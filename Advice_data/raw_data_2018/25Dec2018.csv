0,"I’m 23 years old, 5’7” 145lbs, My boss(braxton) is 24 years old 6’4” 250lbs. He and I have been friends about 6 years ever since he started dating(and eventually married) my cousin. He is practically family and he was the one that got me the job. We work for an AV company in a warehouse that sends out rental equipment for shows and events. When slow season hits, we get bored. We talk shit, we play pranks on each other, we have tape ball wars. About 10 days ago, things got serious on the warfront. We were launching tape balls from across the warehouse.  My boss sneaks out from behind a corner and grabs me. As I struggle to get out of the hold, I end up pushing Braxton and I into a set of equipment cases, he pushes back, sending me head first into a case. He was immediately apologetic and worried about me. I laid on the ground for a minute until the head warehouse manager( Tyler) demanded I get up before anyone sees. I was shaken up, but I figured it was just temporary, so we went to lunch.

After lunch, I start to feel woozy. I ask Braxton if I can go home but he tells me I need to stay because he’s leaving early with a sinus headache, I suck it up and finish the day, clearly dazed. I go home and rest.

The next day, I wake up an hour late because I forgot to set an alarm to texts from Tyler wondering where I’m at. I show up late and I’m now very unwell. The lights and noise are far too much. I tell them I’m leaving.Braxton understands and is apologetic, Tyler seems annoyed. 

I call in sick the next day, and then have my weekend. I go back into work 4 days later and I’m still not right. I find out that Braxton and Tyler told everyone I had a stomach bug and that’s why I missed time. I’m instructed by Tyler to keep my mouth shut about the concussion to avoid Braxton getting in trouble. I’ve worked every day since in various degrees of coherence.

Now here I am. Christmas Eve, 11 days since the incident, extremely depressed and missing out on family dinner due to my symptoms. I’m going to have to see a specialist here shortly if things don’t get better soon. 

What I’m wondering is this: What am I supposed to do now? Braxton is family to me, he’s had my back plenty of times in the past. I don’t believe he meant to give me a concussion, but to throw me into an equipment case with enough force to give me a brain injury is definitely reckless and potentially malicious. I’m not sure if I can respect his authority as my superior going forward in the workplace. If I actually file a report, he could potentially lose his job causing Tyler and the rest of my coworkers to no longer respect me as well as some members of our family as well. I’ve only been working for the company about 4-5 months. I’m afraid I don’t have much job stability if I decide I need more time to recover. I’m not sure if I can continue working at this warehouse, and I’m unsure if I’ve been valuable enough that I could get transferred to another state. I could get another job, but this has been the best job with the most opportunity for advancement I have had in my life. Sorry if this didn’t make sense or wasn’t cohesive. My concussed brain is having a hard time wrapping my head around the situation. Any advice is appreciated",25Dec2018,1
1,"Hey guys! Don't know if I should be asking this here or somewhere else as I'm new to Reddit, but here we go: since I'm a little girl (I'm 23) my parents have always told me that it's not ok to cry. I cry a lot, I'm a very empathetic person, and I can cry with any movie/tv as long as it has a touching scene (I've cried to Modern Family, the little mermaid, the pacifier... just so you get an idea of how quickly I cry). Whenever I talk about something that is slightly serious, or that makes me anxious, or that is just plain sad, I'll cry. My parents never ever let me cry in front of them (my mom is 49, my dad is 56, and they're divorced), they always scream or get pissed whenever I start crying, but I really can't help it. Crying is how I express myself, I don't do it on purpose, it's just an automatic reaction. I've noticed that many of my friend's parents have a similar attitude towards crying/talking about feelings. Why is this so, and how can I understand them better? Or how can I make them realise that crying is just a bodily reaction and I have no control over it? ",25Dec2018,1
3,"I will give you an example. So i was debating with someone about a teacher. When i am alone and not debating with anyone i have a opinon. When someone has the same opinion as me and goes on a rant about that teacher I say something to prove them wrong even though i agree with them. I feel like a huge hypocrite. In the last few weeks i tried to stop it but all the time I have the feeling i need to say something different, the difference is I shut up and say yes now. Is there anything i can do? I feel like a huge cunt. ",25Dec2018,1

5,"I've kept some of my stuff in bins and plastic bags (clothes, books, shoes etc), in an outside shed for awhile. The weather has been very warm with no snow. I want to move this stuff via moving truck into a garage  but am afraid of bringing rats or rodents or bugs into the moving truck and then into the garage. One time I took a bag out of the shed and left it in my car overnight. I came back in the morning and there was rodent feces all over the floor and the cabin air filter had been chewed through. It seems more likely that the rodent had been in the bag and got out then came in from the outside and then went back out. So How can I prevent that from happening again and getting any rodents out of the bags before putting it on the moving truck and in the garage? Thanks ",25Dec2018,1
6,"&lt;This is probably gonna end up being really long so sorry in advance&gt;  

Honestly I’m just so sick of this now. Sick of her. I’m a grown damn woman now and almost 20, she’s a few months younger than me. I’m just really questioning this friendship lately. 

Nothing huge has happened either, not like a big fight/ argument or anything like that. There’s just been a culmination of things that are really starting to grate on me, and with Christmas being one of those times where you reflect on life etc it’s really got me thinking. Am I overreacting or is this friendship just really not worth it anymore? That’s what I’m trying to work through in my head I suppose. 

She makes me feel really crappy, like when we do message each other, part way through a conversation she just doesn’t respond. This happens regularly. I’ve scrolled through my messages with her and it’s practically all the time. There’s only about 1 time where she’s actually said she’s going. Every other time it’s just the conversation stops dead, no sorry I’ve got to go. Or a goodbye or / gnight. Nothing. The worst part is that she doesn’t even message a bit later on to explain, like maybe she got distracted or  whatever, fell asleep but she never gives me a message a bit later on to say that. It can literally go weeks with either one of us saying anything. I’ve told her how this makes me feel as well, when she does this and told her I don’t mind if she even texts me the next day instead to explain her disappearance... Her being like this is just really upsetting and makes me feel so unimportant. It makes me wonder why I bother. 

Another thing that has bothered me is how she was in the summer time. I never said anything at the time to her but now I wished I had reacted. To give some context, my boyfriend of the time was meant to be coming over to this bbq we were having and things between me and him clearly weren’t right and the relationship was clearly going up in flames. I was upset about this situation, we (me, her and my family) were talking about the whole thing. And then she gets her phone out and starts basically shoving it in my face and scrolling like “oh this is how a boyfriend is meant to be!” Really being very insensitive and rude rubbing it in, this was the first I was hearing of her new boyfriend that she’d been with for 3 weeks. We are meant to be best friends why is this the first time I’m hearing of this? Surely she would’ve told me sooner if she actually valued our friendship. There was no hint of a guy love interest at all. The timing was so bad, I wanted to be happy for her but she was just so so insensitive. I didn’t react to that either, now I wish I had told her just how insensitive she was being. To top it all off, I was told by a family member (that is trustworthy) something she had said behind my back. Another family member had said a horrible comment in reference to me being chronically ill “oh she doesn’t help herself” and my friend agreed and didn’t even come to my defence. I am mad with that family member but this isn’t about them, it’s about her. My so called friend. How could she betray me like that?! 

Maybe if this is how she acts and what she thinks of me I shouldn’t be friends with her anymore. I always feel like maybe it’s me though, that maybe I’m overreacting or what have you. I’ve been friends with this person ages, even call each other besties and best friends. I just feel so alone, if I don’t have her then who is my friend. No one really. Do I stay quiet, ditch her as a friend and confront her, or do I try and talk with her again and hope she takes it on board this time... who knows. I’m at a real loose end with this one, I don’t know what to do or how to act towards her right now. I’m just so mad and upset especially as it’s happened again recently,  always disappears mid conversation.

8," 

I work in retail pharmacy. I was trying to transfer out of my current district to a one closer to me. I contacted other DL (Holly) and she said she'd reach our to mine for feedback. I knew the chances of my DM (Emily) approving it we're slim since new to the company but I figured I'd try anyways

After ignoring Holly's email for 2 days, Emily finally contacted her and they discussed me. A few days later Holly informed me she would not be taking me on.

When I asked Holly why and what information Emily provided she stated ""Emily had nothing positive or negative to say about you and really gave no feedback."" I was very taken aback as I've received nothing but glowing appraise from Emily's assistant, co-workers, store mangaers. Many going as far to say I'm the best floating pharmacist in the district.

I'm trying to decide now what's the best course of action I'm thinking about lodging a complaint with the regional manager about this because I cannot believe Emily wouldn't highlight my performance. She's known to ignore all communication from pharmacist (which she's done to me several times) so I'd rather not even bother talking to her about it

I don't want to rustle any feathers since I want to transfer out of this district. But I can't take the chance of her screwing up my next opportunity.. what to do?",25Dec2018,1

12,"Right so, a while ago (some time last year) I expressed my love for lollipops on my instagram story and was like ""Who wants to get me a lollipop"" but I never expected to get an answer. So this girl in my grade replied asking what flavours and I was like oh shit awesome so I told her and the next day she came up to me and gave me 2 lollipops. Before that day I had never really talked to her before and it was really sweet. 

So every now and again since then she's been bringing me lollipops at school and I never know how to thank her because it's so sweet, and she just send me a picture of something in wrapping paper for Christmas and it's obviously some sort of lollipop thing. We've talked a few times but never for long because I never know what to say. She's very quiet during school and never speaks but I know she's actually really outgoing and can be wild. 

I don't want it to be like I'm just using her for lollipops and would like to make the effort to become her friend, can anyone give advice for things to talk about or responses for when she gives me a lollipop?

13,"  It is 22 39 where I live (Brazil) and my family and some friends of my mother are here today for Christmas. I'm a really quiet and shy guy, and my mother knows it, of course. So I was inmy room playing Red Dead Redemption 2, which is a really nice game, totally recommend, btw, and I heard my mother call me, so I go to the living room. I give everyone a simple hi wave, as I said I am really shy (not on reddit lmao, but personally), and there were a lot of people there. My mother instantly got mad and said out loud so everyone could hear - “ I'm sorry everyone, he is not taking his meds anymore, but I already have an appointment with his psychiatrist next week “.

&amp;#x200B;

  Ok, so I'm an 18 year old boy, and I have depression for over 4 years right now, but only started taking antidepressants 3 months ago (I'm on Zoloft 100 mg), but I finished my pills 3 days ago, and I thought I had another pack, so I didn't have an appointment with my psychiatrist (you can only buy Zoloft with a monthly medical authorization, at least right here). Well, now I'm off my meds for 3 days and I can't find anyone to go and get what Ineed to buy it (Christmas eve and stuff + my psychiatrist went on vacation EXACTLY on the day I run out of meds). 

&amp;#x200B;

  I'm already not that emotionally ok because of the lack of medication, and this just destroyed me. I felt just so embarrassed, exposed and sad, do you know that feeling of something in your throat? Now I'm in my bedroom, cause when I got out everyone was talking about how everything will be ok and my aunt said that antidepressants are not the way to go.

I have never been good with this type of shit but I know that's just gonna sound like an excuse so I won't bother. . I was kinda confused on some projects but I didn't know how bad it would get. During that first quarter we were assigned this one project that I just... didn't know what to do.

I really wanted to ask for help but you can probably tell that I'm the type of person who is really, really hard at asking. I just... didn't do anything. At all. And I continued this till' today. I regret not asking but I really didn't know what to say honestly. My teacher really didn't make me feel comfortable about talking to him when he blatantly says that I'm not doing anything once in a blue moon to everyone around me. No, I don't know anyone in that class. All juniors and seniors. I hated every time he would embarrass me, but I 'suppose' it was justified or something. I don't know.

My counselor (probably new) never told me I was going to be in it at all when we selected our classes the last year. I assume she put it in since I needed an art credit, which is fair... but I really didn't want to be in this class. She kept enforcing that I HAD to take THIS SPECIFIC class. I should have pressed her or something as to why I couldn't just take something else, but she was really just unhelpful to me and I had to oblige since the counselor knows all apparently. I  emailed her (was way too afraid to ask in person) after but she only got to me 3 weeks later and of course told me it was too late to change.

I realized this last week, I have always been competitive and always have aimed for the best while my parents are very laid back. And I would have a small mental breakdown whenever I compare myself to my more talented or smarter peers.
For example: 
I consider art as my most serious and most skilled hobby. I would be awfully jealous of my classmates who are better at it than me. But I get inspired by good art posted by strangers. I would also feel terrible when someone who is less skilled than me gain more success than me, even if it’s a friend. 

I am also upset with the fact I’ll never be the best at something, even though I recognize it is an unrealistic thing to expect, I still can’t help feeling these negative feelings. 

It makes me think how if I want to pursue art as a career in the future, all my other peers who choose career paths like doctors or lawyers would be richer and more successful than me. How am I supposed to handle that in the future if I struggle with these minor things in the present.

tl;dr: I am very jealous when my peers are more successful than me. I worry about how this would affect me in the future.

So I’ve been putting it off and delaying it any way I can and that’s only caused a lot of frustration between the two of us to the point where we hardly even talk anymore. He wants me to draw this comic and I keep telling him I’m not good enough and that I can’t give quality work and he won’t listen.

I thought he was lying about it to get me to draw because he didn’t include me in the talks, and he’s kinda known to be a liar to get what he wants. He pulled a lot of strings to set it all up without telling me, and it’s basically cost us our friendship. I still try to text him regularly to check on him but he only ever wants to know if I’ve made progress on the comic. I haven’t heard from him in about 5 months now.

She's made attempts to reason with me so she could see the girls but I caught her shooting up in the house and since then I wouldn't budge about her being sober before she could be around the kids. 

Since then I started seeing a new girl and recently decided to make her my girlfriend. She's super cool, successful, strong ambitious.. every thing a lucky man could want. Only real bad thing so far is she want a bunch of kids and I already have the number I'm comfortable with..

The hang up is.. when I got married to her I took my vows very serious. Yea we both made serious mistakes against eachother.. but overall when things are good they're great. And the sex life is the best Ive ever had. When we've been separated I try and find her in other women.. but eventually I get over that. 

I want to see things work out with us. For us and for the kids but I don't see that happening until she addresses some of the mental dysfunction she admits to having.

38,"I'm 16 male. Honestly I feel like I can't even go outside without hearing them. They're extremely loud, always mad at me and act like everything is my fault, my mother is the worst about this, even if she does something wrong, it's still somehow my fault. She won't admit to ANYTHING and if she does its some sort of ""well you can't blame me we're all humans"". They constantly have the loudest sex possible and it's starting to echo through my head. Even when they're not having sex I can hear moans and grunts and it's starting to stress my sanity. One time my mother yelled ""RAPPE!! HELP ME [my name] HELP ME [my name] and I know I'm a huge pussy but I just sat there crying. I didn't know if I should go out there and help her but it turns out nothing even happened. They said they were ""joking"" I think that's the day I started hearing screams. It's constant and I've thought about suicide and all these other things. I play music so I don't have to hear my mother screaming but even then I have to unplug my ear buds because I can still hear it. They've never beat me, but it's like every moment I feel like I can't sleep or I can't let my guard down because something tells me they're just gonna try something one day. I don't know the difference between fake and real anymore, I keep remember things happening but they always deny it. I know, I'm dramatic but I'm at a loss and this is the only way I can explain the depth. What should I do? Therapy? Am I beyond the point of no return? Should I run away?",25Dec2018,1
39,"First of all would like to say merry christmas eve. Dont want to spoil the most important day of the year but this is the fair truth that needs change. Im 23 yo M and my brother 18 yo M have been noticing this for a ling time. Our parents arent divorced but seperated and thdyve been living seperately for 5 years now. My dad would dribk occasianally when they first split. Like a few beers once a week. Now for some reason, in the past 2 months, its almost been a daily thing where he might have 1 or 2 days in a rare time that hed not drink. I can understand he is going through a lot rn. Were moving, he has stress from work and also he has to pay for/ take care of some of my moms expenses since theyre still together. And they do fight occasionally but in the past 3-4 weeks shes been doing very good and everything is supposed to be under controo, even he notices it but decides to get sloppy every night. Its just upsetting, i know hes an alcoholic and around 54 years old. Would introduce him to weed, because i smoke pretty regularly and he doesnt know it but we live in an illegal state. What can be done about this addiction? I heard kava kava is a good substitute to help curb alcoholism. I dont want to get him any suggestions like AA or otherwise, i know hes aware hes addicted but doesnt want to do anything about it. Hes also putting on weight and doesnt seem to want to exercise or anything",25Dec2018,1
40,"Hey so I’ve known this boyfriend of hers for a while and I’m at the point where I feel the need that she deserves to know what he’s doing behind her back. I met this guy in Portland and he was in a long distance relationship with her and he would download tinder and attempt to hook up with other ladies or hit the club and try to get laid. I’m a girl myself and he’s begged me so many times to have sex with him and I said no because he has a girlfriend!!!!! Do you not love her? I asked. He literally said, “Her family is rich so that’s the only reason why I wanna marry her.”  A year later we reunited in Japan and he bragged how he got a prostitute to come over to his place. I was intoxicated so I was laying down on the sofa at a karaoke room and he literally started kissing my lips when I was fucking barely conscious!!! He used his tongue and I just sealed my lips so he couldn’t do anything. He then even asked me if I wanted to go to a hotel. As you can tell, this dude does NOT give a fuck about his girlfriend and it angers me that I cut him off. Doesn’t she deserve to know this? Everyone seems to know what he’s doing behind is back but no one tells her 😭

42,"Firstly, some context.

My mother divorced my father because he had a pornography problem and she found large books of his containing images of naked children and adolescents. The books were seemingly produced in a foreign country. She took them to her therapist and her therapist said they probably did not constitute child pornography, because the images were not necessarily sexual or suggestive. 

My father then gets remarried to a very trashy and questionable woman with three children, one of whom is a preadolescent girl. I was a child at the time (joint custody), but I observed weird and inappropriate behavior from my father towards the girl. Excessive touching, long baths with him scrubbing her like a car, long bed time stories, tickling, 'accidental' nudity, things of that nature. After reading up lately, this is textbook pedophile grooming behavior. I told these things to my mother and she contacted child protective services. After an investigation, they determined that he was ""grooming"" his step daughter, and they told my father's wife about the grooming. My father obviously denied this to my brothers and I, and simply said my mother was trying to smear him out of spite. My fathers wife was incredulous, but she was something of a psycho narcissist in her own right. My step mother and father divorced about a year later because she had an affair (according to my dad). 

My brothers were conflicted about my mother reporting him and ultimately they thought she was wrong for doing so. I always thought it was the right move. My mother would be proved right later.

Fast forward to present. My brother produces a daughter with his wife. My niece is about 2 years old now. My father was very excited about her being a girl and has been very intentional about seeing her lately. He takes pictures of her and kissed her on the mouth at one point. I was around when he somewhat assertively told my brother that he wants to arrange time for him to babysit my niece and for her to spend the night at his house. He said something along the lines of, ""I just want to arrange regular times to come over and interact with my granddaughter. You guys don't have to talk to me or host me. I just want to spend time with her."" Just a grandfather wanting a relationship with his granddaughter right?

He said he wants to get her involved in ballet lessons. He's normally very private and standoffish with his family, so this enthusiasm seemed weird to me. He has also never been that interested in his grand sons from my other brother, but they live several hours away. That he might be interested in her for unwholesome reasons was in the back of my mind, but I tried to brush it off. Surely not his toddler granddaughter right?

Then a few days ago a disturbing discovery was made. I was at my brothers house. My dad left his Amazon account logged on at my brothers house and my brothers wife looked at his Amazon search history and then started crying. His history contained a bunch of products of sexy toddler outfits, and also about thirty different products of 4-5 yo girls panties. Not normal toddler outfits, but sexualized outfits and panties. Just 2 weeks worth of browsing, he may have deleted his history. There was also a wish list full of children's panties. He had even ordered a set of children's panties and they had been delivered recently. That in and of itself raises a host of questions. Is he using them as a prop for some sick fantasy? Is he victimizing somebody? How does my niece play into this all? The age range of the ordered panties were a few years older than my niece.

He has also regularly been vacationing in Hawaii by himself, which now seems a bit suspect. Is he hopping over to Thailand or the Philippines for sex tourism? None of us know. 

So the situation is very fucked. Because it looks like my father has been plotting a strategy to groom and molest my niece. He's seemingly gone from friendly grandpa to scheming pedophile. All of his overly interested behavior towards my niece just screams ""child molester seeking to groom"". He is a very accomplished, intelligent, and erudite man, so nobody would suspect him of this at face value, but pedophiles can be cunning and hiding in plain sight. Or are we overreacting? And now it is even clearer that his former behavior with my ex-step sister was predatory grooming, if not full blown molestation (CPS investigation didn't uncover molestation). Obviously unsupervised visits with my niece are out of the question at this point and my sister-in-law is disgusted. My other brother was alerted about this, but he was 2 male children and my father doesn't seem interested in them. But my brothers and I don't know what the next step should be. But do we stay silent? Confront him? Hire a private investigator to see what he's up to abroad and at home? Try to find CP on his laptop?

It's all so fucked. Writing this was somewhat cathartic.

Any advice would be appreciated. Merry Christmas.",25Dec2018,1

46,"Hi all, sorry in advance for any general posting rules as this is my first post on Reddit. So here we go.

My previous friend (let's call them Y) is acting as a liaison for their parents who are renting a room in their single family home. Y advertises the suite, communicates with tenants, and collects rent from them. The money is then transferred to the parents and I assume Y does not keep any of the profits. It has been approximately 2 years since Y has started doing this but the room renting has been going on for at least a decade. By my estimate, Y has accrued approximately $30,000 for the parents since acting as a liaison. I would like to report the parents but I do not have enough information about them. Thus I must put Y's name on the form. The family uses the money to go on multiple trips and most recently renovate their home. This is as much information I have from what Y has told me. But unfortunately the decision to make this report is field both by ethical and personal reasons, hence the dilemma.

As I've said, Y is a previous friend of mine. We are currently classmates in post secondary school and had become friends over the last year. The friendship started typically with chatting while studying and working on assignments together. But this quickly evolved into friendly banter and studying together without other classmates for exam week. Y is an upfront friendly person but very private about personal life. Yet I had become a good enough friend that Y sought out relationship advice for a current partner. We continued to meet at least every week throughout the summer between semesters and we even went on a couple trips together. Unfortunately for the friendship, on our last trip I developed feelings for my now single friend whom I'd helped through a harsh break. I knew it wouldn't work out so I held it inside and did not tell Y. Yet my actions spoke for me and I started getting jealous as it appeared Y and I were drifting apart. One day I was confronted by Y who asked if I had feelings. I told Y the truth as I was incapable of lying. Upon hearing this Y told me what I already knew and wanted to stay friends. Since I had planned to continue being good friends even with my feelings I agreed. What I was met with was the opposite of friendship as Y proceeded to stop initiating conversations, ignore me, and giving one word responses to my questions. This pained me initially but I knew this was inevitable. I told myself it would get better an eventually pass. It has been two months since I've told myself that. After asking Y if we could try and work back to the level of friendship we had, Y responded no and that Y would like it if we weren't considered friends anymore. This hurt me a lot as all the times and private peices of ourselves that we had shared now ment nothing to Y. This is the personal motive for me reporting Y.

So that is my dilemma. Now that I'm not friends with Y anymore I don't have to hide the secret told to me. But a driving force for this decision is revenge motivated and may ruin Y's future. What should I do?",25Dec2018,1
47,"I know it was my fault because I am too naive. But I need all advice here. I do not know how to resolve this situation.  


I have used Fiverr to find and order some freelancers here, for ex: order a guest post on a high DA websites to increase my website's ranking. I found a Nigerian writer with username:  ""blythe\_scott"" after I published a request here, told that I need someone to write and publish a well written guest post on high DA, DR websites.   
While we were talking with each other, my Fiverr account was blocked by the supporting team. This writer tried to contact me via Skype and asked me to continue ordering him. Then I decided to pay him $400 for 4 guest post on 4 good websites I picked. I paid via Bitcoin. And after that, I knew that I was wrong very soon. This writer, at first, said he was so sorry because he can't publish  any article on 4 websites I picked and gave me some alternative options to replace. But all the websites he recommended are all low traffic, low DA and alexa rank. Therefore, I can't pick any sites. I asked him to refund my money because we can't agree with each other on any website.   
He refused to refund, ignore my Skype mess. I need to use my friend's Fiverr account to find him. Then he treated me like I begged him, not I paid him.   
He agreed that he would gave me only one guest posts on [thelondoneconomic.com](https://thelondoneconomic.com) at $350 and $50 for writing. I knew this price was to expensive but I was too angry and tired with this conversation then I agreed. But he still lied. Did not send me any update or message. I contacted him many times on both Skype and Fiverr, then he asked me to add more money because my money was too low LOL.   
He is a Nigerian writer, called me ""bitch"" because I asked him to deliver what I paid.   
The problem is $400 is not my money, I work for a company so if he take all my money, I will have to use my own money to refund my company, and $400 is a very large amount of money for me.

49,"A while back I made a post about my mom kissing a married man while we were at the bar. I deleted the post since my siblings use reddit. 

Anyway, things have escalated. 

I found out my stepdad left because he caught my mom cheating on him. One night after I left the bar my stepdad came to pick her up and caught her making out and doing some very sexual things with the same married man outside the bar. He told her he wanted a divorce the next day. 

It makes sense now. My mom lied and said he was cheating on her and my stepdad just wanted out of the marriage ASAP because he didn’t want to deal with her craziness. He also didn’t want to forgive a cheater. 

Since then my mom has a new man every week. She’s bringing random men home and introducing them to my siblings and they’re all creepy perverts. She’s sleeping with my teen sister’s friends and roommates who are barely over 18 themselves (this is just creepy to me even though she’s not doing anything legally wrong). She goes through our Facebook friends lists and adds men to hook up with!

All of us adult siblings feel like our dad should have the kids, not her. 

She is lying and manipulating everyone to think he was the cheater and that he’s this horrible person. She did the same thing to me when I wanted to have a relationship with my biological father. 

On top of the sleeping around she’s constantly drinking and smoking weed. I don’t know what to do anymore, but I feel like if she keeps going further with her new lifestyle my siblings will no longer be safe and they’re too afraid to tell our dad what’s really going on. He just found out she’s never home and is leaving the kids with my 14 year old brother all the time.

50,"Hey guys I don't know if this is allowed but I posted this on r/relationship_advice and didn't get much of a response so I'm re-posting this here

 I just wanted to start this off by saying I'm generally a trusting person and sometimes it's a blessing and a curse. From pretty much the time I became sexually active I always had a habit of getting too attached to girls that I was seeing. (just a note, I'm not the type of person to do this with every single girl that shows me any kind of attention or sympathy, I realize the connotation of what I said). But many times I would kinda become active with some girl and I would start to grow some feelings only to find out she was only looking for sex or just realized she wasn't that into me. I know that these girls that I see don't owe me anything (relationship or not) and they are free to go as they please, but I can't help feeling hurt by this. Right now I'm seeing this girl and we've been talking for about a month and sleeping together occasionally. Of course, I have started to get some feelings with this girl, and I decided to mention it. She says she might not feel the same way about me, but needs some time to think. I remember one night she mentioned that she has had several friends with benefits situations and she was able to kind of separate her feelings from that. I don't know how to do this and I just don't want to be hurt again. I know people will just say to leave her, but I really do like hanging out with her and it's not going to be easy to just stop talking to her. Also, I know people will just tell me to not participate in hook up culture but being a younger guy it is hard to find yourself in a relationship without it. (Obviously not impossible, but hard). I was having a convo with some friends about hook up culture and basically everyone in the room thought it was weird to not sleep with a girl before dating her and all of the people in the room had hooked up with their partners before actually dating them.

66,"Why can’t assisted suicide be legal for those that are not terminally ill, but suffer from conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc...

I have suffered in silence for years. 
As of late I’ve posted about myself on reddit, but only to find the support I need.

I’ve been suffering from depression since my teenage years. I don’t think medication has ever helped, therapy has never helped me either. 

Most of the time I feel misunderstood or outcast. Other times I just want to be alone so I can suffer with self dignity. It’s been a roller coaster. I’m about to hot rock bottom. 

If assisted suicide was legal for depressed patients- I would do it. I’m tired of suffering from this illness that hacks my brain, and pushes everyone I love away.

70,"We've been together for 3 years and our relationship has been very rocky at times but has also had good parts too. We're doing LDR after being together physically for a year and I work full time and every day after work I spend all night with her then sleep then repeat. I don't see friends or family much and if I do she says I never put her first and always leave her last. She has lately been giving me anxiety and every time I talk to her I feel anxiety. She's probably reading this right now. We had a fallout about christmas because I spent christmas eve morning with her for the whole morning and then had to run and buy some things for family and then went to spend time with family on christmas eve in the evening. She said I don't put her first and that I don't even put energy into her ever and that I put everyone else ahead of her and neglect her. I became furious because I can't even spend Christmas morning/evening with my family without her going off at me in drama. I had planned to spend the entire afternoon with her and for her christmas as well and that still wasn't good enough she just argues and deflects EVERYTHING and is never equal with me on reasoning just condescening. I told her I had talked to people about how she guilt trips me and she said ""who told you that your mommy???"". I became so enraged because that's not how you speak to a partner or even a person. She treats me like dirt and I've been getting sour and resentful in return and being mindless towards her, but she is the reason why I feel so numb and dead inside.

71,"I'm 22 years old. A couple months ago, I dropped out of school and had to move back home with my elderly father (72) who has early signs of Alzheimer's and Dementia. We are currently 'sharing' a car, but he does not want me driving it because I am not insured on his policy. He was in an at-fault accident last year that made his premiums exorbitantly high and adding me would worsen them. He is diabetic, has prostate cancer, and over the past few months has become partially incontinent. Accidents occur at least 3-5 times a week. He has been wheelchair bound for over a year due to a hip injury. He cannot clean up after his accidents, or at least refuses to, leaving trails of feces and items for me to hose off, or have to throw away. He refuses any type of senior care. He has a biological son (I'm adopted) that lives across the street, but will not help him with daily living. 

I've been given the opportunity to move to Vegas and split an apartment with my cousin. I have a job waiting for me, a vehicle, and a support system. 

Staying with my dad and caring for him is going to take significant years off of my life, because taking care of him is a full time job. It's impossible for me to work while worrying and caring for him, also he lives 45 minutes away from the nearest city. 

But leaving him feels like abandonment, and I don't want him to die alone and without care, but he refuses any outside help other than mine.

73,"At the beginning of the semester, I made a new friend. As I started spending more time with him, I realized he was arrogant, lazy, and wanted to leech off of me for online quizzes, tests, and assignments. He would constantly text me asking for my study notes and answers to quizzes. I had to do two group assignments with him, and he barely did any work. It infuriated me when he got an 82% on a group presentation that he barely contributed to.

Outside of class, he's quite insufferable. He constantly talks about himself and badmouths people/things he doesn't like. He talks as if his opinions are facts and fails to realize that many things (i.e. music) are subjective. He's also very clingy. Near the beginning of the term, he asked me to join his band and talked about how he wanted the entire band living together in an apartment next year. Mind you, this was after knowing him for only 3-4 weeks.

I decided I'd had enough. Last week, I texted him telling him what classes I was taking and which sections. He happily signed up for all of them. In reality, I lied about each and every class I took so I wouldn't be in any of his classes. Right now, I'm happy that I don't have any classes with him next semester (I confirmed this).

74,"Hey guys. Thanks in advance for reading. Any thoughts or insight is very appreciated. Don’t really have anyone I feel comfortable discussing this with and I thought I’d come here and see what you guys had to say. I’ll try and keep it as short as possible. Feel free to ask questions for clarification if you’d like. 

Some background: I’m a female in my early twenties. I’ve always considered myself a confident person, and my friends often tell me I come off very confident and secure. I take pride in my appearance. I’m in great shape, care about my style/clothes, and generally take care of myself. Additionally, I love working on myself mentally/intellectually. I love reading, I follow politics, and have hobbies I enjoy. I am in school, I work, I go out, and I have friends and family I love. I’ve been told I am a decently attractive woman, and have received a fare share of male attention (Let me just say I’m in no way trying to brag about guys DMing me or old men catcalling me). However, I’ve always been a serial single person. I’ve never been in a relationship, and have pretty much rejected all attempts men have made. I’ve always been happy being single. 

Recently: As of lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m warming up the idea of being with someone. Ive been more friendly and open to men, and exploring the dating world. A couple nights ago, I attended a work party and a handsome, single coworker my age, was also there. I tried to show my interest in him, knowing I shouldn’t wait for him to make the first movie if I want something to happen. He politely maneuvered himself out of the situation, and preoccupied himself flirting with our other, single coworker the rest of the night. Im not an especially emotional person, I know that you won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. It stung a little when it happened but what can you do? I usually roll with the punches in life. 

For some reason though, I caught myself thinking about it constantly in the days to come. I understand it’s normal for rejection to feel shitty, and I realized this was the first time I had actually actively been rejected by a man (I know, a minuscule, insignificant problem to have in life, but I guess it’s pertinent to my point). However, this wasn’t just the normal ‘shitty’ feeling, I felt fundamentally uneasy. I decided I needed to sit down and think about my feelings introspectively. 

What I found: After, MUCH thought, I found something unsettling. My first rejection showed me how fragile my confidence was. Why was one man’s opinion able to make me question everything about myself? The answer: because my confidence has been built entirely on the approval and attention of others. I started to see a pattern in my behaviour that has manifested itself since my early teens. I reject men, pretending to not give them the time of day, when in reality I rely on them almost completely as a source of confidence. On my commute to work, I prey off the male gaze as if it was my source of livelihood. Men staring at me, complimenting me, talking to me, etc has always confirmed for me in my head: “ok I look good”. It makes me feel worthy. But when you take that all away, and think “men would fuck a can of warm beans”, all that attention no longer holds any value and suddenly I’m unsure of how attractive/worthy I really am. Is every one lying to me when they say I’m funny/attractive/smart??

My question: How in the fresh hell do I build GENUINE confidence in myself. I mean that unconditional and unwavering stability and security. I feel like there’s nothing more I can do to convince myself I’m as great of a woman as I previously thought. If your answer if self-acceptance, I can’t really wrap my head around just “loving myself” right now. 

If you made it this far, thank you, and I need all the help I can get. Tell me your thoughts or experiences. Happy holidays :)

75,"I know the title is strange but it’s literally what I am wondering. 

I think I always had that side to things but never really looked that much into it. I just have one step back because I can’t accept it.

What makes me think I am, is how I’d like to be homosexual. Being a straight guy sucks and I’d like to feel desired or powerful, I’d like to order drinks without being made fun of or get into clothing and fashion. Also being the little spoon or teasing someone with all the ways a girl can. Just to think of someone making the first move makes me feel great since I am a bit shy. It looks like so much freedom, I have my side that wants it for me.

I think I am up for everything but the relationship part. I wish I had a child of my own or that my parents would be proud I followed their conservative mindset. I also don’t really see myself in a homosexual relationship, it just feels strange to imagine me living with another male and so on.

I do currently have a LDR girlfriend but some things I want are left unattended for, maybe for the distance, I don’t know.

I feel like there is this side to me as there is to everyone but mine is just bigger. And given the opportunity I don’t know if I should take it or not. Should I?",25Dec2018,1
76,"I definitely have a mental disorder.  I know what one it is and I do actually have it.   That's not really the issue.

I feel like I'd be so much better if I had it treated.  I am really interested in the perspective of having it taken care of.  I'm a 21 yo male currently at home for the break from my last year of college so I thought while I'm home I should maybe get it looked into.  

I was looking online and it says I should see my general practitioner and get recommended to a psychiatrist first.   This is where the issue comes in and why I feel trapped.  

I just don't trust this the GP.  It's hard to explain.  Not trusting might be a bad way of saying it.  Quick backstory: I got put onto this guy because he is both of my parent's doctor.  I've seen him maybe 4 times in the last few years for just random physical issues.  

He's not a bad dude or anything.  He's just not someone I want to tell any of these things to.  He feels really old school.  Tough love kinda guy would be a way I would describe to him.  If I was younger he might call me sport.

It would feel weird telling him about something mentally wrong with me.  Like if it can't be physically seen I don't know if he'll take me seriously.  The most likely outcome in my head right now is him cracking a smile and telling me to drink more water.  

I also don't think I have the capability inside of me to say a mental issue to this man.  

I also don't think I can say any of this as a precursor to my dad or my mother.  I would feel so freaking good opening up about this to my mother but she tells my dad literally everything so I cannot do that.  Also I don't have a car at the moment so my parents are my ride.  

I think I feel comfortable at the idea of going straight to a psychiatrist and skipping the family doctor.  And I think I'm comfortable with the idea of my parents knowing I want to see a psychiatrist.  And I also think they'd be okay with me not explaining details if I press that I don't want to explain details.  

It's really the details that get me.  I don't want them to know the symptoms.  

All I'm really asking is that is it a possibility to just skip the family doctor?  Everywhere I see that I have to talk to a GP first.  I'm stomaching what I can already but I cannot do that.  If I have to see this GP first then I'm just going to do what I've been doing the last couple years and just sit with my problems and deal with them the way I have been.  I can't do it. ",25Dec2018,1

How I can’t learn the simple things (like remembering how cribbage goes after he just taught me it all), and how he thinks I get frustrated when I try to learn something. He even said I might be autistic. This was really painful but it was something I always wondered about myself as well... I always felt abnormally stupid. Like I can’t handle simple instructions, or I just do things really stupidly. People I used to work with would say stuff like “are you sure you aren’t blonde?”...so I know he was clearly stating the truth while arguing with me :( I even think we may be breaking up, and this has been so hard.

What I really want to do is study acting, and theres a certificate/bachelors that's at a school nearby and would be the beginning of my dream. 

If I study I need to have a part time job, but I wouldnt even know where to look. I'm unqualified for pretty much everything and the place I'm at now doesn't offer part time work. I wholeheartedly believe that I can not continue the job I have, I'm physically unfit for the job and it's taking its toll. That said, it's even harder to find a new full time job when I'm not qualified. The only reason I got the job I have is that my sister and my mum work there already and put a word in for me.

I could study without a job, but my student loan is already at 30k because the weekly money I was given was added to the loan, so I'd rather not do it that way because itd make the loan around 50k within a year. And realistically speaking I may never be able to pay that off.

84,"I have a friend. We're not close, but we sit together at lunch and have known each other for awhile. He's been making suicide jokes for awhile now but last week they seemed more serious and concerning, not like the typical ""i'm so stressed out I wanna die haha kill me now"" jokes people make to cope with the pressure of school (which is an entirely different issue tbh) but like a ""seriously, the world would be better without me, i wanna take a bath with a toaster"" kind of comment.   

I haven't seen him since then. Like I said, we're not close and only see each other at lunch. This happened on Wednesday, and I wasn't there at lunch on Thursday or Friday because I had to work on an important group project for a class. We don't even have each other's phone numbers so I've had no way of contacting him. So I have no idea what's happened since then or how he's doing.

What I did do, was go talk to the counselor at school. I don't like getting involved in other people's shit, and I hope I wasn't overreacting to this, but when I went home on Wednesday night and thought about it, I realized I couldn't just ignore it. So I told the counselor what was going on and they thanked me for saying something and said they'd talk to him. I know they take this shit seriously, so I don't doubt they got involved. But the issue is, although they said they'd keep me anonymous, it wouldn't be hard for my friend to guess that I was the one who told them. And if he does figure it out, I don't know how he'll react. I don't want him to be upset with me, though I feel that, if he is angry with me, I still know I did the right thing. 

But I guess, what do I say to him, when I see him again? Do I ask how he's doing? Do I deny it was me? If he says he knows it was me, how do I respond? What if he is angry?

So, up until lately i’ve been pretty strictly gay. I’m 23, and all my sexual experiences have been with guys, but I’ve never been in a relationship before. The past 6 months though, I’ve found myself more and more attracted to ladies and am now seriously considering pursing romantic/sexual relationships with them, but I have a fear!

I fear that i’m...too feminine, for girls? I’m not the flaming queen that’s often portrayed on TV, and nothing’s wrong with that, but it’s not me. I don’t present as very femme, but sometimes my gestures are girly, and the way that I talk isn’t the most masculine thing in the world. Also, I’m not into too many traditional “masculine” interests. I’m worried that will make me essentially invalid as a partner to women, and am not sure how to do it. Should i try to be more masculine (Even the very thought of attempting to be something i’m not is difficult to bear)? Should I just not try? I’ve given it a lot of thought and I really want to at least try, but maybe I shouldn’t? 

I’m not the most confident man in the world, so how do I even go about asking a girl out? I feel like I want to preempt any possible scenario with a “I know I’m not what you probably want, BUT-“ just to let them know what they’re getting into. I feel like there’s all these ideas that I have to be a masculine, agressive, hyper-confident, over protective, musclebro to be worth it- but I’m wondering if I can just be, like, an actual person, doing life with another person.

I started off the weekend thinking whatever, I'm choosing to avoid the smoke and they will come inside when they are done.

93,"Hello all,

My partner and I are considering moving. We would like any and all advice.  We have been together three years now and both are transplants to VT. He has lives there 8 years and I have lived there 6.  He is 26 and I am 23. We think we might want to move to try somewhere else out we are open to moving anywhere in the US. (If citizenship weren’t an issue we would consider outside the US quebec city is our favorite city).

We love thing about our small city Burlington VT. But it only has about 40k people and feels very small. We are also an interacial couple and we don’t feel uncomfortable but would like more diversity.  We have had friends start to leave the area so we don’t feel super attached to the area like we used to. Due to my partners job we feel pretty confident we can move anywhere. He works remotely in software making 72k a year. I work in HR and currently have a good job but it doesn’t light my world on fire right now and would be open to any HR type role even if its a step back. I have worked in HR for 4 years and have a masters degree in HR so hopefully not stupidly optimistically feel I could find another HR job.  Job wise I don’t feel restricted about where we can move. 

We considered moving to be closer to family but we don’t love where any of them live. They live mainly in Boston and NYC but we also have family in florida and michigan. I know I have given you all a lot to think about but a few more things to consider are we were both born and raised in the northeast and have never left. I dislike winters and he dislikes brutal heat and muggyness. We have a pitbull that is our life so anywhere with breedspecific regulations is a no. We are both very liberal and not religious. We have pretty high bills due to my student loans so somewhere like SF isnt really an option. Right now we pay $1200 utilties not included for a 2bedroom (its falling apart, attic and has no washer dryer so its a good price for the area) and feel comfortable with that.

We like walkability. Its okay if we have to uber for nightlife like concerts and comedy shows but we want to be able to have a neighborhood bar/restauarant in walking distance. We like living somewhere that a fences in yard isnt unheard of. We like craft beer and going to dog parks.

95,"Idk what advice I’m looking for. I broke up with her due to distance, and this was 2 and a half months ago. I’ve been having a breakdown tonight and I feel like it’s especially selfish to reach out on Christmas Eve. Idk I just want to fucking yell about how much of an idiot I am, and how I wish I was better. Sorry 



Hey Maddie, 

I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for this. It’s fucking Christmas Eve, and I’m probably committing a cardinal sin by putting this shit on you rn. I don’t have an excuse except that I can’t hold back any more. I’m not going to lie, those text hurt. A lot. More than they should’ve. I had been doing good- suppressing my emotions and lying to myself. Then I got that text and everything just boiled over. Fuck... fuck...

Yes. The answer is yes to the question of if we are (I guess were now) worth it. I’m sorry that it took me this fucking long to answer that question. I was an idiot for not realizing it. Regardless of how I feel, we were worth it. I was just too much of an idiot not to realize. 

I don’t know what this text is. What I want. However, it doesn’t really matter what I want. You moved on- and that’s good. I guess this is me coming clean. Being honest? Probably more like selfish. And I’m sorry for that. I’m sorry for all this. 

Ash told me about how your in a relationship- that’s good to hear. I’m talking to someone too. Although I like her, I keep wanting to say “A1 Saucy Sauce” or “boosha” or “I’m going to kiss you on the lips sooo hard.” I want to be her egg. Do you feel the same? 

This isn’t okay- this text. I’m sorry that I haven’t left or that I haven’t finished moving on- especially since I broke up with you. I’ve been trying so hard to walk away. To move on. I wish I was better. I wish I had been better. 

I won’t pester you again. I’m never going to ask for that stuff back. I guess this is my final goodbye. 
I hope you have a great Christmas, and that everything works out for you. Tell Jack that he’s a boosha.
I’m sorry for everything.

Goodbye Maddie

Thank you for reading. Sorry for that

SO’s Father is in his mid-70’s, not great with technology and lonely (especially in the winter months). We haven’t investigated fully but he’s constantly messaging one particular person without ever mentioning who it is. This is only weird because he always talks to us about his friends - I know a lot of details about people i’ve never met.

We found a large amount of iTunes gift cards with the numbers scratched off. I’m talking at least 100 of them, most of them with receipts, so he purchased them himself.

100,"We started dating my senior year of high school and now I go to a local university. He’s currently a junior. I see him about 2 times a week usually and things are great in person, we have dinner with his family, watch some tv, do /things/.... that aspect is good. 

However over text things are incredibly dry. I’m also on vacation right now, I’ve been gone for about a week and a half, so I wanna text him a bit. There was one night that we texted a lot about the season finale of a TV show we both watch, that was fine, but other than that he just gives one word answers when I text him. Maybe I’m overthinking this too much though. Especially because in person everything is more than fine. 

But to give an example, I asked him if he wanted to FaceTime yesterday at around noon, and he said no. Fair enough, it’s the holidays, I’ll give you some space. Fast forward 36 hours later and he hasn’t sent me one message. So I asked him how his holiday party was, he says “ok” and I try talking him to him a little more but just get one word answers. This made me a little upset. But I think I’m overthinking it. But maybe not. I keep telling myself “hey it’s the holidays, it’s also late. He’s probably tired.” But texts are about as dry as this back when I’m home too. But again, in person things are great. Maybe he’s just not a big fan of texting? I’ve been with him for over a year. In the beginning of our relationship he was a kinda consistent texter. But maybe now that the “honeymoon” phase wore off he’s back to his normal dry texting habits that he’s always had before I met him. 

I also kinda feel that he’s a little immature because of the age gap and it could be that too. Which I wouldn’t blame him for, teenage boys are not good at reading emotions. Especially over text when it’s already hard enough to read emotions.

101,"My husband and I live out in the country. Our next door neighbor is a Grade A dickbag. Last winter he shot my daughter’s 7-month-old standard poodle puppy in the face at point-blank range with rat-shot, blinding her. Since that horrific day I have told my husband and children “no more dogs until we have a fence.” This past summer (a few months after the shooting incident) “someone” poisoned our 3 outside dogs, leaving us with only my tiny indoor lap dog. 

My husband has expressed a number of times a desire to get another dog, and every single time I tell him to build us a fence first. (He builds fences for pay for other people.)

He also was laid off from his job at the beginning of October (the company shut down, so not his fault at all). So this Christmas, money has been *really* tight. 

This morning as I was stepping into the shower he came and told me he was going to town to get coffee because we were out. He came home with a 6-wk-old puppy. He told our daughter that he knew I “would be pissy about it and would rather ask forgiveness than permission.” So he just decided to go get the dog without talking to me about it, and deal with the consequences later. 

We didn’t have the money to spare, but he spent it anyway. We don’t have the money for fencing — and he won’t put one up anyhow. 

To make matters even worse, he bought the puppy from the son of some very old friends of ours. The son lives next door to the parents. He went and visited old friends this morning without me and lied about where he was going. I’m very hurt that I wasn’t even given an opportunity to see these friends of ours, and wondering what he must have told them about where I was that I didn’t come with him to visit at the holiday. 

He then made a big production of telling our whole family how this puppy is out of the same bloodlines as his first dog of this breed that he ever owned. I caught him in a lie about that, so he changed his story just enough to avoid the provable part. 

I don’t have any idea how to approach or handle this situation. This is not an inside dog breed. I am not a big dog person.

102,"I know this post is going to make me sound completely pathetic but oh well. I am cripplingly lonely, starved of physical affection and depressed. Prior to college I had never been on a date, been kissed, held hands with someone, nothing. Recently a guy I know approached me and made some advances that I took advantage of despite my better judgement because I am honestly very desperate. He made it clear that he absolutely did not have feelings for me but still ended up being a bunch of my sexual firsts. Even though I know he doesn't like me at all, the physical affection is really comforting and makes me feel slightly less lonely. I asked him to take my virginity and he agreed, but now I'm having doubts. I asked if he still wanted to go through with this, and told me that meaningless sex doesn't really appeal to him but he'll still do it. I don't know why, but him calling it meaningless sex made me feel really undesirable. Before it felt nice to be actively pursued but now it seems like he's just doing this simply because he can. I know that ideally I want to lose it to someone who at least WANTS to have sex with me, but I feel like if I don't do this now I will never get another opportunity. I'm also worried that if I stop having the physical affection from him to rely on as a comfort I'm going to go to a very dark place again. I don't think I can survive going back to being alone and completely without affection because I'm already very suicidal. I don't know what to do. Please help me.

I also have some really bad anxiety, not in the social sense just that I'm easily overwhelmed and constantly anxious to an extent. Now my mom on the other hand is a huge trigger, shes a nice woman, but she has a short temper and she gets easily angered. We were recently arguing about my personal privacy in college, and I had thought the arguement was through when we left the car. However apparently my dry tone after arguing with her in the car set her off and she went upstairs. I really dont like people knowing my business especially her because she isnt exactly privy to allowing me to do something out of her control (probably because she also has anixety). But while I was apologizing all the questioning I'd been doing and stressing over overwhelmed me and she berated me until I came forward. I really did not want to say anything to her, and if I was going to say anything she would be on the last rung of people to know. Now I was crying and I didnt know how to lie and I really didnt wanna ruin christmas with my mom bitching that everyone is having a horrible time and that nobody respects her by not telling every part of our lives for her to approve of. Now this isnt to say shes not accepting I just did not want her to know and I dont want my dad to know but I guarantee this matter is not going to say silent for long.

108,"I’ve been dating my bf for two years now (we are mid 20s) and he’s been nothing but wonderful. However, I’ve been in an especially foggy mindset the past few months as a lot of adult life is happening. I have depression and anxiety and I don’t want to blame the way I think on this but I also don’t know how to control my thoughts if it is solely because of that. The thoughts about the relationship possibly having issues has been uncontrollable in my mind.

So we are not really romantic which has always been weird to me but ive dealt with it cause that wont make or break a bf for me. We dont say i love you though, and for some reason that bugs me lately cause i know he’s said it to his exes a lot. He also told me a lot lately how these girls hit on him and he rejects them, how one has been messaging him and he says he doesn’t respond with what she wants to hear, still has a girl from tinder on his snapchat that he tells me he calls Babe, and Ive seen searches on his social media searching for exes names, the girl from tinder, etc. It’s been making me real standoffish and unhappy with and towards him because i cant help but feel that he’s either cheating or is wanting to. And me being unhappy towards him makes me further think that if he knows im unhappy with him atm then he’ll no doubt want to find someone else cause he wont want to deal with me. I just am confused and upset. Ive talked to him about it before but he always said he denies the girls, that the girl from tinder is just a friend, and that he wouldnt cheat. 

I come from a history of guys cheating so I know this is probably my anxiety, especially with me seemingly trying to find something wrong after he denies things. I even tried snooping once but found stupid small stuff i got mad about, no real evidence of cheating but suspicious shit. But I cant help but think that it’s a possibly that cheating is happening or could happen. 

He’s always been open with me, always been a nice bf, and knows where I come from but are these openly red flags or am I overthinking? How do I stop these intrusive thoughts and be happy in my relationship without the feeling of something is wrong? What do I do before I go crazy?!",25Dec2018,1

So I am living with my mother and her husband until I can move out when I’m older. My mother is very much a “this is my life, I’ll do what I want” type of person and really doesn’t care how what she does affects others as long as her wants are met.

My mom has always been a chain-smoker, and when we were little she would constantly smoke in the car with us and bring us to the smoking area of bars no matter how much we begged her not to. She only stopped when smoking with kids in the car became illegal here. I’m pretty sure this is the reason I had mild asthma as I child, and probably still do now. (I had an inhaler prescribed when I was younger but I never had to use it)

Back to today - I’m really sensitive to smoke now. If I am around someone who is smoking, I get these massive, mind numbing headaches. It happens with any type of smoke really - wildfires are common in this area and I will be a miserable mess for weeks when they occur.

We moved in the beginning of Fall to a new house and it has a giant fireplace. They absolutely love to light it, sit around it for about ten minutes, and then just let it burn while they go about the house. Every time they do, within twenty minutes I get those massive headaches, it gets harder for me to breathe, and I get this wet bark of a cough that (with the other aforementioned) will persist the rest of the day. My head hurts really really badly to the point that I’m in tears and all I can do is lay down.

I’ve tried to discuss this with her but she just says I’m dramatic and that it’s just dehydration and to stop making a big deal out of it. She doesn’t feels these symptoms at all, nor does her husband, so she’ll probably never believe me. I don’t think there’s anything I could say to her to change her mind, or do anything to change the fireplace at all, so here’s my needed advice: 

How do I negate these symptoms? I saved up and bought a big room air filter and these little seal strips for my windows and doors of my bedroom, and just stay in there all day, but it only helps alleviate my pain a little bit. I really can’t keep going on every day not being able to breathe or think and then getting yelled at for it. It hurts big time and I need help. 😬

In high school, my friend told me it isnt “normal” for parents to drink every night. I was taken back by this statement. It lead me to a-lot of confusion, I’ve always seen my parents with a drink at dinner, then a couple glasses after.

When i got to the age of 16, they started to drink more. When my parents got drunk they would say that they are worried for my future and that they’re afraid I’ll end up like my dads brother (overdosed on heroin). These comments really bothered me because i never touched drugs before; they just wanted me to stop being friends with certain people. 

At about 18 years old, the drinking got worse. I told them that it bothered me and how they only yell at me when they’re drunk, not my sister.  They told me: (1)drinking at night is normal, (2) they deserve drink, and (3) quit being such a mormon ( I’m not even mormon wtf does that even mean). 

At 20 years old, I still live with them because i cant afford to move out (college). I think i have depression and talked to my parents about it. I feel like they just see me as a burden now.

The first two months she really suppressed her OCD, I guess to attract me better. But now she’s comfortable around me and I can’t help but say she stresses me out more than makes me feel good. 


Sometimes I just want to yell at her and tell her she’s making no sense, and I know that is the most awful thing to do to someone with a serious illness. But it’s how I feel. She stresses me out so bad.

She was being super nice and giving me a lot of her drink since she didn’t really need it. Later into the party, I was pretty hammered, and one of my friends suggested that I try to make a move on her (nothing too crazy) and that they would try to set us up.

119,"Hello r/Advice,

I’m 31 years old and I’m from an area located in the southern US. 2 days ago, I received a call from my father who asked that I come down for Christmas Eve dinner to spend with him, my stepmother, and her 3 children, and their small children. He asked that I come early so that my stepmother and I could “talk things out. She wants to talk to you.” I replied, sure I’ll be there slightly reluctantly considering he was drinking. 

**A little backstory:**

My father met my stepmother when in 1998 when I was 11 years old. She was very nice and caring to me during that time period an made great efforts to show my dad (whom was a single father as my mother left us when I was young - only child) that she cared for me as his child. For the next two years up until I was 13, she was, for the most part, nice, loving, and civil. Two years later, my parents married shortly after my stepmother had already moved in. I began to notice certain things to change in her attitude towards me. She began to become colder, moodier, and sometimes just downright mean. 

This progressed as I got to high school. Throughout much my my teenage years, she would get drunk and come upstairs to my room and start yelling at me as well as drunk lecturing me for nearly 1 hour **every** night (at least for 1 summer in early high school that I can remember) regarding how I don’t ever do anything constructive (I always did chores but she told me to stop doing them because “I didn’t put silverware up 100% properly, etc”). She literally would drunk lecture, yell, and insult me for up to an hour. I never talked back or did anything but cried because I never had a grown adult treat me like that before. I was also surprised at what my stepmother had become. She wasn’t the nice lady that I knew anymore though she was sometimes nice when she had good days but that always soured quickly the next day. 

She got worse and just turned into a downright bitch when I got to junior year in 2003. She would always mutter things under her breath every single night passing by my room saying that either I was a worthless piece of shit,. **Every single night.** Considering I have long since moved on as I’m now a grown adult, certain memories I have of living in that hell house: she dumped table salt all in my bed one night when I got home from my high school job (this happened a few times on different nights), put dish soap in my sandwich for dinner one night (I brought it up and was accused of trying to blame her some so ‘ridiculous.’ My dad almost threw a punch at me that night), put dead palmetto bugs in my bed, laundry, and dryer with my clothes, put a dead mouse underneath my desk in my room, and would go through my things and throw my stuff around the room (she would always deny it). 

There were so many verbal arguments between her, my dad, and I during those years and she would always lie, manipulate, and do sadistic things while I was not at home. I would always make sure I remembered how I would leave my room for instance everyday and noticed when I would come back, something was tampered with. 

**Fast Forward to the original story:**

Today, I drove down 1.5 hours to see my dad in my hometown and have this talk with my stepmom that my dad stated she wanted to have with me. I actually told my dad 2 years ago that I wanted to apologize to her (even though I didn’t feel I did anything wrong during my youth). It was for my dad’s sake since she is his wife and my stepmom. While my dad was outside, I went inside the house and asked her if I could speak with her. 

She replied, “Listen, I don’t want any drama today.” 

I stated, “I just wanted to apologize for my behavior during my younger years. I’m not sure if it was because I was angry that my mother had left and potentially a mixture of teenage hormones however I just wanted to let you know I take responsibility.”

She stated, “Listen, today my children and grandchildren are coming and I originally had told your dad to invite you down *tomorrow* and not *today.* Implying that she didn’t want me to be there around her family. That kind of made me feel so small in that very moment considering I knew that I never did anything wrong to her and I wanted to be the bigger person and take full responsibility of her abuse. I love my dad so I want to get along with the woman he is married to but she won’t have anything to do with me. This was our first conversation in 13 years as she has never spoken to me nor does she reply to me if I say hey, how are you etc. 

I eventually told my dad I felt uncomfortable and left right as my stepsister had pulled in. I told my dad everything she said but told him not to mention it to her. I don’t want them fighting over me as I knew this had pissed him. I told him merry Christmas and the usual love you bye then drove back home. This honestly has made me feel like shit however typing all this out has given some relief. 

Sorry for the rant however I think at this point, there is nothing more to do right? I just don’t feel like its normal to not have at least a conversation with her when I visit but if this is how it is going to be then what can I do (she hasn’t really spoken to me since I moved out 13 years ago anyway).

121,"BLUF first date ideas

Hey everyone. After a 2 year relationship ended I've been pretty depressed. But I've been talking to a woman I met online about an hour away from me and finally feel good enough to ask her on a date. So far we have a lot of common ground. Traveled to a lot of  countries. Similar music, like some bands that my friends dont even know. We both enjoy musicals and plays. She's a teacher so she has most of the winter break off. 

What are some good first date ideas that would help me stand out to her? I'm usually opposed to movies and coffee. Just because you cant talk at a movie and coffee has no distraction to ease the date.

124,"Hey reddit,

So I've been working at a retail job for 5 months now.

There's been a lot of issues and I've finally decided it's time to quit.

I've interviewed and been accepted for another job at goodwill that I really wanted.

Problem is the goodwill is in the same mall as the store I'm working in now.

I wanted to say in the written notice that I'm leaving for another job, but what if they ask me where and I tell them I'm leaving for a store that's a minute away?  Do you think the boss would be insulted?

If not do you absolutely have to give a reason?  What if I cite personal reasons and then Goodwill calls my boss and they find out I want to work for them?

What should I write in my letter?  

Thanks so much.  Merry Christmas!

125,So I have this friend and she’s a bit mental. She go’s out of her way to be a too unique like all throughout seventh grade he would change her attitude from being preppy to goth to a girly girl to emo and fake cutting herself to get attention and then she was lesbian then bisexual then pretending to be star from star vs the forces of evil (idk if that’s what it’s called) then she was Thomas sanders then she was yandere for me then back to being bisexual. She has pulled a knife on me a couple of times and bites me I recently tried to stop hanging out with her also she pretends to be mentally ill and unstable and she acts like she has Tourette’s syndrome and she is constantly seeking attention then I constantly do more research on a illness she pretends to have and she has a stereotypical viewpoint and is wrong with the “illness”. How can I get through to her and make her realize she has a bad attention seeking problem?,25Dec2018,1
126,"I was acquainted with this girl I met online for quite a few years now. For the most part, we never really talked. We just sort of knew each other through a few other people. However, about a few months ago, we began to text to each other. We have actually become good friends, and I have started to develop feelings for her.

The major problem with this, is that she lives in Norway.

She knows English, and is fluent through messaging. We’ve called a few times, and she can speak it quite well. And I’ve of course seen what she looks like. So it’s not like she’s a total stranger to me. We’ll talk about anything at this point, no matter how personal.

The thing is, I’ve had a long distance relationship before. It ended badly for me, and that was only in the next state from me. Ever since I kept away from any sort of long distance relationship, and haven’t been in one for years. And yet here I am, crushing on a girl in Norway, across the world from me.

I never told her about it at all. I don’t think it can work out. The distance is just too great, and as a young college student, I’m in no position to travel internationally (plus, isn’t traveling across the world for a girl is sort of weird?). I’ve been telling myself not to go for it, and just stay friends with her, but every time she compliments me, I feel so happy. And whenever she talks about a guy she likes, I can’t help but feel jealous.

I’ve been thinking of telling her how I feel. I’m not sure what I exactly hope to get out of it, because I’m not sure if that sort of relationship can even work out. But I also think just admitting it will lift a weight off my chest, even if we continue just staying friends.

128,"\*\*this is a throwaway acc\*\*

I don't really want to be rude or anything but I don't like my gifts. People asked me what I wanted, but I told them I didn't want anything. 2018 has been shit for me and I am not in the Christmas mood. Honestly, I haven't wanted anything for Christmas in a while now. I don't trust people to get me things that I want (like games) unless I directly tell them.

My sister asked me so I told her money. She told me to think about something so I told her she could get me clothes, like a jacket or some kind of sweater. She gets me this black wooly sweater w/ a hood (which is kinda uncomfortable and doesn't fit me, but that isn't her fault). She got me 2 games, being Bloodborne and Elder Scrolls. While I do play video games, I am not a ""heavy"" gamer and i'm not interested in these. The issue is that she no longer has the reciept so I wouldn't be able to return them. I wanted to pay her back the money (she said it was cheap) but she declined. 

I am writing this at 12:30 ish, so I plan on getting her some things later today (didn't have time to buy anything).

My parents gave me money but they already owed me money anyway so it didn't really feel like a 'gift'.

I'm not trying to be ungrateful or anything but I really feel bad because I didn't want anything. I told them if they wanted to get me something I'd take money because that could be used for anything. I'm really upset right now and if I don't like a gift I choose not to say anything so I don't end up sounding like a brat.

131,"I honestly hate being this way but I’ve become totally irritated with people. There was a time I wasn’t like this and really basically loved everyone. I don’t know why but over the years I’ve become so cynical and social media doesn’t help. When I scroll through social media, I see how everyone is trying to show off and they look dumb. Then I stereotype them and start thinking they are lame for what they are doing in the posts. I feel like people who have babies are annoying and selfish, all about their kids and babies. I feel like bridesmaids in weddings are so silly and they all look dumb wearing same dresses. I feel like those people who work in “good jobs” such as nice well paying corporate jobs are so boring (I am technically one of them but I feel like all my coworkers are boring). I feel like people with kids and wives are the most boring people ever. I feel like those people who went to good schools/was good in school and doing their graduate studies are just nerds and boring (even though they are smart and that’s good).

136,"So I’m in my early 20’s. Growing up, video games were huge to me and I loved them. I work basically 24/7 and never have time to play anymore. Tomorrow being Christmas means I have my first day off in months, I bought myself some chips and soda, telling myself I was gonna game all night so I can get the most of this opportunity.

It’s been an hour and a half and I’m done. I had fun, it was nice but I don’t feel the urge to keep playing. I’m not really sure what this means, I enjoyed myself but I feel satisfied. I don’t feel the need to start another round.

137,"I am the oldest child (22F) and have two younger siblings, one college aged and the other high school. My parents are in the middle of a pride stand off that has apparently been going on for around three weeks now. Their fights usually go along like this, where they fight over something dumb, something hurtful is said, they give each other the cold shoulder for some period of time (from days to weeks) then once one of them sucks it up, they're good as new like nothing had happened, a sort of honeymoon phase. I know it's an incredibly unhealthy dynamic, but I can't help but explain that when it's good it's good, but when it's bad it's bad. They love each other and care for each other very much, but they are just so proud. I'm in grad school now so I am pretty removed, but my sisters still get very affected, but now the middle is cynical (as she used to be the one who would try to get them back together) and the youngest blames herself. I have no one to talk to about this. 

I want to know how to handle this. I can't tell if it's an immature, selfish response to give both of them the cold shoulder and 'boycott' Christmas until we can celebrate genuinely? I don't really want to go to church anyway to be honest, I find it hard to believe. If we go with the image and attend Mass then open gifts, it'll all feel so fake and forced and pathetic, then each of us will just go straight back to our rooms. And I'd feel guilty because mom wants us to try and have as normal of a Christmas as possible. Their anniversary was two days ago, and they already skipped that. 

If I do the 'boycott' idea, I mean December 25 is just a date, I just want my family to have the holiday as a family. But I worry that making a big, risky move like this will cause resentment towards me. I can't talk to anyone about this as my middle thinks that I'm just trying to piss everyone off and hurt mom, and I don't want to make my youngest cry any more. 

I feel that this idea might in a way put pressure on them to just face it and make up. But what if that make up is superficial? 



Tldr: Mom and Dad are refusing to speak to each other. Usually the hardest part of them making up is one of them approaching the other. Should I refuse to do anything Christmas until we can do it as a family, or is that immature and childish thinking? ",25Dec2018,1

144,"I apologize right now for the length of this post. And also any misspelling or run-on sentences. I will gladly receive the attacks from the grammar police.

So I'm sitting here on Christmas sorry I am in Asia so it's already Christmas for us. And a day ago I got a present from my family that had things from the University that my sister attends. Other than a pack of sausage that was pretty much it when I say items I also mean like mugs and hoodies and stuff like that that's at the University that my sister goes to.

No Christmas card no pictures just that. my mother particularly said how excited she was to see what I thought about the gift. And that I should really look forward to it. My parents have kind of a track record of buying non personal gifts gift cards and just sending like $50 to my husband and I so I wasn't expecting much. But for some reason this year this kind of really bothered me.

to give you more of a background I've had a really rocky relationship with my family and I do not live with them and I don't think I have lived with them since I was 18 years old. I spent almost most of my adult life in different countries a ocean away from them.

When I was younger they clung tight to me and discourage me from doing a lot of outside activities, like sports and girl scouts but they still drove me to those places. However when I been in an activity for too long or they got tired of taking me I had to stop going.. pretty frustrating when you're trying to get a black belt, for example.

Fast-forwarding to high school, pretty much everything I did displeased please my mother. My mother just too I guess show her power over me wouldn't even let me attend youth group, I should mention I was raised Christian so this should be fine right it's literally a Bible study group with other teenagers. No I had to come home right after school. even the youth counselor was like is everything okay and I'm like yeah my mom just wants me to be home sorry I can't be at your Bible study pizza night thing that actually sounded really fun. So high school was pretty much like that.

In college I went to a school that was about hour and a half away and after learning how to drive I pretty much stayed there and went to school. My mother mostly complained about how I was so busy and that I decided to work on the weekends instead of coming home to visit them. This is the part where my mother's health started to decline. She has one of those diseases that you still live a long time but you deal with a lot of chronic pain. so this is the part of my life where I started to get guilt-tripped for doing anything. If I went out with my friends I was abandoning her.I should also mention that I was told by my friends that I was pretty much Cinderella when it came to the chores in my house. Before my mother was diagnosed with her chronic illness she told me that in order to have fun I had to clean up wash dishes you know do chores pretty much. So I did this everyday whatever she demanded rewashed things sometimes just so I could feel like a normal teenager, and go to youth group and be home by 9 p.m.

Needless to say we fought a lot let's fast-forward to college which was great gave me a chance to be independent I studied abroad multiple times and came back with a lot of great experiences and almost the mastery of a foreign language. Oh and I forgot to say I am a skilled violinist. Which I continued from elementary school all the way through college. Now remember all of those really good I guess accomplishments I mentioned, these were all faults in my mother's eyes. My hard work working ethic that she taught me that kept me at school on the weekends working too make my own money she saw as me abandoning her and not wanting to come home. My strides in learning a foreign language she saw as me abandoning my own culture. Me traveling abroad for school for a semester or a summer program she saw as me taking an expensive vacation.

when I talk about myself even now I have to remind myself that these things are accomplishments and that I did work hard for them and I worked hard to achieve these goals that I had. And I bet the reason it was because of how my mother viewed my accomplishments.

One of the most scarring things that I dealt with was my first concert as a violinist in University my family didn't come. Sorry I know this post is getting long but I am trying to sum up stuff so if you're still here thank you. But back to that concert I will never forget being all dressed up having your hair done stressing about can you actually play that piece. Playing a hour-long concert and if any of you are musicians that stage is hot your hands get tired and shit I miss my note LOL hashtag musician life for me it's shit my Bow going in the wrong direction fuck let me just wait till I catch up shit.

anyway I finished and I walked out with the other musicians and all around me people were being hugged by their parents and their family members some family members bought their children flowers. And I never forget the sadness I felt knowing that my parents weren't coming. Oh and obviously I asked them. But my mother said your sister has school the next day. Luckily my friends and my boyfriend who is now my husband 5 years or something like that LOL was there. One of my friends even brought me flowers I couldn't believe it.

To sum up my adult life I've moved back and forth between Asian countries doing English teaching and other jobs my language skills have helped me live a very interesting life. My husband and I travel a lot and we experienced a lot of fun stuff. His family is really supportive and calls us once a week and tells us that they miss us but they're glad that we were having such a great experience.

My family they don't call I have to call them. and when I do call the only thing they talk about is my sister. a little about her she's still in my home country she's in graduate school now and she is super smart. We have similar interests which I think my mother tried to suppress when she was younger but it's fun talking to her about things like K-pop and stuff like that. Even though I am a generation behind her. if you need an example I'm a big bang fan and she's a BTS fan.

so my question for you guys I mean the one person that still reading holy crap you're still reading this?

Tell my one question is what to do I got this package from them like I said I live super far so far this obviously you have to take an airplane, and we usually don't exchange presents and you know it's Christmas and I've prepared these special gifts for them individually knowing that they're probably not even going to use it. And the package just had paraphernalia from my sister's University. Should I tell them how I feel? Should I tell them how disappointed I was to get a package like that? Should I tell them how disappointed I felt this entire time being their first daughter and seeming to be put second because I am the terrible one for leaving them? I hope I describe this well I'm sorry about all those run-on sentences I'm using Google and it's much easier. If you actually read to the end holyshit you're awesome I wouldn't even read this to the end I don't even think it was exciting maybe I'm really really boring LOL have a Merry Christmas and thanks.",25Dec2018,1

146,"Ok so a year ago I was dating a shitty guy who was always really cruel to me. He ended up getting me pregnant, then completely abandoning me for another girl. The whole time we were together he never told me he had this girlfriend in another state. (She didn’t know about me either until she saw a pic of us on Facebook) When I found out I was already pregnant and he was just like “yeah I’m leaving to go move in with her in like a week. See ya” He didn’t give a shit at all. So yeah she flew him out and paid for him to be with her while I was abandoned totally alone, devastated and pregnant (got an abortion of course). The whole thing hurt real bad. The whole time he was just using me until he had the money to go be with someone else. Didn’t even have the balls to tell me about it til I found out on my own. Didn’t even check up on me after he left. There was no reason I should have been pulled into their relationship.

Fast forward to a couple months ago, he came back to town to visit his sick mother. He messaged me and asked if I wanted to hang out and catch up. I stupidly said okay because I wasn’t hurt anymore and just wanted to be peaceful. I thought we were just gonna hang out as friends in a coffee shop or something. But he picked me up, took me to his friends house, got me drunk and pressured me into having sex with him. I know it was dumb but he’s very intimidating and I didn’t know how to say no. The next morning I woke up and he was gone and I was alone in a total strangers house. He used me yet again. When I messaged him about it saying it was wrong he was just like “well we have history so it’s whatever”

Now, I’m with a great guy who treats me right and makes me happy. I forgave my ex and I really don’t care at all about him. But it does bother me to see them so happy, to see him treating her so well when he never did that for me. Why was I used and mistreated when he already had a girl he actually cares about? I didn’t deserve to go through any of that. She should know what a piece of shit he really is.

I feel like I should just let it go and let them be happy because I don’t care anymore. But I also feel like it’s not fair the way I was used and treated like shit. I’m dying to just make an anonymous account and let her know that her bf cheated on her when he was supposed to be visiting his sick mother.

151,"19 years old, Long story short, I have a brain disease where quality of life degrades as time goes on. I'm close to the 2.5 year mark and most people are sent to an institution by the 2 year mark so I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. So when I knew what the disease meant, thinking about it really stressed me out(and still does) so I decided to live life completely normally as if nothing was wrong. To this day only one person knows, and her reaction was to convince herself that nothing was wrong despite all the evidence, which made me even more apprehensive to the idea of letting people know. So I wasn't going to waste time on college when the chances were I wasn't going to make it through the 4 years. As an immature teenager usually does, I coped with my internal issues through drugs, parties, and other wild behavior. Ended up selling drugs for a while, stopped because I got robbed a few times, and ended up with like $2000 left over. I also had some money from my grand dads leftover government payments(he was in the military) and I decided to put the money together and start a business with it. Best case scenario it works out and I get the best treatment possible, worst case I went out trying. I tried a lot of things, learned a lot, and got to a point where I thought I had a real shot professionally. I'm making this part short, but over this period of time(past year or so) I poured nearly my every waking hour into this business. Plenty of sleepless nights, plenty of days spent completely on brainstorming. Plenty of times I considered giving up but I never did. Then a few months ago my car broke down. I live in a city where not having a car is like not having two legs, in a business sense and a social sense. But I only had $700 left at this point, and that would be the entire cost of fixing it. Wouldn't be able to buy gas or food. So over the next few months, I did my best to stretch the $700 while still trying everything I could to make the business work. I'd spent most of the time on the business trying to come up with ways to advertise big on a small budget and failing. Tried everything from AdWords to wheat paste posters to placing 500 stickers in important places across the city, still nothing. Not a single sale. After asking enough people the right questions, I kinda figured out that unless I had a huge amount of money to spend on marketing, or just got extremely lucky, my business would not turn profit. Unfazed, I resolved to use my skills to make money to then use for marketing. I tried a list of things, from drop shipping screen protectors and wine bottle covers to writing an entire book on philosophy(which I still think is pretty good) to trying to sell 3D art to businesses. I know it sounds like I gave up on a lot of things, but I honestly put my all into every task. Spent 3 days making the screen protector ad, just so happens the advertising platform I chose wasn't good for product ads. Couldn't run the wine cozy ads due to a bug in Facebook's ad system. Wrote the entire book under the false impression that marketing it would be any easier than marketing my business, plus the fact that the ISBN that I need to apply for publishing costs like $100 up front. I literally cold called 300 businesses for the 3D graphics, emailed 300 more, and didn't get a single client. The cold calls alone took an entire day. And all of this has been within the month of December. So I sat down and really thought about what my talents were. In researching marketing for my business, I got a solid foundation on basic marketing principles(mostly useless without a budget, but alas), Became proficient in After Effects and Photoshop (from editing promo videos, promotional graphic design), and became really good at Blender (promo once again). So I decided to market myself as a versatile graphic design specialist and do work for other companies. Applied what I already knew about getting customers, and got a few solid leads. Then my laptop broke. Yesterday. The laptop which not only holds all of the files I need for the business itself, every piece of creative work I've ever done(that I can no longer go back to for options), but also is the only computer in the house that is capable of running the software I need to do the graphic design. I still have like $600 left, tried to be as frugal as humanly possible(diet pretty much consisting of mashed potatoes and whatever food I could get for free). But my laptop has been doing badly for a while, WiFi hasn't worked for months, had an overheating issue so I had to run the fan super high, and plenty of other issues. The $600 could be enough, but it also could put me in a situation where I'm less than a hundred dollars away from being homeless. It's a really sad thing for me to think about, especially having been homeless for a short time before. I've dealt with depression, I'd describe being homeless as like another level of it. Sometimes there are happy moments within depression, where you almost forget it. When you don't have any place to sleep, you can't escape it. It's like who you truly are is gone, you can't really be comfortable anywhere, and every moment on the bench or the dirty mattress in the alley is a slap-in-the-face reminder of the already depressing situation you're in. Not to mention being publicly laughed at by people you know. I can take a lot, but I don't think I can handle that. A few nights ago I asked a higher power to please either give me some success or kill me while crying. And i never cry. Not asking for pity or empathy, just painting a picture. I've been burned enough time relying on or expecting other people to care. And I'm not suicidal at all, I'd never kill myself. And I have enough self discipline (you need it in business) to never even allow the thought of suicide to grow. Despite all of the circumstances, I have a generally positive disposition and am super grateful for everything I've experienced in life. But I'm alive, and I am human. The constant failure and disappointment take a toll and it gets worse every time. And I just don't want to deal with it again. So I'm here to ask what I should do. What would you do in my situation? My skills are: Comedy(amateur), Graphic Design(anything from websites to book covers to 3D animated short films), Video Editing(AE), and people generally enjoy my views on things, people often tell me I should start a podcast. I have a wealth of information about the most random of topics. I'm smart, been in gifted programs since I was a kid, and I have one heck of a work ethic. Been offered certain crimes as an option, the big stuff (15k+). Never considered it due to obvious moral and jail reasons, but i won't lie and say I haven't been thinking about it lately.  Hopefully it's legal to type that. So what should I do? I figure have a month on the short side, 3 on the long. I feel like if I do a little bucket list thing with the money than once it's over I pretty much will be too. But the business thing seems to have completely failed, at least in my time frame. If you've ever been in a similar situation, or have knowledge that could be of some help I'd appreciate it a lot. Thanks.",25Dec2018,1

153,"I'm a cliche case of ""older sibiling parent"" who was forced to mature way too fast. Mixed with sexual, physical, and emotional abuse happening at different parts of my life I feel like I've progressed and regressed way too often. I'm currently with a very loving man (18M) for 8 months who has helped me work through many issues (over 3 years of friendship before we started dating) and supported me through the things I felt were necessary to fix on my own but he doesn't see my maturity to be an issue. I feel like sometimes I'm way too ""adult"" for the situation and sometimes I'm so childish. He loves it and it's never been something I need to change for him. I want to behave more ""normally"" for someone my age. I feel like I shouldn't cry over him not wanting to talk (he finds it sweet but doesn't ever give in just because I'm crying and I respect that. Adults need their own time and enabling my crying would make it worse. He knows when it's serious) and I get clingy and feel super disappointed at the time but get over it. Then I'll become like a mom and start lecturing him on taking care of his body and he gets a little frustrated with that but he still finds it cute because it means I care about him.

154,"A bit of history first, I enlisted into the military back in 2015 and made it about 9 weeks through basic out of the 14 (infantry) before I somehow hurt my back. The pain was unbearable. I couldn't walk, and even straight up fell down while formed up in the CTA (company training area). The doctors at Ft. Benning couldn't find anything wrong with my back so, naturally, they assumed I was faking it. How I wish I was.

After a month of physical therapy, I was well enough to walk around and seem as if I was alright, with some minor pain here and there. However, I had already missed out on so much training, my company commander gave me a choice; I could either stay in and restart basic entirely, or I could leave. At the time, I assumed leaving would be the best option, as I was scared that I would hurt myself worse, and went home.

These past 3 years have been challenging to say the least. The pain has never gone away, I've just gotten better at dealing with it. Had an odd job here and there but nothing that lasted too long because after a full day or two of work, I can barely stand up, let alone work even more. I've been to the hospital 4 times now with no luck. ""We cannot find a definite cause of the pain"" is what I've heard every time after getting every *incredibly* expensive test you can think of. I've even had to go to the ER twice because the pain was just more than I could handle.

So now I'm here. Living with my mom and brother because I cannot find a job. I have to tell employers about my back issue, of course, because otherwise it would be on them if I happened to collapse on the job.

The reason I'm writing this now is because two days ago, I took a walk to my local mall. It's about a mile and a quarter away from my place. Strolled around inside a bit, and went back home. The next day, you guessed it, I couldn't stand up. That was the most surreal feeling of defeat I've had in a long time.

I try desperately to stay positive about everything, as it could be much worse, but it's just getting harder as time goes on. I've applied to online call centers and transcription services with no luck so far, and I've even picked up practicing web development lately, in the hopes that one day, I could actually start making money again.

I apologize for the wall of text, maybe I needed to vent a bit, but I am asking for any advice on my situation that someone could give. Thanks very much for reading.

155,"23yo male here. 

Okay, so my own sister started calling me ugly tonight, genetically speaking. 

What led to this insult was, I was saying some friend of hers was a 7/10 in looks, very cute girl, but not stunning per say. I said this because she's always complaining about how often this friend of hers gets asked out by men. My type of girl is usually on the shorter side, more into fitness lifestyle, some what petite thin body with glute muscle, and has a younger more defined face. Just my type, if we're talking ideals. This girl doesn't meet any of those ideals really. 

She proceeded to say, ""you'll never get a girl who's as pretty as her."" ""Her boyfriend is substantially hotter than you. You'll never be good enough for her."" Basically saying to me, no matter what i do to improve myself or my looks, I can never get a pretty girl because my face is genetically ugly and im average height (5'10). 

She thinks this girl is a goddess, like 9 / 10 because this girl gets asked out by men a lot. In reality, the girl is just super friendly and kind, tall, thin but not too thin, and probably has a tendency to lead men on. Actually, i know for a fact she does. 

&amp;#x200B;

See this bothers me a lot, i eat a very clean diet, i go to the gym, but i lack a little on presentation effort i admit (Eg: style, ect.) I think i'm pretty good looking guy! Do I get validated for my looks? I have in the past, a fair amount. Not so much these days because im bulking long term for the gym, but im not fat by any means, just not at model body fat percentages. Will be cutting down sometime this year though once i get my gym goals accomplished. 

Here's why im so confused ultimately if she's just speaking truth, or just being miserable. This issue is disturbing me psychologically speaking on a very significant deep level. Let me try to explain: 

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons why i believe im average or ugly. 

1: I haven't had a long term girlfriend ever, and I've never been with a truly stunning girl. I've been with mostly average to below average girls sexually speaking. I've never really had girls chasing me to date me or anything. 

2: I have tried online dating briefly, I only took blurry cell phone selfies. I don't have good pictures, so I attribute this to my lack of success in online dating. But now im starting to think I might just be very average. If a hot man took shitty cell phone selfies, wouldn't he do well on tinder despite? 

3: I don't get great success approaching girls randomly, but based on other guys accounts neither do they. But if i was truly attractive, wouldn't it be easy? I have had it easy a few times, but the majority of the time the girls just smile and be off, or politely listen. Once in a while they've been rude to me as well. From my understanding this is normal, but perhaps not normal for a sexy man? 

4: I'm baby facish, not super strong jawline, plain brown eyes, am only 5'10, somewhat small joints, acne scars, and dryish hair. It's short right now though, i but i find i get most attention when it's longish. 

5: People criticize my looks a lot lately. I've had a couple guys out right call me ugly in my gym, when we were talking about dating. I've also had girls on omegle bully me for my looks, but conversely I've had girls on omegle compliment my looks. Reasons like this is why im so immensely confused about the truth. 

6: I went on amiugly and got a 6/10 , all from dudes im guessing though. My description for that picture was off putting though, and my body fat was a little fluffy at the time. I got like a 7.8/10 on amihot. Above average for that site. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons why I believe I'm attractive

1: I've had people randomly compliment my looks. Like once at a job interview for a restaurant she randomly said: ""You are so attractive and handsome"" randomly. I mean, is this common? My dad's friend also just told me I'm getting better looking every time he sees me a couple months ago. 

I've been randomly cold approached in public girls hitting on me probably about 5-7 times my entire life in the day time. I've been indirectly hit on probably about 25-50 times. I don't go out to the night clubs or parties like ever though. 

Ive been cat called from girls being called hot and such about 10 times in my life, usually when im running. 

I've almost never been randomly messaged on the internet though from girls, and the likes i got on facebook was meh. 

(Mind you, most of this happened when i was skinny and younger, does not happen so much these days. But i imagine, it'll go back to this way once i cut my bodyfat down again, because this attention was to do with my face not body as before i had zero muscle. I hold a lot of fat in my face genetically speaking.)

2: Most girls will look at me when i look at them, or stare at them. If i smile at a girl, she often smiles back. I get this same reaction from plainly hot girls, to meh girls. Like one time i walked through the mall and just said hi to 10 girls, almost all them said hi back and smiled at me, and a lot of them were really cute and thin. Is it not true that if you're average, hot  and cute girls will avoid all eye contact even glancing or smiling or saying hi in return? 

If i stare down a very hot girl, she would stare back at me deeply, and not in a cringe way, semi regularly. Or at least, they almost always recognize my presence if im around. I find these days though they tend to ignore me more. It's kind of disheartening because im putting so much efforti n the gym as before i barely worked out but i was just skinny. 

IVe noticed girls look at me through crowd of people too, i mean min you she's looking through a crowd of old or fat people , but still .. i mean is that even normal? 

3: If im standing waiting to cross the road, it's pretty regular for girls to turn their head completely to look at me. Again, is this something average people experience?  

4: I've heard girls talk about my looks around me, back when i was skinny but not anymore. Like once they were saying on the bus, ""He looks like justin bieber"" ""he's so cute that's awesome."" I had people also say i look like George Cloony and Leo Dicarpio. I mean are they trolling. Or another time, a group of girls were following me commenting on my ass. And i remember once a girl at school said, ""Who's that he's cute?"" and her friend replied, ""He never talks."" (i use to be very silent.) I remember once at party a girl said when i was smiling, ""Your face like ugh.""   

5: Ive gotten girls to be down or have sex with me or kiss me under 5 min of meeting them. Ive also gotten cam sex immediately with girls on omegle, but i can only accomplish that if i show my face. If i show my penis only, since it's not big, they WILL skip everytime. Ive also gotten girls want to go out with me on the internet after meeting me very briefly but i wasn't interested. 

But in real life, no girls are asking me out, tbh i never been asked out first by a girl to go on a date or be my girlfriend, as sad as that is to admit. I dont get groped when i go the club... i dont have wives throwing themselves at me... i can't make a instagram and get girls in messaging me first in my dms....

I mean, reading the stories of guys who recount what it's like to be attractive on Reddit, i get a little bit of what they get but not full on. Are they perhaps exaggerating? Im being completely honest here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying any of this to brag, genuinely, and im not saying any of this to make you feel bad for me. I genuinely feel confused whether these experiences are that of an average man or an attractive one. 

Now, if im average genetically speaking, I can give up the pipe dream of being girls who i once though were on my level but can just settle going for ugly girls and deal with it. If my sister is right, and im a 5/10 genetically speaking in the face, i should honestly leave hot girls alone, unless they initiate. I have no chance unless i get very lucky or am rich or develop my personality a whole lot better. 

But based on my accounts im sharing, is to say 5/10 just plain false, in all likelihood? I swear, id almost rather be plain ugly then have to deal with so much cognitive dissonance. If i am attractive, then i know my lack of success with girls is due to other things like my personality, which is inspiring because i can improve that. I can't change my height or face. That's why what my sister said hurt so much. Please help, and please be honest. 

Are all these experiences of an average man? Am i delusional like my sister said in thinking i am a good looking guy? 

&amp;#x200B;

(Again im relaly not trying to sound like a douche, im just trying to get some help here. )

156,"Hello all! This is really a very basic situation, so I'll try to keep it simple.

First, I'm generally not a very punctual person. I'll usually be on time to super critical things like exams, appointments, flights, and meetings, but for less career or health determining things like meeting up friends to go grab coffee or arriving at a potluck dinner, I'll struggle to be on time. I don't mean hours late or anything insane - maybe 5-10 minutes. On a really really bad day, maybe 15. I know it's not great, and I want to change. So my first question is: how do I improve my punctuality to all things?

Second, I have a group of friends who think it's the world's greatest laugh to poke fun every time I'm late by a couple seconds or minutes (to date, never more than 10 minutes late with this friend group, and never for anything super time-sensitive like a meeting or a flight or something). At first I'd laugh with them and apologize to them - I generally don't feel great about myself when I'm late even for non-pressing things, and I try to let things go. After repeated proddings, though, I've gotten kind of annoyed with it. I'm punctual at least half of the time - people just never notice when I am, and they hammer on the times I'm not. I've tried to be a good sport about it. My second question is: while I'm looking to improve,  what is a mature way to show that I'm not enjoying their ""humor""? Or is the most socially acceptable way just to improve my punctuality and eat it in the meantime?

Thank you all for your time!",25Dec2018,1
157,"Well my wife left me 7 weeks after being married(we had been together for nearly 5 years).

We also have a daughter together who is also nearly 2,who is also the only reason im still living.

Me and my ex have been trying to stay as friends for our daughters sake,me more so cause I don't want to lose out on my daughter. Plus I also am still in love very much with my wife.

Every single day is a struggle,going into work pretending everything is fine,living in a friends room because I had nowhere else to stay or afford my own place.

AND what do I wake up to this morning,her saying ""Love you""with a heart to a guy from her work and he says it back. I had my feelings that they had something going on but to announce it to EVERYONE on Christmas day? How am I meant to go over theirs today and enjoy today with my daughter..... I feel sick to the stomach,I don't even want to get out of bed..... I just feel like dying,cause whats the point. Im going to lose my daughter to him.....I just know it.

I just don't what to do,we have been seperated since the end of October and Im already sick of feeling like this.

I just don't want to do anymore or even what Im asking for. This year was meant to be amazing,get married,enjoy our time together as a family,move into a new house(since we get evicted from last place so was living at her mothers),work on getting better jobs and work towards our life goals.

158,"Dear Reddit friends,

I normally don't use this as a platform like this but my family and I are in dire need of help. On November 19, 2018, my dad, (a U.S. citizen) traveled to his native country, Bangladesh. He was on a routine business trip and planned to remain there until the new year.

On December 19th, 2018, I woke up to news that my dad was arrested in his local village in Bangladesh. He was arrested for 'crimes against humanity' during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, for which the maximum sentence is death.

They have arrested him based on false information and without any factual evidence. My dad was born in 1958 and was only 13 years old in 1971. More importantly, he was not in Bangladesh during the war. He was living abroad in Pakistan.
My dad is currently being detained in Keraniganj, Bangladesh. He is without access to outside communication or legal representation. Based on my understanding of procedure in these kinds of cases, he may spend years in jail before even being formally charged. There is no bail on this matter.

The International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh (ICT), the entity which investigates and prosecutes 1971 war crimes, fails to uphold international fair trial standards. Due process rights are practically non-existent in these particular cases. Most attorneys will not assist with ICT cases because their lives are threatened for defending the accused.

I have been in contact with the U.S. Embassy in Bangladesh, but they have advised me that they cannot visit my dad until they have approval from the Bangladeshi government. I am not confident that the U.S. Embassy will be granted permission given the present political climate in Bangladesh. There is national election coming up on December 30, 2018, and I believe the current political party is on a witch hunt and stalling to bolster votes.

It has been a few days since my dad's arrest and he has not yet been produced before the Court. Nor has he received legal counsel or seen a U.S. consulate. This morning I learned that it will be awhile until he is able to see a judge. In the meantime they refuse to allow him to meet with an attorney. Bangladesh has also refused to allow my dad to sign a U.S. Department of State's privacy waiver - which is necessary to establish citizenship, identity, and entitlement to welfare protection services offered by the U.S. government.

I am also concerned about my dad’s physical and mental health while he is detained. My father is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and also diabetic. I worry the Bangladeshi government will not provide him with necessary medical treatment while he remains in their custody. And there is really no way to know what kind of treatment he's receiving since we are denied access.

My dad has been an American citizen for 27 years. He is a small business owner in Brooklyn, NY and a farmer in both Hamilton, NY and Fort Pierce, FL. He has ties to the Bengali-American community in Brooklyn and in Queens.

Right now, we need all the help we can get. We need our country’s support in bringing my dad back home safely. I've already contacted my local congressperson and my state senators. But I need as much support as possible. Without your help, I fear that my dad will be subjected to a grossly unjust and inhumane legal system

I was wondering what  more steps my family can take to resolve this issue as soon as we can . 
I want to add that my sister and I have posted about the issue on our own social media and that has helped a bit because other people have been writing to their reps and a few people have contacted us to help us connect with media outlets, legal advice , and other resources .

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I will keep you updated if there are any new updates . ",25Dec2018,1
159,"So I'll start from the beginning. I had a crush on this boy, (lets call him F) of which my two best friends knew about. I was crushing on him for a pretty long time. So one of my friends (call her M) gets seated with him and she's basically a spy for me. She tells me he talks and jokes about me, laughs at what I do, and encourages me to like him even more. They were seated together for a pretty long time, and one day I'm on her phone, and I see a notification that intrigues me. So I click on it and well... read this conversation she's having with some other friends. (I know I shouldn't of been nosy...) Her texts read that, basically: She likes my crush and wants to make moves but knows it's going to hurt me. I was shocked, but didn't confront her and acted as if everything was fine. The next day, she asks If I still like F. I say no, and laugh it off. She then tells me she likes him and if it were okay to make a move. (Of course I say its fine, I'm not about to fight her for this boy.) So they talk, and go on a date. I'm obviously hurt but trying to let go. M hits me up a couple days later and invites me to play a video game with her, F, and his friend. So I play, and we voice chat on Discord. And the next day, we play again... The next day F hits me up (I guess we were comfortable enough to be on a talking level?) and asks to play. I say yes, thinking M would be fine with it and accepted his voice call (since she has encouraged me to play with him before.) M finds out and flips out, saying I still have a crush on him and that she can't trust me. I tell her he hit me up first, so chill the fuck out. So then later she confesses that he talked about me on the date and it hurt her. And she thinks he's using her to get close to me. I don't understand what she wants. For me to stop talking to him? I like talking to him. It's fun playing games. I don't see a problem with it unless we're flirting or something. I know she talked shit about me to her other friends and I'm just so hurt by it. Who's in the wrong here and what can I do to fix it?",25Dec2018,1
160,"Grab your reading glasses, it's a big one. 

So my two brothers (16,22) and I are visiting our Grandparents house for the holiday. A few more relatives came over for lunch, and the house was busy with people moving in and out of the kitchen for a few hours.  Everything eventually started to die down, and around 4:00-4:30 the last goodbyes were said and it was just my brothers the grandparents left. All of us were sitting the living room adjacent to the kitchen, aside from my grandma who was sitting at the counter organizing her medications. I went over to the kitchen to ask her something, when I saw that she was noticeably stressed out and looked panicked. 

She had almost been done laying out her medication for the week when she noticed that she was short five of her painkiller. She isn't too far out from a hip-replacement, so needless to say she is somewhat reliant on them to alleviate the pain. Myself, my younger brother, and my older brother start scouring the house, under the impression that the bottle may have been knocked over amidst the pots and pans moving around the counter. We looked for the better part of an hour, but nothing. My grandma was on the verge of tears, she hates to lose things, but my older brother and I ensured her that we'd help her take care of getting it refilled while we're in town. Over time we calmed her down, and we went back to the living room to watch one of her favorite shows. 

I went into the other room to lie down for a quick nap, but I ended up passing out for an hour and a half. I walked back out into the living room just to see my two brothers, and apparently, both of my grandparents had gone to bed early. Before I had a chance to sit down my older brother asked if I could help him finish off the dishes. He pulled me aside and told me the following: 

Something didn't sit right with him with the missing medication, so he kept on looking. He and I generally distrust our youngest brother strongly as he has had a history of lying and stealing, but we initially gave him the benefit of the doubt that even he wouldn't stoop THAT low. That being said, curiosity got the better of my older brother and he started to look through my youngest brothers luggage. Low and behold, at the bottom the back tucked into a corner was a Ziploc baggie with five blue pills inside. Needless to say, it didn't take too long to put one and two together. During the chaos of the family meal, he had slipped the pill bottle into his pocket, dumped the five pills into the bag, and put the bottle back in its place. 

All that time we had spent looking... He looked at us dead in the eye and lied to our faces. He saw my grandma, a woman who has shown us nothing but love and support our entire lives, stressed to the point of tears and didn't say a thing. 

I'll be honest, when I heard what he had done I felt a wave of anger more intense than anything I've ever experienced. I confronted him and absolutely tore into him. I said a lot of things that I'll probably come to regret, and I essentially let him know I'm about to make his life a hell of a lot harder because what he had done. That when we get back home, I'll be letting my Mom know what he's done, along with a whole slew of shitty things he's done that I've covered for the sake of keeping the peace at home. If this gets out he'll most likely not be living with us anymore, and we wouldn't be paying or his private school tuition that we struggle to manage as it is. It's going to turn everything upside down for him, and frankly, I couldn't care less. All the while he didn't show a SINGLE SHRED of remorse for what he had done, only trying to I was being a ""Dad"" for calling him out on what he did. He didn't take too kindly to this, as you would expect. 

He's threatening me with violence, and I can say for %100 certainty that this is not a bluff. He's got an extremely unstable temper, and he's put hands on me and my mom, yes he isn't above hitting his own mother, if he's angry enough. On top of that, he also said that I tell anything he's going to smash/ destroy all of my belongings (My T.V, laptop, switch, Xbox, car etc.) along with everything in our apartment. Once again, I've seen what this kid of capable of. He's roughly 6'1"", 200 while I'm 5'8"",160 and is fully capable and willing to inflict massive damage if it's to cover his own ass. 

So people, what do I do here? To be honest, I want him completely screw him over. He's a literal sociopath that has done nothing but take and take from my family and cause us pain. He's a lying, cheating, arrogant, manipulative, soulless, cunt that thinks he can take whatever he wants without facing the consequences, and I want to put an end to it.

162,"I feel really rude as I want to sell a chair my parents got me for Christmas because I cannot use it as I have no space for it, and I asked for something else cheaper but didn’t get that - is it rude to sell the chair to get the other thing seeing as I can’t use the chair anyway?",25Dec2018,1
163,"My earliest memory is with her. We were really close when we were little; my father even told me recently he doesn’t remember us getting angry at each other, ever.

She recently spent a year overseas away, which I saw as a blessing, to get some natural distance - only seeing her on facecam or what it’s called at family gatherings. She cried at Christmas, and it’s painfully endearing. 

To put it into context, everybody who knows her, might just think she’s the greatest person they’ve ever met. Perhaps not in living a “virtuous” life, but she really has a great energy, and she *is* who everybody in the family loves the most. It’s kind hard to explain it, but she does care for everyone, and I guess it just goes back around.

It was the same with the family she was with overseas. They absolutely adored her, and it just make it more apparent to me that it’s not something in my mind. (I’ve thought a lot about it. Of course she has flaws, and I try really hard to focus on them for obvious reasons; they just don’t seem important at all in context though)

I was invited for dinner some months ago at my Granny’s.

I walk there, and I get a call from my cousin 1 minute before I arrive asking me how long until I get there. I didn’t even know she’d be in the country.

So I get a minute’s warning to prep myself mentally for her before arriving. And she was just so beautiful. And I don’t feel very good at acting like nothing. I guess I pull through every time, because my whole family acts normal everytime I see them. 

I’m very conscious to not act very interested when she talks as well, not that I’m trying to be a dick, I just try to “keep a lid on it” I guess.

It just hits me so fucking hard every time I see her, but I normally have a long time to mentally prep.

She recently asked me out to lunch and asked if she could sleep at my place for New Year’s cause it’s in the middle of town, and she’s out partying with her girlfriends until maybe 4 am. I couldn’t think of a proper reason to disagree, so I said okay.


I’ve just planned staying at home doing nothing special; was probably gonna go to bed before midnight. (I like to keep a good sleep-schedule) I’m also pretty boring. I have maybe 40 facebook friends, never post anything.

I go to university, I exercise and play teamsports, I try to eat healthy, I play a few instruments, though I don’t use it to show off or anything. It’s just an emotional outlet for me for when I’m alone.

It’s just to say I’m not being very interesting this way, and I try to be very generic, and she still initiates conversations, which I wish she just didn’t. It’s a really great family full of “emotional givers”, and I just feel like I can’t do anything to better my own situation without hurting someone else. I can’t move to a different town, I can’t be a dick, I can’t be honest with my cousin. 

But I try my best to lose interest. I’ve gotten drunk and gone out and partied with my friends, but I just don’t like it.

And it feels like she keeps stabbing me and knowing just what to say and do to pain me.

Putting her head on my shoulder in the car going home from an event. Looking me in the eye while licking ice-cream off her spoon, mentioning casually to me what her bra looked like (because *she* brought up her own outfit that day as a talking-point), or making a comment about masturbating. She and I have a secret handshake, that we’ve had for years, and it was her idea, I just can’t say no to it because I don’t want to be a dick, but it really hurts, feeling I’m special in some way. It would be way easier if she didn’t have any interest in talking to me.

I honestly don’t think she has any feelings for me, but those comments and her behavior are just so fucking weird to me. Perhaps that’s just because I’m kind of a prude? I’m not really religious, I don’t have some weird reason for it, I just haven’t talked to my family about that kind of thing, and I always felt weird about it when my friends talked casually about girls. (Especially when they asked me. I’m guessing they thought I was just asexual or something.) My best friends ended up smoking pot, so we grew apart, and although I’m getting along well with people at my sportsteams and at Uni, I just feel so distant from people now, and it’s for such a ridiculous reason.

I have a pretty damn good life, I know I don’t have anything to complain about. Which is in part why I won’t just say “screw your feelings” to anyone in my family and do something to get away. They’ve been good to me, and I don’t have the right to hurt their feelings.

Anyway, I don’t see how I can get past this, and I’m too afraid to talk to a psychologist about this. I don’t really believe in a way out of this anymore, so I’m just trying to cope as best as I can, but of course I still *hope* to get past it, which is why I’m asking for help.",25Dec2018,1
164,"I hardly ever use my real name unless I have to, I go by a nickname but even that doesn’t feel right. Ever since I can remember I have always disliked my name. Every single time I hear it I get really uncomfortable and I hate it even more. (I don’t want to say what my given name is because I don’t want to offend others with the same name) 

My fear of going through the complicated/expensive name change process is people not respecting it. I feel like ppl will think “who does she think she is?” Or not take my new name seriously... I graduated from high school in 2016 and the city in which I live everyone knows everyone, the pressure of judgment is heavy. What are your thoughts if someone you actually knew completely changed their first name? Would you respect it and start calling them by their new name? Does this mean I have like an identity issue or something? (Obviously I’ve been stressing about this)

166,"Hey Reddit, using a throwaway because I have some people I know who follow me and wouldn’t want to see this.

TL;DR at the bottom.

As the title implies, I have recently decided to spend a bit more time with myself - since I have been running from this like mad - and discovered that... I don’t know if I want to keep living like this.

The thing is, I can’t say that, objectively, I have a “hard” life or anything - I’m middle class, with (albeit divorced, but still together) parents who have a stable income, a family and a group of friends who love me So this is another thing that makes me doubt my feelings and their validity.

Anyway, back to my “discoveries” - let’s just say that 2018 was, as an overall experience, something else completely. For starters, I have had a crush for the first half of the year (my best friend, we shall call her D), and because of several factors - my overall toxic attachment to her, my tendency to victimize myself and make some of my personal problems known and public and the fact that we always had a discussion of some sort if we got drunk at any party - made me break emotionally and, as a result, I started seriously consider suicide - and, for the meantime, I started cutting in order to liberate my emotions. 

After that, I became very close friends with three of my colleagues, which helped me more than I could express through my partial road to recovery, but eventually I started developing a crush on the girl who now I was now considering one if my best friends (let’s call her A). Not wanting to repeat the same experiences as with D that ended in the loss of a friendship I cared a lot about, I tried to take extra steps in order to avoid such thing. The only problem was that some of those extra steps consisted of things - like not going to school for a period of time - which affected her, since she partly blamed herself for it.

Now, even though my experience with A was a lot better than the one with D (still sub-par compared to how it should have normally been) and, most importantly, that I addressed every issue with both D and A, I still hate myself for what I have done and I sincerely doubt that I will get over it too soon.

Back to the main theme of the post, since this was a “flashback” to help you understand a part of the circumstances: the thing is, at least in that shitty period, which happened to be most of this year, even though I was sad or mad or whatever emotion I felt at that time, at least I felt something. For the past month or so, I’ve been feeling like I am living on auto-pilot - almost nothing brings me joy, I don’t want to grow older and experience whatever life has to offer and, most of all, I Iost interest in most of the things and relationships I cared about - and if my existence will be like this from now on, I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be a part of it.

Thank you to whoever read my post, it really means a lot.

169,"Sometimes, when I got nothing going on, usually when I’m laying in bed trying to sleep (much like right now), I’ll have this brick of fear come at me. 

Now, my fear is not about dying. I’ve come to grips with the idea that we all die eventually. 

I’m not scared of dying. I’m terrified of dying unexpectedly. I’m scared of being hit by a car. I’m scared of being mugged and killed. I’m scared of being a mass shooting victim. I’m scared of being diagnosed with a terminal illness. I’m terrified of a death that is out of my control. 

It makes me so incredibly aware and paranoid of everything. I’m so stressed while driving but everyone I drive says I’m one of the safest drivers they’ve ever ridden with. I’m constantly wary of suspicious looking people but I’m worried that makes me prejudiced. I’m both a hypochondriac and someone who fears going to the doctor. 

Correction, I guess I do fear death and what happens afterwards. 

1. If there’s nothing, then there’s nothing. 

2. If there’s an afterlife, I’m terrified of being a ghost forever or even going to hell. 

3. If there’s reincarnation, I’m terrified of the idea that i could come back as someone less “abled” as I currently am (good health, good upbringing, financially secure, decent mental standing, all my limbs, etc.) 

Instead of sleeping tonight, my brain decided to worry about all the crazy holiday drivers tomorrow and how much I hope nothing happens while I drive to or from work tomorrow. ",25Dec2018,1
170,"Since highschool I seem to be living in mediocrity to my peers and no matter what I do that situation has not changed up to now. Everyone I know has finished their degree or got married or is making a lucrative living in silicon valley well into the six figure salary while I am working as a math tutor at the same community college I have been at for 3 years now making 16 or so dollars an hour working 20 hours a week and now with college applications being done and all I am trying to get into a decent UC and by the looks of it I just threw money down the drain and only am fooling myself by thinking there is a shot in hell of me getting into their CS program with my mediocre GPA. I explained the extenuating circumstances, however I know damn well that stuff is never taken into consideration when looking into a college applicant as they have to sift through hundreds of thousands of applicants and you are just another GPA number while they drink the morning brew hot coffee while sitting in their comfy office. I have spoken to the admissions office there and they said they will keep an eye out for my application and that they have a ""holistic approach to every applicant they look at"" but that honestly just sounds like canned garbage they tell everyone who calls them. Throughout my journey in CC I had to play caretaker to my father due to him undergoing two heart surgeries back-to-back and since there was no willing caretaker to look after him all day I had to assume that role as my mom and dad are divorced and my brother is overseas with his wife and I would feel guilty otherwise as I owe all the opportunities I have had up to now to him. I also had to pick up shitty retail job after shitty retail job to help pay the rent for my mom's house as she could barely make ends meet as it is with her preschool teaching job in silicon valley. I am also 22 and still a virgin I almost got laid with a girl I met at a bar but then I said some stupid shit like ""want to hang out with me at my hotel"" and completely and royally fucked it all up. It was also not like I was a dumbass in highschool either I had a 2150 SAT on the old scale and a 35/36 on the ACT but I had a 3.1 GPA and since back then I couldn't be bothered with doing the busy work in the AP classes or the HW even though I did ace the AP tests my GPA suffered immensely. Now fast forward to now I have external problems affecting my prospects which are completely out of my control fucking with me. Its like some cruel joke being played on me or something I made a note to myself to make something out of my life at this point but here I am at 22 living in mediocrity working a crumby math tutoring gig while everyone I know is moving on with their life, getting married or at least have something going to make them happy, while when I wake up all I am reminded is that nothing has changed and nothing will ever change. I feel embarrassed to even still be going to community college at this point at my age because at this point people should have graduated with their undergrad degrees and be making 6 figure salaries as software engineers at silicon valley. I swear its like I am cursed or something and I have very little motivation at this point to even bother trying as I am seeing that the result of that for the last 4 years has been a futile effort by my part in all of my facets of life not just school but relationships as well. To give you context I lost over 70 pounds in the last 4 months dieting and running everyday and yet I have nothing to show for it besides getting just barely close to losing my virginity and getting screwed out of an A because my calc 3 prof has a retarded policy of not giving partial extra credit even though she said herself that I basically made a stupid mistake which caused me to now definitely not get into my university of choice as our community college does not for whatever reason have a +/- system in their college and its just a flat B even though it was just 1% off from an A. I swear its like god or a higher power just loves to torture me or something by teasing everything I want out of life letting me get within arms reach to it only to yank it all away from me. I do not know what to do and it feels like I am going into a state of learned helplessness where no matter how hard I try to change my situation nothing comes of it. Its not even like I can take an extra semester boost my GPA as I well be done with all the courses needed for transfer by spring and I will be at their unit cap. I only have choices from the shitty UCs like Santa Cruz and Riverside to choose from but those schools at least for Santa Cruz sound like an awful idea because the people there intentionally take the easy professors and at a such a fast rate that it will ultimately be impossible for me to get a seat in those classes unless I intend to constantly refresh and reserve a seat as soon as registration for the new semester opens up that along with this aside by djistrka  https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD07xx/EWD714.html makes me already not looking forward to going there even though I know its highly unlikely I will get into a better university elsewhere.

I have had my girlfriend living with me at my dads house for a few years, we pay him rent and yet are still treated like house servants and involved in all his self worshipping dinner parties that spring up out of nowhere and I am suddenly involved in.

When my mother left he hung a noose from a lamp in the living room and frequently spoke to me about killing himself for hours on end, meaning me and my girlfriend are secluded to our bedroom to avoid having to talk to him.

I havent scratched the surface of the dream land that he lives in, where he has never done anything wrong. He blew up in a rage a few weeks ago and threatend to punch me.

I say my step-dad but he's been in my life ever since I was a year old and while I'm not super close to him I've always considered him my father. He lives about 2 hours away with my brother and sister but has been staying with me and my grandma for the holidays. His side of the family was having a big Christmas dinner tonight and he had a little too much to drink but nothing crazy and was planning on sobering up and driving my brother and sister back home (12 and 15 years old respectfully) the rest of the family convinced him to have my uncle drive him home and me bring my brother and sister back, which is what we ended up doing. In agreeing to do this however he decided since he had a ride home he was going to get absolutely hammered. 

For some background my mother died of liver problems related to alcohol a little under two years ago and this will be our second Christmas without her. He's been drinking pretty excessivley lately and I sort of understand because I know it's hard for him around the holidays with my mom not around but I also hate alcohol with a passion and what it has done to people that I care about. 

So anyways after they dropped him off he came inside and found his spare car keys and went and fell asleep in his car for whatever reason. We found him there and took his keys but decided to let him sleep it off because we couldn't wake him up. This was around 10pm or so. Around 3 hours later at 1am on fucking Christmas morning my 15 year old sister who has been worried sick, I might add is really worried and goes out to try to wake him up. At some point he woke up and decided to change into some work pants he found in his car and didn't have them buttoned so when she got him up he stumbled down the whole driveway and cut up his hand and one of his legs by falling into the street and managed to bleed enough to ruin the work pants. We got out there and carried him in and he went to sleep, I really wish this was the end but it isn't. 

During a lot of this my grandma was desperately trying to get stuff ready for Christmas morning and managed to lose 2 games that I bought for my brother and sister, this will be semi important later but I was a bit stressed because they were a large amount of what I got them and I was worried and was searching around a lot. Also during a lot of this her well intentioned worry kept making her freak out my sister with talk like ""check on your dad, that much alcohol can kill you""

So around an hour later my step-dad rolls out of bed and almost burns himself trying to smoke a cigarette and then decided he's going downstairs to change out of his bloody work pants and try to do laundry. At this point he can still barely stand up and my sister is basically begging him not to go down the stairs because he'll fall and blocking his way and he kept trying to get past her. While I'm trying to deal with this my grandma yells to me from her room and by the way she was yelling I thought something horrible was happening there too. Well, it turns out she found the games and was angry about my step-dad being up and decided to snap at me about how she found them and how all it took was me not harping on her, not knowing what was going on down the hall. 

I slammed her door for wasting my time but that random bit of aggression from her was enough to set me over the edge and I came back and shoved my step-dad away from the basement door and told him to go back to bed. This seemed to immediately sober him up a bit somehow because he stopped stumbling and he just kept yelling ""fuck you"" and ""how dare you lay a hand on me"" and him threatening to kick my ass and a bunch of other stuff that is all a blur now. I stood up to him and yelled back and told him if he keeps drinking like he was that the kids will end up without a mother or a father and me telling him that he was ruining Christmas and if he hit me I'd call the cops. More stuff was said but like I said it's all a blur. Of course all this is happening in full view of my brother and sister and they're understandably upset about it and he ended things by saying that he's leaving and taking the kids back home tomorrow after we open stuff in the morning. 

He sat in the living room after all this and after a bit I went out and apologised for shoving him and said I shouldn't have gotten angry but that it came from a place of worry and that I wouldn't have if I wasn't sure he was about to fall down the stairs. He said something along the lines of ""I'm a grown-ass man and I know how to walk down stairs."" When he said this I reminded him that I saw my mom fall down the stairs drunk on three separate occasions and all that led to was him getting grumpy, not angry at least but not great and accusing me of not respecting her, he also managed to double down on saying he was leaving after opening presents and I said that if that was what had to happen it was his choice. I left it at that and now he's asleep on the chair out there. 

I guess now it's a waiting game to see what happens in the morning, I'm hoping he was drunk enough that he won't remember or my apology sinks in a bit because seeing my brother and sister is pretty much the best part of my life right now and I'll miss them so much if he stops coming around but I understand if that's what needs to happen right now. He's not a bad guy but his grief is making him into someone that I don't even recognize right now and I'm really worried about him for both his sake and the sake of my brother and sister. 

I'm not even really sure what kind of advice to even ask for right now, I want him to stop drinking as much and be safer but for the moment I really am just hoping that I didn't just tear my whole family apart. I don't have much else at this point. ",25Dec2018,1

But I think my mother is worse - Actually, I know she is worse. She talks to herself, she sometimes says things like ‘You are the bad luck in this family’ or ‘Maybe it was better if you weren’t born at all, so we won’t have problems’ and sometimes she says she wants to kill herself, but she probably got that from my dad because he also mentions that he wants to die numerous times in the past 5 or so years in my life.

He tried talking to my mother about it but she screams and says shit like ‘I’m not crazy like you, I don’t need pills’ etc. I’ve mentioned religion, because every single argument circles about her religion and how God sent her to this world to a mission to save and help my father. I don’t know if that was a romantic gesture from God or her being batshit crazy. 

For Christmas, I decided to buy my mother a lovely bag and the regrettable mistake of buying an angel in a globe that lights up (I bought it cause she likes things that lights up). BUT NO, when she opened the present I notice something off about her reaction but she took it well at first. Then after a few hours, I fell asleep and woke back up to see my mother is watching a movie about Mother Mary (she watches the religion channel 24/7 which drives my father and I crazy) and when I went to her room, she said something like ‘The angel shouldn’t be isolated, I want to break it.’. I sometimes can’t handle her stupid suggestions so I argued why? It’s just an angle inside a globe. She says that I don’t know how to buy angels and it’s a set up because it’s a sign that I want her to be isolated!!!!  Obviously this isn’t a set up to get her isolated or some shit like that. She does this all the time where every little thing that happens she thinks it’s a sign that we are setting her up to something and even accuses us that we are recording her! 

She says I am wicked, my father is wicked, the whole family except her is wicked! She always say stuff like this and I don’t know what to do. I want to help her but I don’t know if I can. There is more crazy things she does but I just want to know if there anything I can do. Please.

Note: she also makes up her own words like ‘you’re being pokemon’ and no it’s not the whole franchise she is calling you, cause she doesn’t even know what Pokémon is.

186,"Hi, so I (21F) along with my dad(55M) and sister(25 F) have been living at my aunt’s house for 4 years now due to our financial situation. It has come to a point where it is too toxic to live here because we do most of the chores and my aunt has anger issues. She would nitpick every minor mistake and make a rant on it as long as she wants to, and she admits to herself of being a “grumpy” person. When not at work, all she does is literally sit on the couch and watch tv all night, while her son sits and plays pc games all day. His son (26 M) does not go to school nor have a job because he refuses to so all he does at home is eat, play games, and make a whole lot of mess in the house. We share with the expenses in the house and like I said do most of the chores which is infuriating because the mess never stops. 

We have lately been making a stand but it is not working since we do live under their roof, therefore under their rules. The problem that I have is that I DO want to move out but not with my dad and my sister. Which my sister also wants since she is 25 and would want to be independent and live by her own means too but my dad thinks that the three of us should move in on an apartment together. I love my dad but he thinks that I am not financially able to live on my own, he thinks I should only do it once I graduate college. I’ve done my calculations and that I am able to afford a student living apartment if I split it with my boyfriend but my dad detests it. I know that I am 21 and should be able to make my own decisions but if me and my sister leaves then my dad has nowhere to go and I don’t think he’ll be able to live on his own. We are immigrants and I’ve hinted to him that he should just go back home since he likes it there better because he doesn’t work as much as well as being treated like a maid here in my aunt’s house but does not like the idea. I am completely torn right now because I feel like I’m holding back my sister from having her own freedom because the only reason why she would stay with us is to help split the bill on the apartment. 

Me and my sister want to be independent but feel guilt-tripped if we do so. ",25Dec2018,1
187,"I (22f) worry that I am seriously dumb. My relationship is falling apart and I feel like I am the reason for it all. We got into a heated argument and he(25m) freaked at me and started calling me retarded and stupid and stating why he believes I am this way. How I can’t learn the simple things (like remembering how cribbage goes after he just taught me it all), and how he thinks I get frustrated when I try to learn something. He even said I might be autistic. This was really painful but it was something I always wondered about myself as well... I always felt abnormally stupid. Like I can’t handle simple instructions, or I just do things really stupidly. People I used to work with would say stuff like “are you sure you aren’t blonde?”...so I know he was clearly stating the truth while arguing with me :( I even think we may be breaking up, and this has been so hard. I always used to think my stupidness just comes from my depression and the lack of desire or interest i had to learn something new, due to the depression.. but now I’m just thinking there’s something truly wrong with me. My brain is obviously unhealthy or something. 
I do have a talent and that is with drawing, but that doesn’t mean anything really.. I have interests in science, and hope to go to college for information technology innovation and design. But I fear I am just too stupid and will fail. I asked my SO if he wishes he was with someone smarter; and his response was “it would be nice to be around someone who used their brain rather than depend on mine.”
I just feel so much self hate. I feel like an absolute waste of space and that I am truly unbelievable. 
I’ve always been depressed and that obviously doesn’t help.. I came from a really bad childhood. My mom was an addict and I had to go into foster care when I was 10. This made me depressed and I was always a bit weird... 
I’m a mom now, at the age of 22 to a 3 year old son. His dad is the person I’m with right now (and I feel like he just despises me cause I’m stupid)..
Idk what kind of advice I’m really asking for. But I just want to be a better person for my son, and maybe someone his dad can see something in again. I just want to be a positive person in my family’s life. And not this depressing, stupid, person who is not a joy to be around.. ",25Dec2018,1

189,"Alright, so this guy, (let's call him F) is just so confusing! I can't really describe his personality well, but he's a bit of a loner who doesn't really let any girls get close to him. (Besides the hot/cute girls lol) Hmm.., and I'd also say he's the shy type to anyone he finds attractive, but very lewd with boys. Last year, he gave me soo many signs he liked me. He was nervous around me, got upset when I talked about other boys, and stared at me. Like a lot. I also liked him too, so I never got the confidence to ask him out or anything. Our conversations never went anywhere because we were just too awkward. So a year later, my feelings started to drift away. F got seated with my best friend, and she told me he was always talking/joking about me, looking, and smiling at me. (In my other post you can see that she started liking him.) My best friend confessed that she liked him and after that I thought I had stopped liking him. Recently, she (I'll call her A) went on a date with him. She said that he was talking about other girls, including me and apparently saying hurtful things about me? (He's the type to make mean jokes like ""You're ugly"" or some shit lmaoo) (And that he finds me really hot... and can't help staring at me.) She also said he brought me up a lot. On the date he confessed to her but she blew it off bc she was nervous. We recently played video games and voice-called over Discord. He seemed kind of nervous and a few hours in he started asking me random questions such as ""What's your favorite \_\_\_?"" But he also asked if A could play with us and acted sad when I said she didn't have a keyboard atm, so she couldn't. (actually true lol) Was he trying to make me jealous or something? Once she joined our call, he suddenly got really quiet and didn't talk to me until she left. My friend thinks he's trying to make her jealous or either using her to get close with me.

This is really tame compared to all the other problems in this subreddit, but around a year ago I discovered a google chrome extension([https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk)) .

I got about halfway through before I realised I couldn't watch it at normal speed, I had to speed it up to 2x. This completely ruined the movie for me and now I realise I have a problem.

191,"Typing on mobile, so apologies for formatting. 

I live in a rented house with 3 other guys (one is my brother), a girl, and two dogs (border collie and husky) . We are all college students in the 20-23 age range and have jobs. Two of the guys and the girl went out of state to see family during the Christmas holidays along with the two dogs, while my brother and I stayed in state, since our family lives in the same city. 

I've been visiting family throughout the weekend before Christmas and rarely went to my house, while my brother stayed and worked his job. At around 1pm Sunday, after work, my brother decided to come hang out with the family for the day, and when he went back home around midnight, he noticed that all of the bedrooms were messy and our video game consoles were stolen along with controllers and a bunch of video games. The main things gone were two Xbox One consoles, one Playstation 4, and a Nintendo 3DS. It seems that they were able to unlock one of the sliding windows from the outside and go through. He immediately called me to come home and called the police.  I arrived with the police shortly afterwards, and we filed the report. The police looked around the took pictures, but not much was able to be done since the intruders were long gone. After the police had finished around 3am,  I went back to see family and my brother stayed at a friend's house since he felt uncomfortable sleeping there alone. We also had taken our computers and valuables with us in case they came back.  And they did.

My brother had work Monday and no one had been home since 3am when we left.  I decided to leave my family's house and stop by home depot to buy some window locks and blackout curtains,  and came home at around 1pm to install them, when I noticed more things were missing. But this time they smashed some things in the house looking for valuables. They were able to find and take my brothers $1,300 camera that he forgot and took down my roommates TV off his wall mount. I continued to install the window locks and called the police again to add onto the police report. They arrived and looked around once more, but not much was done again.

I'm now staying at my house again with my brother and don't really know what to do, and I gotta say I don't feel safe. I'm considering buying a gun and installing fake cameras around the house. We are struggling college students and don't really have a budget for nice security systems. So what should I do? Has anyone had similar experiences? My roommates should be back in about a week and I've told them everything that has been going on. 

Tl;dr
Roommates went out of state for the holidays leaving my brother and I home alone.  While visiting our family and working, our house was broken into with things stolen. The next day while planning on installing security precautions, our house was broken into again with more things stolen. I installed window locks and blackout curtains,  but I still don't feel safe. What should I do?",25Dec2018,1
192,"Sorry if this isn't allowed but my heart really went out to someone who posted about 20 minutes ago about her boyfriend. I wrote a reply but you got cold feet and removed your post. 

Your boyfriend is a giant ass hole.

It is entirely possible you have a hard time processing information or retaining it- many people do! ADD/ADHD are incredibly common and could be one of many things that might be making it hard for you (or not! You very well might be totally in the normal range and just surrounded by emotionally challenged assholes!)

You do not hold your SO to the highest standard in your skill set (you would not think less of him for being poor at drawing for example) and the way he treated you was completely unacceptable. 

I have a terrible memory and a hard time remembering rules when playing games. My husband is a brilliant man with the ability to retain and regurgitate information as well as a computer (I often call him ""Bing"" because although he knows everything he often gives me a random answer and not what I am looking for)

We are both college educated. I went the science track (it was really hard with poor memory! 😫) And worked hard to graduate. At the same time my husband often has to tell me directions to get somewhere several times and I will still forget.

You should not let anyone speak to you that way and your bf should be the last person in the world to say something like that. It is one thing to be frustrated but he took it too far and unless he has never done this before and is insanely self reflective and apologetic along with getting some professional anger management help then you should boot him.",25Dec2018,1
193,"So here's my situation. I live in a small town and there are no jobs hiring within walking distance. I live with my mom and she only receives money from a disability check. Problem is, unless I get a job or begin classes in less than a month she will lose her disability, food stamps, HUD housing, everything. We will be forced to live on the streets (which would kill her since she needs her oxygen machine just to live) or move back in with my abusive father. I would rather kill myself than let that happen.

Anyways, I need a car to get to classes. I can't rely on any family, friends, or neighbors to take me either. I've been banking on student loans to get a car, but many will not allow freshmen to receive their loans until enough time is spent at school. I'm not sure a bank loan would be possible either due to my mother's bad credit, and my lacking of any credit.

What should we do? I need to be able to get to classes before less than a month from now or we lose everything, but it seems like any opportunity we are handed just turns out to be false hope.",25Dec2018,1
194,"Ever since I was a kid, I've always viewed wanting something or expecting something as a bad thing. Every time someone else says they want something (not wanting something from me, just that they want this particular thing), I see it as them being unreasonable, even if what they want is alright. Because of that, I've always avoided saying that I want to do this or I hope this happens, because I just find it weird to want things to happen. 

I never really hang out with friends and family or even do something fun on my own and most of the times, I'm usually distancing myself from events and going out, spending on cool stuff and other things, and the only times I really get new stuff is when my parents insist me to get this thing or when it's a gift. 


I really like games, and I watch videos on YouTube on them all the time, but when it comes to actually getting one so I can play it myself, I see it as a superfluous thing to get, and I don't buy it. It's the same thing with spending on food and other items, I buy them when it's absolutely necessary and I know that sounds like a good thing, right, to not spend on frivolous things but when I really think about it, they're not that unreasonable, they're just fine and I think if I like a certain thing, I should try and do that but then I just ignore that, saying it's not worth it.

(I know it sounds like I'm just trying to save money, which I'm not but it's an actual concern of mine as I can't tell if I'm just really selfish or weird or anything normal. I see my friends buying stuff and visiting places but I just think that doing that is completely unnecessary even when it's normal to do those things.)

I'm in college, right now in Christmas Break. Starting on the 7th of January I will have my first exam. I'm in Romania, studying Electronics, Telecommunications and the Technology of Information in Foreign Languages (English). I'm pretty good at Programming languages and Operating Systems, and I think I could do well at Electronics but that's not my problem.

My problems are mathematics and chemistry. I have two Math courses, Linear Algebra and Calculus + Chemistry. None of those tick with me. I can't understand them. I forced myself to learn for the midterm exam, but I just can't understand them no matter how much I try. Chemistry requires a lot of nerding and learning things like a parrot while math just kills me with a combination of me not getting it and the professors not speaking good english.,

OFC, while I'm good at operating systems and programming, I still have a lot to learn. I can learn, but that's still a time sink.


My parrents have problems which don't really help. My father is an alcoholic and my mother a strict capitalist which sees me as an investment. IF i fail my exams, I'll be in a lot of trouble

I'm not fit, So i can't lift heavy weight. I haven't yet to work, I got all my money from grants and proofreading.

In my free time, I'm really not a STEM guy. I like to read, I like to debate, I like political thought and philosophy (Lucian Blaga being my favorite). I am also currently writing a play and a sci-fi book.
I'm also a good actor, but never played in any official play or took any real courses. Overall, I'm also a bit charismatic and I have plans of founding my own Student Association and Political Party.

He had asked me what I looked for in a guy and i told him I just like when guys are easy to talk to. We both mutually agreed we didn’t want anything serious and to be honest I wasn’t even interested cus I wasn’t looking for anything at all and I told him that. But he kept flirting with me and being persistent and eventually I gave in. We started hooking up. I’m a pretty deep person and I tried to have more meaningful conversation with him (over snap) but he’s just kind of weird with it. I don’t know how to explain. In person he’s okay.

Now the only thing is I caught feelings in the middle and brought it up to him but he made it clear that he doesn’t want a relationship right now. I know it was stupid but I said okay and continued hooking up with him.

So yesterday, I was minding my own business and trying to figure out what I’m going to do next year since there’s only a few days left until 2019.  Just to give a glimpse of my situation, I’m currently unemployed and don’t have enough money to study. I was in university for a year and due to multiple complicated reasons that I prefer not to share, I was sent home again. 

Long story short, I am just staying in all day with zero interaction with other people other than my family. I would go out but there really is nowhere to go in this small ass town that I live in. I got a part time job for 2 months but I quit because it felt like the job was making me even more miserable. The isolation is enough to drive me crazy but to make matters worse, I had to put up with my mother’s stubborn, self-righteous, nosey, judgemental, and controlling attitude. 

She treats me like a child and doesn’t understand that I value my privacy. She subconsciously uses reverse psychology to get what she wants me to do. She expects me to follow everything that she raised me up to be and if I ever had a different opinion from hers, she will call me rebellious and compare me to her friends’ daughters, etc. The worst part is that she fucking nags and repeat the same shit over and over and it felt like she’s forcing you to do it or the nagging never stops. I tried talking to her nicely but she always hits a raw nerve and it always end up in a verbal arguement. I grew so tired of it and a few weeks ago, I tried to avoid any confliction. I am so so tired of the arguements but she WOULD NOT stop bothering me. She would say out loud that she has a very disrespecting daughter in front of my family members, and basically talk shit about me. She doesn’t consider other people’s feelings and fails to see how her words would trigger someone to get upset.  

I guess she saw that it was xmas eve yesterday so she came into my room and tried to have a talk with me (her talking bullshit and trying to force her values and religious views on me again). It was pretty obvious what happened next but I never expected myself to break down in front of her. I really couldn’t stand it anymore. I cried in despair and told her I get a lot of negative thoughts from her being this way but she brushed it off and fucking LAUGHED, said I was crying for ATTENTION. I spend the night crying to myself and wishing I was strong enough to have an overdose and die. 

I feel so stuck and depressed. I doubt I could survive next year and get out mentally sane. I want to move far away alone but I’m still desperately planning on how to earn money. I haven’t been out in the society much and I’m scared of getting cheated as well.  I would like to live and get a job overseas but it’s probably very hard and without any qualifications, I doubt anyone will hire me. I’m sorry for this to turn out into such a long text.

I have been invited to a birthday party at the end of January where many of these people will be in attendance and I’m not sure whether I should act like there’s no problem, attend the party and just say my goodbyes normally before moving away less than two weeks later or should I avoid these people and not attend. I don’t particularly want to go the party but it will be the last time that I’ll see these people for a while and I feel like it would be courteous to go as it is for a birthday.

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated. Part of me also thinks that I’m overreacting and this is typical teenage drama so if I am please let me know that too. ",25Dec2018,1
210,"So the last 4 years have been pretty rough, I moved high schools to an all boys school a little more than half way through my first year.

 The second year i ended up doing fuckall in school, before this year I was actually pretty geeky and was a good boy who went to class but in year 10 (second high school year) I skipped the options that I'd pick and I would end up just going home on them. 

I would hang out with the methheads, hory white kids and juveniles. I was in a one classroom core class where we learned different things to mainstream, we would basically just mix all the subjects into one, we would do a lot of presentations. Looking back I should have just gone to mainstream and regret being in that class. 

Third year I went to mainstream classes, got kicked out of one of my options for having a rage at a couple other students and the teacher in the middle of class. I ended up failing that year and dropped out at the end.

 Half way through my second year I started to get bullied due to my additude since my home life got real shit. My home life was shit, I decided to move to my dads when I was in 14 and everything from there went to shit. After some massive commotion I ended up getting kicked out at 15 and have been drifting pretty much ever since.

 Mentally this took a toll on me and I ended up making very dumb decisions, like dropping out of school, binge drinking and smoking, doing illegal shit, and self harm. It got so bad that just before my 17th birthday I planned to commit suicide one night when I was sleeping on a family friends couch. Obviously I didnt end up going through with it though and since then I have been slowly getting better. 

The only thing I have now is extreme regret and realization that I could have done a lot better. I ended up getting my nceas and got a trade. But I keep thinking about how I could have done better and idk how to get over all this regret. ",25Dec2018,1
211,"My (20F) dad spoils me with gifts throughout the year. I don’t have much money, but that doesn’t mean I want expensive, luxurious items. This Christmas he bought me an apple watch and airpods - which I never asked for and never would. He didn’t even give me the chance to give him my wish list, which was an assortment of practical and inexpensive items I would absolutely use. I work as a cashier and he suggested I use them at work. What he didn’t think of is that 1. I don’t want to bring them to work, I’ll feel guilty and like I’m bragging by using such expensive items around my coworkers who, like myself, are not very wealthy.   2. They’d either get stolen or I’d lose them. Im very forgetful and I’ve had my phone stolen at work before, so I’m sure a fancy watch would make me a big target.
 
What am i supposed to do? i feel guilty about keeping it when i have no use for it.

215,"I know this girl who is getting married and she asked me to be the maid of honor after only knowing her for a year. 

All was well at first, until I realized why she didn’t have any other friends to ask. I’m the only one in the bridal party. 

She quickly became overbearing with trying to be best friends, saying how asking me to be her m.o.h was suppose to make us close. I have major depressive disorder and anxiety and I’m not just going to want to go out on a whim when I’m feeling blue, but she really doesn’t respect when I say no and constantly tries to get me to do things after I say no. She has depression too which I thought would let her understand but if anything she uses her “understanding” as a way to basically undermine my feelings. She basically told me that I was using it as an excuse to not hangout with her. It takes a lot for me to want to go do things, and she lives a little far away so it’s even harder. 

One time she went off on me for no reason after I just didn’t feel like talking. Saying how I was selfish and wasn’t trying to be a friend. In truth her behavior was off putting and I didn’t want to basically be her second boyfriend, as she constantly texts me and responds almost instantaneously. 

Another time she kinda didn’t follow boundaries at a party my roommate was throwing and showed up almost 45min to hour early claiming she had to use the bathroom in order to come in and I really didn’t like that. 

I feel really really bad about not wanting to be her maid of honor, especially because she has literally zero other friends and I don’t want her to feel sad. But lately I’ve just felt uncomfortable with the idea, but have no idea how to bring it up to her or if it’s selfish to back out of it. ",25Dec2018,1

I get socialization through work and a sports team (though due to increasing work load, this has been dropping off!), and while we have a few friends in the area we don't hang out with them too much. My SO has been dealing with increasing social anxiety, likely elevated because we don't get out that much (and his work group is extremely small), and I have been reading/hearing that group-based hobbies can help with confidence and social anxiety. However,  his hobbies (i.e. running, reading, etc) tend to be more individual, and more enjoyable when he can do them by himself.

Second, im feeling down cause im very ambitious and yet im not sure what my career path or what to do. 

Background story: 26yr old from NJ make 56k and has a side business. 0 debt and live with family.  Commute 3hrs total per day cause parking is too expensive and not moving close to work as i dont like the job or plan on staying there longer than this july. It has nothing to do with finance and im feeling left behind.  I don't know what i am passionate about but i do like real estate and business. I have been applying for months and redoing my resume. I feel stuck as i see others are moving towards the direction i want and im getting down on myself. 

Im not sure if i should do the following,

1. Try to find a better job but if not take 6 months to travel asia.
2. Keep applying and wait till i purchase a rental in Philadelphia god willing in 6 months. Or less

I want a house well a 3 family house to live out rent free as ill be renting out the units to cover cost. I know this is like a side job as well and risk but im good with that. I want something in finance but dont know what that is as my thought in college was just to get a degree as a backup. I would focus on businesses and making them. J see now that i should find / start roots of my career and manage to do both.

226,"I'm using a throwaway account for personal reasons. Sorry if this post is messy, I'm just writing as I go at the moment.

I'm an eighteen year old girl, in case my age has anything to do with it. I'm going through a rough patch in life, in a month or so, my exam results will be released and what I get will dictate my future but I'm not confident that I'll get good or even average results.

I took a science pathway as it was the most common route but frankly, I'm not particularly interested in anything science related. I don't want to be a doctor or a pharmacist or a surgeon, nothing related to the medical field at all. I just felt pressured to take sciences as at the time, I didn't know what I wanted to be. Even now, I don't know what it is I want to do in this life.

I'm scared because I don't want my parents to feel disappointed in me and I don't want to be a failure in their eyes. I have always been the one sibling that always lacks when it comes to studying whereas both my older and younger siblings excel in them. I ultimately took the subjects that I thought would please them but what's the use of that if my grades are horrible to begin with?

The only thing I feel I'm good at is writing - it's my escape from reality, in a sense. Where I live, it's quite hard to find a job much less survive as an author so I cut off that dream in order to obtain something more realistic. Looking around, I feel envious of those who know what they want to be and those who have a goal set in mind.

I have a lot going on through my head and I really hate it. I know its my life and I should do things that make me happy but this life was also given to me by my parents, whom I wholeheartedly love and appreciate. My parents aren't bad people and I know they're harsh on me when it comes to studies but I do genuinely believe it is out of love.

So here comes the question. As of now, since my mind is a mess - I'm not sure what it is I should be doing. Is it too late for me to start over and find what it that I truly want to do? Should I tell my parents what I'm feeling or should I continue staying silent? What should I do to find even an ounce of motivation in this life of mine?

I'm really sorry if this entire post is nonsensical or if I seemed entitled in any way, I don't mean to offend anyone and if I did, I truly am sorry. 

I hope that everyone that took the time to read this genuinely had a good day and a good year to come.

This year, 5 years later, I transferred to his school, partly in the hope of finding him but also due to the fact that it is a good school... but I discovered that he had already left. 

Like me, he apparently had a pretty rough time in secondary school so he left as soon as he could.

I really want to find him but I have no idea how to - since he doesn’t have social media and he didn’t have any friends. I know his father worked at a university nearby but that might be unprofessional and creepy, plus I’m not sure if he still works there.

For all I know he could have no interest in knowing me and we may have both changed too much to still be friends. I also think I’d be heartbroken if it all went wrong since I’ve never been good at making friends and he was my only true friend.

After I quit, I was without work for 3 months which obviously has become a financial burden now.

My older brother has struggled with drug addiction on and off for over ten years aside depression and bipolar disorder. My mom blames herself for everything. We were all homeschooled, and, despite it being a healthy learning environment and allowing us to get accepted to our top schools, she will blame herself for homeschooling him because she believes it was his downfall (which isn’t true).

If something goes wrong even moderately, my mom takes the blame upon herself. Sometimes it’s genuine, sometimes I can tell she takes the blame to get pity. But in terms of my brother, the blame she felt was definitely real. She’s also struggled with depression herself, and a few winters ago she was also suicidal or at least having suicidal ideation.

My best friend (girl) of almost 5 years now is in a relationship with a guy ( 4 years now) that became one of my closest friends though the interaction we have had over the years. Lately he had suspected that his girlfriend had not told him everything that he needed to know and asked her to tell him everything that he did not know yet.

One of the things he did not know was that before they met, I had made out during a party with my best friend. After that we once shared a shower together but nothing happened. After that we just left it at that and became best friends. Then when she met him I helped them get together. My best friend was worried because at the time he was a virgin and she was scared that he would leave her after a while to see what other flavours are out there.

After finding out, that we kissed and showered together he got furious at me and he decided to cut me out of his life.

Now i'm wondering what I did wrong. In my opinion that information was not mine to tell... Had I told it at the beginning of their relationship when I did not yet know him, would it not have seemed like I was trying to sabotage the relationship? Also had I told him one year in to the friendship would I not risk breaking them up? I mean I understand that knowing this so late sucks.. and that he is wondering why I never told him, but to cut me out of his life, one of his best friends for something that happened before they met and what I thought she would have already told him...

He thinks I’m condescending and think the worst of him and what not. But I assure you not once has anything I said come from a place to hurt or ridicule him. I just say stuff jokingly but he is convinced otherwise.

Called him and asked him to bail me out bc I realised I didn’t want to be here and I acted in haste. He was pissed but we got over that sort of. But things were never the same.

I have some learning difficulties which has prevented me from getting a better education I have 2 GCSEs. I went to my cousins house for Christmas eve who is 35. He is an entrepreneur with a really nice house and family. I  really want to change my life because I'm scared of being a loser 30 year old working in a fast food chain. What should I do to go forward with my life?,25Dec2018,1
243,"Okay so I used to smoke a lot of weed. Still occasionally do, but I'm not the pothead I was in my early 20's.

Anyways. I'm home for the holidays. I'm staying in my younger sister's (she still lives at home) room and, while doing laundry, I left some wet socks in her room. Well, the socks soured and smelled up the room. My sister came in and said ""Did you smoke pot in my room?""

Now, I will say, the way I reacted was uncalled for: I blew up at her, saying how the fuck could I have smuggled weed on a plane, that she was insulting my intelligence she could've used some common sense... and she ran downstairs and went to my mom for comfort.

I ran downstairs to try to immediately apologize, but already my mom is already saying that I'm lying, that I really did smoke pot and got it from my other sister, who still lives at home and has drug problems (she doesn't just smoke weed, hence why she lives at home... to keep watch over her). My mom is sobbing, saying she's been lied to all her life by her husband (my parents JUST got divorced, the ink isn't even dry) and that my angry reaction toward my little sister was a sign that I was, to quote Shakespeare, ""protesting too much"" so it was obvious that I had smoked pot with my other sister in my youngest sister's room and she can't trust me.

Exacerbating the situation is that both my dad, my middle sister, and myself all are bipolar, and while I can handle my smoke (3.8 GPA, can hold down a job, keep up with rent, bills, and keeping house clean, only use it as a treat for special occasions), I recognize that many people with bipolar disorder cannot: that includes my father. My father goes psycho, and my mother is convinced anyone who has bipolar disorder will have psychotic episodes just like he does (she does not take into account the fact that he drinks alcohol, I do not).

Then she did something that I am emotionally wounded from: she said I was ""turning out just like your father."" My father is a MONSTER who beat us all, was an alcoholic, and would explode into unexplained, unprovoked rages at any given moment. He is a narcissistic alcoholic cokehead with serious anger issues (since the divorce he's texted me death threats and shit like that.... good thing I live cross-country!).

I've been stuck in an awkward holiday situation where my mom thinks I'm lying to her that I had procured weed from my middle sister and have been smoking the whole holidays. I understand she's traumatized by my dad's inability to control his own cannabis use and that she JUST got through going through a divorce, but if it hadn't been for my other relatives, this would've been a terrible Christmas. And yes, last night, before we went to bed, she said ""I still need to talk to you again about you smoking pot in my house before you leave to go back home.""

What should I do/say? It hurt so much to hear her compare me to my father, and she is completely convinced I did drugs under her roof. She sobs about it because she's so hurt that I've ""become a liar just like him."" I'm at my wits end trying to convince a traumatized woman that I didn't do what she thinks I did and that I'm not ""becoming"" the monster my father was (the latter is what hurts the most).",25Dec2018,1

247,"I know that it’s coming from a place of insecurity. But it’s the strangest thing to really insult someone about. 

Someone at one of my old jobs, who had no voice or expression commented on how I had a monotone and that if there was a fire in the building, I’d express it in such a bland way.  

His voice isn’t any better and he knows this. It was awkward as hell cause I didn’t even know this guy too well. 

Last night someone commented on how I said Merry Christmas in a bland way? I’m definitely not insecure about it. And his voice also doesn’t sound too nice either. It’s just uncomfortable knowing that people are hanging on to the sound of my voice and overthinking it. 

It doesn’t cross my mind to comment on anyone else’s voice. I feel like that’s something really personal to comment on. 

Anyway. Could I get some insight into why these people are commenting on something so strange? Is it really insecurity? I really don’t comment on things I’m insecure about. I feel like it’s just obvious if that occurs. ",25Dec2018,1
248,I’m 15 and ever since January 23rd this year I’ve been wanting a pc. So I told my mum that and she said okay she’ll save up money so I could get it by the end of the year. So after waking up today and realized I got nothing. Literally nothing. She got my sister a perfume set for €370. She did give me €100 on December 12th because I had to go to turkey with my dad for 3 days. I only spent €13 of that 100. But anyway she told me that €100 was my present which I don’t want to believe. I wanted the pc all year even saved up money for my own monitor for it. She said she’ll get me the pc during summer which I know is a lie. How should I go about this? Didn’t even get me flowers or anything!!!,25Dec2018,1
249,"Recently I have been trying sleep hypnosis videos on YouTube for confidence, positive mind set and other things that would benefit anyone’s mind.

I’ve always been a confident person but I wanted to see whether I could improve this more, just to see if it works and of course if it works I may continue to use sleep hypnosis to better myself.

My inspiration came from a video that stated that the first 7 years of your life are where you learn subconscious behaviour traits and that you can re-tune certain things into your subconscious through sleep hypnosis.

To summarise I just want to know whether others have stories of their experiences with sleep hypnosis and whether headphones are essential for it to work(i don’t currently wear headphones to do so, I play it from my laptop out loud).

251,"Hey, this is my first proper reddit post ever and there's no one I can talk to so I thought I should post here and let someone know before I finally snap.

I don't know whats wrong with me there's just so many things I don't know where to start. 

I feel so sad and lonely all the time, I'm under 18 and already getting like only 6-7 hours of sleep every single day (is it anxiety? I don't know), ugly lines are starting to become sharper on my face each day and I feel disgusted every time I look in the mirror.

Every time I wake up I go on my phone and keep surfing reddit or youtube endlessly until my phone runs out of charge because I have nothing to look forward to for that day.
I dont know why exactly I do it but I think its to overwhelm myself enough so that the negative thoughts dont reach me.

Im on Christmas break right now and I feel so useless, all I do every day is sit on my computer for hours, I used to play games with my friends but its slowly starting to decrease and instead I'm beginning to browse youtube/reddit more and more by myself, alone.

Over the past few months I've been finding it harder and harder to connect with people. When people I'm supposed to love tell me what they've been up to or how they're feeling, I have to struggle to focus and actually care. I just joke around with friends at a superficial level now and its been so long since we've spoken about something deeper. I'm just the joker in the friend group, we chill at school but they only go out with each other and never ask me. Im sure they still care but I subconciously put a confident, funny and outgoing 'mask' on whenever I go outside so I guess it doesnt feel like theres something wrong with me. I am so scared whenever someone asks me if I am alright. 

I just feel like if I disappeared right now everyone including my parents (who are great, don't get me wrong) wouldn't miss me.

Every day I tell myself that Im going to put myself out there and become a better person but I just cant, my motivation is at rock bottom. It's pathetic, I can't even get myself to watch a movie as I rot away in my room because two hours is too much commitment.

I've had a few girlfriends and all have left me for more or less the same reason. This has not been directly said because obviously it's rude but what I've gathered is that I'm fun and great for the first few weeks/months and then it just gets boring... Probably due to lack of doing new things together or the lack of deeper conversations.

To add salt to the wound I also have unnecessarily high expectations, second place is failure to me and I just can't stand being mediocre, even though from what you've read so far, you can see that I'm not even THAT. I've had this mindset for as long as I can remember, I doubt it can be changed. Always wanting to be better is probably the one quality I like about myself I guess.

It's so hard for me to do things I just want to cry forever and ever... I've been going to the gym for 6 months now and even after all this time it hasn't become a habit and I have to DRAG myself out of the house using all my mental strength.

I can't focus on anything, I keep daydreaming even during exams and I keep having an internal monologue going inside my head that won't shut up. Every time I go out I go up and down the stairs about five times because I've always forgotten something. Sometimes I forget what I want to get DURING those few seconds it takes to walk up the stairs.

I hate myself so much and I regularly have thoughts about killing myself, but I'm so unmotivated that I won't. 

If you've read this far thank you so so much I've just spilled out my heart. Typing this up has brought tears to my eyes.

Please help me. 
What should I do?

TLDR: I can't sleep and it's horrible + each day is becoming me trying to distract myself from something (I don't know what exactly) and I'm wasting away my youth as I do so. What do I do?

PS - If you somehow know who I am IRL, please act like you've never read this post ;)

I talk to him a lot and its pretty much the only thing that keeps me going. Every time I visit him I have fun but it stresses me out when I see his wife around because she is very attractive and it makes me feel horrible because I have never had a girlfriend and I am a virgin.

If I stop talking to him I will be completely alone and probably even worse off. I don't know if I am having anxiety or paranoia or if I am justified in feeling horrible. Maybe I am jealous.

262,"To understand the situation you might need bit backstory.
  
Basically many years ago my family lived in quite big house. To fill space in library and get me started with piano lessons my dad bought us a huge traditional piano, very expensive at that time. Eventually we moved away to a smaller house where didn’t have extra library and space for the piano, so we temporarily moved it to my mother’s parents place.  
  
Years go by, my parents split up, piano stays at corner of my grandparents house unplayed and not taken care of.  
Last year I picked up playing piano again and asked my dad about the status of the piano. He promised that the piano was mine and my mom’s parents (whom I’m not much in contact with) were also fine with me taking it since they don’t care for it and nobody uses it. I didn’t have space in my current apartment so I told my grandma I’d get it once I would - since my current one’s lease ends 2019 and I can get a place where it fits to.  
  
The thing is, today I recieved a message from my cousin (around 20M I think, if not little younger) who asked me if he could get or buy the piano from me. Now I don’t know what’s gone down there (since he hasn’t ever played piano so far and he is pretty much on daily contact with the grandparents where as I am not), but suddenly he really is asking for me to give or sell it to him.  
  
Now I’m not sure what to do. I feel like not wanting to give it away or sell it would be extremely selfish or unfair since I can’t get it back for myself until next year at earliest, but then again if I would sell it or give it to my cousin, I would regardless need to buy a new piano next year when I do get the space for it - and I most definitely would not be able to afford to another very good traditional piano, which the piano in question is.  
  
So, I’m asking for an objective opinion. Should I sell it/give it away to my cousin? Is it selfish and mean for me to not wanting to do that? How do I go on about this?",25Dec2018,1
263,"Some context here, I’m currently 16, and when I was younger I was really sociable, I had alot of friends and hung out alot. 

Fast forward to when I was 11, my uncle gave me his old Xbox 360 and from there, I was completely addicted to video games. My addiction was so bad that I would play the whole damn day and not even shower. For 3 whole years I prioritised video games over friends and had no real close friends until I was 14. 

I got really quiet and unsociable but since the start of this year I’ve started to stray away from playing video games and recently started to stray from watching anime. I made quite alot of friends in school this year but I still have no best friend or close friends. I thought I had overcomed my anti-social self until I’ve recently got a part-time job and I was so afraid of speaking with my other co-workers even though most of them are my age. I never really realized how bad it was until one of my co-workers told me this: “you know all these days you’ve been here, I’ve never actually heard you speak.” 

I really don’t want to continue my life like this and I really don’t know how to overcome this.

264,"A little background of the situation: I am currently in the final year of my degree, and I am undergoing my final year project, which spans for two semesters long. I will have to submit my FYP by the end of August, which would be the end of my degree. So, in two more semesters, I will be graduating from my Computer Science course. However, my FYP revolves around the use of microcontrollers, which are electronics-based and I have zero experience in them. Thus, I would have to spend some time to learn about it to ultimately complete my project.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next semester, which is on January, I will be starting my internship programme (which is a compulsory module for students to graduate) which spans 12 weeks, ending late March. For my internship, I will have to learn to use the company's development tools, and have plans to do my FYP during the evenings after my work shift in the morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, a friend of mine suggested a potential client who requested a web system to be built for them. It uses the same framework as what I've created so far with my FYP. I thought heck, why not just take it on? After going through a number of meetings to clarify their requirements, it seems to be a pretty heavy system. It also doesn't help that the deadline given is by the end of February. I then started to have doubts about whether I can actually put myself under the immense pressure of juggling so many things within such a short amount of time.

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is, is it realistic to try and juggle so many things at once? I believe this is doable but I would have little to no social life by cramping every single day trying to complete all three things at once. The pay of the job opportunity is lucrative, but it would mean risking the progress of both my internship and FYP. I once thought that by putting myself under this kind of condition, I would learn to adapt and progress better to deal with a heavy workload.

We’ve revealed super deep and personal things about one another and I feel like I fall into the same trap I always fall with around people.

  I’m disappointed because she didn’t act the way I expected her to act... and that’s how I am with everyone... and then I thought to myself “should we even be friends?”. For example when we were playing a game and she lost she freaked out... ignored me for ten minutes. and then said it was because her parents thinks she is dumb. I tried my very hardest to comfort her and make her feel good because I wanted her to be happy... and I thought that’s what a friend should be doing. I told her about how my parents would make fun of me and call me flat chested so she wouldn’t feel less alone... she laughed.. she thought it was hilarious... and then I revealed to her a very deep and personal thing that is very hard to talk about and she literally said “I appreciate that you trust me enough to tell me that... now answer my question hoe” ... and she asked me a question about herself... and I just felt... empty.

267,"Just wanted to let you know I am thinking of you! I’m sorry you were let down by your birthday. I also am sorry I wasn’t the greatest and most supportive because I let some of my anxieties get the best of me. Also, I suck at talking feelings in real life most of the time so I prefer to write them. 

People forget stuff unless they get reminded and of course it feels stupid reminding someone of your birthday. I don’t blame you for being hurt. Also you’re right. It’s a busy time of year and people tend to be busy with other things. But it doesn’t mean people care less about you if they don’t wish you a happy birthday. There are plenty of other ways to show they care and I’m sure they’d feel actually pretty bad that they didn’t tell you happy birthday on your actual birthday if they knew. 

Plus, you’re going through some hard stuff right now in other areas in your life. Take what happens right now as a learning opportunity or whatever positive thing you can take or learn from this experience. It’s so easy for me to say but much harder to do. 

Don’t be down. I know it’s easy for me to say but for real. You have so much going for you. You’re a super cool and interesting person who makes me laugh and makes me want to explore new things. I know you’re scared you are thirty and that is very normal. But, it can either be a damper on your life or something to see as a challenge to make this decade your best one yet. You’ve never been as smart or as mature as you are today and you’ll only get better with age. Like a fine wine lol. 

Again, I wanted to say I’m sorry I made some (lots) of our chat about me and me being butthurt. I just needed reassurance and I am sorry I didn’t give you the same when you needed it. And I suck at bringing feelings up and used that at a chance to do that. Not fair to you. I’m sorry. 

You’re great. I am happy you’re a part of my life and that I met you. You have people who care about you a lot and that’s better than having lots of sort of friends wish you happy birthday who don’t do shit for you the other 364 days of the year. I am sorry I didn’t fully support you 100 percent today. I hope you forgive me and I hope you have a very, very good Christmas Day. 💋

When I was a kid my family wasn’t rich, we couldn’t afford much other than necessities, once in a while we could buy something nice, I saw my dad working really hard in a factory and putting sweat and tears into feeding us, so I learned to value money and hard work, never demanding my parents buy me things and even when relatives gave me money for my birthday I gave it to my family because I wanted to help them. 

Fast forward to these days, my family is pretty established, we have money, we all are business owners and we live comfortably, my parents are separated now so my brother lives without a father as he’s busy at work and doesn’t visit frequently, but provides us with money and buys us pretty much anything we want. 
My brother is a shitty kid who thinks money grows on trees now, he’s in 3rd grade and all he’s interested is playing fortnite or pubg all day long, he can’t even read properly, he demands things he bought for him because “daddy is rich, he has money”, he doesn’t want to read books, doesn’t care about education. 

I’m worried he’ll grow up to being an idiot that doesn’t value hard work and ending up being an over entitled douche type of guy...

While in college i became a legitimate drug addict w/weed - i have not gone more than a couple months in the last 7-8 years with not smoking weed - i get really depressed/unsatisfied/have bad impulse control and just end up smoking to get relief/escape as i have a very overactive/overthinking mind and anxiety (i take anti-anxiety meds and have done a significant amount of therapy since childhood)

While in college i never really made too many close friends besides the girlfriend and smoking buddies, part of this was that i had a really close group of friends from high school that i was friends with - after the girlfriend broke up with me and i moved back home and had a falling out with these friends due to me being such a mess emotionally and then deciding they no longer wanted to be my friend - this has hurt emotionally/ego-wise that people who used to be my friends want nothing to do with me. It also hurts with girls because i don’t get invited to do social stuff anymore where i have the chance to meet girls (not that i was that great ever with girls)

The other element to add is that I’ve had multiple good jobs and quit them (don’t know if i can do this again without permanently ruining my resume) because i was so unhappy and put myself into treatment for the weed/depression, but I’m currently in relapse as i spent the pst few weeks smoking just to escape - I’m a mess. I need to make friends i need to find hobbies i need to get laid as it feels like such a long time and feel like I’m missing out on young people fun sex stuff adult life is coming too fast and I’m 10 years I’ll be 37 and that feels too old. 

I’ve also gained a lot of weight from smoking and binge eating - i have matches on dating apps but I feel to unconfident and unattractive (my photos i look skinnier)

I also have no idea what i want to do career-wise (i know this is a first world problem and won’t garner any sympathy) but i was also raised well-off so i have this complex about wanting to make enough money to afford to live where i grew up - but i also know money won’t make me happy - so i struggle with the idea of working my ass off 12 hours per day to be some finance guy and achieve my financial goals at the expense of being able to take care of my loneliness/happiness (again i know i sounds like a bitch/spoiled brat, pussy snowflake) but what I’ve written above is what’s going on in my life and it affects my happiness on a daily basis - any advice/help untangling this mess and helping me achieve clarity/plan of attack/happiness would be so appreciated. Thank you!

I can’t seem to settle into routines either, i get too bored/life feels too mundane - like I’m supposed to wake up and meditate every day, but instead i wake up and just scroll thru bullshit on my phone and get myself to do it and be disciplined - maybe i have really bad add as evidenced by the format of this post?",25Dec2018,1
272,"I recently began work in a warehouse. I try to be nice to everyone I meet. Yesterday, as I was leaving the warehouse, a co worker asked whether I drive. I was honest and told him I do, and then he asked me to drop him off. I told him I don't go in the direction in which he wants me to drop him off to some train station. Then he starts telling me that he will only clock out if I drop him off, I said okay. I waited a minute and then headed outside and literally drove off. The reason I did that is because I feel he would make a habit of it if I  gave him a ride. I am not good at making excuses and being dishonest. But now I made the situation worse by just leaving him there. I want to continue to work, but I would have to make an excuse as I just left him there. The honest truth would just hurt him that I didn't want to drop him off, especially knowing that this would become a habit...

So far, I've never had a job and put most of my energy into personal projects and while it's been nice, I recently have come to the conclusion that if I continue to live my life this way I might never grow up in a real way and miss out on a lot of stuff. I'm finally thinking about going to college, and while english is my best subject I'm more interested in a STEM degree because I don't think I'd be a very good teacher... My only issue is that in high school it was a struggle for me to even get myself to go most days and I'm also not very good at math, so I don't want to waste my parents money even though we're well off.

276,"TL;DR(but please read) Friends want to leave my dance group due to leadership issues

I’ve been with my dance group for about 6 months now, I’ve been to every practice and I’m on very good terms with everyone. However, recently one of our leaders decided to trash talk a member on our SHARED ACCOUNT WITH 12 OF US ON IT and she found out and left. We all saw the screenshots of what the DMs were, and now some of our trust has been lost for those two leaders. (There’s one more who has been fine to work with) I talked with another member over the phone a few days ago, and found out she and another member are both planning to leave and start their own group in late January after a performance we have planned. This group means so so much to me, and I’m really scared at the possibility that they would leave over this. I asked her what it would take for her to stay, and she said she’d need those two leaders to stop trash-talking our main rival group(who is actually amazing and I’m friends with some of their members) and also to generally change their attitudes. 

Now for the advice part: What do I do? I really want to stay in the group, but I don’t know how I can get the leaders to stop shitting on our rival group and to get them to be less intense over group chats when things can be misunderstood(one time I was the only one who could attend practice other than the leaders and that was awful).

277,"I have to write my feelings here since I really don’t want to talk to anyone about this bc everyone will probably hate me for many reasons. I’ve had two serious relationships in my life. The first one lasted 2 years and the other one for over a year. After breaking up with my latest boyfriend 6 months ago, I’ve had 2 guys that I’ve been hanging out with (they’re friends with each other) and I’ve kissed both of them. And now my ex, that I dated for two years is flirting with me and I’m letting him &amp; flirting back... I’ve been really good friends with him after our breakup and we’ve seen each other after the breakup many times bc we still care for each other, dating was just not the best thing for us. But now he’s coming over for the night next month (he lives far away) + the flirting?? I have no idea what’s happening. Also the two guys I’ve been hanging out with... The other one i have actually feelings for and the other one is just hot &amp; tall but he is SO in love with me. First I thought I liked him but now I know that I don’t, I like the other guy more but we really can’t date bc he’s moving far away and all that, it’s just better for us to stay friends. But really, one friday I sat with the guy I actually like in a car &amp; we made out, on saturday the good looking guy stayed the night &amp; on sunday i facetimed with my ex? I’m really never like this...I really wanna tell the hot guy I don’t have feelings for him but... i just like the attention? And the guy I actually like, we agreed that we should be only friends and we still can’t keep our hands off of eachother... and uhhh I have no idea what I’m doing!!! I like the attention, I don’t wanna hurt nobody, I never do things like this but now I’m sending my best selfies on snapchat to three guys and hoping THREE guys see my cute mystories?

278,"Just wanted to let you know I am thinking of you! I’m sorry you were let down by your birthday. I also am sorry I wasn’t the greatest and most supportive because I let some of my anxieties get the best of me. Also, I suck at talking feelings in real life most of the time so I prefer to write them. 

People forget stuff unless they get reminded and of course it feels stupid reminding someone of your birthday. I don’t blame you for being hurt. Also you’re right. It’s a busy time of year and people tend to be busy with other things. But it doesn’t mean people care less about you if they don’t wish you a happy birthday. There are plenty of other ways to show they care and I’m sure they’d feel actually pretty bad that they didn’t tell you happy birthday on your actual birthday if they knew. 

Plus, you’re going through some hard stuff right now in other areas in your life. Take what happens right now as a learning opportunity or whatever positive thing you can take or learn from this experience. It’s so easy for me to say but much harder to do. 

Don’t be down. I know it’s easy for me to say but for real. You have so much going for you. You’re a super cool and interesting person who makes me laugh and makes me want to explore new things. I know you’re scared you are thirty and that is very normal. But, it can either be a damper on your life or something to see as a challenge to make this decade your best one yet. You’ve never been as smart or as mature as you are today and you’ll only get better with age. Like a fine wine lol. 

Again, I wanted to say I’m sorry I made some (lots) of our chat about me and me being butthurt. I just needed reassurance and I am sorry I didn’t give you the same when you needed it. And I suck at bringing feelings up and used that at a chance to do that. Not fair to you. I’m sorry. 

You’re great. I am happy you’re a part of my life and that I met you. You have people who care about you a lot and that’s better than having lots of sort of friends wish you happy birthday who don’t do shit for you the other 364 days of the year. I am sorry I didn’t fully support you 100 percent today. I hope you forgive me and I hope you have a very, very good Christmas Day. 💋

283,"It's been going for a short time now, starting Mid-September I think. I've always been a bit overweight for my age, and I've always had fat around my abdomen, thighs, etc you name it. Even though I knew it, I wasn't very concerned about it until starting high school. 

Around this summer break, I decided to weigh myself in months, and came well over weight by 14 Kgs. None to say, I wasn't surprised but kind of disappointed in myself and what I was doing to my body. So, I started to lose weight, by portion control watching what I ate, getting more active etc. Come round the school year and I'm at 60 KG. Yet, I wasn't still happy with my weight, so I started to watch what I ate and shrink my portion sizes. During the year my activity also increased, taking four classes of karate and sometimes yoga throughout the week. I went down to 58 Kg. And thats when I remember first actually looking at the calories I ate in a day. I was surprised at how much I still ate, so I reduced it even more, removing any sweets, cakes, or fat inducing stuff(except that one binge where I just had a shawarma and two popsicles because it was a holiday). Mid to late November, my weight loss just accelerated. Right now, I'm standing at 54 Kg and 163 cm,or thats what I think my suspected broken scale is trying to say. 

Here's the thing: I want to stop losing weight now. As someone who does sports, I think at least half of my weight is muscle, but still have noticeable fat on my body. I don't want to lose more weight, but whenever I look at my body I feel repulsed. I feel like I haven't visually lost weight at all, but the scale says something different. 

I'm now worried about every single thing I eat. 

I can't eat something care freely for once, without going through websites and apps subtracting and adding calories I need. 

I get anxious if I consume over a thousand calories per day. 

I don't eat anything with sugar, if I can control it. However, I do enjoy baking for my family.

I get guilty, terribly, if I eat breakfast at times. 

I've been avoiding my favourite chocolate. I just stare at it and then keep it back unwrapped.

Just now, I took a small spoonful of rice and spinach, and then had the immediate urge to spit it out. I cried the other day because my mom gave me rice for dinner and kept on bugging me to finish it. I jogged immediately for half an hour after that, and didn't sit down or lie down because I was worried that I'm going to get fat if I did. 

I don't know what to do. Should I listen to my mind, or what I see?

The fitting part is very important because I have weird feet - they're a big size (Europe's 42) but very thin, thus it's always difficult to find footwear that fits well. These shoes are my only heels that I feel comfortable in, just recently I wore them to a 3 month dancing course with my partner. 

I graduate from Master's this coming June and planned to wear these babies to my graduation (the first time I wore them was at my HS graduation, I also graduated from Bachelor's in them). The problem is that the last 2 times at our dance course my partner wore black freshly polished shoes and we practiced tango, so the shoes brushed against each other quite a bit from all sides. To my horror, I later discovered long black lines on both sides of my light shoes. Not knowing how to remove them, I tried rubbing the lines with clear water but then the spots started changing color (turning brown) so I freaked and left it alone. Does anyone know how to remove the black shoe polish? I really want to revive my favourite shoes!

He told me that nobody in my family had called him for weeks on Christmas plans whatsoever and when I told him where I was on Christmas eve he seemed to get annoyed/jealous saying ""I didn't know that, they never invited me"".

I feel his pain a little but at the same time I'm neutral in toxic family politics. I don't want to be that person where I'm your second or third alternative person to where I'm not put as important as he is to me. Why be around people that don't have your back yet you stick up for them?

My parents wanted me and my brother to stay at their house over night for Xmas eve. My girlfriend has trouble sleeping alone so I decided to take her with me for the night.

Now, my GF and my brother had had a weird relationship a while back and he was manipulative enough that she developed some strange tendencies about him, similar to that of an abusive relationship.

The Event: My GF and I are going to sleep. I pass out and wake up 15 minutes later to the sound of distant moaning. I get out of bed and the hair stands up on the back of my neck as I realize that my GF is not in my room. I sneak out into the hallway and I hear my GF giggling and laughing from my brothers room. I hear her whisper “be careful”.

I march straight into my brothers room where I find my brother pretending to be asleep (but still obviously breathing heavily) and my GF laying next to him. She still has her clothes on and she acts like nothing is going on but she’s being a little defensive.

I ask her what happened and she eventually admits that he had kissed her. She also later admits that she was moaning because he was touching her. She started off saying that she stopped him as soon as she could and that she only went in there to talk to him. I brought up that she could have left a lot sooner and that I could hear her moaning and she admired that she didn’t intend for things to get sexual, but she did let it happen because she still had feelings for him.

GF drove back home in the middle of the night and I soon did the same, sending my parents a quick heads up explaining why I left.

Present:
Now I’m getting texts from both my parents saying that they are sad that I left and that family should stick together. My mom said that she’s sorry I got caught up between my brother and GF which makes me feel like she didn’t respect my relationship with her and that it was always more about her and y brother.

They want me to hear my brothers side of the story. He has a history of using women and my parents usually respond with “he’s just not a relationship guy” even though he uses obvious manipulation tactics.

I really thought my parents would have my back on this one. Why does it feel like they care less about my situation and just want me to forgive my brother so we can have a normal Christmas?

Learning that she is willing to lie to me and to manipulate the truth to protect my feelings hurts me a lot, and I'm not okay with it. I told her multiple times I am not okay with it and that I do not want to be in that type of relationship and i don't want her to but she says I cannot handle the truth and it is better for me this way. The scenario in topic as of right now is going to my grandparents house for Christmas, she says if she were not in the mood to go to my grandparents house or she really didn't want to she would do it anyway for me. I think that would breed resentment and other issues down the road and I would prefer total honesty. (There have been other scenarios but this one is today) Plus I've had a good number of relationships where a girl lied to me, cheated on me... There were lies everywhere. And I think a person who is okay telling a little white lie is okay telling a big lie later on. I don't want someone who is willing to  not tell the truth,  even if it is to protect me. Especially when i ask her to...Me personally I am blunt and truthful with everything. She knows exactly where I stand, and she thinks that makes me barbaric and  rude because I'm not willing to sugarcoat things for other people. 
So she said she doesn't want to do that... How should we handle this? What is your guys's input? I'm extremely biased and think my way is the right way or the highway... But I am also very aggressive and Stern and I might need to be looking at this from a different perspective

So this girl. I met her at a very young age. So I grew up with her. I shared so many experiences with her, and I wouldn't be the person I am today with her. And I am forever grateful for that. For the last 7-8 years we've gone on and off. We've been in a great relationship, and we've been in less great relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, she is perfect, she is everything I could ever want and more. I feel lucky to have spent so many years with her. We've had moments where we be together, then we wouldn't talk. But it always ended back in a relationship because we both felt that something brought us back together.

&amp;#x200B;

Until 10 months ago. That's when we broke up for the last time and we haven't talked all that much since. When we initially broke up, I didn't cry. I decided that I didn't want to cry anymore over her. I immediatly signed up for a gym membership and went on my path to get a better physical health (still on that path). Of course, some days later I cried my  eyes out when something reminded me of her. I've been in a couple of relationships inbetween but they all didn't work out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Call me naive, but I really believe she is the one for me.

&amp;#x200B;

The latest months I was well on my way, but I still miss her, alot. And things only worsened last night. I had a very long dream of her. I was in bliss. I got to talk to her, feel her and see her again. Maybe it made me fall in love with her all over again. I woke up to a hole in my stomach (perhaps my heart aswell) that's been there all day. I worked today but it didn't distract me, however made me the distracted. 

&amp;#x200B;

After ten whole months, with new life experiences I have yet to get over her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I bit the bullet aswell. I sent her a message on messenger wishing her a merry christmas. This led to a little of a conversation. Well, I eventually found out she was in a relationship.

I took a break from smoking weed (sorry to those who are against it) just cause my lungs need a break. I really have been much more socially isolated and reclusive and I don’t know why.
My family is anti mental health and I’ve never wanted to reach out to them. My friends are great but I don’t want to burden them.
Not sure how to handle the next coming weeks when I’m at home and not busy with school 
Hope everyone has a good Christmas though.

302,"So here’s the issue. I’m a freshman in college and there’s this guy who’s liked me since I met him in August but the timing never really worked out &amp; I just started talking to him this month again before winter break. 
I’m sure you can see where the issue comes in, since winger break has started we have talked every day over Snapchat, which is fine, but I really don’t want him to get tired of me or feel like he has to talk to me. He never leaves me on read &amp; so it’s like the conversation can never end and I feel weird saying, “oh I have to go bye” because it just feels to formal and we’re not dating .
I’m not the type of person to need to text someone everyday, especially if I know they like me. He’s always been super consistent so I’m not worried about him liking me, I know he does. The issue is that I feel rude leaving him on read, but I also just can’t hold a conversation for that long, nobody is that interesting that you seriously want to talk to them all day every day, eventually you start recycling topics.
My main problem is that I have 3 more weeks of break and I’m not sure what to do at this point, I feel weird saying something like, “hey you don’t have to talk to me as often if you don’t want to/you can always stop a conversation when you want, because I feel like it always comes off as a nice way to say you don’t want to talk to them even though that’s not what I mean. I want him to still be interested when I go back to school and I’m scared that if he feels like he has to talk to me everyday he’ll get bored or start resenting me. Do I start pulling away slightly and hope he gets the message or do I just pull the trigger and say you don’t have to talk to me all the time? Thanks for the help.",25Dec2018,1
303,"It’s Christmas and I should be enjoying time with my family, but instead I am worried sick about a friend. 

In summation: I was raped at 18. Turned to alcohol and drugs instead of addressing my PTSD. Ended up being arrested at 20 and went to rehab and began intensive therapy. Met a super nice young man and we quickly became great friends. We were buddies through rehab but lost touch after we completed the program. His vice was spice. 

In rehab I was told I wasn’t an alcoholic, but I had developed an alcohol dependency to cope. I continued with the program anyway because I learned some invaluable life lessons, recognized and addressed my triggers, and was taught what to do when I feel myself slipping. 

It’s now three years later. I quit drinking for a year but now drink in moderation with close friends and family.  I’ve spent three years in therapy and am now graduating undergrad with honors and applying to law schools for next August. I have a wonderful boyfriend, healthy relationship with my family, and close friends who I can count on. 

I lost two friends during my time in rehab and it really wrecked me. One relapsed and was reincarnated. The other got sober but the years of heroin abuse and AIDS eventually took her life. I was her only support system and visited her in hospice every day for a month until she passed. 

For those who have never been to rehab, a sort of unspoken bond between misfits is created. I feel a sense of love and loyalty toward every person I met, as we healed together and discussed demons never before addressed. 

Unfortunately, most turned back to their old ways of life. I lost touch with everybody and really focused on getting my life straight. Recently the aforementioned male friend reconnected with me via Facebook. Still using intermittently, homeless. After sporadically talking for a few weeks he asked me this morning for bus fare to “somewhere far away because the depression is taking over.” 

Obviously, I’m not going to wire an addict money. I offered to talk on the phone and help him find a shelter and buy him some new clothes for his job interview. I implored him to seek guidance and consider therapy.

Here’s where I need advice: what exactly should I do? I’m not afraid of slipping back into my old ways, I trust myself to keep working tirelessly toward my future of becoming a lawyer. I’m not going to Venmo him or pay for a him to live anywhere. Honestly, I couldn’t even if I wanted to. 

I work two jobs while taking 18 hours. I’m saving for school but am considering paying for an online counselor for him for one month. I can muster up $200 - $300 if it means saving a life. He says he wants help, wants to get better. But I understand when you’re in the throws of addiction you’ll say whatever will get you to your end game. 

I’m at a loss. In a messed up way, I feel guilty for my progress. I know he’s not my responsibility but I’m a very caring and loyal person. I want to help, but I just don’t know how to go about it. Any and all insight/thoughts/opinions/advice is greatly appreciated.

That didn’t really bother me at all, I really liked her and she really liked me and that’s all I cared about. However, she was kinda secretive about her social media, so I suggested adding each other on the things we mutually use. Everything was really good for the most part and she ended up telling me she loved me, and I of course told her I loved her too. 


However, one thing I felt weird about is that she would never really post anything about me, and if she did, she almost never referenced me as her bf. She is pretty attractive and I knew guys would message her here and there, so it made me uncomfortable that she wouldn’t really reference being in a relationship at all. I also knew she had a tumblr but I never used tumblr so obviously we never added each other. Sometimes she would go on around me, but she would never show me her profile. However, I ended up seeing her profile name, and I would just randomly check it here and there. I didn’t feel great about it, but I just wanted to see if she was posting anything she wouldn’t want me to see. 

Usually there wouldn’t really be much to worry about, but today I saw a text post she made today where she said she’s convinced her soulmate is somewhere in NY. Obviously I’m devastated, but idk how to handle it. I know I shouldnt have been snooping, but clearly I had a reason to feel that way. I feel like no matter, what, if I’m right and she actually is looking at/talking to/whatever other dudes, or I’m wrong and somehow I magically misunderstood the post, our relationship will end after I bring up the convo.

306,"I recently (24th October) decided I wasn't eating meat anymore. I still cook it for my family, obviously not witholding it from my pets, and have had several discussions with my family about it.. for some reason they have taken great offense to me becoming a vegetarian, making sure to point out my hot chocolate contains milk and ""don't you know that comes from a cow? might as well eat a cheeseburger"" and other similar comments and things like googling the energy drink I had to see if it was suitable for vegetarians... if I had been condesending and ever made a single comment about them eating meat I could kind of rationalize it but I haven't. I even told my auntie how nice the lamb looked/smelled. Now the last month or so, they have changed their tune and decided to just accept I am not going to change my mind, and even tagging me in recipes theyve seen on facebook. That brings us to now..  I've found out today, since coming home several hours ago, the Christmas dinner I ate wasn't vegetarian at all as the root veg was all cooked in duck fat. I've rang and asked about it, and was told that because it's not actually meat she didn't think it would matter, and that's why she didn't tell me. I don't know how to proceed from here as we are going next week for new years dinner, and I dont feel like I can trust anything that is put on my plate in front of me... how do I approach this? Do I just take my own food? I believe it wasn't malicious, but even so surely asking me first wouldn't have been too difficult? I know I sound melodramatic but I feel a bit betrayed.

315,"I work as an apprentice chef in a pub, I have no problems or trouble with any of the staff or my colleagues except for the assistant head chef who was recently made head chef and who is a year older than me. I'm in my early 20s.

He talks to me as though I'm a child, and asks me to do jobs or specific work while the other staff are either talking or eating during work hours. Since it's a very busy restaurant, the only people who have breaks within the kitchen are those who do more than 10 hours in a shift.

When I ask for 5 or 10 minutes to chill, the head chef tells me why I can't in the form of saying other staff have started earlier than me, or that people normally don't have a break anyway, it's the norm. And I can have 5 minutes if my area is clean, which is a difficult thing to accomplish when you have customers coming in as you're cleaning.

Today, as an example of a specific conversation, I was looking into the oven for veg and around me for a temperature probe, he comes along to say to not do that at all since he'll do all of that and ""Don't touch the oven door at all unless I say"" when other people have used it freely. To not make a scene, I shrug it off, and be compliant. I tell him or ask him when I'm taking stuff out. And I hate myself more for allowing that to happen and not doing anything.

He uses excuses that people have worked longer or haven't had a break to warrant his reason for not allowing me time to chill. And it's important in that kind of environment to vent and take a moment. Another example was when I was 5 minutes late since I cycled in the rain to work, and had to get changed at the changing room there in soaking wet clothes, I apologised when I walked in and explained, and even though he nodded and said ""Okay no problem"", as soon as I was a few steps away he says my name and with condescension to essentially have foresight that it'll rain on the way to work and I'll needed a few more minutes to change cause it rained even though I didn't know, and when I said ""My clothes were soaking wet so it took longer"" he just shrugged.

These kind of situations happen a lot, he'll talk to me in a condescending manner, calling it a way to present authority, even though I'm an adult and understand the logistics of kitchen staff. I'll feel humilated. And when it's ""casual hour"" he'll ask me dumb questions about my private life as though it was funny to him, and when I say I'm not answering cause he's taking the piss, he shouts ""How am I taking the piss?!"" so other people are overhearing.

I spoke to the manager above and they told me I need to assert myself when requesting for short breaks. But I feel I need to resolve the situation myself before it gets any worse.",25Dec2018,1

My husband and I just need other people's perspective and advice. I have landed a job in a city that is about an 1 hr and 10 min commute from where we currently live. We are planning to move there anyways, I just landed my dream job early. Problem is our lease does not end until May.

So we need advice on whether or not to break our lease. We need to give our complex 2 months notice - so end of February would be soonest we can move. We then need to pay an extra months rent to break the lease. We also lose our deposit. If anything needs to be fixed in the apartment, it comes from my pocket and not the deposit. All to leave 2 months early and not have to commute every day. My company will reimburse up to $1500, but it will take a few weeks to get to me.

320,"I've known this girl since we were 10 and I had to leave the country when I was 18 to live in the US with family. 

Right now I'm 23 and after 4 years I visited again my country which resulted in her coming to see me. 

She said she missed me and she had not been in a relationship with anyone so we spent the time I was visiting together (2 weeks) and told her I wasn't sure if I'd be back or what I'd do since I haven't figured things out. I got student loans that need to be paid back and bills and I wasn't sure where I was heading. So ,I told her its okay if she dates guys or if she eventually falls for someone. These things are part of life and it will just happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a year later my brother got married and I'm visiting again. This time she comes back and doesn't want to let me go, she's had really hard times that she's getting therapy and on medicine because of a collapse she had. Then tells me she tried something with someone and that things didn't go well. She liked someone and the guy basically told her that she would need to do better if she wanted to gain his trust because he knew she had a crush on me and that when I visited the year before, she was with me.

I really don't know what to do.  I'm here to just visit and it seems to be affecting her love life. I don't even know how the guy knew I even existed since I don't talk much with anyone from my country since I don't spend much time here.

322,"My best friend and I were both virgins. She had more dating and sexual experience than me, as she’s had a few boyfriends in the past, before she concluded that she was asexual (although she was ambivalent about this). I, on the other hand, didn’t even have my first kiss. 

When I got my first boyfriend back in June, she didn’t seem to care. While all my other friends were happy for me, I didn’t get the same vibe from my best friend. Whenever I brought him up, she’d give a vague response and change the topic. Eventually, I felt her pulling away. I was always the one to reach out to her first and she’d take eons to respond. Then one day we actually started having a consistent conversation and she opened up to me that she was recently diagnosed with obsessive compulsive personality disorder. We started talking about mental health, and then about the state of our friendship. 

She told me that seeing me move ahead of her in life and get a boyfriend and have sex etc. made her feel abandoned. Part of why she felt so comfortable around me is because we were both virgins (we’re 20 &amp; 21) so she didn’t feel that social pressure to hurry up and lose her virginity. I assured her that I’ll never abandon her, she’s still just as important in my life, and there’s no rush for her to get a boyfriend and have sex. Deep inside, though, it kind of felt like she was making me feel guilty for getting a boyfriend and just having that part of my life blossom. It’s like she wanted me to be miserable and alone forever just so she can feel good about herself. It sucked that even now, she wasn’t expressing happiness for me, just throwing a pity party for herself. 

We actually started talking everyday again like we used to. I was always careful not to bring up my boyfriend. For some reason, I felt like I wasn’t allowed to. She did begin distancing herself from me again and I stopped being the only one to put in effort. Today, I wished her a merry Christmas after two months of not talking. She was online, and she’s been shitposting on social media, so I know she saw my message and chose to ignore it.

324,"New year is approaching and I thought a lot about my future these last days. I do a lot of introspection (as always) but now I need some advice and I don’t know anyone who could really help me. I’m someone introvert but it’s also the result of loosing confidence in others.

What’s my questioning about ? About my life, my choices, my relatives. It’ll probably be boring but I need to introduce myself in order to explain to you why I’m not satisfy in my life.

I’m a young adult who has a good life at first sight. I’ve wealthy parents, I was good at school (considered as a precocious), people generally consider me as smart, good looking, mature and wise. However as you can understand there were some issues.

Firstly my mom got a cancer when I was 12. I’ve always been someone independent but this situation created a lot of new difficulties which, as you can understand, impacted a lot my childhood and my relationship with my parents. Moreover my father isn’t the most talking guy, my brother is often unbearable and my mother got away from the rest of my family and her friends. Thus it was not a great situation and my dog was the only good result of that situation.

Secondly, I kinda failed my studies. To summarise I did one of the most difficult formation in my country, I didn’t manage to follow, I started to hate physics because of it, I understood that I did a mistake and the results of my competitive exams were bad. I then left the school I got for some reasons to join university in physics maths. I’m in 3rd years (because I validated my first 2 years with my difficult formation) but I hate it and the first results weren’t good. I’m loosing motivation to work but I got pros such as more free time (I’ll talk about it later). Moreover I don’t really know what I want to do in life (even if I know what I do not want to do lol).

Thirdly, I feel like something is missing in my life. As I said before I do a lot of introspection, I’m generally considered as wise and mature, etc... but it doesn’t provide me of feeling bad. It’s like not being ingenuous is an issue to happiness. People say that I’m asking myself too many questions but I can be spontaneous, I love having fun, etc... Maybe I lack of a balance, don’t know. The point is that I feel like nothing good happened to me. Many people surely have badder life than mine but there’s no period where I felt happy. I had fun, that’s it. I also never found someone who understands me. I don’t have social issues but I use my chameleon and fun personality in order to be considered as nice and cool by others. However in reality I’m really introvert. Going to party or kissing and having sex with a random girl weren’t made for me. It’s sometimes weird because you feel disconnected without being disconnected : you don’t feel in your place with weirdo nor with other people. About that I never believed in love until recently. I wasn’t attracted by girls of my age and was only focus on possible sexual relationships. However, recently I got infatuated with one of my fantasies. A girl I never met nor never talked to but there was so much stuff that attracted me and made me feel comfortable about her. The story was totally crazy and is an example of how lucky I am lol. To my mind I just have grown and my 2 years of hard work pushed me to think about living my life. Thus I wanted to find someone. However I also felt like it was more : I wasn’t looking for fun but for something serious. I wanted a confident, a person to love and who can love me, someone who can provide me a new life (probably because I didn’t know her, she’s already working and she does something I like which is quite different to what I’m doing).

Finally, I’m thinking about starting a new life. At the beginning I would have liked to stop everything, to have a new identity, etc... nevertheless it was stupid. I just feel like I want to start a new journey : begin new studies, live elsewhere, etc... I was focused on staying in my city because it’s cool and it’s where my family and friends live, on pursuing in studies I’m not made for, etc... but I need fresh air. I’ve always liked adventures. Moreover my friends and family aren’t an help. Most of them generally don’t provide good advice and make fun of me. It’s nice but sometimes I just want to say nothing because I’m afraid of their reactions. As an example, I didn’t say anything about my crush to my parents because I don’t confide myself to them and I regret to say it to some friends because they didn’t keep the secret or make fun of me (after encouraging me and saying they were impressed lol). I don’t know what I should do but I started a new activity which makes me learn a lot of stuff, I meet interesting people and we do things that have impact. I’ve always felt that people only have impact with their studies or work but I understand it’s not the case.

To conclude, I would be really glad to know your opinion about my situation. I’m generally pessimistic about my situation and life in general. However it’s weird because I still believe in life : I love nature and I continue to advance and to be resilient. I think I’m just exhausted (which seems not good at my age).",25Dec2018,1

I’m trying to save up enough to move out by putting pretty much everything I earn into savings and spending as little as possible.

330,"Merry Christmas y’all! So there’s this girl that I’ve had a friendship with for 3 years now.  Let’s call her “Lea.” I felt pretty close to Lea in the 1st year of friendship and not to mention that was our first year of college. The second year, we still hung out but I kinda felt uncomfortable around her at times especially when it would just be and her hanging out without our other friend who is in our trio. I never really felt uncomfortable with her when we were freshman but sophomore year she started to use more sarcasm around me, joking that I was “so stupid” or “dumb” although in my heart it really didn’t seem like a joke, not giving her attention to me whenever I try to tell a story, laughing at me when I do something ‘wrong’ and again calling me so stupid.... I don’t know if I’m being very sensitive or what, but I notice that the treatment Lea gives me in comparison to our other friend is so different. For instance, Lea always listens and doesn’t use her phone when our other friend is talking to us. She also always makes plans with our other friend first before telling me about it.  Not to mention I’ve never heard Lea speak to our friend with harsh words. So now comes to our third year of friendship but I no longer attend the same school as those two but Lea still texts me every once in a blue moon asking to hang out; but honestly, I don’t really feel like keeping a friendship with her due to the discomfort I’ve felt with her since sophomore year till now. So what I’d like to know is what do you guys think? I feel like I want to end this friendship but am I making a mistake? We were such great friends in the beginning but it doesn’t feel that way at all anymore... should I ignore this feeling and try to be friends with her?",25Dec2018,1
331,"I'm kind of freaking out. There's this middle-aged guy who I've been working with for the past six months, who's a super nice guy. Always acting cheerful and friendly, etc. 


Anyway, I had my last day about a week ago, and I friended him on facebook. He messaged me every day since then, and yesterday he sent me this message out of the blue talking about how he was glad to have met me and saying that he was sure I would do great things in life or whatever. 


Today I went to wish him a merry christmas, and his account has been deactivated. I have no other way to contact him, and am not yet friends with any other coworkers of mine. Is this a bad sign? Should I tell someone? I'm 18f and this is totally out of my life experience. ",25Dec2018,1
333,"I've been dating a guy for a while now, and we get along perfectly fine. As cliché as it sounds, we say the same things and we synchronise with them without even trying. We think the same almost, we like the same things. Match made in heaven. 

He has these kinks I'm not into. ABDL to be precise. I'm a dom by nature, and I really love that he's submissive, but I really am anxious about that one kink. I don't know what to think of it. I'm totally chill with it, I don't judge him, I accepted him with it, but I don't know how to include this in whatever we'll be doing. 

I'm really scared, because I love him a lot, yet I also feel awful because this might be his favourite thing. He's been genuinely happy with me and so have I, our dirty talks go amazingly well. It's just that I feel afraid for the future, kind of. What if I'm not what he seeks? ",25Dec2018,1
334,"So, this happened about 2 hours ago and i am feeling fine now. 
(i am 16M if that has any significance)

I was eating Christmas dinner with my family and me and my brother did a Christmas cracker together, he won as the toy fell on the floor. So as Brothers do, we tussled to be the first one to get it. In the tussle i swung my arm back and hit just above my elbow and i got super light headed. 

I looked around and everything was fuzzy and slow. I slouched over to hold my head and i think i passed out for a second. 

This is where the confusing part comes in. So i felt like i was having a seizure because my arms were going up and down on the table rapidly and i had no control over it. 

But according to all my family at the table (4 people) said i was as still as a rock. 

Once i got my senses back i rushed to the toilet because i felt like i was going to vomit, but i didn’t.

I felt better within 5 minutes then went back to the table and finished my food. 

My friend told me i should go to the doctor ASAP but i don’t feel like it’s that big of a deal since i feel fine.


Can anyone explain what just happened to me?

335,"Hello

I'll try to keep it brief. I'm spending winter with my parents. I'm 20. I have to be on a flight to visit and a flight back. 

The two nights I've been here I have had extreme neck and back pain. I spent the tree decorating trying not to cry and slept through Christmas Eve dinner on a slightly more comfortable bedin the house.

I think I'm just sensitive but my neck hurts, which makes my back, jaw, teeth, and hips hurt. I'm crying as I type this is pain and frustration (I hate being incapacitated. It pisses me off. I know this isn't a helpful emotion(. 

I've had back pain from sleeping in the past. I slept in an air mattress for months because it didn't give me any, and the mattress at my house I'm dreaming of . 

I'm here for another two weeks, probably three. I'm so physical miserable.

I've already spoken to my dad about returning earlier (or other reasons. The ticket biyign and date setting process pissed me off anyways) and it will be talked about. 

Is there anything I can do In the meantime? I can't tell what does and does hurt only that it really does whsn it does. I take aspirin every few hours but I just can't deal with this pain.

I did at the time have the state minimum insurance through geico. I think that only covers 10k worth of damage. I have no house, no vehicle, maybe 100$ in my bank account currently.

I was told this is just when they decide the fine/points added/license suspension etc. I was wondering if I should get a lawyer, or just call them and tell them I can’t pay them? Can they sue me?

339,"I (18m) live with 4 other people: my 2 sisters (20f, 16f) , my mom(38), and my Grandmother(68(?)f). For a while now, My entire household has had a steady decline in mental health. We all have bags under our eyes, mine being the most severe though I've had problems with sleep all my life. When I go to events with them such as family meet ups, I notice they are very very weird. They are not anything like how I remember them, even around me. This shift seemed to happen very suddenly, almost out of nowhere, my sister was in college and on the road to becoming a certified RN, until she failed a couple classes and got dropped by her financial aid. I myself can tell I am pretty strange to people, just by the way they look at me and act around me, and they laugh at things I say that I think make perfect sense and don't seem funny at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Some specific examples are that my older sister will talk in this really childish voice constantly. Like, she sounds just like a 5 year old voice actor. I've told her it annoys me and she said sorry and that it annoys her as well and she doesn't know why she even does it. Yet, I hear her talk in this voice about 10 times a day and sometimes even in public. She will talk about how her head hurts and she wants to rip it off, make multiple ""jokes"" about suicide and how she's a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom will make inappropriate jokes to people. A family member mentioned nuts and she said said ""hah, gross"" ...because she said the word nut. She's angry all of the time and will yell at the cat or dog just for walking next to her. My little sister won't get up for school each morning and just lays in bed, and my mom screams and screams at her until she does, by screaming I mean fucking SCREAMING.

&amp;#x200B;

my little sister is failing highschool but she actually seems to be the most ""normal"" out of us all, though still weird around people at family gatherings.

&amp;#x200B;

None of us have any true friends. My mom has about 2 friends from work she rarely talks to, my older sister has a boyfriend in prison and a 27 year old girl she sleeps with, My younger sister's friends are all online and I have literally none, literally meaning actually 0.

I keep thinking maybe there's a Carbon Monoxide leak, but that surely would have killed us all by now, and our detector picks up nothing. What else could this be, why is my family seemingly going insane? I've talked to my sister about it and she says our house is full of black mold, and that can cause mental disorders, but we've lived here for a while and were doing just fine before. We do have black mold on the roof of our shower, but other than that I haven't seen anything. A lot of stuff in our house contains asbestos as well. I don't know but I hate that I just have to sit here and watch as my family becomes insane and depressed. If it's just a side effect of our isolation, how can I help my 2 sisters and I overcome this?",25Dec2018,1
341,"This is gonna be a somewhat long post but here is whats going on.
What recently happened.
So i’m on academic probation (have a 1.95GPA) and i just had finals, none were exams they were all papers/essays (3 of them to be exact due on the 23rd) and when i started working on them i had nonstop anxiety attacks every few minutes when working on them; my first paper was due on the 18th and it had to be 8 pages long, i only had 1.5 pages together and when writing the paper i repeatedly had fits of rage and sadness to the point i was crying and i had to distract myself to get myself to stop feeling this way and what i’ve turned in is not adequate at all. At this point i was working on papers since the 16th but have had nonstop anxiety attacks preventing me from focusing on these papers and i’m very confident at this point the essays are not in passable condition. Now the finals week ended and i’m pretty sure if i do not have passable grades in class, i’m getting kicked out of the university. I have zero clue what is going to end up happening because i know my mother is gonna try and kick me out of the house at this point and she doesn’t think i’m burned out from school even though i clearly am (i’ve always hated school and i’ve been going for 20 years straight) and at this point since i’m getting kicked out i’m going to have to start paying off the student loans which is 6 years of loans, keep in mind this is at a University not a community college so we have to pay a lot more for those years.
I’m extremely depressed because this means my 6 years of college have been a waste. I’ve always hated school and i’ve had way too much mental health problems formed ever since i’ve started college.
At this point i’m unsure what to do: i have a part time job but it was a flexible hour job and they do not have any hours available so i have no idea what i’m going to do with myself.
On some related note: i have went to therapy to get some kind of medication to get the focus issue taken care of but they keep telling me i have nothing wrong with me and instead put me on anti-depressants which ended up making me suicidal and i had to withdraw from the previous semester because of the large amounts of crying fits i was having i had to dismiss myself from class even on exam days so that entire semester was blown.",25Dec2018,1

347,"Okay so here goes. I had an extremely close relationship with my best friend. I considered him to be a brother, more of a brother than my biological ones. We worked a seasonal job together and subsequently ended up living together which lead to arguments and disagreements which got quite heated at times. Both of us said some regrettable things but in my mind it was always something that was left in the time that it happened. I never held it against him. 

We both kind of fucked around a lot at this place, both while at work and while off of work at various parties. In short we worked the system to our advantage whenever we could equally. Maybe I was a little better at it then him because I’m good at talking to people, I definitely got more women then him which I attributed to my “speech skill” (a joke referencing the video game fallout)

Fast forward, he has now become convinced that I am a legitimate manipulative narcissist. Not narcissistic mind you, but that I actually have the personality disorder. Now mind you I’ve been to a therapist off and on for years and he never even remotely mentioned anything like that. That’s not even the biggest deal, I can accept that, but he has now begun accusing me of things that ABSOLUTELY NEVER HAPPENED. He thinks I was going behind his back and telling people he was gay and that he was a freak with absolutely no evidence to support this claim.  He thinks that the things I did for him out of genuine kindness were all just a ploy to get him to like me (used to do his college homework for him for free, gave him money to get home when he was stranded on the other side of the country, etc. etc.) the strangest thing of all is what he said to me today. He asked me “Do you remember when we would be in the car driving together and you would randomly look at me and say ‘It’s a fetish.’ ?”  He provided absolutely no context to this, no specific time that it happened, no conversations that lead up to me supposedly saying this. Just that I would look at him and say “It’s a fetish.” I was left completely clueless by this because this absolutely never happened. He’s always had some issues but that’s the only thing I would ever label a delusion because it 100% never happened. When he was confronting me he didn’t seem like himself at all. Like the person I knew was completely gone. I’m no psychologist, but it seemed to me like he was manic. 

Does anyone think I should get this kid help? Should I avoid him altogether? We work and live at the same place and I fear this is going to be a huge infringement on my life seeing as how he wouldn’t leave me alone when I repeatedly asked him to. ",25Dec2018,1

350,"I'll put a TLDR at the bottom, but I'm making this post as I'm at a loss at what to do with my current situation and need some other sets of eyes on what my options could be.

To help with some information:  I'm in my upper twenties, currently live southern Arizona, and I've been trying to find what possible jobs I could find in the next couple of months.  However, trying to find something where you don't need years of past experience, is full time, need some thousand skills, and where it won't make me hate my life more than I already do currently (aka call centers/etc) has been a struggle.  I currently have two part time jobs (both which I hate), one as a warehouse person at a retail chain and another as a bartender at a movie theatre.  Both unfortunately never have consistent monthly incomes, as they fluctuate constantly with hours/amount in tips.

I've searched tons of past threads on reddit and what their suggestions were, and I wish I could do some of them.  I can't enlist in the military (for that sweet sweet Tricare that I miss so much), as they don't take people with past history of depression/suicide attempts. (this was years ago and is no longer an issue)  I can't move to a different city as I have no money.  I might be able to move in with a friend here in a couple months, but I'm unsure if she even wants to go through with it.  Hopefully yes, because if my rent goes up almost $100 again this next time around I won't be able to afford it.  I was in college quite a few years ago, but that was when my depression hit hard causing my grades/gpa to plummet and I wasn't able to finish. (Got about 2.5-3 years worth finished of a mechanical engineering degree) It's been so long at this point that I've forgotten most of it and would probably have to start over.  Not to mention I already have 50k in student loan debt, I'm not sure if I could even get any more to go back to school.  

A lot of people were suggesting learning a new skill (which realistically is one of my only options), but so many that would actually help get a job seem to take months to even a couple years to learn, and I unfortunately need something soon before my lease renews in a few months.  Also not to mention I may have a small hernia developing that I don't have health insurance for (thus needing a full time job that would provide one).

I've even tried to move up at my current jobs, like the movie theatre for example.  It wouldn't be that much more money but it would at least help and also get some health insurance.  However, I've tried countless times only to be met with something along the lines of, “Your interview was great, maybe just try again next time!” even after the tenth attempt.  Yet I've trained most of the people in management at this point, they even still come to me with questions on what to do with certain things happening.  They've even called me before at my other job to ask questions.

What little savings I do end up having are eaten up every year for glasses prescriptions.  My eyesight is awful and it's always expensive. Last time I got just the lenses updated they were around $500 and buying online doesn't save anything.  I'm also getting a dental crown put in soon.  Since I don't have insurance that came out to be around $1200. :/  So any savings I had this time around are definitely gone.

Here's an idea of what my expenses are every month:
Rent + Water/Trash:  ~$650
Food/Other Groceries:  ~$300
Internet:  $70
Phone:  $80
Car Insurance:  $65
Loan Payment:  ~$200 
Credit Card Payments:  ~$150
------------------------------------------
Rough Total Of Expenses:  ~$1500

**My income is roughly the total of my monthly expenses.

Right now I have my student loans on an income plan, so I don't have to pay anything back right now since I make so little.  That other loan is unfortunately different and has no income adjusted plan, so the amount can't be altered.  I've looked at a consolidation loan to just pay off that loan and my credit cards so I would have only one payment, but with all of my other debt and my low income I can't get a loan big enough to pay the others off.  (credit cards and other loan total about 10k together and can only seem to get approved for about 4k)

Right now, the only two things I can think of to change my situation in this short of notice are either temp agencies or transferring to a new city with my jobs for a bigger better job market, both of those are hit and miss.  I've heard mixed things with temp agencies on placing people somewhere different when they don't have the skills for that position.  And with transferring, it would only put me in a new city, with potentially higher rent and the same amount of pay, and no one around to help if something does go wrong.

TLDR:  No savings, no skills/experience other than retail/hospitality (that I can't stand anymore), rent getting renewed in a few months that I probably can't afford, and a potential health issue that I won't be able to afford if/when it does get worse.  Currently at a loss on what I can do and what jobs I could possibly do to change my situation in the next few months and hoping some of you might have some ideas that I'm overlooking or ways to improve.  Just need some advice on where to even start..

Note:  I hope I was able to at least put this across with any sort of sense.  I realize some of this came across as ranting/rambling, but I'm just frustrated, from what seems like a lack of hope of escaping the minimum wage hell, and getting ever closer to 30 without even living some semblance of an actual life other than just school and work. (I've literally done nothing else. JUST school and work)  I even have to close tonight at the theatre job here in a couple hours (open all year round..) and I'm already dreading it as I'm wondering who might yell at/threaten me today for having to see their ID so they can get a drink.

355,"So we've known one another for 3 years now, mostly as really good friends but over the past 6 or 7 months, it seemed like we were a lot more. We talk for literally hours quite often, and the things we talk about are unlike anything I've ever talked about with other female *friends*. Nothing is off limits. She's very flirtatious, compliments me often everyday, openly talks about us having sex when we meet(we're currently living far from one another). Even when we're both busy, we both take some time before sleeping and when waking up to just talk a bit about whatever. It was pretty much as good as it gets in these long distance type relationships. My problem here is the fact that I haven't yet officially told her that I loved her and wanted to be with her, we've been talking like I did though. She broke up with her boyfriend last year, and they stayed apart for like 6 months. He visited her a few months ago(they live a few hrs away) and I didn't think much of it because she has a few male/female friends, so maybe she's just friends with him again. Then she visited him again, and again and now for Christmas. He lives with his parents still, so I don't think they're doing anything? (She tells me about all these interactions, I'm not stalking her or anything like that lol)

Am I wrong to think there's something going on between them? I mean I get she's lonely where she lives now(she had to move recently) and she needs a friend to hang with from time to time and I'm a lot father away than he is(she's asked to visit me a few times but I told her I'll be the one to come to her in the summer because I don't really have a place for her to stay).

Our interaction when she's with him is just a good morning text from her and a good night text from me. That's about it. Its pretty sad honestly. Not sure what to do or what to think. Not sure if I'm able to just let her go because I have feelings for her and I know for a fact she does too. Don't know if I can just straight up ask her if she's getting back together with him, that sounds wrong. 

Any advice appreciated

356,"So here is the deal. It's past christmas, everyone is excited for New Years Eve, except I don't have a place to go. Every year up until now, I have spent it with my girlfriends, and have had a lot of fun with them. Recently they have stopped asking me to parties or hang out, and I don't know what I have done wrong. But I have given them the benefit of the doubt, and not thought a lot into it. 

Now, 6 days until the big day, I still have no plans. I have asked around, to a lot of different social groups as well, to see if there was anything I could attend, I'm open minded, but they have either never responded, or just answered ""Don't you have your own plans?"".

The same has my girlfriends. I have sent a PM to multiple of them to hear about the big plans, and all I've gotten was one to answer me, out of eight girls, which had the respons as prior ""Don't you have your own plans?""

So now, sitting here the day after christmas, looking at my outfit I was going to wear, don't have a party to attend. And I don't know what to do but feel a bit left out? I have tried to approach a lot of people, but they indirectly doesn't want me to come. 

Any advice on what to do?",25Dec2018,1
357,"Long story short. I anticipate being offered a job transfer to a much warmer climate in an interesting city complete with a bump in pay. My job would basically be the same and I'd be in an area where I would have friends and great support. 

On the same coin, I recently met the most amazing person shortly after applying to this job. He has a kind, gentle soul and I can't seem to keep him off my mind... Never felt this way about someone before. 

I don't want to be impulsive in my decision as I've worked so hard to get where I'm at. I find myself leaning towards wanting to stay where I'm at because he's that great of a person, but I'd also feel silly for staying if he turns out to be not what I'm looking for.

360,"I come from an Asian family, so there's a lot of pressure to do well academically and score in the 99th percentile on every standardized test. I believe I handle pressure fairly well, however, my parents have been making it worse every year. Since I'm in my junior year of high school right now, I'm taking the SAT's and my parents want me to get the full score of 1600, or at least 1550+. I took my first one in December and got my score back, a 1520. I was personally impressed by my own standards since I worked pretty hard for it and I had only expected a 1500 at best. The curve hurt my score as I only got -2 in writing but got a -50 point penalty for it, but those are just some personal excuses. Nevertheless, my parents were quite disappointed even though it was my first attempt and are making me retake it in March. I'm not against that decision since I genuinely want to go into medical school but what comes next is worse. Now that it is winter break I believe it is a time for me to rest from studying and recoup the energy until school starts. However, every time my parents come into my room and see me playing video games or relaxing in my leisure time, I get heavily scolded for ruining my life and not working hard enough. It's slowly building more frustration in me and I don't really know what to do, hence why I came to this reddit. Personally, I'm a very diligent student and have always shot for the highest in school. I've spent time without my parents always telling me to study and I know that I'm self-motivated enough to succeed in my own academics. I know how to manage my own time and know when I can play games or when to study. Because of this parental pressure, I'm forced to tab out in the middle of video games and mute my microphone when I'm talking to friends. And if I get caught my dad gets really angry and sometimes physically abuses me to the point where I have to hide in the bathroom until his anger calms down. I very rarely have suicidal thoughts but this is usually when it hits me the hardest. Every conversation with my parents is about college, university, medical school, and how many days are left until my next standardized test and how I haven't been studying enough for it. I wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar issue and could perhaps give me some advice for it. Maybe this post doesn't belong in the right subreddit but I need a way to relieve of this stress. Thanks for reading and paying attention to my rant. Merry Christmas!!!",25Dec2018,1

i have been trying to message her and get ahold of her for days and noticed she doesn't text me as much nor reply to my calls. i was worried cause she used to meet guys from facebook and not let me know and disappear for days. 

finally today she picks up. and she tells me she cant talk much cause her ""love"" is there. im like wtf u never told me u talk to anyone and that's dangerous to meet a stranger from the internet and let him sleep in ur home. 
she gets upset and tells me she has to go. at least i managed to get her to send me a picture of him but she wouldn't tell me his name or anything. 

my brother is in his early 20s and living there with her and also thought its ok to not let me know there is some dude living with them. 

not too long ago we were talking about how dangerous it is for women. how u gotta be cautious with strangers. i was telling her about jane does and unsolved mysteries, about women who end up murdered. telling her about the book THE GIFT OF FEAR and giving her tips that i learned from it. 

she knows as a 50 year old how dangerous it is for anyone but especially for women. 
i just dont get it. im worried. last time she took off for days and didn't tell me nor my brother and i had to call the police in the country she lives in to report her missing. 
its tiring. why is she like that. it would be so easy for that guy to do something to my brother and mother while they sleep or put something in their food and steal their stuff. im thinking about contacting a mental hospital and let her get checked in. she is clearly putting herself in danger. maybe they wouldn't take me serious but i dont know what else to do. 
i live in a different continent so i can only do so much. 

any advice? 

i just want her to stop doing these dangerous things. i told her the guy should have slept in a hotel while visiting her. but she dismissed it.

Last thursday I had a party and she was invited too. We chatted all night long and we were really bonding I think. The day after I continued the fibe of the evening/night before at the christmas breakfeast at our school. We chatted and I Kinda flirted and She flirted back too. She also touched my shoulders once in a while.
Saterday night I snapped her a lot and She snapped back a lot. I continued the flirty fibe I think and she flirted back too. I send one risky snap and Im not sure of thats reason Why She is acting silent al the sudden. I ended the convo with a red heart and She replied with a blushing smiley. So I thought this was Okay and I thought that this was a good sign.

The day after though She Only sent one streaksnap too me and I send her a little But She wasnt replying to my snaps, my snaps were not directly meant for her but fridays She would react to them and No She wasnt. I thought this was just an odd day and that tomorrow She will be back like first.

The day after the Same happened like the day before. Now She was replaying though But She was really formal. The Same is for monday and today.

379,"I was acquainted with this girl I met online for quite a few years now. For the most part, we never really talked. We just sort of knew each other through a few other people. However, about a few months ago, we began to text to each other. We have actually become good friends, and I have started to develop feelings for her.

The major problem with this, is that she lives in Norway.

She knows English, and is fluent through messaging. We’ve called a few times, and she can speak it quite well. And I’ve of course seen what she looks like. So it’s not like she’s a total stranger to me. We’ll talk about anything at this point, no matter how personal.

The thing is, I’ve had a long distance relationship before. It ended badly for me, and that was only in the next state from me. Ever since I kept away from any sort of long distance relationship, and haven’t been in one for years. And yet here I am, crushing on a girl in Norway, across the world from me.

I never told her about how I really feel at all, just a few compliments on her appearance and her character here and there, and that’s because I don’t think this kind of thing can work out, after all. The distance is just too great, and as a young college student, I’m in no position to travel internationally (plus, isn’t traveling across the world for a girl sort of weird?). I’ve been telling myself not to go for it, and just stay friends with her, but every time she compliments me, I feel so happy. And whenever she talks about a guy she likes, I can’t help but feel jealous.

I’ve been thinking of telling her how I feel. I’m not sure what I exactly hope to get out of it, because I’m not sure if that sort of relationship can even work out. But I also think just admitting it will lift a weight off my chest, even if we continue just staying friends.

I really need some other perspectives on this...what would any of you guys do if you were in a situation like mine?

Edit: Oh yeah, it’s probably important to talk a bit about this guy she sort of likes...

She’s been crushing on him for a while now. I don’t know exactly how long, but from the sounds of it, it sounds like a long time. The thing is, he recently got a girlfriend, and she was pretty upset about it. She told me she’s trying to get over him, but it’s really hard for her. She still talks to him, and he has even been flirting with her somewhat, calling her ‘cute’ and things like that.

 She told me she doesn’t want to help him cheat on his current girlfriend, and I told her that if he’s willing to flirt with other girls, he’s probably not a good guy to begin with (I was trying real hard not to say anything biased), and she acknowledged that.

I’m not all that worried about her falling for him. She doesn’t seem to be ‘in love,’ but that’s only from my own perspective. What bothers me about this is that it makes my decision to talk to her about how I feel that much more difficult. Even if I decide to, would it be bad timing?",25Dec2018,1
380,"I've been texting with this guy I met on POF for a few weeks. He initially sent me a message first.. We talked for about a week or two online, then I offered him my phone number, and we started texting each other.  I noticed a few days into texting, things became sexually suggestive and then eventually full blown (he offered to call once to have phone sex, I said no I was sleepy). 

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that he hadn't offer to ask me out/see me , and trying to be a take charge girl and go after what I wanted, I asked if he wanted to come over to my house to help me make cookies for the holidays. I rarely let anyone come to my house. I grew up with southern parents who believed men asked you out, take you to dinner, and then maybe, after a few months of getting to know each other,  you invite him over. I've been trying to shake those ingrained notions, and catch up to the modern age because apparently, they weren't working and I was still single.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, He declined the initial invitation, but he said he would let me know when he was available because he wanted to see me. The next day,  Christmas eve he asked to come over. Before he asked to come over, we had a very sexual conversation (It's been two years for me), and I gave in. I was excited for him to see me, but I realized he had other plans for the evening outside of baking cookies.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that evening he told me he wouldn't be able to come over until closer to midnight. We joked about the booty call hours, and then a thought hit me. I wanted an actual relationship with someone, and for the past two years of trying to date, it always leads down this road, and I'm disappointed when nothing happens in my favor.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I told him it probably wasn't the best time to come over, and I explained why. All he said was , 'oh, ok'. And I haven't heard anything since.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel shitty for doing this to him. I felt like I lead him on :/  But I also felt like I sabotaged myself from possibly having a relationship because I'm still holding on to principals that don't seem to work in this modern world of dating. I tried shaking my old ways, but I couldn't.

389,"Alright, let me introduce the situation.

The friend who I'm speaking of is an old friend of mine from middle and high school and with whom I'm potentially sharing a home during the upcoming college years. He's an awesome friend and an interesting person at the very least. 

The reason why I believe he might me gay is because of the fact that his body language and his clothing preferences match the stereotypical homosexual ones. I'm personally indifferent towards someone's sexual orientation as long as they're fine mannered, genuine and good people. That's why I never bothered even paying attention to such subtle signs of his or bothered doubting his sexuality. 

Well, up until recently. For the past few months we've been hanging out together a lot more than usual. Drinking every other day, walking towards certain destinations together and etc. He's my classmate so we share mutual space everyday and it's obviously inevitable that we get in touch quite a lot. He started hugging me regularly, texting me heart emojis and all these things that you could potentially throw into the 'supportive friendship' category. And maybe that's the case. But it doesn't really seem that way to me.

Just for a fact, I live in a country where a stereotypical male must/should (according to the local social norms) act like a masculine and an independent individual who feasts on the blood of their rivals, if they want to be granted with legitimacy and acceptance. So my friend's behaviour really stands out, at least from my field of view.

And, for the last clue of mine, he once admitted that he was in love with a boy back in the middle school days while we were drunk as shit at my other friend's place.

Maybe I'm just overreacting. I don't know. That's why I'm posting here. I *really* want him to be my friend, as he's an amazing person and the best company I could ask for. I just don't want him to, you know, be my boyfriend.",25Dec2018,1

Whenever someone insults me (if they really mean it), I can't take my mind off it, I get very anxious, and usually end up crying like a big baby when no one's around over it. I can't stand up for my rights, I just stay silent. And I generally let people walk all over me, just to avoid conflict.

392,"So I recently started seeing this guy that I met on tinder (I know, it’s already looking grim hahaha). I found out that he’s from another country and he is only in the US for about a year for work. Now, I clicked with this guy immediately. He has had so many life experiences and has been to so many places already. He’s just very interesting. I finally met up with him, and we’ve had 6 official dates. We’ve now been seeing each other for 2 months. 
I’ve never been in a relationship, and I still held on to my virginity (I’m 19 y/o).. I lost it to him recently. 
The issue: he’s only here for a year. Also, he was also showing me a video on his phone the other day, and as he clicked out, I saw he still had tinder (I shouldn’t care, we agreed we are not anything official) but it still got to me a little because I genuinely like this guy and lost my virginity to him
I’m starting to regret this whole situation because I wanted to be fully committed to someone before I just lost my virginity. I am aware that I could’ve waited to have sex, but I was curious (what 19 year old isn’t?)
I’m afraid I will get feelings too fast and too intensely and he won’t feel the same way. 
I’m also afraid if I continue this ‘fling’ that he will continue to sleep with other people and I get exposed to some sort of STD. Call me old fashioned but I just don’t want to be sleeping with someone who is sleeping with several other people (I guess I could ask but I’m not sure if that’s my business?? I’m new to this shit)

396,"Before starting I'd like to say I really hate confrontation and am usually a shy person.

I (f/20) have been living with two other guys (m/20 and m/21) for the past 3 months. We are all university students and are living in private housing for the year. As far as I know I'm the only one with a job.

Here's the thing - I'm always the one doing the cleaning. For the whole time we've been living together, I've always taken out the trash, cleaned the kitchen and living room and hall. In 3 months one of them cleaned the bathroom once. I try to keep things as tidy as possible by keeping the counters and floor clean, no dishes on the sink etc. But it's ridiculous how dirty they are. They'll clog up the sink and not clean it for a week, clog the toilet and not call anyone, just leave it be, and spill juices and other things on the floor and leave to dry making the floor sticky. My room is on the main floor which means I only go upstairs when I need to use the bathroom. While my floor is kept clean, their hall is a mess. There are dirty towels on the bannister and on the floor and empty toilet paper rolls everywhere.

Now, they are adults. They do have eyes on their faces and the ability to use them. I should not have to tell them that they made a mess and that they should clean up after themselves. But they wouldn't so I asked them both once if they could please clean up after themselves. They did the bare minimum of storing their trash away. Not so bad, at least it's not taking everyone's space. This was one month in. It's since been two months and the trash just kept accumulating (by trash I mean they would pack bags filled with whatever and just leave it anywhere in the kitchen - the table, the chairs, the carpet, even next to the bin we have that I took out weekly).

And then came the holidays. I knew they'd be gone, since they are from near by. Once again I asked them to please clean up their trash in the communal spaces, as my mom is coming to visit and I'd like to have a clean house. Both of them agreed - none of them did anything. I spent the entire morning today vigorously scrubbing months old stains that they made and were too lazy to clean up, gathering their scattered trash and just generally being disgusted by the things I've found, like mildew-ridden weeks old rice inside of a rice cooker. I haven't had the courage to start cleaning the bathroom yet, as I am afraid of what I might find.

I honestly don't know what to do. I've tried the civil approach, I think I should try the passive aggressive one. I've filled two black bags with the trash they left lying around and am thinking of leaving it between their rooms. I do not want to enable this sort of behavior any longer.

Please reddit, give me some advice.

Tl;Dr: my roommates are pigs who refuse to clean up after themselves even though I've asked them to. ",25Dec2018,1
397,"Alright. I don’t really know how to start this, but I’ll give it a try. Sorry, this is probably going to be long (I’m on mobile, sorry for formatting). I’m a 16 year old girl (I’m a sophomore in high school) and last night, my friend texted me. Although I don’t know her too well yet- I met her at a GSA meeting (I’m bi, and she’s attracted to girls, I assume, which will come into play later), I’ll call her a friend. 

So this friend, who I’ll call M, texted me. I’m on winter break right now and at least 6 states away from her. M texted me and said she was “drunk, and sad, and she wanted to die.” I don’t know her too well, so I’m not sure if she’s actually serious. Well, M continues to say that she “drank some stuff,” and when I asked her what, she said “two shots of vodka, sips of wine, whiskey, scotch, brandy, like three cigarettes, and then added some cuts to my arms bc u knowwww depression. lollll don’t report me.” She said she feels alone, broken, and she’s the worst person ever. She then texted that she threw up everything and bandaged her arms. By this point I’ve shown my mom all the texts because I have no idea what to do at all. I sent her the national suicide prevention hotline number, and all she said was “Ugh [friend] gave that number to me already.” I guess it’s good that she texted other people too? At least other people know to be on watch for her, too. Then... she asked me out. 
I deleted all the texts after this, so the story might be a bit cloudy. She kept saying I was beautiful, that I was out of her league, but that she really wants to date me. Now, I’m questioning myself. A lot. I don’t know who I am, right now. I’m bisexual, but I’ve also had thoughts about my gender identity and tried to bind my chest a few times (with sports bras, not bandages, don’t worry). This is beside the point, but I need to figure myself out before I date anyone. 

So M keeps saying she wants to date me and I’m so pretty and she’s not worth it and she should just die and leave me alone. I tried to calm her down, and it worked. I’ve been texting her periodically throughout the day, and I told her last night that I still expect her to be here today, because I like talking to her. After a few texts, I do admit that she’s really pretty and I like her, but I told her that she needs to focus on herself right now. I told her I’m here for her right now, but as a friend. I told her I’m not out to my parents (I’m not, currently building up the courage to do so. I came out to one person yesterday, which makes... 3 people? I’m getting there), I need to focus on school, I don’t want to date right now, but she just kept giving me solutions, like how she could help me study, and we could come out together. 

The thing is, I was thinking about her before I got those texts. She is really pretty and funny, and frankly there aren’t many LGBTQ+ people in our school, and if there are, I’m friends with them, so I don’t want to mess up friendships by dating, you know? Anyway, I would’ve dated M, but now... she needs to get help, and she seems resistant. She won’t let up on flirting with me, she’s coming on really strong, and I can’t deal with it. I need to take care of myself, but I don’t want to say anything that’ll make her kill herself. Literally. She’s really vulnerable right now, but I’m not out, and I can’t date her right now- and she won’t listen. I don’t want to be cold or harsh, but she needs to take care of herself first. I don’t know what to do. How can I even face her after break? What do I do?",25Dec2018,1
400,"Hello reddit :-)

I can’t think straight anymore about my relationship to my mom and I need some help figuring it out. 
I’m 20 and I have a very strained relationship to my mom, let’s call her Clara. 
Clara is a very strong, intelligent and creative woman but she also has a “dark side” (doesn’t everyone though?) 

Anyway, growing up, she would hit me often and sometimes be quite cruel (for example picking me up by the hair to get me to do extra math as a young child). She was quite cold but sometimes she was also very kind and loving. When I got bullied at school, she at first was sympathetic but quickly lost patience and the tables would turn, my sadness would provoke huge conflicts at come. I never thought of her as abusive, though I remember often wishing that I had different parents. My father wasn’t around much because he lived separately and worked a lot. 

When I was 14, I started drinking heavily and became depressed, and developed anorexia.  During this time I was convinced that Clara had borderline personality disorder after reading an article about it on a psychology website. This is where the real strain began, the real arguments. Before that I was too young and unaware to criticize her or to point out flaws. 
We would fight terribly and I would often hurt her feelings a lot by blaming her for my declining mental health, she however would blame me for “ruining the family”. 

When I was 16, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward for attempted suicide and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder myself. 
I wonder now as an adult if I am “evil” or “bad” and kind of invented the whole thing (even though the pain I feel is very real and I am often triggered and start crying if I talk about certain topics to my partner). Through being a psychology student I also often notice that I actually may have a lot of unresolved trauma from childhood. (I can elaborate on that if anyone is interested). 

I have a lot of self esteem  and inadequacy issues and also suffer from body dysmirphic disorder, as well as bouts of depression. I have gone through a lot of therapy and would no longer call myself borderline, however the pain still lingers. 

As an adult I have a lot of anger towards my mom, and we often fight because there is a tension which is in the background but it penetrates our relationship. 
For example today, she accused me of being jealous of her because of my body dysmorphia (she’s very tall and thin and pretty, I am very insecure about my appearance and this has been a reason for arguments often). Her boyfriend mixed himself into this and it ended in me shoving him, then him physically attacking me full force, after which I called the police. While waiting for them to come, I said some terrible things to my mom, told her “f*** you”, picked at her past mistakes and even spat (not at her but almost) becuse I was beside myself with hurt and anger. She did the same. Now, she won’t speak to me even though I tried to apologize because it’s Christmas Day and I want her to be happy regardless because in the end, she brought me into this world. 

The thing is, I’m not sure I love her and as I child I often wasn’t sure if she loved me, although When I confront her about this she insists she does and is hurt. I’m so confused and I don’t know if I’m just a terrible person maybe. 
People tell me I’m one of the most intuitive, sensitive, caring, loving and supportive/positive people they know and my mom told me the same when I was in hospital after the suicide attempt. I just don’t know which “side” of the relationship is more real because the two opposites aren’t harmonious with one another. 

Anyway I’m just looking for some thoughts, feeling super lost and confused and ashamed of myself. Maybe it’d be better if I didn’t exist (even though I know this is ridiculous and I think life can be amazing and I’m spiritual) 

Thanks for reading! Please share your thoughts and advice. Feel free to PM me also.

But in my last relationship it felt like nothing I'd experienced before, I felt I could be myself with him and he'd not reject me...but he did. 

He seemed right there with me, if anything he was leading the way : he pursued me, he was the on wanting to see me all the time, he was the first to say 'I love you', he took me to meet his family, etc. but he started becoming emotionally abusive and when I tried to talk to him about it he instantly dumped me. He clearly didn't love me to end it that way.

I just don't want there to be any awkward silences, however to combat this I've chosen ice skating (never went so we should be able to laugh at my failure) for the date. Which makes it so we don't have to talk the whole time.

I was not in any way, shape or form aggressive or rude but for some reason he felt attacked and told me (among other things) I need a detached home.

Earlier this month, I couldn’t get through to by law so I went to the door again..this time he gave multiple excuses and then the wife came home and started verbally attacking me too. End result, she calls the cops lol and says her son is crying because I come to their door relentlessly. I didn’t know relentlessly meant two times. I recorded the conversation before going to their door and they both threatened that they’re going to make more noise now which they have been doing (currently all fucking day).

Yesterday, we had lunch with my SDad's family. I've never really felt comfortable arround them, as they always treated me differently from their bio grandkids, but it's important for my dad, so once in a while I go along when they visit. His father (my Sgrandfather) has always been kinda creepy and weird, he grabs me by the waist/sideboob when saying hello/ goodbye, gives creepy looks, etc, but since he never escalated to anything else, it's been fine. 

Arround March this year, he (SGF) had multiple strokes, and was in pretty bad shape at the hospital. But he pulled through, recovered, and now only has some speech problems, it's kinda crappy, but compared to what it could've been, things worked out great for him.

He has been especially weird, but I've ignored it and blamed it on the episode, that left it's sequels, but yesterday, when I went over to say bye, he just straight up grabbed my boob. Not the sideboob, like the boob boob. I was instantly paralyzed, he didn't move his hand or anything, just left it on my boob and kinda squished it a bit. I said goodbye and ran out.

Now, it might've not been intentional, but I'm not sure if it was an accident. I'm 20, so if this happens to me, I'm weirded out for a sec, but not traumatized, but I have to smaller sisters, and a cousin, and I'm worried for them.

My father went to prison for a crime that went on for over 10 years. White collar. No one knew. It damaged the family severely. My mother attempted suicide after she found out.

My father is out of prison. My parents are still together. My mom is a pot-stirrer. She also likes to dump all of her shit on me which includes financial issues, being angry with my dad etc. About 2 months ago they came to visit me and my dad's mother said something to my mom that caused them to cut ties with her completely. Basically she said the reason my dad did what he did was for her and she needed to accept responsibility for what he did. 

She told me that she wanted to be sure that ""us kids still have a relationship with Grandma"". She told my sister she wanted ""us kids to cut all ties too"" and she told my brother nothing. My sister, who takes after our mother, decided she would TELL my grandma that my mom told her to cut all ties. This caused my grandma to be very upset and sad that we wouldn't come for Christmas. My brother and I did not know this was said at the time so imagine my grandma's surprise when we called to make our Christmas arrangements with her. 

This is getting super long. I feel super angry with my mom because the above is just the smallest most recent thing she has done to stir the pot. She then acts like it wasn't intentional and then says things like ""maybe it would be better if I just werent here anymore"" when we ask why she did it.

Tonight I called to wish my mom and dad a Merry Christmas and they thanked me for the gifts I sent. Immediately after I hung up my mom called my sister and told her that my ""feelings were hurt"" because she ""didn't pick up the Christmas package"" I sent to my sister and her kids. (She didn't pick it up because it hasnt even arrived yet thanks to a shipping issue...my mom KNEW THIS and made the rest up to stir the pot).

I have no idea what to do or where to go from here. I feel anger, sadness, loneliness and so much more. And expressing this to my mom and telling her she is causing me to feel this way ALWAYS results in her saying maybe we'd be better off if she were dead which just makes things worse.

I  have some social anxiety, I work retail though, so I've been getting  better and better, It's not really a problem with me being scared of  talking to people, I just feel super awkward sometimes when making small  talk and it discourages me from a lot of things.

At  my new job I've become friends with my coworker and I want to see if  she's interested at all in more, but I keep thinking about how awkward  it'll be in the future if she rejected me, or if she'd tell other  people, ect. I know I've got nothing to lose by just asking her. We aren't super close friends, but we do talk during work. Should I make a move and go for it?",25Dec2018,1
421," 

I apologize in advance for this long post.

My girlfriend and I have a complicated history. We met in college and were friends for around 8 months before she broke up with her boyfriend and then got together with me. We ended up dating for a couple months before she ended it due to still getting over her ex, and working on her own issues. We ended up getting back together a couple days later, as she thought I was truly a great guy and didn’t want to let that go. This was right before term ended for the summer and we were going to both head back to our respective cities where we lived, but we decided to make long distance work. It didn’t. We broke up about three weeks later and it hurt like hell but I wrote her a letter telling her I wasn’t resentful or angry and I would still support her (she was going through some very tough times) and that because I loved her, I would let her go because that was what was best for her. Fast forward a couple months and she has been contacting me rather frequently and is flirtatious and wants to see me before she goes on a month long trip abroad at the end of summer. We meet up and both break down realizing how much we both missed being together. We decided to wait until she came home from her trip to label what we were but as soon as she was home she asked me out and we have been truly both beyond happy and in love ever since.

However, right now, we are both on winter break for 4 weeks and won't be seeing each other for that time. The first week she was gone, she was very loving, and said how much she loved and missed me. We talked a lot and facetimed and were both missing each other desperately and excited to see each other once school started again. However, she has become seemingly distant in the past week or so and no longer mentions she misses me and only occasionally says she loves me usually after I do when I am on facetime with her saying goodnight. I'm a pretty anxious guy and I asked her if she was okay because she was acting weird. I knew she was pretty sick of being with her family and bored but it still seemed odd she was acting the way she was. I also briefly asked her if we were all good and she really hates talking about that sort of thing so she was uncomfortable but said yes everything was good. I think (?) this isn't entirely true, since her behavior has changed. I am afraid that I have been ""too available or needy"" over the last couple of days knowing I panicked a little. I'm guessing I should pull back and just give some space and trust that she probably just wants a little space but that's hard knowing the anxiety.

To add some final additional context, we are both in the same major and while we don’t spend time together in classes which we acknowledged would be difficult if things went wrong although neither of us saw that happening. She has also mentioned in the near past that she could see me as a boyfriend beyond college which made my heart explode with joy. But, with how she has been acting for the past 9 or so days, I really am worried. I know I overthink a lot of things, and am not always the most secure guy, but I hide it pretty well most of the time except on that day when I asked if she was okay, and if our relationship was. Finally I will add, that I know she isn't seeing anyone else, her family has needed her the vast majority of the time. Also, when we facetime things are great and we both seem happy, just a little less ""lovey"" from her side. 

With all this in mind, should I be worrying as much as I am? She and I have been through so much together which we both acknowledge that, and from our conversations just a little over a week ago, everything seemed so right and good. It is as if a flip switched over a couple days. Should I give her some space or just act normally? I see her in person in a week.

I greatly appreciate anyone's thoughts or opinions

422,"Hey, I'm 14, male, got ASD (Asperger Syndrome, to be specific) diagnosed and I'm having a really difficult time with getting friends lately.

It happens way too often when I meet a new person that I really feel like I click with, but when it comes to adding them on any platform like Discord or something I always get this huge anxiety kicking in and feel like I'm 'moving too fast' when I'm meeting someone I think is neat. I actually want speak to them outside of wherever (public server or chatroom) but I can't build up the courage to even add them as a friend or strike a conversation.

A good example happened today, I was playing a game (multiplayer) and met this fun girl that thought I was neat and I felt like she'd be a cool friend (or something like that) but it took me way too long to build up the courage to add them as a friend because anxiety. I'm very lonely and I kinda want new active friends.
We said hi and such and I was amazed she accepted the friend request and she said I was funny and great and then the convo died. I don't think I'll be talking anymore with her and she possibly doesn't want to talk with me any more than what we did???

This type of stuff occurs where I see a person I want to be friends with, build up a ton of courage to talk to them and it dies out and I feel like I'm doing it all wrong.

I only have two slightly active friends and I'm feeling all depressed over not being able to get new long-lasting active friends. It used to work out but ever since a few years ago I've just gotten terrible at making friends.

Any advice or feedback or anything, please?",25Dec2018,1
424,"My ex (M, 22) and I (F, 20) broke up over a year ago. He became sort of controlling and lied a lot, and so I decided to leave the relationship. He then proceeded to lie about getting raped, attempting suicide, and blamed me for it. I asked him for space and he never listened to me, proceeding to call me over 40 times in the span of two weeks, even after I blocked his number and asked him to stop contacting me. This was in December-January of 2018. It got to the point that I blocked him on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and even fucking Group Me because he wouldn’t leave me alone. We both worked at the same establishment, and I didn’t feel safe working with him, so I quit (he would use the work’s shift app to message me, knowing I wasn’t able to block him).I even changed my phone number. He even has this poetry blog and wrote an entire collection of poems that he wrote over a 6 month period about me and how “vampiric” I am. He told me it was about me, too. 

My friends and family have even told me that they’ve seen a car that looks like his parking outside of my house sometimes, and last month it almost hit my step mom and drove away. The next day, I received multiple follower requests from a film group he is in at his school. My profile is now set to private, and so I rejected the page. 7 times in less than an hour. I decided to DM the page and his University’s Instagram detailing the situation, and asked that he is under no circumstance allowed to use his school’s student pages as I believed he was attempting to get in touch with me, despite my explicit instructions to not contact me. 

The car stopped coming around after that, but then something really weird happened. 

I have a finsta, and it has 2 followers (whom he doesn’t know) and has no pictures of me on it. My name isn’t on it, and I have changed my email and phone number so it is not connected to anything the could track me with. But last night, he followed me on the account. I immediately messaged him telling him to leave me the fuck alone, and blocked his account right after. I have no idea how he found it and it makes me scared. 

My family told me to email his school’s Title IX coordinator detailing the situation and I’ve made an information report to the police, but I feel really bad. I don’t want to get anyone in any trouble, and I don’t want to ruin anybody’s academic career. I just want the behavior to stop. Plus, I don’t think an investigation would really go anywhere because I can’t prove he was outside of my house and the other stuff would barely get a harassment charge legally. But I’ve already made the report and I feel really stressed about it and really don’t want to deal with this. I’m just looking for just some sort of advice—whether it be emotional or legal. It’s just really really stressful.

425,"So I’ve been talking to this girl a lot over Snapchat and we really have been hitting jt off. She has talked about how we should go on a date and I would love that but she hasn’t seen me in person before and I feel like I should tell her that I’m short(5”5). 

I don’t know how tall she is, but I want to notify her that I’m kinda short before we meet. I have no idea what to ask/tell her so I can actually say that I’m short without randomly throwing it out there.

Any suggestions in how I should go about this?
