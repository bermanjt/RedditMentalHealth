0,"She trusts me and she is really like a little sister to me, so of course the first thing I did was comfort her. But I was so distraught when I heard this, not to mention that the pathetic fuck who assaulted her is still out there. It just makes me sick to my stomach knowing that this happened, and I want to do something. 
1. Is there anything that I can do legally? I believe that he was 17 and she was 14/15, so they were both minors. And is there a statue of limitations?
2. Is there anything else I can do? Nothing illegal of course, but maybe confront this person (without violence or harassment or anything other illegal activities!)?

Please help, I am just so distraught and sorry for her. ",05Jan2018,8
1,"I think something is wrong with me. I am pretty certain I lack the capability to feel empathetic. I have been faking social interactions, friendships throughout my life. I am at a point where the stress is way too much. I believed at some point that I could fix this. I have come to realize that the reason is simple. I was not given love early in my life, and such, I do not and will never know how to give love to others. I want to start accepting the fact that I am an inconsiderate asshole and move on with my life. I wanted to become a researcher. But there is too much burden on social interactions, I cannot handle it anymore. I know that I will not be able to live like this, put on smile, talk casually with others. I guess I was here to look for advice on what I could do to move on. ",05Jan2018,6

3,"I honestly don't know much about what makes girls happy because I've never had a girlfriend in my entire life and they have always avoided me when I tried to talk to them. I've ended up in some sort of awkward thing with tow different girls who I will refer to as ""Miss E"" and ""Miss K"" because I was raised a gentleman and I don't think it would be appropriate to put their names on the Internet.(don't worry I use their real names in real life)

As I said there never really were any girls who were into me. There was one freshman Miss E though who seemed different. She was gorgeous and she laughed when I told jokes and she smiled whenever she saw me in the hallway. I ate lunch with her for about a month and we seemed to be getting along fine. She even called me handsome. I asked her to the Halloween dance but she said she didn't have a costume and I didn't think she was lying to me. A few days later I asked if she would like to go to a movie with me and a few friends she said she was busy. At that point I began to suspect she wasn't into me. A day later my suspicions were seemingly confirmed when she said that she  ""didn't know how she felt about me and to give her time to think"" she also basically told me to stop eating lunch with her. I came back a week later and I asked how she felt. Miss E literally *cringed* in front of me and said it was all too fast. 

After that I was really fucking depressed. I had to go to consoling through my school every Monday. I didn't even feel like doing anything anymore and nothing seemed fun. Talking to my councilor helped a lot and she motivated me to get fit and to improve my hygiene. I changed my hairstyle I started exercising daily and started worrying about my looks. Even after all of that Miss E was still trying to avoid me. And she never said a word if I said hi to her in the hallway. 

I gave up and started talking with her friend Miss K. Miss K isn't as pretty but she's still cute and she is smart and she seems to enjoy being around me. When my school went to Starbucks(it's small enough for the entire high school to go their at once actually). I got her some hot chocolate with my own money. That made her smile. She said she really appreciated it or something like that. 

I didn't see Miss K again until after winter break was over. Yesterday when I got back from school I didn't get to talk to her because Miss E is her best friend and it would feel weird to talk to both of them. Today Miss E seemed to be looking at me differently. She smiles whenever I pass her by in the hallway even though she doesn't say anything. After school she saw me staring looked at me and grinned saying ""don't do anything weird.""

I honestly don't know if either of them are into me and I don't know how to talk to them if they are. Or which one to talk to. That's where you come in I guess?

Note: If you're wondering why I'm going after freshman it is because my school is a tiny special ed school and both of the senior girls have boyfriends. Same thing with the Juniors and Sophomores.

Edit: my mom said I shouldn't assume miss E is into me and she might be making fun of me.",05Jan2018,4
4,"Around 4 years ago I moved to Canada and met my first best friend. Im gonna call him David. David and I were friends for about 3 years until one day we got into an argument and he called me the n-word. After that we didn't talk at all.

5,"A little backstory, I am a college student and stripping is always something I’ve been interested in but never pursued (living in Southern California it’s an insanely competitive market apparently). But just hitting the dance floor at parties throughout college earned me a little reputation. 

Fast forward to now, a good friend calls and asks if I could be the stripper and her friends birthday party. She says it’s going to be about 10-15 girls that for the most part I don’t know (besides two I know well who had the idea)

I have a few questions like how do I go about conducting a show? Showing a couple moves on a dance floor is one thing but how do you keep it going when it’s all eyes on you for all that time? What should I wear? Should I shave everything? If there’s a lull when I’m up there is there anything I can do the change gears and keep the party going?

Any and all advice is appreciated.

10,"I live in a small, 4 unit apartment building. Across the hall from me is the landlord's son who has been in and out of jail for dealing drugs and a lot of other things. I'm not one to judge another person's life, but the issues that come from him dealing drugs is getting out of hand.

There are so many people coming and going at all hours of the day/night that it makes me uncomfortable when I come up to my door to see a stranger standing there.

Last night, someone left the building and moments later, the fire alarm started going off because they had been smoking in the hall right by the front door.

To top it all off, We have a single lane driveway that leads from the street to the back of the building where we have a gravel parking lot. His ""customers"" tend to park in that driveway or directly in front of it, obviously preventing anyone from entering or leaving the lot. The major issue is that my upstairs neighbor is a firefighter who lives about 15 minutes away from his station. If he has to wait for these people to get back to their car and move it, it could literally mean life or death.

I don't know if I should contact my landlord(his father) because he babies his 27 year old son(who hasn't paid his dad the $180/month rent in 8 months, while I've been diligently paying $500 every month for over a year). His dad has told me several times that he knows his son is a fuck up, but he allows him to continue to live in this building with his other tenants, despite the drug dealing and not paying his super fucking cheap rent.

Should I go outside and confront the people blocking the drive? It happens so often that I'd have to live in my winter coat and go outside every 30 minutes.

I can't afford to move, so that's out of the question.

I don't want to get my neighbor in trouble with the police(I'm sure at this point with all his priors, he'd be looking at a lot of jail time) and I don't want to be the cause of his life being ruined.

16,"Got in an ""row"" with the person I directly work with today. I couldn't come in today because I was injured and she sent some really mean text messages about it and tried to demand for me to come in even though physically I couldn't. I highly suspect she is bipolar; this is not the first issue I have had with her. She has yelled at me in front of students (we work for a school) and she has extreme highs and lows, never anything in the middle. I know she's dealing with a lot but it doesn't excuse treating me poorly. I've seen her change her mood 180 pretty quickly, too. 

Anyway, after she sent me mean texts and then a pretty awful e-mail, I'm assuming she'll want to talk tomorrow. And that's fine, I think we obviously need to clear the air and I need to set her straight from her misunderstandings. 

The thing is, I have heard her talking on the phone with people, or have seen her interact with people who have not agreed with her and it's always been ugly. We work so closely together that it's not like I can't talk to her at all or avoid her; so when we do see each other, we're going to have to address the elephant in the room.

18,"sorry if the title is confusing

A few months ago when I was in the city centre, a middle aged man approached me and asked me to help set up the free WiFi service. After I helped him, he attempted to engaged in conversation, quickly talking to me about all of his problems (went to a homeless shelter, divorced etc.). At the time I wanted to leave and not engage in conversation at all but I stayed anyway  - I did not know how to leave. He seemed desperate to talk to someone and his problems did seem legit. Now, looking back, I should’ve just left without a word. He asked for my email so he could contact me but I refused (had difficultly saying no - I’m bad at excuses).

I have seen him twice again before today, both by accident whilst I was at the city centre. Both times I stopped by to talk to him, and made excuses to leave. I don’t want to sound shallow, but I don’t really want to get close to someone who is 30+ years older than me - I am 18, 17 when I met him. Furthermore, I have a right in the people I choose to talk to - I just don’t know how to avoid conversation when he just comes up to me.

Today I went back in town for the first time in a month, and by coincidence he saw me when I was in the library. He sat down next to me and started a conversation about his new job. I told him my parents were going to come, then he left the library  immediately... he was there for no more than two minutes.

Now, before today I did not feel that uncomfortable with this total stranger. But after he left immediately after I told him my parents are going to come, I was super uncomfortable. If I see him again, I don’t want to acknowledge him; I don’t know him and I don’t want to know him. I know it’s my right to choose who I engage in conversation with.

Should I just blank him? I don’t want to know him anymore. That would be awkward though. I already have some anxiety when going out (hence why I hardly do)...
Also apologies if it sounds like I’m whining about nothing. I just don’t know get him to stop recognising me, and talking to me.

30,"So where do i begin...a little backstory...

Im a 22 yo guy currently seeing a girl thats 19 yo and we have been dating for 8 months now

-She lives in a city half and hour away from me -She is in her first year of collage -She is not the most beautiful girl in the world (she is to me but sometimes i lose sight of this, please try to understand me, i am not a native speaker so bare with me pls :) )

My previous relationship

-I met a girl from a foreign country -we dated for about 4 months (this was about a year ago) -we saw eachother altogether for maybe 8 days out of the 4 months (i went to her twice) -she was my first girlfirend -she broke up with me saying she needed to take a break from dating on and on but in reality she left me for another guy which broke me a bit as it does -not 2 montha later i started talking online (again) with my current gf -at first we were friends with benifits but after a while we were in a relationship

Now a little about me -im anxious -i tend to be clingy -i over analyise things -i tend to jump to conclusions -i cant seem to function unless theres a problem present sometimes to the extent that i enjoy other ppls problem and try to solve em or in extreme cases create probs

And now the issue

So from the start to right about now ive been hesitant to enter the relationship, cuz i wasnt really ready, but when i did my mind started fuckig shit up, and i wondered has it or not.

To clerify, i love her, shes very near and dear to my heart, but we easly run out of things to talk about, we rarely do anything when we see each other, except for watch movies and have sex.

She is more dominant sometimes and likes things her way or no way like a brat but she is young so i can get that.

And im a bit spoiled no work around the house, im childish, and clingy ao im not perfect as well

Now problems combined with my anxiety tend to fool me, like is it my bad expiriance, or is this relationship shit, or what ia happening

We truly love each other and we've been through some shit together i was there to revive her in a sense cuz as she says she was dead and bored before me, and she was there when i had problems with my dad.

But ive always felt like im on a cliff a step away from breaking up with her, but then i dont and we see each other and things are mostly fine but then she leaves or i leave and my brain is like shes dull, shes ugly you have nothing in common, shes cheating on you, find someone better etc...

I ask u, with the info i give you, do you have some tips for me to save this thing or should i just leave her, it would kill me, so i wanna make sure to save it and do everytjing before letting her go if i have to...

31,"i have a friend whom i’ve considered a bestfriend for years now. however, ever since she’s been trying for relationships with guys, and rather unsuccessfully has found a few, she basically ghosts me because she’s so obsessed with the idea of relationships. i’m always very supportive, always wish her the best of luck and urge her to be careful because she often makes very reckless decisions. but when it comes down to it, it seems like she only reaches out to me when she has inevitable time away from whoever she’s currently seeing, or if she is having issues with them. it often makes me want to cut her out of my life completely, because while i genuinely love and enjoy her company no matter my relationship status, it seems as though she pushes me to the back of her mind when theres a romantic interest in the picture, until there’s hardly anyone else to keep her company since she has virtually no friends, and only has boy toys.

Over the years i have done so much for her, whether it be letting her stay with me for days, sometimes a week or more, at a time to get away from her hectic house hold. i’ve fed her, bought her an abundance of things over the years, mostly bc she won’t keep a job, but she’s never seemed truly appreciative of those things. she’s often tactless and self centered without even knowing it. what sucks, is that when we hangout we have the time of our fucking lives and we get along great. i just don’t know if it’s rational to cut her off, but i do know that i feel incredibly under appreciated and unneeded/wanted. i’ve expressed these things to her before, and she acts sorry, but doesn’t really change anything about it. if she does, it doesn’t last.

35,"Okay, I just realized the solution to a problem that has been bothering me for a while. I had a really hard time defining what I should do and self analysis was super difficult to do. But now I have got a very clear image of what I'm looking for.

I think closed systems of information are uninteresting. Learning knowledge about a finite system of things such as the universe tend to have a serious plateau of value input vs meaning output. The more you look at smaller scale things the less they feel like they have an impact. An example is politics, you accept a world model that is best for improvement, but after that you are just learning of specific occurances. You learn the big big concepts first, but after that you get into the meat and data. It takes more labor to learn relatively less(like your world model changes less and less the older you get because you are accumulating knowledge). Learning that relative lessness serves humans less than when you were learning a shit ton and learning a ton about humans. (It's like spending 10 minutes to learn 50% of humans vs spending 2 years to go from 70% knowledge to 73% knowledge)

The only thing that matters is human enjoyment essentially since everything will eventually perish a billion years or however long from now.

So the question is, what are analytical imaginative fields that affect people alot and allow you to be around others a decent amount?

Tl;DR: What are analytical subjects that you can obsess over long term that aren't ""knowledge""/learning. Kind of like creatively building things constantly like those activities in school classes where you would take a roll of scotch, spaghetti, string, some other item and compete to make the best one.

Edit: my biggest drive in my personality is the process of achieving this pay off practically in an analytical field.",05Jan2018,0
36,"Hi,

This post will be long.

To explain this predicament better, I have to introduce three people to whom I'll give fake names: Josephina, Holly, Michael, and Brendan.

- Josephina is the best friend who I betrayed.

- Holly is one of my other best friends.

- Michael is the past boyfriend of Holly; he cheated on her, but another romance between them is budding.

- Brendan is Josephina's boyfriend who she met a little while after we began talking.

This is high school. I am aware that love and romance is not akin to reality. Also, I am a male who likes males if that adds to anything.

Anyway, I've known Josephina throughout elementary school, middle school, and now highschool, but I had barely spoken to her until October. From thereafter, we became best friends.

She explained to me that I am the only person on whom she can depend--later she met her Brendan who helps her also. Her entire life she has been everyone else's rock, so I was special to her.

It turned out Michael attempted sexual assault on her and had touched her sexually many times. I believe this because one of my other friends told me he had done this to her while they were together. Josephina was on the verge of suicide in October but has recovered since then.

I asked Josephina if I could tell Holly because I didn't want Holly hurt. Eventually Josephina agreed on the condition that I didn't mention her name.  Holly knew that Michael had been accused before. She spoke to him after I told her about the situation with Josephina and he denied everything.

He mentioned Josephina's name while denying everything, arousing suspicion in Holly's mind. Holly and I were talking and she threw out the name Josephina, to which I didn't deny because I wasn't thinking. My unintentional continuation of the discussion confirmed in Holly's mind that the girl who accused him was in fact Josephina.

Josephina was temporarilly confused and and a bit angry with me because I left her in the about the whole thing (I didn't explain well enough in a rushed text and didn't answer her responses because I was sleeping) and was absent the next day at school. When I reexplained the situation to her she told me it was OK, since everyone makes mistakes and it wasn't intentional. That was the first time I hurt her.

Next, Josephina has a tendency to emit a dark and negative atmosphere when speaking with her. She's been through so many horrendous experiences in life that this is only expected, but it is also offputting and it can feel painful to be around her. At a dark time in her life a couple weeks ago, I couldn't take it anymore and I ignored her for about a week and a half. When she wanted to talk, I would tell her I was with my other friends (which wasn't a lie), and she became envious and felt betrayed that I wasn't spending time with her. Despite the fact that I asked if I was hurting her by taking a break, she told me it was fine because she didn't want to cause me stress.

This blew up later and she told me how she truly felt. She was outwardly hurt, she told me she felt betrayed at one point and she was angry with me because I hadn't told her earlier. This was betrayal two.

Finally, while Josephina and I were mending our friendship after my second time, I told my mom and my sister something that I shouldn't have. We were on vacation, it was 1:00 (30?) AM, and I was vomiting everything out from my mind. 

They were asking about Josephina; my sister wanted to see pictures of her because she remembered her being fat (which she isn't at all, seriously). When I showed the pictures to my sister she concluded that she was a little bit fat once again. I did something bad--I told my mom and my sister both about Josephina's bulimic tendencies and body dismorphic disorder. I don't know why other than I wanted to prove to them that she was going through things, to show that she wasn't weak for whatever reason (NOT a valid excuse), and I didn't even realize that what I did was so bad until the next day when it had been edging on my conscience. This was the worst thing I'd done to her.

I ended up telling Josephina what I had done while our friendship was still suffering. She was hurt, confused, the same things as before except more intense. I was stressing her out to no end and she said she still loved me and that I was on thin ice. She said she doesn't want drama in her life. She said I have one more chance and she doesn't want to have to pretend I'm dead because it would hurt her.

This pained me. For the first day I felt stabbing pains in my chest. I hated myself. I wondered why I was so defective.

She told her boyfriend to tell me to stop texting her because I was stressing her out. He threw insults at me, told me I was blind to the fact that I was causing her stress, called me a dumbass. I later showed those messages to her and she said he wasn't wrong but she had wished he'd taken a softer approach.

Now I'm looking back on everything that has happened. I'm beginning to think she's blowing some of my mistakes a bit out of proportion. I regret telling her that I told my relatives about her eating disorder because I now feel that it was something that was kind of arbitrary; they would never do or say anything to anyone. Obviously it was negative that I told them but I don't think it was evil.

I want to end this off with the fact that Josephina is a one-of-a-kind person, and she's doing fantastic with what she's been given. I would never intentionally hurt her.

With all this said, we are planning on talking about what to do tomorrow; would you please give advice on how to digest everything and how to handle it maturely?

Thank you for reading if you did.",05Jan2018,1
37,"This is a pretty long story but I’ll make it as short as possible. 
This year I moved across the country and moved schools. On the first day,I noticed one guy staring at me while he was with his friends during lunch. He found the guts to go up to me and call me pretty and stuff and “Isn’t she pretty?” Then the week ended. 
I was excited to open up the second week since I made a few friends, but I found out he moved to another state! Like what was the point of attending school? Lol but anyway, I followed his Instagram, I tried sliding in the dm but it seemed like he wasn’t interested at all.  
He found out I played this game league, and we played together but never had a convo. 
He then came back to my school three months later out of the blue. He was in my class once I walked in. He looked at me all the time. But he hasn’t said a word to me. The next week, he asked for a hug out of nowhere. It was a quick side hug and he walked away real quick after. (note that he isnt one of those weirdos, but he kinda is considered I guess popular) He still hasn’t said a word to me since that, it’s been about a month? 
Ever since he came back, everyone goes up to me asking if I like him, or telling me they ship me and him. It makes me feel anxious because, I don’t know why he doesn’t talk to me. I feel he thinks I’m weird, but I don’t know. Sometimes I feel like he hates me. Idk. I just at least want to be friends but it seems like he doesn’t want to be friends either. ",05Jan2018,1

39,"Here is the situation. 
This final assignment in my final course of my Masters program is a research and thesis assignment. At this university, in this faculty, it is standard for the master thesis supervisor to mark the thesis assignment. I know that is the first mistake of the university but hold on. 
The online published mark was 74% for the final assignment which was a surprise and my supervisor sent me a separate message saying that the professor of the course ignored his marking and that he had given me a high H1 (90s). I messaged the professor, my supervisor and the assistant dean of the faculty asking what was going on. The assistant dean said that she was approached for a remark and that my thesis mark couldn't be higher than my last years average grade. After sending a politically charged email about the faculties pedagogy the assistant dean advised the professor to take an average of the two (supervisor mark and average of last year = 82%) which already doesn't make sense. The professor ignored the advice of the assistant dean and sent it to the chief examiner.
I contacted the student union who forwarded the assessment and reporting policies of the university, which states that the thesis is supposed to be marked by two unbiased markers but that wasn't the initial faculty process. The chief examiner is also only meant to be involved for failing marks and if 2 blind markers disagreed by more than 10%. Which was also not the situation since there was only one mark from my supervisor.
I quoted the policy guide and the current situation (how everyone else will receive their supervisors grade) to the chief examiner who then past on the paper to two new markers anyway. During this time I had been emailing back and forth trying to get explanation on why I had to go through this in the first place and why no one else in the program was, unsuccessfully receiving any responses to my questions. Also during this time I had my graduation to which I now have my master paperwork from. 
This final grade is what is supposed to average with my previous assignment mark in order to finalize my transcript. Just this past Wednesday I received the outcome of the double marking which was averaged to 52%.
I am outraged and in disbelief. From 90 to 74 to a 52 is absolutely unbelievable.
I sent an email back questioning the consistency of the grading process and inability to agree on how to follow a rubric but have had no response. In the email it said that I could take their feedback and resubmit but at this time I don't value or believe in their grading abilities. I don't know what to do.
Should I accept the mark and suffer the possibility of never being able to do a PhD? Should a give up my time and address their feedback and resubmit (and possibly receive a lower mark)? Should I fight the system and contact higher ups or ombudsman? Or is there a better solution that I'm not seeing?

I would appreciate any advice you could give.",05Jan2018,3
42,"Heads-up, this is a long post and has a lot of details.

Hi, I'm coolpants, I have a issue and I really need feedback or some form of advice. Let's start from the beginning. 

I've recently moved back to my old high school that I was in freshmen year and transfering from it to another for sophomore year. Since I've came back, I noticed something. Things were different, they felt different. Friends that I've grown a strong bond with freshmen year have left me for others or even straight avoid me at all cost. I missed the gang a lot during that period of being in the new school so I would often join their chats and try to talk to them or even try to hang out but none the less nothing. My old friends are people that moved on and that I understand. The problem is what is ahead. I was lonely. I sit everyday under a sole tree in my school yard and listen to music. I grew thoughts of suicide and other things simliar like self harm. It wasn't until I joined the school performing arts club where I notice a change. Joining the club I've met some people. In particular, of these people are two girls that I often chat with. I'm a very secluded person I don't like bumping into conversations and such so they are my pals to a certain extent as in I talk to them a lot if they aren't talking to anyone. The girls, (for the sake of keeping their identities safe, for personal reasons) Allie and Tina, They're both smart and extremely comforting. But, my problems seems to be that  I've grown attached to one of them. Both of them are extremely social and have lots of friends. This attraction grew because one night a few days ago from today around 3am, I finally came out to someone on my thoughts. She expressed concern as well and even told be she has had them too and even wanted to talk about my past. She was concerned with my feelings and that made her attractive to me. My problem is the coming out. I'm asexual and I want her to know that I have her back as well as she had mine.

 I don't know if I expressed this well, words and stuff aren't for me. I love her as a person and I want her to know that without being too forcive or outright. I just want to protect her.

TLDR, I grown out of my social life, joined a club at school met someone, want to protect them without being too forced

44,"The person in question here is my younger sister (18 years old). Recently I've come to realise that she has no real concern for consequences and it's really upsetting.

Only a month after she got her Provisional License (we live in Australia) she was caught speeding 3 times in a week for 12 points total which was 4 times more than Provisional drivers are allocated. After she lost her license she kept driving, no regard for the huge potential risk she was putting herself in, and obviously she was caught for this too, last week she was pulled over and fined $1700 for a collection of reasons.

Recently, she's been seeing an ex boyfriend, and my parents and I are less than pleased because this guy hasn't really improved my sister as a person, and most likely damaged her personality in some way. They dated for 4 years and personally I feel like this guy has had his time in our lives and by focussing on the past she's limiting the potential of her future.

I wanna keep this post somewhat short but she also smokes while having quite bad asthma.

Despite the countless times myself and my parents have spoken to her, warned her about risks and poor decisions, she doesn't listen and it feels asthough she doesn't even accept she's wrong when we're proven right.

I'm not sure whether I want to keep pushing and trying to help or just let her keep making mistakes and not changing for the better.",05Jan2018,5

46,"Alright I’m going to get right to the point. My dad died when I was about 5 when he committed suicide. I didn’t know the reason my father died until I was about 15, mom always told me it was a accident out of state and I was so young no questions were asked. My mother recently passed away in 2016 from liver failure. With that being said, I have been reconnecting my family with aunts, uncles, and cousins I didn’t know I have. 

My uncle on my dad’s side wants to visit in March and I have a burning urge to ask to see the note that was left by my father before he passed. I don’t even know if my uncle has it or the slightest clue to where it might be. 

My name is mentioned inside of the note and my curiosity of what it says has only grown since I first found out. I was never told what it said all I know is it was about how much I will be missed. My mom would always start crying before she could tell me, also, I think years and years of trying to forget my dads death she kind of forgot what it said. 

Now I’m just kind of stuck because I don’t know how I would ask to see such a thing. “Hey, do you have my dads suicide note” might be a little too blatant. I haven’t really spoken with my uncle for about 8 years, just the occasional seasons greetings.  

Should I ask? And if so how would I? Should I just forget about it and carry on, imagining what it might say? 

I have a wonderful life and am not looking for sympathy or trying to offend anyone with this post, if you are suffering I encourage you to talk to someone and be strong! You never know who will need you or when they might need you!! I am just looking for some advice and anyone who has ever gone through something similar,

48,"I'm a college senior coming up on my last semester, and I work a part time job for my school's recreation department. I started as a weight room monitor. Over the summer I was promoted to shop attendant, and shortly after they promoted me again to the office as a student administrative assistant / receptionist. 

I really enjoyed working as the shop attendant and didn't actually want to move up to the office, but I figured that it would look good on a resume. As a shop attendant I was left to my own devices in the basement, and was allowed to read during down time. After working in the office for a while I realized that I dread coming in to work now, and I feel like it's just not a good fit for me. You make $10.75 for working in the office, but with the minimum wage going up to $10.40 just recently in my state, this is now only a $0.35 raise, compared to what the weight room monitors make (either my boss didn't update my pay or the school won't pay us more). Additionally, my boss sits in a room right behind me at all times, and really makes me feel stressed out when I try to do my job (not that he does anything wrong, just the fact of my employer being in the room with me makes me self conscious). I keep making mistakes on paper work or giving customers incorrect information, and it's really bringing me down. I hardly ever made mistakes as a shop attendant, and was pretty thorough in doing my job. I'm allowed to read and use my phone during down time, but it's not the same as being downstairs. If I was making good money at this job I wouldn't care as much, but it's only part time and I have other things that are more important to me right now. 

The job really has no relevance to anything I want to do in the future, but I would like to stay on good terms with my managers and employer. I really just want to move back down as a shop attendant, even if I don't get the raise anymore. I used to love coming to work, but now I hate it.",05Jan2018,7

53,"My whole life i’ve been severely allergic to cats. If I’m anywhere near a cat and touch my face, my eyes swell, my nose clogs, I cough, and my lungs tighten up. I also have asthma so it creates a serious problem. I can’t even borrow clothes from friends who own cats because it’s so bad.

I live in an apartment with 3 roommates and we all have our own rooms. A month ago, over winter break, one of our roommates texted us and told us she got a kitten. All my other roommates were so excited and welcoming, but I had to tell her that i’m severely allergic. She just said she would keep the cat in her room. I have never lived with a cat before because of my bad allergy. Our apartment has windows but they don’t open. We only have 1 balcony door in the living room for ventilation. She says she will keep the cat in her room, but I have no idea if the dander will spread through the air and vents. 

I moved in late, so I was just the 4th additional roommate. So, i feel awkward being the roommate who just “jumped in” but is killing the fun for everyone because of my allergy. Tomorrow I move back in and the cat has been there for several weeks. She seems to be putting me through some manipulative test trial to see if I can handle it.

I’m worried about living there now and I don’t want to be uncomfortable in my own room. I also don’t want to cause roommate issues. The lease I signed stated our room would be “pet free” but somehow my roommate got away with it. I don’t want to be the “tattletale” to the leasing office on my roommate about this cat but I don’t know what to do. I’ve also already moved once this year so moving would not be an option, and finding a subletter would be impossible this time of year.

My family says everyone has bad roommates and we have to learn to live with people. Yes, it’s true that part of growing up and maturing is learning to deal with other people. That would apply if my roommates and I didn’t get along. This is different because it’s a matter of my health.

59,"I'm a pretty regular 20 year old guy. I have a very busy schedule that involves working full time and immediately after going to school at night, and unfortunately having a girlfriend has yet to have been a focus or a priority in my life.

Recently this past year I've developed what I believe to be a bad habit of having sex with random girls on dating sites such as Tinder or Bumble. It's usually around one to two girls per month, at most three. I've come to terms that I've developed this habit to satisfy my sexual needs, considering my hands get pretty boring after awhile.

Every time I engage in sexual intercourse, I always take the necessary precautions to avoid at best pregnancy or STD's. I always wear a condom, and most of the time I'll even pull out while still wearing the condom to ejaculate outside of her (in the condom) because of my immense fear of getting a girl pregnant and subsequently ruining my life. (I'll even test the condom after every time to check for any leaks/breakage prior to disposing of it.)

After pretty much every encounter, the weight of having possibly gotten her pregnant lingers over my mind constantly, to the point that sometimes I'll even lose sleep over it. I realize the best method to prevent pregnancy is abstinence, and usually I head into these encounters planning on being ok with everything but sex, although I'm sure as you all know, one thing leads to another, and I find myself in a similar situation.

Honestly. Is this something rational to be fearing? Or irrational? I'm not here for comfort, I'm here for the truth. I always hear that condoms are effective 98% of the time if used properly, but I never understand if that means 2% of the time they break, or 2% of the time the girl gets pregnant... Please help me identify the rationality of this fear!

70,"Honestly I feel a little like a child and I have been in emotional turmoil for the last few days having a silent, yet on the verge, brake down. 

Its hard to start a long tale of personal issues regarding family life but I feel I am out of options as to who to ask. 

My father is a very eccentric, strict and a damn right terrifying person, someone who isn't really in my life and yet has such a hold on me. He is not a great person, beat my mother for years and somehow without trying, makes me feel awful every time I talk to him, if the conversation we have at the time is bad then i'm just angry and pissed, however if the conversation is good I feel guilty, a gut wrenching guilt that makes me not eat and pretty close to just swelling up in tensed sadness. 

My so believes I should cut him out of my life due to the anguish I am caused. My problem is that I can see that he is suffering, he barely contacts his own children, he is genuinely a alcoholic, he is obviously suffering with depression and yet I feel torn and helpless. I will become depressed if I cut him out of my life but I don't know if I can keep being a ghost of a person every time I talk to him. I've recently seen him and my heart is breaking in all area's of the meaning. I want to help him so, so much but I can't. I can't help him because he doesn't want help.

Any way lately I have been in contact with him (the usual Christmas and birthday contact only, throughout a whole year) and I received a message from him saying he'd been in hospital but was fine (no details found out later he might have had a heart attack, and there is a shadow behind his right kidney), so far all is well. 

This is why I am in distress and I don't know what to do, whether I should allow the guilty part of me to at least offer a partial contact of conversation with him or if I should completely cut him off. It sounds pathetic but due to the historical aspects of the relationship I have with my father, I find it hard to talk to him. Its a constant lecture with a man who is always right no matter the hard facts that say otherwise. A man who is hurt and suffering but won't help himself, he's so depressed that he can't even clean his own home. Its the worst place i'v ever been to and the worst thing is that he knows. Oh and when I saw him he'd thought he'd mention that he started talking to the person who sexually abused me when I was five. so yeah there's that too. 

I just feel pity and guilt for him as well as being caused emotional hurt because of his actions, therefore subsequently i'm a big ball of wound up stress and I don't know what I can possibly do to help him as well as helping myself and I just wanted to know if anyone  has/is currently in a relationship that's similar, whether they need advice too or has some really needed advice for me and others.

Everytime we are discussing in a group or passes by my desk he always has to say something against me like im his target. He calls me a p*ssy and tries to put me down every chance he gets. I thought at first he was just messing with me but I figured out he has something against me. Sometimes we are alone hes nice and sometimes hes just an asshole. He seems like he wants to fight me or something like that. I'm a little smaller than him in size and thinks Im weak probably. I'm not the kind of person to look for trouble. Everyone else is nice with me except this asshole. How do I deal with this? I don't want to do something bad to him as Im a calm person but get really frustrated with this kind of shit. I think hes bipolar.

73,"Throwaway account because she looks at my reddit but me and my girlfriend play video games a lot together. Every once in a while we'll have some dumb argument that we sort out immediately because ultimately it's not that important but just like 10 minutes ago we were playing. She's been asking me to do something for her because she didn't want to. She needs something crafted but only people with higher crafting can do it so I told her to get somebody in our guild to help. She was begging me to do it and after an hour I finally gave in and just said ""Okay just give me the materials and I'll go do it"" and she immediately declined after an hour of begging and is now refusing to talk to me and is very obviously upset. I'm so fucking confused right now on how her mood just 180'd from perfectly fine to being extremely upset. I tried talking to her about it and she's just giving me the silent treatment.

74,"My mother in law divorced her husband after 30 years, took all the liquid assets as her half, and married someone else within six months. Her new husband was in prison for child molestation. We retrieved his conviction records from the local county courthouse after she announced their marriage, and saw there were thousands of dollars in unpaid fines and legal fees. We warned MIL about finances and our concerns.

It’s been 18 months since then, and now it appears she’s broke. She’s always on Pinterest, pinning things about how to save money and cut expenses. She sent everyone a box of anise cookies for Christmas gifts (no one even likes anise cookies...they’re cheap to make and durable to ship). We also think she may have taken a second mortgage out against her home (that she paid for, and he was not involved with).

Our biggest concern is that he’s taking her for all she’s worth. The hard part is, we’re pretty much no-contact with her at this point. She’s manipulative (she lied to us for months about why she wanted a divorce) and wants her new husband to meet our child (not gonna happen). Any time we try talking sense into her, she tells us to “get over it,” “grow up,” and some iteration of “accept me for who I am and let me back into your lives.” 

I know we can’t affect her actions, but what other types of advice are there for dealing with this? We know she got money meant for her children’s inheritance, retirements, etc. We don’t think she’s done anything illegal, but we also don’t want to end up having to bail her out eventually. Any thoughts out there?

TL;DR: Mother in law divorced and took all liquid assets as her half. She re-married to a convicted  child sex offender with lots of debt. Now, it appears she’s got no more money. Our attempts to warn/talk sense into her have gone ignored. What else might we do to protect ourselves, or help her actually see what she’s doing to herself financially?",05Jan2018,2
76,"I understand I’m not entitled to my parents paying my phone or insurance, but I have a bad feeling about their most recent phone call. They said my insurance jumped $250 “because I turned 21” and they wanted to see if I could get a more affordable plan and they’d pay the premiums. Once they mentioned income I knew they were applying for state aid. In my name. I dodged their calls for awhile (we hardly talk, I pay all of my other bills which requires full time work/school/internship). Today when I asked about it they cited having a high deductible plan. 

I think they’re just blowing smoke because this year was the last year my biological dad is paying child support (backpaid). These are the same people who bought a $50,000 boat this year. They told me college was non-negotiable, did nothing to help me academically leading up to it k-12, did nothing to help me plan financially, and contact me 2-3 times/month and show very little empathy for my situation. I work full time, take as many courses as I can, go to networking events, have an internship, and pay tuition and all living expenses minus phone/health insurance out of pocket. And when I snap back that they’re in no place to judge or have high expectations they gripe about how they wish they could afford to help me with college. They have somehow gotten all 4 of their kids on free and reduced lunches while living in a 500k house and making over 100k. 

In my opinion if they’re going to pay for my health insurance premiums they should use their income to qualify. I’ve already been paying the deductibles for 3 years. What might private health insurance look like for a healthy 21 yr old with very limited health history (antidepressants see a therapist is all). I have multiple jobs in order to afford a career-advancing job that won’t pay the bills. I’m hoping to have a salaried position within 6 months so I can get benefits and save money for a owner occupied rental property. ",05Jan2018,7
78,"she died in an unbelievable way. living with me in a country that neither of us belonged to. My life has been turned upside down, I'm not sure how to handle this. I speak to her mom daily, they have God, so that helps them get through but I can also tell that she is losing faith each day. 

I have never had God, all I want are answers, and they're difficult to come by. 

I know I need a psychologist, but the past 9 weeks has been packed with police reports, helping to get her back to her home country for burial, figuring out where I was going to go after everything.

The night it happened, she asked me to call in sick the next day so we could stay out, as she didn't have to work the next day and I did. I said I couldn't baby, we couldn't afford for me to lose my job and I was still in the 3 month period. 

I lost her and my job. And have to start from scratch.

In one year, I lost my business, my 42' cat, all my money, none of that mattered, she had already been waiting for me in another country while I sorted out my issues. She got us set up, a room rented in a condo, a job for both of us, she accepted me with 20$ in my pocket after We had been flying and sailing the world together care free for 3 years.

I know I will rebuild my wealth, that's not a problem. But I've just lost all desire to do anything. 

She was the reason I did everything, I wanted to show her the world, and then settle down together with 5 kids. 

it's all gone now, I would give anything to get it back.

I've never been a religious person, but I can understand why people turn to religion. 

I want to believe that some instance of her, some copy, some information is still floating out there in some dimension we don't have access to. I want to believe it so bad. 

She was 25, a 25 year old girl was wiped off the face of the earth with no record other than that her family and I keep.

After all the facebook posts and whatsapp profile pictures from friends fade away, and everyone gets back to their lives, all that's left is the people who really hurt.

Does anyone have experience with this? Any advice at all? 

I was told that posting on reddit may help as someone in this community has surely been through something similar. I've never been one to post about my life, but this is a very unique and difficult time for me.

any advice is welcome. I spoke to a girl i know who had her twin die when they were teenagers, she said it takes 5 years just to get over the initial shock.

I believe that because I don't think I've even come close to accepting this reality.

others suggested that I write to her on a blog or something. I'm not sure how much of my life i'd be comfortable posting online. Or my thoughts or our history. We've had some very unconventional memories. ",05Jan2018,153

Basically though I asked this girl i'm crazy about for her number but in the middle of talking to her I had a panic attack and walked away blurting out nevermind it made me look like I had no confidence. I still ended up getting her number because before we left I just sucked it up and asked if she wanted to hangout. I text her the next day and no reply so I wait another day and ask if this was her and she says no i think you have the wrong number. That was a month and 2 weeks ago and I havent talked to her since This girl is really important to me ive never felt like this with someone before so I have to try again. Dont tell me to just move on because Im doing this no matter what. Now if she still isnt interested then fine ill have to let it go but I gotta try once more. How can I go about this?

So this coming fall my parents will finally be empty nesters when my littler brother goes off to college in a different state several hours away. I've never had to worry about my parents in this kind of way before, so I don't really know how to help them deal with their inevitable loneliness. I'm mainly concerned about my mom, who doesn't speak english fluently, has honestly zero hobbies, and doesn't have many friends (and I feel many be socially anxious). Her and my dad don't really do much together. My dad works all morning and by the time he's done he's too tired and just naps all day. They love going to church together, but that's about it honestly. My dad seems perfectly content just working, going to church, and sleeping. I often look at my mom watching boring TV on the nature channel blankly and it kind of breaks my heart. Does anyone have any advice on how I can nudge them (especially my mom) into finding something to fill their time when we leave? Really all my parents have done my whole life is work and make sure me and my three siblings have had everything we needed so they've never really had time to go out, explore hobbies, etc. At least they'll always have each other, but I want to help them out a little before they're on their own (this all sounds a bit paradoxical). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks. Sorry for the novel.",05Jan2018,5
85,"Tldr up front; fiance's sister is neglecting her 3yr old daughter, entire family is looking for a way to take custody away from her.

Not tldr; sorry for the dump of info but i need the clearest idea of options based on everything happening.

My fiance has a sister who is neglecting her child. We live in Ontario, her sister lives in Ohio. My fiance's parent's also live in Ohio (same city) and her brother lives there too.

The child in question is 3 years old (almost). She is so smart and cheerful but very overweight (more on that later).

The problem of course lies with the mother, but also the now absent father. Let's start with him.

He is in jail now. He was arrested twice in 24 hrs for dealing drugs (smart guy). He often took the daughter on drug deals with him. Once the mother and father were found in the car passed out from intravenous drug use with the daughter (then a baby) in the backseat. Dad's out of the picture now so that's less of a problem until he gets out.

Mom. Mom is homeless. Mom has no job. Mom was relying on my fiance's parent's for money and a place to sleep but they had to have the police come to evict them after a long period of disrespect and eventually threats. They are staying temporarily with my fiance's brother but he is not happy with the situation. Mom and child are currently spending a few days here and there for sleep, but mom shows no inclination to find her own place. Hard anyway with no money.

The mom has no job and shows no sign of looking for one. Instead she spends all her time on her phone (paid for by her parents, reluctantly). Meanwhile care of the child falls on the rest of the family. 

The child is fed only candy and fast food. She is put in front of screen after screen. No bed time. She goes to bed after 1am and wakes up at 8 screaming. I know none of that is in itself grounds for CPS but just to flesh out the picture. 

The mom smokes in front of the child and the child frequently reeks of cigarette smoke. Mom will hang out and drink while child runs around. Mom is also on methadone trying to come off heroin and other drugs but we're not convinced she's not still using. 

Mom is also giving child to the dad's step dad who is a drug user and has (unofficial) allegations against him for molesting his 6yr old step-granddaughter. Mom doesn't see a problem with this.

This morning we witnessed her hitting the child. 

All this to say that literally nobody else in the family thinks mom should be raising child. I have only been around for 2 years but apparently this struggle has been happening since child was born. 

Mom treats child like an accessory. Sits on her phone and smokes all day, or goes to visit a revolving door of new boyfriends, while care of the child rests on the family.

What are the options here? I am going to call CPS tomorrow to see what can happen. My fiance and I want to take custody (grandma and grandpa do not). 

If more specifics are needed for an accurate answer please let me know. This was never something I thought I would have to deal with so I have no idea how to. ",05Jan2018,3

Now the problem is I’m starting to feel like I’m falling for her, and a) I’m pretty sure she doesn’t want that and b) I’m not really emotionally stable right now so I could be misinterpreting or just reaching at something to replace what I had prematurely. 

My question is, do I talk to her about it? I’m really relying on her right now and idk what I’d do without her. I’m afraid that talking about it is going to push her away. Plus, I don’t even know if I really have feelings for her I might just be reaching for her so I can move past the aforementioned other girl.

90,"Over the course of this year, friend *Amelia* and I have become very close friends, probably each other's closest friend living nearby.  I'm late-20s, she is mid-30s.  In many ways we have gotten along very well and had a friendship that is growthful and positive.  Some things I like about her are her sense of humor, her artful writing, and her company on our shared foray into birdwatching.

I grew up fairly poor and she knows this. I have a good career now, and also have deep feelings of concern and care for continuing to work towards making life better for people who have less. She has made a number of comments disparaging poor and homeless people, including an extended conversation recently where she expressed harsh, uncaring, and disparaging attitudes toward homeless people.  Her most troubling comments were that if 'she' were homeless, she would do X things; and if someone wants help they should be entertaining; and that she believes most homeless people deserve it. On the whole she fairly consistently seems to believe that she does not care about the welfare of people who are poor or destitute, because it's their fault.

I have no issue with how or whether she wants to spend money on homeless people, or how she feels about individuals who may behave dangerously, aggressively, or otherwise inappropriately.  But the degree of uncaring and cluelessness behind suggesting 'what she would do' or to feel that someone deserves to be homeless feels extreme to me.  Being that it is a concern so close to my heart, it is even more incompatible to me.  Most of the time, I feel like I try to give people the benefit of the doubt that whatever they have done they mean well, but these comments make me feel like I will now have a hard time doing so with her, which could cause further deterioration of the friendship over time.  Furthermore, she purports the idea that she is a markedly kind and compassionate individual, a view I can't honestly share.

I feel like I need to tell her that this is bothering me and see how she responds.  I'm having trouble figuring out how to approach this conversation though, especially what I want to accomplish and naming exactly why her comments bother me beyond just my feelings of not liking them without projecting into interpretations about her character.  Any advice practically speaking about how to approach such a conversation or insight on the introspection would be much appreciated.

95,"Sooo I am quite in a pickle at the moment. I'll try to make this as short as possible but give you enough background to understand. When I was about 6, our church got a new pastor and family, from then on our families became best friends. They had a son, let's call him Joe, who is a year older than me. We became like childhood best friends hanging out all the time, went on family vacations together etc etc. for many years until middle school. I had a crush on him since I had met him up unto this point. He went to a private school and I went to a public school. I ended up going to the private school in 7th grade because we had heard good things and at the time I was getting bullied and miserable at my other school. Joe's mom was a teacher at the time there and since we lived 30-40 minutes away I rode with them to school. Our friendship had pretty much fizzled out and understandably so. I still had a crush on him and the girls in my grade knew it. I'm embarrassed to admit but I had believed I knew he liked me back!  I remember telling the girls I thought so too (I'm facepalming so much right now). For one, I was never liked at the time because of me riding with him and going to his church. turns out he's one of the most popular guys at the school and almost EVERY girl in my grade had a crush on him) This one girl and her best friend bullied me a LOT that year, it was really awful and it's only because I liked him. Ironically, me and this girl share the same name besides her's has an extra letter. She did all she could and eventually got him to go out with her. Fast forward 7-8 years later...I'm now 22 and next Wednesday, Joe's whole family is coming to stay at our house(they live across the US) for their wedding(yep, she got what she wanted!). I've been trying desperately to come up with a plan to miss the wedding. I'm upset because my best friend had told me she would help me get out of it then says she's going to it (because her husband is friends with Joe). It's beyond awkward for me. I stopped liking Joe in 8th grade but I have never cared for his girlfriend because of what a terrible person she has been to me and others. And before you guys say I'm jealous I'm not, once they broke up for several months and he dated this other girl I knew and I was so happy for them! They were cute and the girl was really sweet. Then he ended up with the first one again. This girl has never liked me and I've had to deal with her coming to church functions every week, family parties etc..I was glad once college came around because Joe and his family went back across the country(love the fam but Joe's girl...). I thought they would have the wedding there but it's back here. With his sisters, and his parents staying at my house for 5 days, how on EARTH can I miss the wedding!? Is there a way I can skip!? I just will have a horrible time if I go I just know it. All of the people I graduated with who are snobs will be there(her friends) and I haven't had to see for 4 years. Everyone knew about how me and her did not get along well so I feel weird going. Besides, I doubt she'd want to see me there as I was only invited out of obligation. Sorry for the long story but I felt it was needed to understand what a mess this all is. The wedding isn't until the 13th so I could maybe still get out of it. Any ideas? Or should I just put on my big girl panties and go?",05Jan2018,2
96,"I’m a recent college graduate from a prestigious university in the U.S. On paper, my life sounds great: I was offered a job straight out of college at a law firm, I have my own car that I bought myself, I have a girlfriend and a stable home life (2 normal younger siblings, parents are together)...BUT I can’t stop feeling like something is not right. It’s like I have a terrible emotional itch that needs to be scratched.

Since at least freshman year of high school, I have felt a sense of increasing anxiety. It didn’t affect me as much back then because I was lucky enough to keep a close circle of friends that I grew up with. When I got to college, I always struggled to make friends, or at least more than just shallow relationships. My last couple years have become more and more lonely. I always thought that, after college, my life would get better. On the contrary, my friends have been seeming to drift away and I feel more and more lonely - is this what adult life is supposed to be?!

Sometimes I feel like I’m just plain retarded or at least don’t know how to act towards other people. Deep down, I just want to be a good person and be able to achieve my dreams (whatever those may be - I barely feel anything these days). I’ve been studying to take the LSAT, but some days I just feel like “what’s the point, I’ll just be miserable in law school like I am right now”. 

The worst part is, I oftentimes find myself lashing out in frustration at those that love me the most - my family. Even today, I got into a fight with my mom (I still live at home) for something trivial. Sometimes I just feel like buying a one way ticket to another country just to get away from it all.

In closing, it’s driving me insane that I don’t know what I’m doing wrong (or am I even doing anything wrong to begin with?). Is this what life is and I just have to suck it up? Am I just being a little bitch? Do I not care enough about others? Am I self absorbed? Or am I just lacking confidence? I wish somebody could just say what’s wrong with me so I could work on it. This sense of not knowing is driving me nuts because I don’t know how to tackle a problem when I can’t identify it. It’s killing me.

I don’t know who to turn to- I have been seeing a psychologist for the last few weeks which has helped marginally. I’ve recently been reading up on a condition called Alexithymia because a lot of the symptoms seem to be what I’m experiencing. I just want to be happy, follow my dreams, and connect with people in my life, I just don’t know what to do anymore. Sorry for the long/excessively negative post but I honestly feel like I’m at wits end and I just desperately want answers.

The guy always texts me back, always fast and keeps the conversation going if anything I’m the one that takes forever to message back. But i was still so hesitant like why me of all people and i kept asking myself. If he just wants to hit it and quit it why would he be so persistent but at the same time I’ve met men who were like this ...idk. So we agree to go to the movies he picks me up, pays for everything tickets, popcorn and drink we are waiting for the movie to start cause we got there so early so we started playing games and feeding each other popcorn lol. 
The movie starts and as soon as it does he pulls me close to him and starts cuddling like crazy I’m kinda hesitant cause i just met him but i went with it then  he kept kissing my temple and breathing down my ear and neck and kissed me a few times. He kept saying your so cute, why you so cute and kept wanting me to look him in the eyes. He took me home we hugged had a goodbye kiss everything and left it at that. 
He texted me as soon as he got home then like 5 days later we agreed to hang again before i went outta state for a week it was late but he took me to a small waterfall and we talked and he kept hugging me and kissing me which I’m still kinda not liking just cause this is only my second time meeting him but he was persistent on it and then we were talking and he said “i want you to be mine before i go back to college” (forgot to mention he leaves to go back to college really soon ) and i told him no period just cause i barely met him this was only our2 nd time, he said we have been talking for like 3 weeks tho and i told him that’s rlly nothing and he kinda dropped it but said it a few more times then took me home. I came back from Georgia (which btw we are
Constantly texting when we aren’t together) and he kept saying how he missed me and wanted to hang so i agreed and he came to my place (i should’ve known not to do this) we are up in my room just watching a movie and he starts pulling me closer and closer and then he pulls the cover over us  and you know we start kissing all that but i tell him i don’t want anything to happen he says it won’t but continues to keep pushing the limits... i let it go sometimes cause ngl i liked it, but eventually i was like ok I’m serious i don’t want anything happening and blah blah and then he mentions how he wants to make me his and all of that again and i said idk and again i said we’ve barely been tlking and he said “barely we have been talking for a month and this is our  3rd time together” ...is it just me or isn’t this quick? Or am i just wanting to much to take things slower? Anyways he also talked about that he wants to make our first time special anyways??? And like that is a big sign imo to me that he just wants to hit it and quit because... i don’t know he seems to be going to fast in my opinion but then he always talks about hanging out, he is always free, i personally don’t know if he talks to other girls but he swears he doesn’t and it doesn’t seem like he is ever hanging around a bunch of girls cause he is always free and wants to hang out ALL THE TIME ngl peeped a few times when he was on his phone and no girls that i rlly saw. He talks about how  he is going to miss me when he goes to college and that i should visit him and he is already trying to make some plans for when his spring break comes up?

101,"Half a year ago my older brother moved out. It's been diffrent with out him but it intill didn't bother me at first. He would come home every once in a while and we would talk. But now I just feel hurt and upset he's become a diffrent person. He recently drove me down to Texas for Christmas at our grandma. We got into a fight on the way. He claimed our mom smoked mariujanna when she had cancer I was in disbelief so I said bullshit. He immediately called me an idiot and retard. I was shocked he never had done that so viciously before. It hurt alot I got upset and it escalated. He gave a filmy apologie on how that's how he acts with his friends. But it was somehow my fault because I wouldn't take his word for it. My reasoning was mom had asthma so she wouldn't be smoking because it would fuck with her lungs. Which led to more name calling on his part. We eventually calmed down but when we are at grandma's he went to take a nap. I was layer told to wake him up which I did I didn't realize my uncle was there to and I walk him up. My brother then called me a moron I said nothing not wanting to fight despite being hurt and feeling like I was going to cry. Which I did for a few minutes in the bathroom. He acted like everything was fine but it wasnt. I later got over it by distracting myself by playing with my baby cousin. He went our with our cousins our age he didn't invite me. It's been awhile since we left but now emotions are hitting me hard. I feel abandoned i hardly saw him at all during Christmas, I miss him, I miss that he didn't used to be so mean and then blame me for getting hurt over it. I get that I'm not perfect and I'm a bit over emotional which can be hard to deal with. I have no idea who was in the right if I was really just being over emotional or not. What do I do I want to talk to him again and spend time with him with out it turning into a fight. ",05Jan2018,3

Even though breaking up was the best option for both of us, I still can't help but feel we failed each other by giving up on each other.

My other brother is so uppity it's not even funny. He's constantly criticizing my diet, appearance, how I talk, my opinions, who I hang with, my hobbies and interests, literally everything. He thinks that somehow, he's so much better than me in every way and he has all the answers and is soooo cool. It's always been that way, but ever since he started med school it's gotten so much worse because the ""I'm a doctor I know what I'm talking about"" attitude shines very bright in him.

I am a 20m currently living at home in university, I live in a city and can’t afford a dorm plus college is right around the corner so it just made more sense to continue living here. My family hosts exchange students from around the world so they often come and go but we got a student months ago who will be staying for almost a year. She is a Japanese girl age 21. Now I know what you are thinking, but hear me out first. I really wasn’t attracted to her at first but the more we talk around the house the more intrigued I become. She is so passionate about traveling the world, and her volunteering past leaves me awestruck. She straight up traveled to all these countries to help disadvantaged kids and teach them Japanese all for free. She has such a vibrant personality which contrasts everything people have told me about Japanese girls. Whenever we talk about our cultures we end up getting such a deeper understanding of each other and it’s really fun. If the situation was different I could just confess my feelings but she lives right above me. When we talk its natural we have great steady eye contact and whenever she gets close to me around the house it feels so right. I always end up shying away from her because I don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable. My family always holds hands to give thanks for our meal before we eat and we usually don’t hold hands because she sits across from me but last night I outstretched my hand to reach hers yet she didn’t take it. This dinner tonight she reached for my hand but I didn’t take it because she didn’t take it last night and I didn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable but then when she realized I didn’t take it she took it back and seemed embarrassed. I don’t know what to do, whenever we are in the kitchen alone together we always talk and eat and we stay there for hours sometimes with big pauses in talking and we just have eye contact and she smiles and I make her laugh. When I went to visit family during break she gathered all my mail over the days and put it in a pretty little arrangement for when I got home. She gave me some of her food her mom sent her from Japan which she doesn’t have much of and she misses because US food is bad. She even offered to cook me stuff. I’m very confused. I don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable but I want her to know how I feel, hell I want to know how she’s feeling.

115,"Hi Everyone,

I am looking for some advice regarding my dad's legacy. He was an amazing husband, father, brother, uncle, and friend. After an incredibly difficult and painful battle with esophageal cancer over the past year, he passed away two days ago at the very young age of 62. Reality is still settling in, and things don't feel real just yet, but I am trying to think of ways that I can honor him and his memory going forward as my mom and I try to come to terms with this loss. I think that this will help us both cope better if we know that something we loved about him, and something he really enjoyed, could be shared with others.

My dad absolutely loved singing and performing. When he was in his early 20s he was in a band, and one of his favorite past-times was performing with them in his basement. My mom fell in love with him the first time she heard his voice, and some of my favourite memories of him and I were the times when he would let me pluck his guitar strings as he fingered the chords and made me think I was playing the song with him. In the past few years he was no longer performing with a band, but he did enjoy singing karaoke on an online website. Thankfully, we have about 100 of his recordings from the website that we can listen to at any time. All in all, music was such a big part of his life.

I am hoping to find some ideas regarding how I can use the recordings that I do have in a way that will pay tribute to his life. So far I have thought of playing the songs he has sang during his celebration of life, and we will have his guitar on display as well. If anyone has other ideas they would be greatly appreciated! His celebration is in about a week, but I'm looking for any ideas and they don't just need to be something I can do during the celebration.

Thank you in advance for your help.

- I am relatively fit

131,"So I’m on my vacation with my family, consisting of me, my brother, sister, cousin, grandmother, and both my parents.

So I’m 17 M and my (first) cousin is 14 F. I didn’t really have any attractions to her before I can honestly say. But I did notice how she developed pretty well since she does a lot of gymnastics and other sports. I guess you can say that I was digging her body, since i saw her in a bikini a lot of the time. She constantly hugged me and says “I love you” throughout the trip and I’ve always took it in the kind family way, and i confidently feel like she meant it that way too. But most nights before we went to our rooms, I would lie on her lap or she would lie on mine in the living room, where my siblings would see. No heads turned. it was normal. she hugged and did the same to my brother, but not as much as to me. Also just in the loving family way, not at all sexual. But since tonight I’m  sleeping on the couch , me her and my siblings stayed up to watch tv. After both my siblings went to bed, it was just me and her. I said I was going to bed and she stayed on the couch, even after I turned all the lights off. 

So then we cuddle, but in the regular way since we’ve been doing a lot of that. And then her legs naturally come wrapped around mine. I put a blanket over us. Our mouths kept passing each other and nothing happened for a good 10 minutes. I kept getting up for several small excuses. Water, the time. I also keep asking her if she’s comfortable and if she’s good. She keeps saying yes. Eventually our mouths keep coming by each other and I feel her tongue keep slightly pushing, I tiny bit, not entering my lips but at the verge of hers. We eventually meet and before I know it, we’re slightly frenching, my tongue is touching hers and hers to mine. We’ve also moved around a lot and went from being side to side to her being directly on top of me. 

I continuously ask her if everything is good. She keeps responding yes. While our tongues are touching around a bit, my hands are slightly squeezing her butt through her sweatpants. I ask her if she’s good again and she says yes, and I casually slip my hands to press against her underpants. Keep in mind we’re still kissing. I’m still nervous and wondering if she’s good because I just can’t believe this is happening, so I ask her again, “you good?”. She doesn’t say anything, I take my hands off her and we stop with the kissing, and I ask her again, she pauses, and says she’s gonna go to bed. She also gets off of me. That’s when all the guilt, pain and regret came to me. 

As she gets off I say “wait”, she looks at me and I ask her for the time. After that I tell her that that was nothing. She agrees by saying “yes”, and “I know”. After that I say that I was tired, and that was a mistake. She also agrees. Then I say don’t tell ANYONE, not in an aggressive way at all though. she also agrees and says that she was tired too. 

After she left to her room I started panicking and felt guilt, and now I’m writing this. I can honestly say that I didn’t not feel aroused at all with the kissing. The only thing that really did it for me was the hands on butt and when her legs were wrapped around me, which was part of what started it. I’m not saying that this is entirely her fault. She may be responsible for tempting and initiating (at least in my eyes), but I went for it even when I wasn’t 100% sure if she was tempting me, which I shouldn’t have went for even if she wasn’t tempting me. It is 100% wrong what happened no matter the circumstances. Also I’m 3 years older than her which in my mind makes it much worse. 

Im worried 1) because I just can’t believe that happened, and now since that happened, it can’t unhappen. I have to go the rest of my life knowing this and having a memory of incest. Also I’ve never had a girlfriend or any sexual interaction with anyone before so i have to live with this being my first. (Also my first official kiss) To make it worse the same goes for her, which brings me to 2) I don’t know if this will stay a secret. She also said she won’t tell anyone, cause this would be bad for her too, and maybe it’s just the paranoia I’m having right now, but she comes from a pretty strict family where theyre pretty close together. They text her couple times day and FaceTime her at least once a day. Also she has to send a pic of everything she wants to buy before she can buy it. Although I know she keeps some small secrets from her parents, they still talk a lot. One is that she has a boyfriend. (Which makes the situation with me again, worse) although they’ve prob done nothing at all, and I may be her first interaction like that too. She talks with her sister too. (prob about having a boyfriend as well) if this comes out my family would be pretty shooken. and it wouldn’t be good for me at all. My family’s Big and pretty old fashioned, so something like this would not only make me 100% the problem and her %100 the victim, I don’t know how everyone would get passed this. It would ruin everything and make every time I see them extremely awkward. 

For my cousin, rn I’d say she prob just wanted to experiment and was very nervous going into it. Her leaving to go to bed was clearly a sign of wanting to stop right there. My best guess is she just had some sexual feelings/urges that passed like that. I really hope my hand going  to her panties was not a sign of going further, (it wasn’t) and I hope that didn’t make her I uncomfortable at all, but I’m pretty sure she mainly left cause I stopped the kissing and i kept asking her if she was sure everything was good, which prob snapped her out of the moment and made her realize what was going on. She’s prob still up too and I can imagine she’s shooken and nervous too

It’s literally an hour after since the incident as I’m writing this and it’s pretty early in the morning. I’m really nervous for seeing her in the morning, and all the awkwardness to come on trip. We’re 5 days in and have 9 more To go before we fly home. 

I don’t know what’s going to happen and I just need to know what to do so nobody finds out and things turn back to normal, (or as normal as can get) between me and her. Need to know what to say and do, and think, please

133,"tldr: our new two month hire teammate does not take feedback well, refuses to listen, and won’t admit to mistakes. Insists he’s correct and quite frankly, he’s being a dick. Is there something I can do to help him out vs getting him let go?

I’m a jr developer at this medium size tech firm for three years now and I'm having a hard time getting through to a two month new dev hire. We're in a small team of 5: three Jr devs, one Sr lead dev and one analyst. One of my jr dev colleague (Karen), asked to have a chat about her frustrations on our new teammate (Ming). She’s his mentor for the past few months and they’ve been working together getting ramped up. 

This morning, she was sobbing as she narrated what had happened: Ming asked for a code review and Karen accepted. There were two main code changes, one was accepted with minor revisions and the other one was not accepted and feedback was provided.  

The rejected change: Ming *refactored* an essential method (used in more than 300 places, has been stable, been in place even before I was hired). Simply, that method contained an if statement and a Boolean flag. The flag was passed to determine if it goes to the first statement with 4 lines of code or to the second statement with 3 lines of code. Ming had extracted the statements from the method and replaced one method call to 3 or 4 method calls in places the original method was used. 

In Karen’s defence, if a process is added or a change will be made in that block of code — Ming’s solution would require repetitive changes  all over the codebase; vs only having to change in that one place. Ming debates that the original method call and if statement together slows down the process (possibly, but not really imo). He replied to Karen’s feedback with, “ :) I don’t  care how you code.” She was offended that the feedback was disregarded easily. 

Ming asks her if he can check in his changes. She said not yet as she feels strongly against his changes. She asked our lead for his opinion and he scheduled a meeting the following day to discuss the changes and to hear both of their sides. However, towards the end of the day Ming asks again if he can check in his code. Karen said no and explained that they’re having the meeting to reach an agreement and that our lead can help mediate. Ming responds on chat, “why do we still need a meeting, I’ve already told you it works?” Karen didn’t reply. 

Meeting day (today/ day Karen sobbed), the boss sided in Karen’s favour. Ming became defensive and unwavering. Ming and our lead started arguing; as to not make matters/emotions worse, my boss gave up and Ming code changes were approved. After that meeting, Karen talked to me;  she felt very disrespected, defeated, and frustrated. 

I volunteered to take over mentoring Ming, giving Karen some space from him.  I also plan to reach out to my lead to discuss. 

I rarely get any interaction with him because i don’t often work on the same code base. I’m not his boss or lead and I’m not claiming to be. I’m way more introverted than Karen or my boss but I’m able to listen and work well with my team. I want to help Ming improve, get along with the team, and stay in the company. How though?

What would you have done differently?  Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading this long post

**update**

as mentioned above I volunteered to take over mentoring Ming, giving Karen some time away from him. Since his changes were already approved albeit completed code review, I continued the code review and I made the assumption that extracting the main method into smaller methods is valid. I went inside one of the methods and I spotted something that can be removed. A variable was initialized and never used, and different variable was used with a similar name (SomeStatic.Class.varx.property = some property was initialized; however the rest of the method used a different varx or this.varx). 

It was a simple thing and I asked Ming if I could give him feedback. He said sure, and I told him how we can remove the unused variable. He was taken aback as if surprised and says straight up No, he continually argues that his code works and he doesn’t know why he needs to make changes to it. I calmly asked how that was that different from when  he refactored the original working and stable piece of code. But he defensively says his changes work and it’s faster. I agreed and said that, “you’re right, your code works and is faster; do you think we can make it better?” He says, “no, I don’t think so. It’s working now so there’s no need to change it.” 

“So your code is perfect and there’s nothing we can do to improve it?” I replied. He said, “yes. What is this; an interview?” I couldn’t believe how stubborn he was being. I was shocked; I remained silent beside him. After a quiet moment, he then says begrudgingly, “fine, I can comment out this unused code.”

I noticed he wouldn’t respond to any of my texts or calls. Only to find out he was with other girls cheating on me. This ended very badly, me never really getting closure. 

On Christmas he did message me through Instagram wishing me happy holidays and proceeded that he wanted to catch up with me. I accepted to a call later that night. The first hour was very awkward and had lots of gaps of silence but once it got later we opened up about how we felt. 

When doing so we realized we still loved each other.

I've always looked up to my father immensely, and this makes me feel... confused and shocked and hurt, among other things. I want to maintain good relationships with both, and don't want to cause a rift in my family. However, I also want to confront the situation and put an end to this inappropriate behavior.

Should I confront them? Who first? Should I prepare for denial? Blame? Should I be sympathetic or assertive? Should I be concerned about leaving my future children with him?

I'm truly at a loss for how to process this, let alone voice my concerns. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",05Jan2018,1

140,"So obviously a throwaway account....

To give you the background, my wife and I have been married for 5 years, together for 10. Early thirties, no kids.

So to start the story off, about three months ago I happened to discover a few sex toys hidden in a bag on my wife's side of the bed. This is a little bit of a shock to me, since she is pretty reserved and this isn't a normal type thing for her. She is not very out in the open sexually and toys are something I'm pretty sure I remember her saying were ""skeevy"" a few years back.

So naturally I'm curious. If shes's now into this, what other type of thing is she maybe into? So I get on the computer, and lo and behold, in her browser history, there are like 20 past days of entries for a site called FetLife. For those uninitiated, FetLife is sorta like a BDSM themed Facebook, you can make accounts, post pictures and videos socialize with people about different fetishes you might have. Well, after a bit of looking, I find my wife's profile. She has many ""friends"" and has apparently been pretty big into posting pictures of herself nude and masturbating.
The immediate red flag for me is the phrase on her bio ""...I am married, but if my status doesn't bother you, your status won't bother me...""

I am floored. I have known this woman very well for a decade at this point. She never does stuff like this.

She comes home that evening, and I broach the subject of the toys. She says she is going through a period of ""self discovery"" and is just interested in ""being with herself"" and ""learning her body"" I keep mum about the website and tell her not to be ashamed about the toys, I want her to have a healthy mindset about sex and masturbation, etc. etc. Doing my part to be a loving and supportive husband.

So a week or so goes by and I keep tabs on her Fet profile, but I start to notice its been a while since I've heard her phone ring out loud. It's on vibrate, I can hear it buzz, but she is very careful, almost to a fault to never leave it alone in a room with me, or to never open it where I can see the screen. The first time she does leave it with me and it goes off, I notice she has installed KiK messenger on it, and it has ""blocked content"" message on the screen. She has also password protected it too. I'm nervous. Is she cheating? WHo is she talking to?

Another couple of days and I confront her about the profile. Tell her I feel hurt that she cant come to me about stuff like this. SHe says because we're so close that she feels weird about talking to me about fetish stuff. I tell her I am fine with the profile, as long as it stays online only and there is no way I will allow this to be taken out into the offline world with real people. She assures me that she will not.

I'm not sleeping well anymore. All I can think about is the little bit of truth that she is willing to show, and what must lurk deeper under the waters. I start to feel depressed, worthless. She has this new life now, new and exciting friends and I'm just the guy who's here to pay bills.

I free write like 5 rambling pages of my thoughts and fears and everything that I have been going through. i express my fear that she is looking to hookup with someone if she hasn't already. I express my distaste about her phone being this locker of secrets and the messaging back and forth to other people. I intend to use these as notes to write a script to use to try to talk to her about these things (neither of us are very confrontational) I end up just stuffing it in an envelope and leaving it for her to read with a preface to explain it a bit.

She calls me from work, tells me she's done ""talking"" to people. Reiterates that she has been with only me for the past 10 years and would never cheat on me. That she's still very attracted to me (one of my fears; my looks have started to go a bit).

Jump forward a month or so to last weekend. I notice she has changed her phone unlock back to the ""pattern"" and not the password anymore. I see what it is. She goes to take a shower, so I decide to grab a peek at what she has on there.

I pretty quickly discover a video of her having sex with a man who is very obviously not me.

I confront her with it and storm out of the house. I AM PISSED! I cant even talk to her I'm so mad. I finally text her and say how upset I am. She relents, says she sorry, says she knew it would hurt me and make me hate her. Tells me she still loves me.

The only thing I can think is that I want a divorce. I am so hurt by this, there is no way to think straight for most of the day, so I just kinda drive around, stop and walk around some parks until I've calmed down enough to go home and talk.

She claims she only did it because it was ""fetish"" stuff and she wanted someone who was more ""experienced"" than her when it came to things that she was into. She said it had only happened twice and there was no intention of carrying into being an affair or anything.

I still love her more than anything, I would love to live the rest of our lives together with this being a ""slip-up"" in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

So here is where I need the advice:
What should I do moving forward to ""keep her honest""? I've already lain down the law of no more FetLife, I need access to all social media that she uses (which I think she may have gotten rid of Kik). At what point do I go from being protective to overbearing? Complete access to her phone? GPS on her car? No going out unless escorted by a trustworthy friend?

Has anyone else been through something like this? How did it turn out? 

What should we do as a couple? I've checked into couples therapy, but our insurance won't cover it and we cant afford it out of pocket. I really would like us to have some professional help.

I really want to be able to trust and love her again like I had been able to in the past, but it worries me that this wound may never heal.",05Jan2018,8

146,"We are students working at a company through a pro-rata basis, logging in the hours we worked every week. The leave we are entitled to is based according to the amount of hours we put in. 

A colleague is punching in all the days he does NOT work as additional leave and getting completely paid for them, basically getting a full time wage all in all every month.

We, the other colleagues, have legitimate proof of this and feel that this is very unfair on us, though we honestly have no idea how this is possible since all leave needs to be verified by the respective manager before it is given.

Basically, we all drank during dinner, and this girl, who I've talked to several times in the past but honestly not enough to be really close, drank a little too much and got a bit drunk. Meanwhile, I know how weird I am when drunk so I stopped myself short.

That said, she randomly just rested her head on my shoulders. I kinda freaked out and just froze up and didn't really respond physically at all.

Listen, I'm a dude who is REALLY awkward with girls. Not creepy awkward, but more like the kinda guy who doesn't know how to respond in this situation. 

Again, she's a girl that I didn't really know well before last night. We did have a good conversation earlier that day before the dinner (the first ""good"" convo, honestly), but other than that, we've never had any amazing interactions in the past.

They said, I feel like maybe she expected something in return like maybe I get a little closer to her or something. What should I have done to respond to her suddenly coming physically closer and attaching her head to my shoulder? Was it okay that I didn't really respond?

151,"I booked a place with Airbnb which did not match the description, so it was agreed with the host that he will issue me a refund. Refund was issued, the web site confirmed that I have received it.

3 weeks later there was still no money in my account, even though using my payment method it was supposed to arrive in 5 days.

I wrote to Airbnb support asking what's going on and they said that the host's payment hasn't gone through. Which is weird on its own because I can't book any housing if my payment doesn't go through, so how can a host issue non-existing refund.

Instead of issuing my refund immediately and dealing with the host on their own time, Airbnb said that I now have to wait until they contact the host and sort it out. 

It is now day 4, every day they tell me to wait, to be patient and bump me around to new case managers that do not seem inclined to return my money.

I returned to the trash can the next day to remove the cell phone, but didn't see it in there.

My older brother (he's 25yr old) has recently came back from the Netherlands to our homeland for the holidays and few weeks. He was working there since summer and had a lot of trouble. One of which was his 7 year relationship with his (ex) girlfriend. They kind of broke up but still stayed in contact before he left in the summer. But things got out of control with their relationship for few reasons which are not quite worth writing (his new female friend; him getting beaten up; and some law bulls*it).
They both think their situation is not being understood by one another. That is why they stopped talking and texting a month before he left the Netherlands. Until last night. I opened up my facebook to see that he commented all kind of stupid sh*t over her photos, for example ""you fu*king cu*t, bit*h, whore"" etc..
The moment I saw this I immediately texted him and he told me how he's going to ""hurt"" all the guys she was with, touched her and just do bad things to them: break their every finger, burn their houses,... (he was a bit drunk). I knew he was a bit psychotic but I realised he's even more psych than I thought.
I don't know how to calm him down or help him with dealing with this relationship, I'm not an expert on neither relationship advices, nor human psychology. The only good thing I know is that he is not going to kill himself and that's for sure. But hurting (or even worse..) others is very likely possible.
I really don't know how to talk him out of whatever he has on his mind. Anything can pop to his head, like taking a baseball bat and going straight to her house, even at this very moment.
Can anyone give me an advice on how to act or talk to him, to not ignite and provoke his thoughts? Or could anyone point me in the direction, where these kind of problems and advices could be found and asked.

Basic Info: I'm a 22 year old male. Physically very unfit and underweight [60kgs and scrawny af] . No phobias that I know of. No history of hard drugs (I smoke weed, but can easily give that up) or alcohol abuse. I quit smoking cigarettes about 2/3 years ago. I'd like to think i'm mentally sound. No serious ailments or illnesses. 

Here is my biggest problem: 

    20 x Push-ups (non-stop)
    30 x Sit-ups (in 2 minutes)
    2m Wall Scaling (3 attempts) (with clean fatigue)
    150m Fireman’s Lift in 105 seconds (with clean fatigue)
    2.4km Run in 20 minutes (with clean fatigue)
    30 (15 shuttle kicks per foot) x shuttle kicks (non-stop)
    3 x pull-ups
    20 x 6.15m shuttle runs in 120 seconds (with clean fatigue)
    3 x Dips
    4m Rope climb (3 attempts)
    15km walk in 2 hours 15 minutes (with clean fatigue)

I know those specifications are not really tough, but that's the recommended minimum. and I plan to try and be able to do all those without breaking a sweat eventually.
I'm VERY unfit, however. No sports or exercise. So it's going to be tough. I would love to get into shape and have been for a very long time. If i'm serious about joining, I will need to be able to do that. 
Not looking for a gym membership, doubt it would help anyway. It's too ""clean"" 
I need to be fit, not buff. 

I have absolutely no illusion that it's going to be easy. I'm going to have to train intensely every day, in one way or another. I'm basically giving myself no choice and once I decide this weekend what I want to do, I'm diving head first.

Ridicolously interesting job, amazing hobbies and very non-standard personality (we share the same very uncommon hobbies and we're both very socially awkward). And...there's also a very good looking body involved. (wink wink nudge nudge)

It didn't work out (and that made me depressed) because 2 introverts together don't communicate very well. When I was in a relationship with an extrovert instead it was amazing! So I'm pretty sure it wouldn't work out even if we lived close!

Keep each other in contact? How exactly? Sending out of the blue a whatsapp that says ""hey what you're doing"" every couple of days? I don't even do that with my close friends.

I am a 27 year old male who has just relocated to London after basically just giving up and breaking down my successful street food business that took me 3 years to build, it was successful in the fact that it was making good money but due to various reasons was not making me happy.
Currently I am unemployed sitting around unmotivated and have no idea what to do for a job. I have a serious amount of experience as a chef of all levels, it is the only work I have ever done and I'm very good at it.

If I go to bed at 2am and wake up at 9 for my lecture, thats 7 hours sleep but I feel terrible and can't get out of my flat. If I go to bed at 7am and wake up at 9, the entire day I'm fine but by the end I'm more tired and fall asleep, this means I get like 7 hours of sleep and then the whole process restarts.

Is there any sleeping pattern that would mean that I could fit with my day's schedule but get small amounts of sleep so I can actually deal with lectures and stuff? At the moment after a long night's sleep, I can't even get out of bed and so miss a lot of lectures.

After I left their house, I noticed bites on my ankles. I didn't think much of it, because it was itchy, I thought it was a heap of mosquito bites. Wroooong. TIL: 'Tis the frightening bite of the bed bug. 

Now. I fucking hate bugs. Especially bugs that spread around easily. Today, I wore my pyjama pants that I wore to bed at my friends place. Now my brain has thought, in classic 'me' fashion: the bed bugs are on my pyjama pants. 

I have been sitting EVERYWHERE with these pants. And I mean it. I lay in my mums' bed, in my sisters' bed, on the couch, fucking everywhere. 

I'm no stranger to anxiety and, honestly, I'm panicking. Did I just transfer the bed bugs to every part of my house by wearing these pyjama pants? It's 1:15am right now but should I be tearing everything off the beds and washing them immediately? 

Please someone reply ASAP. I'm really panicking. I live with 6 other family members. I don't want to be the one that fucked up everyone's lives with bed bugs. My parents are so poor, I don't think we can even afford to have an extermination.

202,"I am currently in my 30’s, male, living in the U.S in the tri-state area, recently unemployed and at a turning point in my life with a strong desire for a new vocation! 
I have found that nothing in life gives me for satisfaction than helping others. I would like to find a career in which I could do this on a regular basis but am at a loss as to what exactly to do. I have a bachelors degree in a social science and have worked in some form of management my entire life. I am an adult with ADHD and have particularly poor executive functioning. Thus I’ve always found it rather difficult paying attention and managing time but have always been fortunate enough to have a secretary or staff beneath me to handle these things for me. I excel at working and communicating with others and have learned in adulthood (though being “hyper-active” my concentration often tends to be lacking,) how to become “hyper focused,” especially when doing something I enjoy- and there is nothing I enjoy more than working with others. 
Can you guys help me out in finding a career where I can help others but is less clerical than most jobs? Or a least point me in the right direction? I’ve strongly considered teaching but became demoralized in college when finding others on the same path seemed to be pursuing pedagogy for a paycheck, rather than the exceedingly important role of educating and empowering our youth. And I also worry that I will be less successful in this type of career when it comes to deadlines and lesson planning.

Driving home last night around 10:30 p.m. Here in the northeastern U.S., we just got hit with that ""bomb cyclone,"" so there's lots of snow &amp; sub-freezing temperatures. Few cars are out driving in this suburb, &amp; nobody's walking.

As I sit at a red light, a guy is standing by the roadside, across the street to my left. He motions me to roll my window down. I do and he shouts, in a pleading voice, ""Hey, do you have a couple of bucks?""

The light's about to turn green, so my thoughts are kind of rushed. But it seems like I have three options:

1. Drive away.

2. Give him a couple bucks. I don't know what he needs it for - could be a cup of coffee, or a bus ticket, or drugs. But if he's out at night in this weather, he's pretty desperate for *something*.

3. Ask him what he needs - maybe even offer him a chance to sit in my warm car (though I sure don't want to get carjacked or something, and as I said, only someone pretty desperate would be out there).

I finally did #2 - fished out two dollar bills and called out to him; he came and took it and thanked me profusely as I drove off. I said ""Good luck, man."" But when I got home, it bothered me that I didn't do anything else for the guy.

What do you think? Should I have asked him what was going on with him? Given him more than he asked for (say, five bucks)? Just gone on my way? Or do what I did - give him two bucks, figuring that since that's what he asked for, it would help solve whatever his problem was?",05Jan2018,1

211,"Hi guys, so I have a lot of stressful things happening at once essentially and I’m not sure what I should do. 

So to start I’m 23 and a college student. I live in an apartment with my girlfriend of 6 months and it’s just us after my cousin moved out in December. My lease is up in February and we can’t renew the lease because the apartment complex does not allow my girlfriends dog, which she understandably does not want to part with. Currently the dog is at her mothers Incase the question comes up. Anyway I haven’t found anywhere to move in to that I can afford that allows her dog. 

At the same time I am supposed to start UCF next week but I’m having trouble with my financial aid and was told by the school yesterday the same issue causing my aid to be unavailable would bar me from getting a loan from the school. And being my first semester as a transfer student I have to take atleast one class or I will have to re apply to get back into the university. 

I barely make any money as my previous job had to let me go when the slow season began. I’m currently delivering pizzas but it’s barely covering my expenses. I have applied for several jobs but I’m pending hire in all of them and my worry is that I won’t have any money to pay a deposit for anywhere I can find to live. 

If I can’t find somewhere to live I will essentially be homeless as my only family has moved 6 hours away to Atlanta and all of my friends houses are full. 

On top of that my girlfriend has said she is going to stop looking for houses and leave it up to me because she feels I only care about figuring out my school situation. 

I’m not sure what I should do. The only thing I can think of as a backup plan is to take an online class at UCF pay out of pocket for it, get a storage unit and put my stuff in it and live with my mom in Atlanta until I can find somewhere I can afford to live alone back in Florida because most likely going this route would be the end of my relationship with my significant other. 

Student housing is very hard to find vacancies you have to apply essentially months in advanced to get in so that is not an immediate option either. 

Thanks for any advice I can get.

232,"Hi all.  This is my first post here.  Last night, I received an anonymous email that said that my husband is cheating on me.  He wrote my husband’s name.  It was a Gmail so I went to gmail to confirm that it was a real username by typing it in to sign up a new account; it was already in use so the sender was a real person, not a bot.  (This was an online tip somewhere).  I responded by asking who was emailing me and this morning the reply email said (with poor lexicon/text talk) that my husband is cheating with sender’s wife and then said “his number is ###-###-####?  The number he gave is my husband’s work number.  

The questionable part are these:
1) it was to my work email, which can only be found in our online directory and if you do a google search for my name with a few other keywords, it doesn’t come up; therefore this person knows enough about me to find my employer and my email.  I don’t have my employer listed on Facebook, but I’m sure I’ve been tagged in a few things. 

2) the sender email is not linked to any social media page

3) sender knows our names, my work email, and my husband’s work number (but he wants me to confirm it)

Could this person be phishing for personal information to steal our identities? Or worse..... I don’t know what other steps to take.  I definitely don’t think I need to be communicating with a stranger on my work email about my husband’s infidelity.  I also don’t want to be the one to confirm any other information to this person if he is indeed trying to get our personal information.  

Any tips on how to proceed would be appreciated.  I immediately showed the first email to my husband who thought the whole thing was weird like me (and of course told me he would never cheat on me).  He wants to know who would say this.  I haven’t said anything to him about the second email.

I don't know if it's because I talk to them everyday and that there's no point in hanging out with me or rather I talk to them too much and that I'm being clingy. How should I approach this?

241,"So I have a tight knit group of friends. There are four of us. (T, S, M, and me) I’m giving them letters so I can refer to them without using their actual name. 

I knew S and M first. They are both seniors in high school I am a junior. We met T at a movie night for all the different schools in the valley. T is also a junior. 

S and M are both being accepted into their dream colleges that are far away. I will be left with T. 

That would be great except for I am really uncomfortable around T. He is too into physical contact, too many hugs and has to hold hands all the time he tries to cuddle all the time. He even tried to kiss me once even though he knew I am a lesbian. 

He is the kinda guy who always is playing his guitar when we hang out with the group and it makes it kinda awkward. 

He is a terrible influence. When I told him about my eating disorder he literally said to me “well most drugs don’t have calories” and shit like that. 

He romanticizes mental illness all the time and that particularly sucks because S and I and very mentally ill.

He hits on us all the time even though we are all clearly uncomfortable. 

I don’t want to be left alone with him when my two closest friends (S and M) go to college. 

What should I do? (He does go to a different school so that makes it slightly easier.)",05Jan2018,5

243,"I understand that he did/does LEGALLY have access to the accounts and the money in them, but the stipulation on the accounts is that if it’s not used for education purposes (which includes any technology, books, supplies, etc.) it’s heavily taxed. Although he’s listed as the owner of the accounts, they’re under my and my brother’s social security numbers so our credit is a huge concern considering I’m at the age where I should be establishing credit. We already have an appointment set up with a lawyer on Monday, but the company saying that his access is/was legal is giving me extreme anxiety that, if we had to go to court, he wouldn’t have to repay the debt or have any legal consequences.

The other thing I’m personally struggling with is whether I could ever speak to my father again. He stole money from savings accounts my brother and I had when we were little. He also stole from his mother, elderly aunts, and his own father when he was young (he’s a recovering addict with nearly 30 years clean time from drugs and alcohol, money has always been another addiction for him). Throughout my entire life he’s shown blatant and obvious favoritism for my brother. It almost has felt like he only loves me because I’m his child and he basically has to or that he never really wanted a female child. I haven’t seen or spoken to him since I got the news from my brother because I just can’t deal with it right now. On top of that he gave my brother the news only after I told him that my grandmother (on my mom’s side) was terminally ill. He had the chance to tell me then and there to my face, but he waited to tell my brother. And when my grandmother passed two days ago, he never even called me.

But I am feeling way more anxious with our relationship and he recently confided to my best friend that he doesn't feel I am confident and that I can make decisions.

247,"It's a new year, I want nice things done for my family. Not like out of this world royal family status type nice but just wanna do small things that'll make life easier in my house hold. We are a middle class kind of family, but can't afford extra things (like paying a snow plow to plow my drive way, or a dishwasher)

Let me give you an idea of my household. 

I come from strong Italian roots, my family lives with me, and we work like a team to keep up our house. 

I pay for all expenses. I work, come home and relax, and go back to work 6 out of 7 days of the week. I'm Catholic. 

My brother keeps up the house like cleaning, cooking and what not. he is 17 stays at home and does cyber school, tends to family needs when I can't etc. He's basically the man of the house when I'm not home. He isn't real religious. 

My grandmother is old. We do whatever we can do in our power so she can do what she wants when she wants so she can enjoy herself every day. She is a very religious Christian. 

My aunt lives on her own, but we consider her part of our household. She comes over and has dinner, relaxes at my house, does house chores with us, etc. she's Catholic. 

My other brother and his wife comes over so often we have a bedroom for them. We usually hang out in the basement drink beer and shoot pool and talk about our lives while his wife does their laundry and hangs out with my grandmother and aunt and they do their own thing. They're also both Catholic. 

We have 3 dogs, and 3 cats.

Lately I've been shoveling my drive way so my family can go outside and have some snow fun but not be buried in it. My brother walks the dogs on a daily basis, and I've been trying to make sure the gas tank is filled on sundays so my grandmother can go to church, although these are basically normal everyday things. 

What are some suggestions that I can do to make life more comfortable? Small things like idk turn the furnace on when I come home after work in the morning so everyone wakes up to a warm house, or brew some morning tea for a warm drink when everyone wakes up, or trying a new recipe for dinner. 

Usually I wouldn't be asking people for such suggestions, but I am literally stuck. I can't come up with ideas or anything.

My main basic idea to this is ""A new year, a new comfortable house"" my house isn't broken, and it doesn't need fixed, but I'd like to add improvements just for comfort and to see a smile on everyone's face. 

Thanks for the suggestions guys, and my bad for rambling on! :) Happy new year!

He won't stop taking photos of himself and has pressured my brother and I to take photos of him around our yard and other random places. Hell, a few months ago when we were all driving home, he saw this catholic church and forced my brother to take like 7 photos of him there. He is so obsessed with how his FB and IG friends view him. Furthermore, when we are out in restaurants, he won't stop taking photos of the food or the family eating. This last restaurant we went to had all these flowers which he wouldn't stop taking photos of and pressured me to take photos of him standing next to them. It's so embarrassing. Recently, I looked through his IG and FB and it's essentially dozens of photos of him and many were him taking selfies in the mirror in public places (This is what teens my age normally do, it's quite peculiar that a 51 year old man is doing it)

252,"I get pretty mad at work. I'm a supervisor in food service, and I work with a fuck-ton of idiots because the general manager will hire anyone who gives us an application. They fuck up orders a lot, which makes me have to deal with the consequences, even though 99% of the time I had no partake in the order. Examples would be like forgetting to include items in a delivery, giving someone bad product (like older bread, soup, lettuce). 

(This next paragraph is more of a vent, you can skip it but it could add context) 
I don't have 5 heads and I can't manage the whole store constantly, because there's things that I need to do at work that require my full attention. The thing that makes me angry the most is when customers call to complain about something, and the coworkers under me TRY TO FIX IT! When it's MY job to deal with customer complaints. Just last week, a coworker told a customer that they'd refund the amount paid on their card for a delivery THEY messed up, and they never refunded them! My coworker was joking with me later about it saying she ""nobody knows how to refund, so no one was going to do it"" When I KNOW how to refund and I was there the whole time!!! 

At this point why even be friendly to them. I'm the ""bitch supervisor"", because I let my anger show sometimes. I get frustrated, I'm human, I'm stressed. I don't want their validation anyway, because I don't need it. I don't care if they think I'm a huge bitch, I'm angry all the time, etc. I don't want to be their friend, I'm their boss. They're all idiots anyway and I have no intention being their friend because most of them are high schoolers and I am much older.

We are trying again and I'm trying not to use weed, but it's really tough since that's how I've coped with anxiety in the past.

That Spring they started being *everywhere*! All on my door, the walls surrounding my porch, sitting on my windows. And when I say they are gross and not just being some scary cat, not kidding their leg span is like 3 inches! They fly unpredictably like they are blind! 

It really has affected my life. I don't like to go outside when they come in April to when they start to leave around late May.

He pushes my sister around, is always harassing my youngest brother, and he has started to physically abuse, and threaten me, since he is now larger than me.

We called BC hydro for more information and they said our tenant called BC hydro saying the meter number is not hers and she gave our meter number to BC hydro for correction. (the tenant did not 
let us know). BC hydro accepted her request and did so (also did not let us know that they are doing this). 

As we complained, they said there is nothing we could do since it already happened and we need to pay our tenant's bill now. We asked is this possible to switch a meter number and the bill without our consent and they said it was possible. 

As we complained more, they said they will have an investigation on this case. The investigation happened in August and was completed in December where usually the investigation takes 4 to 6 weeks. Even they said it took long and they do not know why it took long!! almost 4 months?!! 

Along the process, they transferred our tenant bill to our bill and took it using pre-authorized payment. As we ask for a refund of the bill as the investigation was done but they refused since there is nothing they could do. They said we need to find our tenant to fix this problem.

She switched jobs and now has a much longer commute (not-walkable anymore) and wants me to pay more and everyone else pay less for the spot.

She can be awfully catty as well, and because they work much less hours, she is closer with the other roommate because they drink wine and watch tv every night but I dont get home until much later. It feels like theres a bit of an alliance forming.

I understand there is no contractual agreement for me to fall back on, but I don't find it fair to suddenly pay much more when that wasnt the deal. She is asking if we can broach the subject again and I want to keep everyone on a good page, but I dont think this is fair.

285,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am a 21 y/o female living at home with an insane mother. I don’t use the word “insane” lightly, and I’m not using it to condescend or make a joke of the situation. I mean my mother is fucking insane, and I’m severely suffering as a result of it. My mother has verbally and emotionally abused me for as long as I can remember. My father and my youngest sister (11) live with us. My other sister (18) is a freshman living on campus at a school nearby.

In school, everything had to be perfect. I was never allowed to fail, and anything short of 100% effort or score on a test was condemnable. These expectations fucked me up for a while and I’m still struggling to get out from under the grasp of perfectionism. She holds herself to the same unrealistic expectation, which only hurts her and makes her depressed because she is out of shape and “lacking” in other departments, too. She is highly disorganized, which she internally criticizes herself for but externally places the blame on everyone but herself. Even though my parents make good money, I get the sense my mother is very dissatisfied with her financial situation. She constantly describes us as “poor”, or “one paycheck away from living on the streets”, which is not even close to the truth. As a result, I get into practical arguments with my mom over money all the time.

All these things may sound just like semi-normal flaws so far, but here’s where it gets fucked up. My mother is prone to violent, verbally abusive outbursts at the drop of a hat. She will fly off the handle out of nowhere. I could ask her an innocent question like how her day was, and somehow the conversation devolves into what an “ungrateful little shit” I am. At the end of these outbursts, she usually makes herself cry and blames it on me, which is total bullshit. Thank god I’m mature enough to realize I’m not truly responsible for her woes, but I still can’t take it anymore. The years of verbal abuse have worn on me and left scars. My sister in university feels similarly. I’ve experienced the depths of depression myself, so I know what it’s like to feel like nothing is worthwhile but my mom just won’t listen to me. I’m highly concerned about my youngest sister and what my mom’s criticism might do to her.

The bottom line is, I think my mom has bipolar disorder, or some equally serious mental illness, and I don’t know what to do. Moving out is probably not an option for another solid year. I’m dependent on my parents financially as of now, and moving into a shitty apartment and working my hands to the bone to support myself is not my idea of a solution. I’ve tried talking to her about getting help before, but she’s so prideful she won’t admit the possibility that anything could be wrong in her head. My dad is too nice to really confront her. She verbally abuses him, too. The reason I think bipolar is because my mom can alternate from depression (of course she won’t admit it’s depression) to laughing at everything—anything you say is a fucking riot. She’s irritable, angry, venomous, depressed, impossible to ignore, and my financial lifeline. I have no idea how to convince her to help herself, or if there is a way at all.

I was born premature, so now I have cerebral palsy, anyway I am grateful for what I have  beacuse I can walk, I know I don't walk like a regular human  and I never won't but it fine cause still I can do many things with my slowly unsteady walking, I can go on walks, go to cafes, shops, almost everywere I want, There where I can't  go with my legs I go for it on my wheelchair, I also like my rehablitation that make me walk and use mu legs better, cause now I can't take them very high but I think there will be better of them, even If it won't be ""normal"" walking, still I can have improvent myself in my own way :D I have my rehablitaion session about 2-3 times in week and I aslo do my own rehablitation session on home about twice times at day :D I also often go for rehablitation camp, every of them is about two weeks long, I am there  often. I usually hace 2-3 camps on one year.

Whats about my relationship with other people?
I don’t know why  but I never  was that kind person that everyone likes. My cousins or other children who lived nebray only played with me cause my mom payed them with candies. When I was little I used to think that cause of my disablity, but  when even disabled kids  refunse to talk to me I realized something wrong is with my personality.
People often find me boring, annoying or even werid
I have one friend. I know him  from the camps. We often motivate each often to walk better  and I ever try to help to get the girl he likes. They suit to each other very well :)
I had an internet friend. I met her on some role-play site when we were both 14. We wewre close  for some time, she helped me to be more positive. But when she went to college and I stayed home we started to have less and less  in common. We both agreed, that we aren’t close as we used to be. Noe she e dosen’t read my texts anymore , but I don’t miss her and I feel very bad about it.

I had another  internet friend but she only called me stupid, bitch, and she said I don’t deserve to live I „broke up” with her after 3 years begin friends.
I really have good relationships with one of physiotherapist from camp. He is always there for me and I am there for him. We can laugh and cry with each other,we often disscus wirth each other on camp and we have some smiliar hobbies. I am not in love with him. Isn’t that werid?

What about my love life? I never been kissed, I never been on date I never had sex. I never been confessed I should be depressed about that, but I think I will be happier with begin single. It’s something wrong with that but I can’t change the way I think even I tried  to do it many times.
I had two crushes. 
Frist on my high school teacher, second on my physiotherapist  form camp .( but not  in one that I talked about  before). They are both males.
and there were sometihing werid about my love for them I never wanted to go with the. on dates, I never want wanted to kiss them or having sex with them. I just wanted to talk with them and sometimes hug… I never was sad cause I .can’t be with them

I never wanted and I don’t want to have sex with anyone. I  don’t understand why people like that very much. Naked bodies of both sexes never makes me wantss sex. I don’t masturbate ethier.

My educiaton is my worst factor. I never liked to study. I only liked english. After gratulation from high school I stayed home cause I didin’t pass my high school exam, but I tried to pass it about 4 times. I still live with my parents and siblings.
I was on some kind of centre wheere disabled  people learn how to look after themselfs, but I left that „school” few days ago cause  I find it not practical and one of teachers was mean for me.
What about my looks? Outside internet  people say nothing about my look, on internet they say  I’m ugly, and I have masculine face or I look average.
I’m bit overweight but when I start walk even more often and eat less junk food it gets  bit better, I still work for good shape. I look a bit younger than I am but I think that good point
My style has both tomboyish and girlish vibe. I never use make up. I often wear braids or pigtails, I like to wear loose t-shirts, hoodies and comfy pants and sneakers :)

I spend mostly of my free time on internet. I’m into japanese popculture ( Idol jpop, jmovies, anime, manga) and I like creepy mysterous films on youtube for example „Kraina Grzybów” („Mushroom land”) or „Magiczny Świat Ani” ( „Magical world of Annie” 
I like that  „mysterous, creppy things + 90’s in Poland” theme

How would rate me life?

Sorry for mistakes, I’m not english native speaker, anyway feel free to correct me

288,"I don't even know how to really start off but I am trying to figure out ways to change my overall attitude towards things (That still doesn't come off like I intend it to but it'll work). While I was growing up it was a constant take shit and deal with it situations, Dad was a recurring felon and mom was in an abusive relationship. I spent almost a year in foster care because my mom was MIA and dad was charged with multiple racketeering enterprises felonies that somehow I was tied into. I had to fight felonies out of multiple states, at the same time dealing with mom's boyfriend who thought it was appropriate to hit women and I was dealing with this ontop of making sure two other kids were taken care of. Well now that things have finally moved on, Mom isn't in that relationship anymore and he isn't in the picture. I dropped communication with dad when he threatened to kill me before I moved out because I wouldn't keep paying 100% of the bills months after he got out of jail, well he is back in jail now and out of the picture.

My issue is now that things are over I have a super serious attitude, I don't have any sense of humor and am not a people person at all because I don't trust people in general. I walk into work and I get comments 'you look so mad' and in reality I'm not at all, I might be a little tired from working overnights but that's it. I honestly want to change that, I just don't even know how. I've been told I need counseling but in all honesty I can't afford it and don't have the interest. It's one of those things I see it as I am an open book, I will tell anyone anything they want to know about me without hesitation. I've accepted what happened I'm just trying to get over it. I got really one good friend at work and that's it, the rest are acquaintances.

When I'm drinking my attitude changes completely so I know it's in there somewhere it's just finding it. I don't get stupid I just loosen up I guess and a sense of humor kicks in and confidence\ trust in people come out. I would give anything to have that kind of attitude in general without the loss of motor skills and half of my 3 brain cells not clicking together.",05Jan2018,1

I am kind of lost in the topic of college, not because I don’t know what I want to study, but because I haven’t received (what I believe) is proper orientation. I wish to go to a well-known woman in my country that helps young people like me choose in which university to study. However, my mom insists that it isn’t necessary and that everything will just “figure itself out”. I think she doesn’t understand how competitive scholarships abroad can be. Also, I feel she is too attached to me and uses excuses for me not to leave to another country. 

She won’t allow me to arrange a meeting with her, despite me offering to pay for it. How can I convince her to let me go on to a simple meeting?

I am dating someone polyamorously and they clearly (despite saying otherwise) need someore spontaneity or are stressed planning social things in advanced. How do I develop patience with people? Sometimes I try to invite people and just leave and do things by myself. For example I invited my roommates to hike, set a time we agreed on, assumed they'd be late, waited one hour after and then left. One of their feelings was hurt but if I just wait around all day I can't the shit I need and want to get done, done.

302,"I feel like I'm just getting bowled over from right to left by life at the moment. 

But after having health insurance for the better part of all my years in this world, I've lost it as recently as 5 days ago and I actually need to go to the doctor now. 

I have a 'periapical tooth abscess', (I looked it up on the web and I'm pretty sure that is what it's called) and now I can feel my body developing a fever. 

I don't know what to do. I can't go to a doctor to get this treated because I have no insurance and the bill will be huge especially now that I am just managing to almost get out of debt. I'm so close but I'll be straight back in debt again if I end up going to a dentist to remove the cavity that is causing all this. 

Is there a way I can let the bacteria run it's course and let me contend with the fever afterward through rest and plenty of water? I will eventually have to get this dealt with, but I don't have the means to deal with it now.

Please help

Edit: 
I am relatively young, 23, and other than a thousand dollars on credit card debt, I don't have any debt at all. But since I never used my health insurance when I had it, I just figured I wouldn't need it till later in life. 

Even more frightening is that I don't know anything about insurances because I was on my parent's plan. Ugh

- my dad and stepmom have been together for about 4 years

- one day (a few weeks before the fight) my stepmom talked to my dad about wanting to have babies, which clearly indicates she's not unhappy with their relationship (right?)

- A few weeks later, my step mom's sister (Who lives on the other side of the country) came to visit, and she stayed at her husband's aunt's place. 


- she arrived super late, it was three in the morning and my step mom wanted to go see her

- my stepmom can't drive and dad was too tired to drive her so she was like ""i'll get an uber"" but my dad said ""no you're not it's too late it's dangerous""

- she got really mad locked her self in her room and was bawling her eyes out and screaming (while talking over the phone with her sister)

- her sister got into her head and told her stuff like ""your husband isn't letting you live your life... blah blah blah.... you deserve so much more"" 

- my stepmom got even angrier started packing her bags and stormed out the  house...  just like that

- when her sister went back to their hometown, she left with her

- she blocked my dads number and never came back or called back


she has been away for three months. my dad and stepmom want to get a divorce. is there anything I can do to snap them back to reality and make them realize how silly they're acting?

314,"Warning: text wall- I put a brief TL;DR at the end!

My best friend and I are both in high school and I feel like I am so lame compared to her (calling her K).

I feel as though it’s not that I’m jealous of K, but I feel like I’m not on the same level as her. We’ve been friends for awhile, but she lives in the other side of town and I feel like the people she hangs out with there resonate and connect with her more then we do. She and her new friends like to sneak out and party and do ~teenager~ stuff, but I’m just here at home playing games with my sisters...

She’s also have had a lot of boyfriends- I know it’s dumb to compare my worth in terms of boys, but the last boy who really talked to me was for homework and test answer and to cheat off me.

Also K is literally so gorgeous. She’s got beautiful hair and amazing eyes and literal body goals, but I’m sorta just flat everywhere, too skinny, weird haircut and tiny eyes and wide nose. 

K is also social and humorous. She easily connects with people and tells me how it’s easy for her to just go up to people and chat with them, but I’m really shy and quiet and get stressed easily in social situation; aka I’m socially awkward. I’ve got maybe like 3 solid friends, but even then I don’t hang out with them often just text occasionally. 

These feelings I have of me being lame hurt my self esteem (obviously) and also make me scared that she is getting bored of me. Maybe she thinks I’m lamer compared to her other friends and just hangs out with me to not be rude... she’s told me before that she can’t hang out and then I’ve seen her those same days hanging out with other people. 

TL;DR~ My best friend K is really pretty, social, parties, and is decently popular with boys; and I find myself feeling lame and boring compared to her and makes me feel like she might be getting tired of me. This is also sorta random, but I’m Chinese and so I feel like I just don’t fit in sometimes because of my cultural differences (not sure how to word this sentence).

Is it appropriate for me to go for dinner at my restaurant when my coworkers wanted me to come in and I declined? This is so frustrating, tonight was supposed to be a nice evening with my mom and now I feel too guilty about the circumstances to go in and spend it with her.",05Jan2018,1

331,"Some backstory on my brother is that he’s struggled with depression and other related things his entire life, and was just fairly recently diagnosed as bipolar. On and off different meds, in and out of psych hospitals. Nothing helps him it seems. 


Recently after the latest stint at the psych hospital, my mom and step-Dad couldn’t deal. He didn’t seem to want to get better, and they can’t take much more of this life with him being the way he is, so they made him live with our dad and other step-Dad. They also have a hard time with him and are struggling. 


A blow up finally happens at my dads house and my brother leaves the house with literally nothing and hasn’t gone back since. He is at a friends house...we don’t know the friend, but his mom has spoken to my mom. 


I don’t know how to help. I’m concerned that he’ll hurt himself out there alone, he’s not very self sufficient, and he won’t talk to anyone. If he doesn’t go home my dad will cut off his cell and then we really won’t have any way of talking to him. 


What can we do?? He’s a legal adult so is there really anything at all? 


In the long run...what can we do about the misery my family goes through when he is there, including my brother himself?? Are there better places for people like him where they can stay and work on themselves with other people? Sounds a lot like the psych hospitals but they have all been horrible and ineffective. 


My family is still reeling from my uncles suicide last February and this is really hitting hard. We just don’t know what to do anymore. He seems unwilling to make any changes on his end, and it’s sad. ",05Jan2018,3
332,"Admittedly, I am an introvert, and there are plenty of times when I don't want to hang out with anyone and I'm just fine with it. But there are times, like this weekend, when I want to go for a hike or go to karaoke with someone and I have no one to ask. No one reaches out to me to do things, either.

What do you think is the best thing to do here? Should I just reach out to people I know? Whenever I do that, I always feel like I'm imposing or that I'm taking responsibility for them, like I need to make sure they have a good time when they hang out with me. If something goes wrong or something bad happens (like I invite them to karaoke and drinks are too expensive or something), I regret asking them in the first place. It feels so awkward to basically ask someone to come and talk to me for a few hours, like surely they have better things to do.

Are these worries irrational? I also think that maybe the reason no one asks me to hang out with them is that I'm somehow really annoying or bothersome in some way. I don't think that's the case (generally people seem to like me), but still, it's been a few months now and no one but my coworkers has called or texted me at all. 

What do you think? What are steps I could take to make sure that next time I want to go do something fun and social, I have someone willing to come with me?",05Jan2018,16
333,So me and my gf text at night a lot. its when we get to be really personal and talk about important things. occasionally her mom takes her phone away at night usually she only does this for a few days than stops. but we just had winter break and she was on vacation where we couldnt text so we didnt text for like 10 days. now that shes back her mom has taken her phone away everyday this week. i dont know what to do these talks we have are really important and its the only time we get to have them.,05Jan2018,2

336,"So there is this girl that I like very much and I plan on putting this letter in her locker. Im nervous and would like to know what you all think, whether it's awesome/terrible , maybe things I should add/remove ect. I want your 100 percent honest opinions :) 

""Okay so as cheesy and random this is going to be, I felt I should start taking more chances. First I should probably introduce who is writing this, Its Matthew, -Last name- to be exact, (from Spanish junior year) We really didn't talk much then but I blame the fact that we had assigned seats. But anyways the point of this is for me to tell you that i have always thought that you are very pretty, smart , and incredibally funny. I guess I couldn't really sum up the courage to say it to you before but I guess I do now. But yeah I think you are super cool and perhaps we could get to know each other better ? Maybe even go out sometime ? I know this is a super cliche way to do this but maybe you are the type of person who appreciates this kind of thing.

337,"Okay, so I accidentally bumped into a coworkers car at work and left a decent sized dent on the corner of her bumper. At the time the incident happened the girl was in her car and she was very nice about the whole situation. 

Since I'm under 25 years old I asked her to not report this to the insurance and she agreed. I really didn't want my already high insurance to go up even more over a small dent with no paint damage or electrical damage. 

I guess my concern is that a) she will go to her insurance later on and b) that it will cost over $1,000. It is a dent on the corner of the bumper so I hope it won't run over 1k. 
I apologized profusely and asked her to get an estimate and to send images of the estimate to me so I could venmo her the money. 

Can I get some thoughts on this? is this a non issue?

339,"So in the beginning of our relationship all he would do was touch me, tell me I have turned him into a pervert blah blah. We sometimes had sex 2/3x a day!! 8mo into the relationship, sex is still the same (great) we have tried new things together which has made it even better however... my bf is now starting to watch porn more than we actually have sex (it’s been a few months now) and it’s stating to bother me. Porn isn’t an issue. But the fact that he’s doing it everyday therefor we can’t have sex is starting to really get to me.

He comes home from work earlier than I do and it’s very obvious that’s he’s doing it because he’s either left a towel or shirt rolled up somewhere, closed the blinds in the bedroom and positioned pillows on the bed as if he was sitting up on the laptop. His excuse is that he is horny everyday he comes home and I’m not here to help with it because I get off just 2 hours later than he does. When I confront him about masturbating an why he can’t wait sometimes for me to get home he gets very angry, I have told him how and why it bothers me yet nothing seems to change. I have tried to watch porn with him and please him at the same time due to me not being able to have sex that week thinking maybe that would help things but nothing has changed. We don’t have sex as much anymore because he says If we have sex one day he can’t have sex again for another 24/48hr cause he needs to “reload” yet he can bust every day watching porn. He says it takes 30 seconds to cum watching porn VS having sex with me (he calls it making love with me because he isn’t doing it to cum)Anyways, I literally have to tell him some days “can you not masturbate so we can make love when I get home” like how stupid is that. He says he feels the same exact way about me, he loves my body, I have one of the best bodies out of all the girls he’s dated and so on. Yet we can’t have sex because he would rather masturbate every single day!!!! 

He’s even taken it as far as watching porn in the room while I took a shower. he’s straight up told me once (I had no clue he would even do that) and I then caught him once after taking a quick shower when he thought I was going to shower a bit longer.

What should I do? What would you do?
Is there another way to approach him about this? 

TLDR; bf watches porn everyday after work yet says WE can’t have sex everyday because  he needs to “reload” and when I do want to have sex I have to ask him not to masturbate before I get home and it starting to really bother me and idk what to do about it anymore. ",05Jan2018,46
