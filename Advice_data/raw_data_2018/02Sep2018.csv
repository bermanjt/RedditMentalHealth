0,I'd like to get to know a friend of a friend. My friend's schedule is very busy so I don't know when he'll be able to introduce me to the friend. Would it be too forward to cut the middle man and friend request on Facebook with an explanation of who and why I did so? Should I get with my friend so he can vouch? ,02Sep2018,2
1,"So I haven’t had sex in a little bit and I’m uber (no pun intended)ready to get it on with one of my old dick appointments. However my house and his aren’t options tonight and this is already super planned, but is it worth it to do it in the car? Like it’s a rav4 to give you and idea of where said action would take place, but I’ve never had car sex and I don’t want it to be awkward. I know it’s probably gonna be short anyway, but should I plan like play a playlist or put the seats down? And I’m going on a road trip tomorrow so hopefully it doesn’t carry the sex smell.

2,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. I’m in the USMC and my girlfriend, in her first letter to me after she left for navy boot camp, tells me she tested positive for chlamydia.

I’m pretty sure I got it from the girl I was hooking up with before I met my girlfriend. I just called that girl today and asked if she would please get checked so we can found out where this came from. We mutually agreed that since she slept around (A LOT) a little too much, that it’s probably her.

With me being in the Corps, should I tell my chain of command, go straight to Doc? I have no money so I’m not going to go off base and pay for it out of pocket.

Also, my girlfriend gets her first call on Monday. How should I go about that conversation? Should I ask for her past partners names so I could tell them for her? Should I tell her that it’s probably from some female I fooled around with before I met her? I’m trying to be a decent person in this situation. 

Give all the advice you can. If you want to know more info, ask.

3,"So this guy came over awhile ago asking to paint my address on my curb. I said no, and he kept asking for awhile until he left.

5,"I've recently enrolled and recieved my acceptance letter for my local community college. (Yay!) My plan is to attend the community college for two years and then transfer to a university to finish my BS in Computer Science. 

First, I'm terrified. I graduated HS in 2005, went to Remington College for dental assisting (8 month program) and graduated that program in 2011. I did well in both schools BUT, I feel like my memory isn't what it used to be. Could I be ""too stupid"" to make it? How does a school determine that I'm fit for college courses at this point?  

The next question I have is: what kind of laptop do I need? I don't have one just yet but obviously know I'm going to have to have one. Should I get something special for my major (Computer Science, just in case you missed it)? Is there a way to get one for cheap or have the amount tacked onto my admission cost? What specifications should I be looking for in a labtop? 

Lastly, what can I do to prepare myself for this journey?? I've already downloaded a DIY programming app (with a focus on Javascript), but I need ALL the help I can get. 

I'm scared. I'm excited and I just might be in over my head, but my life hasn't been what I've wanted and I've made shitty decisions and had shitty things happen in my life until here recently and I'm determined to try,  dammit. 

I want to believe I can do this. 

Give me the advice. All of thems Please!!!

7,"Okay so I met this guy like a month ago and we have hung out a couple times. The first time we hung out he asked me to give him a handjob so I could say I touched a dick. Anyway I freaked out but then told him I would touch his dick if he kissed me. He was like ""I guess that's fair"" and he gave me two pecks on the lips. A couple days later we hung out again and I offered to give him a handjob but I told him I would do it if he kissed me. He was like ""see I don't want to kiss you again because I don't want you to get too attached. When I get back together with an ex or get a girlfriend, the sadder you're going to be when I'm gone."" I told him the kiss doesn't have to mean anything and finally he was like ""just one?"" and we kissed each other.



We didn't hang out for like a month and a couple days ago he asked if I wanted to hang and I went over to his house. We sat in his car for like an hour and talked. Of course he was like ""will you please do me a solid?"" and pointed his eyes down toward his dick. So I gave him a handjob and put my mouth on his penis a couple times. After I was done I was like ""so what do I get?"" And he handed me a cigarette. Lol did he know what I was hinting at?

I don’t want to feel this way, but I suddenly find myself wishing I had never said “ I do.” And now I don’t know what to do. How do I even start the conversation?

I'm anxious all the time about things I don't have or have never experienced and as I approach 30 it's getting worse. I feel my gut churning every time I think about this stuff. Despite everything I do I just can't make the life I want happen. I'm obsessed with two things that seem to be out of my reach from ever obtaining. They are pretty basic things that most people seem to not even think about, it just happens for them. The first is that I really want to move out on my own to a decent apartment. Unfortunately apartment's cost more than 3x my income in my area. I've tried to get better paying jobs but I have failed every time. I keep getting told by friends, family and employers that I'm ""doing something right"" but that doesn't matter if I'm not getting the results I want. My parents are in a financial hole which they will never dig themselves out of and they tell me all the time that they wouldn't be able to survive if I didn't help them out financially, so another reason why I feel I cant leave. The thing is, I have a pretty cool job right now and I would stay but I'm humiliated that I live with my parents and I think that might effect my problem with the other thing I want which is a girlfriend. I've never had a relationship and it's so demoralizing to feel that no one finds you interesting or attractive enough. Every girl I've ever liked has had zero interest in me. I've spent my entire adult life, from high school to now, chasing women who acknowledge and even befriend me but have zero interest in anything beyond that. I don't really know why, I'm not fat, I'm not disrespectful or weird, and I'm always making people laugh. I know women don't owe me anything for those things, but damn, I feel like I'm viewed as some kind of asexual object. Right now there's this gorgeous and super nice girl at work who I've been trying to impress but I'm afraid to ask her out because I'm pretty sure she doesn't actually feel that way about me and then I'll be seen as that ""creepy guy at work.""  The only advice my father has is ""just hang in there something good will happen for all of us"" but that seems like terrible advice.

I recently found a very active site with users regularly posting horrific snuff and torture videos involving animals. I have sent info to a lot of large animal rights organizations (including PETA, Humane Society, and SHARK).

16,"I am looking at getting a 2nd degree and transferring a lot of credits. The school I am applying to has it on their website that ""Applicants who are ineligible to re-enroll at any college or university that they attended within the last seven years for student conduct reasons will be automatically declined admission.""

 I left my first university because I broke student conduct rules and would likely have been expelled at the hearing. They scheduled my hearing for the beginning of the following semester and they basically said that if I didn't re-enroll, the hearing would be cancelled and nothing would be on my official record so I left. I successfully transferred to another school (and another one after that), and I never heard anything of it. Now I'm worried because it looks like this new school has some much stricter transfer policies than the others I attended.

Does anyone have experience with this? If you're ineligible to re-enroll due to conduct or academic failure, that should show on your transcript right?

28,"So three years ago I was hospitalized and I met my friend in a psych ward which already gives away that the both of us have mental issues. anyway so we got along really well and the first year of our friendship was rather good and we actually talked about things that were important to us back then. But over the last two years he's changed so much and kept getting more and more distant, keeping everything to himself like his feelings and thoughts to the point where our convos consist of a meme from him (instead of a greeting) and me answering how funny it is. Also every time I asked him to meet again IRL he always found an excuse or just didnt answer me. I kept trying to talk to him, asking questions, you know, trying to hold onto this friendship but he's so distant, I feel like I'm wasting my time on him. He's the one starting most of our ""convos"" but I feel like he doesn't mean it, if that makes sense? I already tried talking to him but he keeps dodging my questions and making everything look ridiculous even though I'm seriously worried. 

For a few months now I tried to fit into in what I think is his ideal friendship thingy but I can't deal with it. I need at least some intimacy which he hates and refuses to let happen. I'm really considering telling him how I feel and just ending our friendship because that isn't the way I want it to be and I doubt he's able to change- and I dont want him to change just because I can't live like this.

She is my best friend and I love her. But it’s getting harder and harder everyday to like her, to ignore all the faults that I hadn’t seen before. She has a horrible temper and when she flies off the handle she will rant for hours, even when everyone has stopped listening. She’s even prone to physical  violence, though never at me. She would throw things, break objects and attack and threaten my father. When I was younger I’d just hear them yelling, it would be normal, just adults arguing. But as I got older the less I was able to shelter myself. I also love my father. Where me and my mother are compatible personalities me and my father have more shared similarities. I was never as close with him as with my mother, we’re both distant people by nature, but I always understood and respected him. It’s so hard, I don’t know how to keep all of this together. Both my parents are good people, I truly believe that, but they can be so terrible to each other. We just came back from a family vacation, and it was the most perfect vacation of my life. It was super last minute but everything fell in place perfectly, the weather was perfect and it was beautiful. We came back yesterday and another yelling match ensued. For no fucking reason. There never seems to be a good fucking reason. My dad will make a jab, malicious or light hearted it depends, and my mom will blow up. She will follow him from room to room, she will get up in his face, she’s talk quietly continuously for hours even after he’s put headphones in and try to open the door after he’s closed in, just to yell more.

Every time I try and help she either ends up ignoring my advice or she turns it around, she’s started to think that I’m being turned against her and of course she’s blaming that on my dad too.

I am fully aware of when she is manipulating me and how to deal with it, but honestly I am beginning to feel like her psychologist and it’s getting tiring.

every now and then, this friend will tell me something bad that her parents have said about me, I think she does this to make me feel guilty for not doing something that she wanted me to do (even if it’s not something that I am in ANY WAY obligated to do) ... for example, i cancelled plans with her to bring her to a vacation condo, as my mother said she was too tired to deal with her (understandably) and i had to follow a strict exercise schedule that I knew she would get in the way of.  she later told me that her father says that I am a horrible friend who is unreliable, and that she should no longer be friends with me.  I’m not stupid, I knew that in telling me this, she was trying to get me to feel guilty for not hanging out with her.  i told her that she should not be sharing this kind of information with me (for the 4th time), and she said that the whole thing was stressing her out and she needed time to “cool off” .. ah, yes!  because when you’re being incredibly rude to me, *of course* you need time to recover from such emotional trauma!

anyways, i know that any normal person would boot her out of their life (as pretty much all who befriend her end up doing) but i know that if I do that, she will say incredibly bad things about me to her next friend.

36,"Hi everyone.

I don't know where to begin, but thank you for reading this. Here's some background. For as long as I can remember, my family have dealt with poverty. I am used to a life on the constant move. I am used to having electricity shutdown or paying food with EBT... I am used to living in projects. I am used to working side-by-side with my parents at the local Chinese Buffet. I am used to dealing with depression and a shit reality. What I am not used to is my current life...

In a way, I won the lottery- a ticket out of hood. I worked extremely hard back in high school, juggling grades and work. I worked after school till late night. When I get back, I had to catch up with school work and as much sleep as I can get only to wake up at 6:30 the next day to repeat all these again. I didn't have any friends or a carefree teenage. Nonetheless, the hard work paid off and I was able to attend a great college with full financial aid. You may think it all worked out and hey here's a good old American dream, but it really has not. I am in my 2nd year currently and I am more assured than ever to drop out... I know this is stupid, but I can't seem to convince myself the otherwise. I am constantly haunted by the fact that I can't be there for my family. Just the other week, we were late again on duke energy bill. My mother has chronic back pain and I would massage her back every other day...and I haven't done that for the last 2 years. My sister's epilepsy hasn't gotten better and whenever she has an episode I can't be there for her. Situation at home hasn't gotten any better and I blame myself constantly for not being able to help out. I don't know how my parents would react to my decision... perhaps, my father would yell at me and my mother would cry. I hate to give it all up. My grades are good. In fact, I got into a research lab last year and my research projects are very close to publication...

You know, even if I don't blame myself for not being there - I am living a life that I really don't think I deserve. This thought haunts me constantly. I haven't quite gotten along with anyone here in my new life. I hate the thought of going out to party on a Thursday night while my parents are both working and my little sister at my cousin's place... I have big dream of becoming a professor and a scientist to lead my own lab one day and to help combat environmental pollution and to inspire kids to pursue science. But this all sound too idealistic. I am nothing but a hood rat. Yes, I don't want to give it all up because I worked my ass off... But down the road, I am looking at 2 more years of undergrad and 4-5 years of grad school... My second plan is to transfer to a community college near my house. My current college is 2-3 hours away. Whenever, there's an emergency, I had to skip the entire day of classes and lab...

Honestly what would you do in my situation? I sincerely thank you for any advice.

38,"So, I just started a new job and &amp; about half of my shifts have me waking up at 4am. Due to a lot of things happening in my life, my sister is letting me stay in her apartment &amp; sleep on one of her 2 couches. (Side note: I don't own a car nor do I have driver's license)

TL;DR My sister's family doesn't care if I have to wake up early in the morning for work. There's nothing I can do at my job right now because we're short staffed. Anything I can do?

I'm extrodinarily grateful for this, because my new job is extremely close, she charges me almost nothing for rent, &amp; I get free meals. I also try make myself as unintrusive as possible. I help clean, I'll buy groceries, &amp; buy whatever little things we need around the house. I also wear headphones &amp; earbuds almost the entire time I'm in the apartment so I'm not making any noise.

With my new job, if I get any open shifts I have to wake up at 4am. I personally require 6+ hours of sleep to be able operate properly. Anything less &amp; I'm physically exhausted the entire day.

The problem is that my sister &amp; her husband don't care. E.G. Tonight is Saturday night &amp; I have to open tomorrow. They just finished watching a movie at 9:30pm. They then decided to binge watch a show, probably until 11-11:30pm. I noticed &amp; said, ""Hey guys, I'm really sorry but I have to open tomorrow &amp; I really need to sleep."" Their response, ""You can still go to sleep, but we're not going upstairs."" I.E. Go fuck yourself.

I don't understand. They know my job requires a lot of physical labour. I do as much as I can to be an excellent house guest. But once I ask for them to give a little, they tell me to fuck off?

I am 29 and have always wanted to live in a big city. My fiance is 26 and is starting a two year grad school program. After she's done, the plan is to look around at places like New York City or Chicago or LA. I am afraid, though, that moving to those places in my 30s will not be the same as what I've imagined over the years... essentially the kind of idealized 20something city life you see in media. Am I being silly? Part of me thinks 30 is an arbitrary number, but part of me worries about this nonetheless.

41,"I’m in a dilemma with what I should do about a situation with my grandparents. They are both in their 80s. I’m not the closest with my grandfather but have been trying to be lately. My grandmother, on the other hand, has repeatedly shown herself to be a toxic, manipulative narcissist.

They had my mom when they were quite young (my grandmother was 16). The issue relates to that — there are rumors that she poked holes in a condom which caused my mom’s conception. It eats at me to know that my grandfather might not know the truth and that she could have gotten away with a lie like that. 

I don’t know how I could confirm the truth without her just denying it. I think her sisters might know but they could just deny it, too.

45,"I was just dumped by my girlfriend last night, and I don't know what to do. ""I can't really say I'm in love with you"" is what she said. This just came out of nowhere and I feel like I can't breathe. The day before yesterday I thought we were still madly in love, now I'm heartbroken. 

I just wish I knew what went wrong. I wish she would tell me that I did something wrong, tell me that I fucked up, tell me I had abhorrent personality traits, at least then I could make *some* sense of it. But she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. She loves me but she's not *in love* with me anymore. How am I supposed to react to that? How can you say you love me on Sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on Friday? She keeps insisting that I didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am I supposed to understand that? I'm just hurt and confused.

She stopped by my house last night to return some things I left in her apartment, one of my shirts she had (she kept the other one, and this one still smells like her 😢 ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents I gave her for Valentines this year. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I spent all night crying, I feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. 

It's like I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't wake up from. Whenever I was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. Despite all the bullshit I deal with on a daily basis, I always felt alright, because I knew that no matter what happened I had her beside me, and she made everything alright. I honestly don't know how I'm gonna make it through the rest of the year.

The worst part is how nonchalant she was. She seemed just so apathetic about it. Our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and I was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. But when dumping me she was so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. We were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to care. She said she doesn't see us having a future together; I saw us potentially getting married one day, I definitely saw a future with her. And she used to see one with me, I just don't know what changed.

I don't know how to deal with this. Without her I just feel dead inside. Just last week I was so happy, now I don't know how I'm gonna live without her. She was the best thing that ever happened to me, now I feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. She said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. I don't think I could ever find anyone else as amazing as her.

The only one I feel like I can turn to at this moment is my best friend. They try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but I'm a crying mess right now, and I don't feel ready to try to date again.

46,"I've had some suspicious symptoms, so I went to the doctor. She seemed very worried, signed me up to colonoscopy and other tests right away. That got me a little worried. I went to r/cancer and read posts of people with rectal/colon cancer, and it seems like the symptoms match. Then again, it might be a lot of different things. I'm just thirty, though I had cases of colon cancer in my family.

&amp;#x200B;

I have my test in three days. I'm scared. It's 3 AM right now, and I cannot sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem here is, every time I think of a person that could give me some emotional support, I have a good reason why I shouldn't.   


My mom? She's very panicky. I remember she had a cancer scare few months ago- she presented it to the family as if she definitely does have cancer. I was so worried I had to take a day off at work. I feel if she started her panic routine, I would just feel worse.

My dad? I feel like he'd feel guilty for this somehow. He's kind of depressive, and he already worries about providing for the family enough.

My sister? She has anxiety disorder, and struggling through the college (she has great grades, but the stress is killing her), barely staying afloat. And she has severe fear of mortality since childhood.

My other siblings? Too young. They're still kids.

My grandma? She lost five of her siblings to this cancer, I really don't want to tell her unless I will know for sure I'm not worrying her for naught.

My best friend? He lost his both parents in traumatic event, got PTSD. He confessed to me once he had nightmares about people he loves dying, including me. No.

My other friends? One is a good drinking buddy, but not an emotional support. Plus his dad got cancer lately. The other became my boss. 

I even thought about venting on the internet to my buddies- we aren't so tight that they would lose any sleep over that, but like me enough to cheer me up a little. But then, there's the location. I could probably tell them if it was a lung cancer or brain tumor or something, but speaking about my ass to people I usually play video games with would feel embarrassing.

&amp;#x200B;

The dumbest thing is, I did tell two people.

One, when I tried to breach the subject, told her I will have to have colonoscopy and that the doctor seemed worried it might be something serious, dismissed me saying she had one herself and was OK so I also will and seamlessly returned to conversation about cat food. The other I know from the Internet kind of listened to me passively, politely asked few technical questions about the procedure, then returned to conversation about their problems. I don't blame her, she lost her father to cancer so I guess it must be a hard topic to her, and I kind of regret I told her.

47,"So in early July, I booked a flight to Sydney on 9/11 so that I could go attend a friend's wedding (I also travel insurance for this trip, just in case anything happened). Then literally the day after I booked tickets, my boss announced that I was going to be laid off and that my last day would be 8/3. Although I was laid off, I still held on to my ticket in the hopes that I'd be able to find a new job before my trip.

Now I'm thinking I should probably cancel my trip, but it looks like I can't even get a refund because the travel insurance policy states that I need to have been with my previous employer for THREE YEARS (I had only been with my employer for little over a year). I'm at a loss at what to do now. Should I just move forward with the trip?

Over the summer we ended up spending a lot of time together and getting really close, and we would even hold hands and cuddle and stuff. I finally asked him how he felt, because he was sending mixed signals, and he told me he didn’t know. As in, he felt more comfortable around me after we acknowledged the fact that I liked him, and it was like some tension was released between us and it allowed us to get closer, and he wasn’t sure how he saw me. We were both going to the same university too, and he said that we should wait until then to make any decisions about “escalating our relationship” which I took as “oh, he likes me, because he’s been thinking about this” and I got my hopes up. For the past 2 weeks we’ve been spending so much time together, and I felt like we had something. Well, on Wednesday night, he told me he thinks of me as a friend and he doesn’t want that to change.

59,"Relevant-ish Backstory:

  My mom was out with my cousin visiting to tour the city, but I willingly chose to stay in my home because I was lazy (😅 sorry for that). So I just stay cooped up in my room playing games and watching shows and videos as normal. Then, I heard 3 doorbells and the door just slammed (not unlocking with a key, just a slam). I heard footsteps (sounding like rainboots) going up the hallway once. I then rang a phone call to my mom to make sure everyone left and no one’s home except me. She said yes, and she was confused (and explained it was probably upstairs noise). I responded with no, explaining that the footsteps were way louder and sounded way closer to my door than upstairs’ numbing footsteps. So we were both confused, and ended the call. Then I just continued to do what I relaxingly do. Just after a moment of silence, I heard the same footsteps coming opposite in direction and the door slamming again. I was confused again and called my mom. Same explanation and asked me to go get ready for dinner outside. I was a bit unnerved by the footsteps and needed a bit convincing to head out. There were some things that happened such as arranging for my aunt and uncle to pick me up and having the apartment manager to check the door to be locked and that I’m okay (which are both cleared). So after a clean search of the home and being relaxed (assuming I’m just hearing things), I got ready for dinner and just did our family dinner. 

  However, the next day, just now, my mom noticed that her valuable jewelry and rings are gone. She remembers that her box and full of it, but it is now strangely empty. 

  So we came to the conclusion, that what I’d heard was actually a robbery taking place. It’s good that the robber didn’t go inside my room, but it’s unnerving and terrifying that the incident actually happened.

But one detail of that conversation stuck with me, he said that she’s really into guys with dark hair and light coloured eyes. And being a guy with dark brown hair and light blue eyes (ridiculously blue) I find that detail sort of believable, like that’s such a random thing to exclaim, out of that conversation, It’s just a really absurd thing to say. It just seems like to me that she’s told him she likes me and he’s asked what about him and she’s said those exact words. 

Anyways, I walked in with a hickey, and after the conversation he insists that we would be good for each other, and he asks me if I’m in a relationship, and being loyal to my lovely girlfriend I said yes.

I go to bars, gigs, climbing, archery, burlesque classes, art groups, coffee, cinema, galleries, whatever on my own - for the record it's best to have company, some things just aren't fun when you're on you own and sometimes in bars I get funny looks (maybe they think a date stood me up IDK)...but it sure as hell beats sitting in an apartment staring at the walls.   


I've not gotten up the cahonas to go to a karaoke bar alone yet, but who knows!   


Anyway...  


I was planning on going to an electro-pop gig in a warehouse-type venue just for something to do, but an acquaintance messaged me to go to my usual bar to watch a Metallica cover band which is more my kind of thing...so I go, and he asks me if I was going to have gone to the other gig on my own. He seems completely surprised when I say yes, he jokes 'what don't you have any friends?' so I said no and he seemed surprised by this too, tells me I'm brave to go places on my own.   


I've had therapy in the past (for depression that comes from having no friends!), therapists have applauded me for going places alone too - I get that maybe they have patients too depressed to get out of bed or so anxious they can't leave the house, but I'm not like that and it feels patronizing to get praise for something as simple as just going somewhere.  


~~Is this really something people struggle with?~~   


Okay so some people struggle with this, but is it really so strange?

Up until recently this summer has been the best of my life. I just graduated high school in June and spent the whole summer hanging out with friends and really enjoying myself. Honestly it was the happiest I've ever been! But things changed a couple weeks ago. Pretty much all of my friends left for college in mid/late August, but I don't start until mid September, leaving me with about a month alone. I really love the school I'm going to and honestly wish I could've started 2 weeks ago, but since they have such a different scheduling system then everyone else I feel like I'm just sitting around waiting to start. Almost like post-high school pre-college limbo :/ 

Since they all left I've been a lot less productive then I'd like. I've spent the last two weeks doing what feels like nothing... and I feel like I'm wasting a great opportunity. I know I won't get this much free time for a long, long time, and I feel like I'm wasting it. I don't have a job, since school is starting soon, and I don't have friends to spend time with since they all left already, so I've basically just sat around watching Netflix and playing video games just to burn time. I've been drawing a little too as it's a huge passion of mine, but I feel like I don't do it enough. Overall I just feel terribly lazy.

Maybe I'm being too hard on myself, I don't know. At the very least I've been going to the gym a few days a week, buying supplies for college, and getting some doctors appointments done. But a full month to do all this is just way more than I need. 

TL;DR - I have a bunch of free time and I feel like I'm wasting it. What should I do to not feel so lazy?",02Sep2018,1

73,"My dad and i have always had a complicated relationship. My parents were fairly young when they had me and divorced after only a year of marriage. My dad and I were best friends growing up and I was closer to him than my mom. I spent a lot of time with him and he was a great dad. My mother got remarried when I was 9 years old and I moved about 30-45 minutes away. In the years after, my father stopped seeing me as often. He would often say he would come pick me up for dinner or to hang out and then call as soon as I would get out of school and say, ""Well I know you're busy, you must want to be with your friends..."" but I never did. He disappointed me so much those years. He later told me that he just was hurt because another man (aka my awesome stepdad) was stepping in to take care of me (aka because my father didn't want to financially) and that he was trying to distance himself and was too lazy to sit in all of that traffic. My father and I had a lot of fights during my middle school years. He would go against my mom's rules and tell me I couldn't do things. He would explode into fits of rage where he would scream at me and I would be scared shitless. Throughout my high school years, we would go months without talking or seeing each other. He would never reach out, he'd wait for me to reach out, and then try to make me feel guilty by saying I never call him. Anytime I said something he didn't like (aka teenage sass), he would call me a ""spoiled selfish brat."" In the 2-3x a year I would see him, he would remind me that he was my father and I needed to respect and listen to whatever he said. He also always took these opportunities to remind me that he stayed in this city for me and that he could have moved somewhere else and become a famous musician.

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship got a little better in college. He was more like a friend or an uncle that I would see a couple times a year and we kept conversations light. I didn't divulge most of my life to him and he still doesn't really know as much as he thinks he does about me. About a year ago, he got married to the most vile person I've ever met. To make a long story short, he met her about 10 years ago, when she was married and had one kid. In October of 2016, she got a divorce, he reached out, and they started talking. By July of 2017, they were married. During this 10-month period, here were just the red flags that I saw (keep in mind how distant our relationship is):

* She was not granted custody of her son (who is autistic) and her daughter (who is my age) no longer speaks to her.
* She got divorced (had been married since she was 18) and immediately started talking to my dad. She would make my dad feel so pitiful for her that he gave her money (he makes relatively no money, owes my mom money from child support &amp; other health related costs \[it had been 3 years since I turned 18\]) and she accepted.
* I was hospitalized for dehydration and my mother let my father know I was there. He brought her to the hospital and was rushing to get to my room, because he didn't know what had happened. She got offended that he was walking so fast and wasn't holding her hand and was walking slightly in front of her. When she got there, she thought she was the doctor, and after the doctor telling me he believed I could keep water down.. she told me that I shouldn't drink the hospital water because it has chemicals in it.  
* She hadn't met my grandfather (who doesn't live locally) and got into a heated argument with him because he responded to one of her FB posts saying ""I'm too old for that shit!"" (sarcastically) and told him not to use that language on her page. 
* Started a random argument with my cousin on FB, who is a cardiothoracic surgeon and whom she has never met, about the field of medicine.
* Made my dad go on a treasure hunt in our huge city to find her the perfect engagement ring that she had seen in a vision from God. He could only marry her if he found it because then that would mean God approved of their marriage.
* Told me bipolarism is sexually transmitted and that her ex-husband is bipolar.
* Told my dad that she believed his pitbull would bite her son so she wanted him to get rid of it. &lt;&lt; My dad called me to tell me this and made me try to find a place for him. She just demanded that the dog be gone and I had many sleepless nights and strongly urged him to keep the dog. I told him I'd pay for the dog or take the dog if I had to. She didn't bother to help him find a home for the dog. This was the last straw - I told him if he did that, I would never speak to him again. Thankfully he ended up keeping him.
* Told me at 5PM the day before they were getting married.. that they were getting married the next day and I needed to skip any plans and get a dress before then. LOL then didn't include me in their wedding ceremony.. only her son.
* Decided to not work for the entire time they were dating + first 6 months of their marriage.. so my dad paid for all of her and her son's expenses (including all of the son's very expensive supplements &amp; organic special food he is on) -- while still owing my mom money for his own daughter.

There are many other instances of craziness from this girl.. but they ended up getting married in July of 2017 and by the end of the month, my dad asked to have dinner with me and my boyfriend.. and told us he had already thought about getting an annulment, because she had been verbally abusive and when they got in a fight, she asked my dad, ""Don't you want to hit me?"" and was trying to get in his face (of course he didn't hit her). She refused to take his last name, but decided it would be a good time to legally change her first name.

&amp;#x200B;

After the wedding and this dinner, my dad and I continued to not really have a relationship. In May of this year, we had lunch and he ended up confiding in me that they had separated and had talked about separating as early as September of 2017. They were living separately and seeing how things went. I saw her a couple times after this (my grandfather came in town) and she seemed to be a little better. But then - my dad called me in early June and said she had completely gone off the deep end. She was sending 100s of abusive text messages a day and then after he blocked her, she was sending 100s of emails a day. She would say the most heinous and nasty things I've ever read in my life. She basically took everything my dad had ever confided in her about things he was insecure about and threw it in his face.. over and over again. I started becoming very worried about my dad because he said this was causing him so much stress that it was giving him chest pains. The wife was even trying to involve my elderly grandmother to pit her against my dad. This really worried me and so I tried to just really be there for my dad. While working full-time and going to school, I'd stay on the phone with him late and let him confide in me. No matter our past, I just wanted him to be okay and I started to feel really bad for him.. I thought this must be absolutely humiliating. This hell went on for about 2.5 months, constantly. She ended up texting him things about myself and my boyfriend (""I hope your daughter has a man treat her the way you've treated me."") and my stepfather and mother,  whom she has met one time. I thought things for sure pointed to a divorce. 

Well.. I guess I was wrong. My dad and her are trying to work things out. My dad has been a constant source of negativity to me since I was in middle school. We are nothing alike.. and quite frankly, he raised me to have confidence and not to ever let someone treat you like shit. To see him going back on all the values he taught me when I was little is disheartening. He also continues to belittle me now that I've questioned his decision to work things out. He says, ""Well she's my wife,"" over and over and over again.. like marriage has really been that sacred to her. I've been in a serious relationship for 6 years and he just acts like I don't know anything about life or about hardships in a relationship. 

The times that my dad and I have stopped talking.. my grandparents have guilted me into calling him again, and I always do.. because I don't want to regret not talking to him and he is my father. He's been extremely negative my whole life about my mother and my mother's side of the family (who have always been nothing but kind and amazing to me) and he's honestly just not a happy person. I want to be there for him, but I just feel like I don't want the negativity in this next chapter in my life of adulthood. My boyfriend and mother and close friends who have been with me through all of this are obviously biased.. and I just need some unbiased opinions. Thanks for reading.",02Sep2018,1

77,"Welp I've got no one to ask, so I come to you guys, hoping I'll get something substantial. 

Let me give you a little background before I begin the story. I'm a young twenties [M], and my coworker is a mid twenties [F]. We are both new at our company. I've been there about 6 months, she started a month or so after me. This is a very professional job, and definitely a career and field that I am interested in. Since she started, we have always been friends. We got along as we were the two new employees and the two youngest in the office. Both of us moved quite s far way to start working for this company, me from CA to MD, her from FL to MD. Anyways, we have hung out, outside of work a few times since she started. Gone and got drinks, hung out at each others place, etc. She is bisexual, and currently engaged to another woman. This is where things get weird.... 

Last night, I was over at her place with her fiance there. There was supposed to be a few more of their friends over, however they cancelled last minute. I got there around 8pm and by 10-11pm had finished off the 6 pack I brought over. We were all hanging out in the living room, then her fiance fell asleep on the couch. Me and coworker decide to keep the party going and start making some mixed drinks. After a few hours of talking, I tell her I'm thinking about leaving the company for a better paying job. She starts crying, and I think that is somewhat strange. As time goes on, I can tell something is up. At about 3 am she starts saying ""I know a better way to pass the time."" Or some shit like that. I question what she means, although I know damn well. She then proceeds to say ""Fuck it!""and grab me by the dick and starts making out with me. This was no normal make out session, I'm pretty sure I have a hickey on my tongue today (is that even possible?). Things get real hot and heavy, we start groping each other and getting each other off on her back porch while her fiance is passed out inside. 
Next thing I know, we are going down to my car to fuck, and did we ever. I'm a little kinky, and she is too, so honestly it was pretty good. 

After we finish up, she starts talking about how she has wanted this for so long and so on. Then she mentions she wants an ongoing thing, where we sneak out and lunch, and try and fuck in the office. Basically this is where I need advice. I'm all for hookups, however one of rules before last night was, ""no one i work with"". Obviously that rule was broken, should I continue on with this? Should I end things? I work with and supervise her, I dont want things to be awkward. Shes supposed to be coming to my place tomorrow and I really need someone to tell me what they think before then. I'm torn...

80,"Sorry first off because this is going to be quite a long post. I just want to make sure I’m able to describe the situation as best as possible. (Also reposting hopefully so more people can see this)

I’ve just recently come out of a 6 month relationship with a guy who was just too different to myself. Non of our morales lined up and he was far too into the relationship, (would tell me he loved me etc.) and just in general moved way too fast for me. I’ve been on a few dating apps trying to put myself out there after going through some shit but I haven’t really felt a connection with anyone that was promising.

Until of course I moved projects at my job. I work at a call center and I moved projects recently, so instead of working on sales I’m working in customer service, and now as of recently I’m going to be put up for a promotion to work in the training department as a trainer so I won’t be just an agent starting soon. (Not that this exempts me from anything, but since I’d be in management, at least I wouldn’t be working under my crush as his employee anymore).

So yes, I have a crush on my boss. He’s pretty close in age to me and I never intended to start crushing on him. I’ve been in denial for awhile but lately I’ve been entertaining and just now coming to terms with the fact that I do have a crush on him to begin with. 

I’m the type that needs someone to bounce back and forth with jokes etc, and I have a knack for not being able to filter myself, so I tend to be pretty sassy. Now Kyle and I (I’ll call him Kyle) are able to throw sarcastic remarks back and forth, and it almost feels very coy when we speak with each other? For example one time him and I where joking after I asked for help he said something witty and I asked if he was starting with me so early in the day, he winked and just gave me this very smug look and told me always. 

It’s hard to put into words exactly everything that happens between us but he and I almost always flirtatiously banter back and forth, he always winks and laughs at my dumb jokes, we get along so well our other coworkers started to notice. Kyle doesn’t really get along with anyone (he’s told me specifically) and he’s always complaining about having to be fake kind around everyone else on the floor. A coworker of ours pointed out once that Kyle and I got along super well, even though he didn’t get along with anyone except for me really. 

He’ll tell me little things for example one night his neck was hurting and he said it was from sleeping on his couch, I had asked him why he didn’t just sleep in his bed, and he told me it didn’t matter he had no one at his apartment anyway. (He’s made his abundantly clear over the course of our discussions) The other night my friend was making fun of the way I ask questions at work and Kyle said that whenever I ask him questions with my tone he smiles to himself.

He has this look whenever we talk and sometimes he fidgets like crazy whenever we talk with each other, one time he told me I was distracting him just by leaning on the cubical wall while we chatted and was acting super nervous.  One time he accidentally called me babe and moved on super quickly to whatever we where chatting about. 


Just today early in the evening I was asking him questions and he was being super fidgety and nervous. Right before I left Kyle and I where chatting about scheduling PTO for my birthday (which is coming up on the 16th soon) and him and I where laughing and had a great time chit chatting, and somehow I don’t even remember how we started talking about it he brought up the fact that he was single and let me know why they didn’t work out. Things like this keep lining up and he always gets this certain smile on his face when we chat.

He’s the type that’s sarcastic and doesn’t put up with people’s BS but cares in his own strange way. I just don’t want to screw things up at work but somehow loose a possible great connection? I always feel like we flirt back and forth and have a great connection, but of course I’m slightly hesitant here.

I also am slightly self conscious because he’s not the tallest of people and is pretty slim and I’m short and chubby, so sometimes I worry about being the chubby girl who is just wishing for there to be a connection. 

I’m not sure if I should approach him? Dial up the flirting? Trying to get over my insecurities about myself and not fuck things up at work. I just need any advice. I really like Kyle but I’m just not sure how to proceed or if it’s even worth it 😩 

__TL;DR__ I have a massive crush on my boss and we both flirt with each other like no tomorrow. I’d hate to loose out on a possible connection and need any advice.",02Sep2018,3

The last year has been difficult but that’s not my reason for wanting to be done with relationships it’s just that I am going through a lot internally. Mentally I’m dealing with childhood trauma and just trying to work through that. I am sensitive and a bit fragile. He’s the type that stuff his feeling down and he has this attitude towards me being emotional as he says I care too much and I need to learn how to not let everything effect me. He always says how I complain about everything I mean even at the slightest it’s just me voicing a concern I have. 

We recently got into about his family and the fact in the beginning we said we weren’t raising our child around them and same for mine...now his aunt disrespected me saying how I didn’t have a job and he takes care of me which is true I’m a stay at home mom.  He at first seen the problem but now that she’s apologized that him about something she’s done to him he says that she had the right to ask and address that has he was asking could we stay a night there. Now I have a problem with my 2 year old being around anyone that holds a certain character. Our families relatives have done things that effected us as children and now we just don’t want to expose are kid to that. 


More so he’s a avid gamer I mean in his spare time that all he does...he works then comes home and goes straight to it.

My phone is my only interaction with adults.

94,"Hello!

My 35 year old brother still lives at home. He’s had jobs and has at one time for about a year lived on his own. He moved back in when he was laid off from that job and hasn’t been out since. That was probably 10 years (give or take) ago. He didn’t complete high school but the last I heard he was trying to get his diploma. No other education. No long standing work experience. I’ve seen his resume, it was a mess. 

He’s in a pretty bad spot mentally. He’s a very angry individual and is extremely hostile to my mother, father, younger brother, and 90 year old grandmother who all reside in the home. He’s possessive of the house and extremely particular about he likes things. He’s verbally abusive to everyone in the house and throws extreme “tantrums” when he feels he is being disrespected or his “boundaries” are being crossed. I’m in town visiting with my 1 year old son and a situation occurred last night. He was so angry about dog bowls being on the counter because he’s grossed out by it (germaphobe). He completely freaked out and started screaming for hours and verbally abusing everyone. I insisted on calling the cops but my parents are afraid if that happens he “won’t go down without a fight”. I think they are afraid of him killing himself or worst. My parents are completely at a loss. They are retiring in a year and don’t know what to do. But they’ve also totally enabled his behavior his whole life, and also let him down by not doing something sooner, or guiding him. They’ve even offered to pay for counseling which he turns downs. He basically runs the house. They pay for his cigarettes, phone, and alcohol. I can’t seem to convince them to either kick him out or discontinue making this house an easy place for him to be by providing everything for him. 

This is completely ruining everyone’s life who lives in the house. Not to mention that I can never bring my child back to this house to visit his grandparents while he is in it. What the actual fuck do I do? Should I just remove myself and let go?

I really feel like he’s the type of dude who you hear about in the news... if you know what I mean.",02Sep2018,1

Hi all

I have noticed that my family use very confusing language to describe things sometimes.

For example, I went to my parents house yesterday and found a lamp on my desk, but the lamp didn't have a base.

My  mum said ""oh well it's pretty useless without a base"". For context I  was kicked out of home by my parents recently and so the implied meaning  is that I'm useless without her.

There  are times when things get so totally obscure in the conversation that I  cannot follow what is being said at all. The meaning of everyday things  is always brought down to these extremely subtle meanings behind the  more explicit facade, so as to have a kind of defence. When asked  explicitly about what my mum means, she will say something like ""it's  just a simple question"" and proceed to get absolutely furious with me if  I question whether or not there is more meaning to what she is saying  than just the explicit intention.

The  reason I know there is more meaning is because of the level of  aggression behind me questioning the true meaning of what she is saying.

I  have found that this kind of behaviour makes me extremely cautious and  calculating about the more subtle aspects to what people are saying and  whether or not they are trying to mess with me the same way my mum is.

She  also always tries to force hugs on me, asking me questions like ""can I  give you a hug?"" If I say no, then what I mean is ""no I don't accept the  passive aggressive subtext to what you are saying as being nice""

This  all results in me having the same issues with other people. A lot of  the time I interpret things that people say or do as being aggressive or  rude when they aren't intended as such, and so I respond by replicating  what my mum does and I end up being passive aggressive to other people  even when I don't intend to be. This confuses a lot of people and leads  them to think that I don't want to connect or am closed off.

Does anybody here have any experience with stuff like this? I think about the way that I come off to other people so much because I don't want to seem passive aggressive but it's a circle because I am always annoyed with people because I am always assuming that they have malicious intent in the subtleties to what they are saying just like my mum did, even when they don't intend it that way (obviously sometimes people do). Then what happens is when I am passive aggressive they end up being the same way or not including me in the group and then I start to think ""well I caught them, they are being rude!"" when initially they weren't being rude at all. This just makes me question everything that people say to me even more and seems to create this self fulfilling prophecy that people don't like me.

  
Any ideas?

98,"Hi all,

I’ve not slept more than 3 hours tonight due to me constantly going around in my thoughts on this:

My best friend of 10 years has crohn’s disease and is slowly deteriorating. I don’t like bringing up the subject with him, we talk about it but never in great depth.

He refuses medicinal advice from doctors such as taking steroids or surgery because he believes he can control it by having a good diet , which I have fully supported as it’s his decision at the end of the day.

I have not seen any improvement in the last 3 years, he doesn’t always stick to the diet he intends to have, but I don’t know if this is the thing that’s going to help him.

I have a hunch that he refuses medical treatment because from a young age his mother has been into holistic medicine and may have swayed his opinion - although this is speculation on my behalf.

His day to day varies, I’d say the majority of the time he’s not in a good way, he struggles to keep food in his stomach as it almost instantly passed through, he has inflammation throughout his body/muscles which prevents him from doing a lot of things without being in agony and I really do hate to see it.

I try to bring up the idea of following the doctors advice but he usually shoots it down quite fast and I feel like I’m stepping on his toes as it’s his business.

With all that said I really don’t want to watch my best friend get worse or die because I love him like family, I don’t think he would also appreciate me posting this on here as it’s personal but I really don’t know what to do.

Any advice?

Thanks ",02Sep2018,2

It'd be nice to just say 'it didn't work out', while still recognizing how much I had valued our relationship and that he was abusive, but I'm so caught-up over-thinking the relationship and being anxious about possibilities that it's trapping me.

Bear with me because this post may be long. Since I have known this person he has said he was going to be a doctor. In high school we all knew him as a future doctor and he was well on his way. He received excellent marks in classes and even got into a special pre-med program. He always parted and dated girls but managed to keep a 3.8ish GPA. He got into a reputable medical school and this is when things started to go south. Our beloved friend all of suddenly got more cocky and doubled down on his party lifestyle. At this point we all started to get a little pissed off at him but we would still hang out. After only one year he dropped out and tried teaching. At this point he was getting heavier into drinking and drugs and eventually gave that up too. Now today he has nothing. He totaled his car under circumstances that he refuses to share. He lives at home and while his parents have an extra car, they won't give it to him. I understand he shouldn't expect a free car but the problem is that his parents don't seem to be doing anything except turning a blind eye to the fact that their son is now pretty much a bonafide alcoholic and a bi-polar shitshow.

Everyone had to movie their tents under a huge tarp and that was supposed to protect us from the storm.

115,"I’m so angry at my parents.

I’m 27 and have no job and over $50,000 in school debt. I have several disorders that caused me to be very violent when I was a child, and it translates to me still yelling and saying things I don’t mean.

Growing up, my parents screamed at me and called me names (“I’m going to call you ‘It’ until you start behaving!”) because “nothing else would get you to shut up!” When I tell them that they hurt me, they say “that was a long time ago. Time to grow up.” 

Then when there’s a problem, they go right back to yelling in my face and say “This is why you had all those problems in elementary school! You haven’t changed!”

Dad keeps mocking me. I told him to stop. He got upset because he “wasn’t mocking, just imitating” because what I was doing was “SO STUPID!”

If I tell them that what they’re doing is mean, they say “YEAH!!!!! Because you’re -insert excuse-!!!” They admit that they’re screaming and being unreasonable, but somehow my behavior is so vastly worse in their eyes that it excuses theirs. They remind me that more than one therapist gave up on me before I reached the age of ten. They won’t take anyone’s advice because “Those therapists don’t know what it’s like to actually live with you and deal with the CONSTANT complaining!”

I asked mom to borrow $50 and she said that one of dad’s relatives died of a heart attack due to his daughter causing him stress. She then insisted I was going to do the same thing to dad.

“It’s not abuse, it’s the TRUTH.” That’s their catchall excuse for denying me emotional support and continuing to insult me.

I don’t know what to do because I’m too drained from dealing with their constant barrage of insults to bring myself to apply for jobs or do anything productive. I don’t have any friends due to my upbringing causing me to explode at people in the same way they do to me so I have no place to go. The car I use is leased in their name so I cannot live in it.

116,"Okay, so I've been studying medicine and taking science courses for five years now but I was never an ace when it came to math and science. I've always been more of an Arts, English, and History girl and I've been said to be pretty intuitive when it comes to those subjects. I only decided to major in Health Science majors because years ago when I was first starting out college and majoring in Political Science, something I actually liked and did well in, I was constantly pushed by my mom to major in health sciences instead and try to become a doctor. Since we could afford for me to continue at my first college, I ended up transferring to a community college. At the time, I had decided to take the required courses needed to major in a Health major. It was either Nursing or Respiratory Care, and I chose Respiratory Care. Managed to survive most of it but failed during my third semester, and I felt burnt out at the time. But I wanted to keep going so I would go into medicine and make my parents proud. I took a year off, and was advised by my mom to take online healthcare courses and get certificate, so I could get a job in healthcare. I tried to do that and managed to finish one course. But I didn't have much money to pay for the certificate and after the stress of the previous semester, and dealing with stuff at work, it took some serious motivation to try to get to the end. I still didn't complete the last few chapters, and my mother practically reminded me almost every day how I ""could have been far"" if I had finished it.This was well into the time I was going back to school, too. I wanted to complete things but I felt like I was at burnt out at the same time. I didn't want to be a complete waste of money and throw away everything I worked hard for, so I majored in Exercise Science at the four year college I was going to. I started off well, taking required courses before moving onto the heavy science courses. But as the year went by, certain courses got harder to balance, even with help from the tutors. By summer of 2017, my mom had finally turned a new leaf after realizing that I wasn't really happy with my major despite my pursuit in it and attempt to get a degree in it. She decided to advise me to change my major if I don't feel comfortable and do art and creative writing, what I was already good at and passionate about. As much as it seemed nice to hear those words, I didn't want to just throw all the years of studying health science away just like that when I was so knee-deep in the major and almost done with it. I also was a little annoyed with the fact that, for years, she had been pushing for me to study medicine and all of a sudden she was okay with me doing art and animation instead. I mean, where was that support when I was first considering going to an art school to study animation or when I was studying political science. She kept hammering the idea of me being a doctor and it felt like she wanted to steer me in that direction because she never got to be a doctor when she was in college studying medicine. So, it felt nice to hear something different, but I didn't want to just shift just because she wanted me to. I kept going, even when things got harder, and I ended up failing again and regretting not giving up sooner and changing my major like she stated the summer before. Now I have been academically suspended, but with some help from advisors I'm getting a chance to complete school, or take time off and take courses outside to transfer back to school. I've decided to do the latter but try to sign up for additional online courses in animation, so I could get a certificate in it.
My mother mentioned the idea and she seemed excited after sending me links to animation school sites and online course site from umass. She wanted me to follow my original dream and be happy. Since choosing to just take a year off and take the animation courses AND community health course online, I've been having doubts. Since telling my mother my choice, she's been more somber in her behavior, like she's mad that I didn't just fully leave and go to an art school. Even though I have a good job now to support myself through school, I'm wondering if I really want to return to school in the spring after years of taking loans, and physically to school. I already told the teacher that I plan to go back in the spring. Should I even go back or should I just thrown it all away, leave the school entirely and go to an online art school. I'm planning on becoming an animator anyway and going into the medical illustration/animation career given my love of art and animation and experience with health studies. But going back means making more payments that I'll have to do out of pocket now (We can't take any more loans because of already owing so much).

Anyone ever been through these problems in college and have some advice. I'm worried I'm going to make the wrong choice again and not graduate like I want.

It sounds really picky but I just want my hair to stop looking dumb after I run or sweet or just walking not even sweating. When I go upstairs my hair would just fly all over the place then it would look like a big mess where my hair at the top is going from left to right and to my eyebrows. ",02Sep2018,1
126,"Okay so I’ll just get right to it. I have absolutely no experience with insurance, and honestly when companies try to sell me insurance I really don’t know what they are talking about half the time. That being said, I need a career change in my life badly and I have been a CSR before and I like it a lot more then working in a grocery store, but it was just for a cellphone company not for an insurance agency. 

So first of all my question is, is this a good career choice for someone? Will I learn everything I need to know in the course provided by the state (for instance after I take the course and I going to know what exactly my car insurance is all about, or do I need to have a pretty good grasp of all of this before hand)? And how likely is it to pass the exam after the first time you go through the course (if you have no prior understanding of this stuff, or if you do have an prior understanding, please specify “none” “some” “a lot” of experience or understanding)? 

Sorry if this is complicated. Just trying to think it all the way through. 
Thank you for your help. ",02Sep2018,1
127,"I'm a sophomore this year. I have a nice friend group, get really good grades because I want to get a scholarship in the future as I am paying for uni. But I'm not happy?

Even though I have a lot of friends I feel left out from my school. Absolutely everyone and I mean positively everyone drinks, about half of that smokes weed and cigs. They constantly party. I get invited to a few but I never really have fun the times when I don't make up an excuse to not go, it's just not my type of scene, I guess I have different ideas of fun. 

I like baking and cooking, seeing what I can make. I like playing the piano, letting the notes linger in the air, being absolutely amazed by the minds that came up with the pieces. I like going out to eat with my friends, sitting by the lake with them, or just having a chill hangout. I like so much more but none of this matters in my school..If you don't like partying you're boring, end of story. 

I hate being labelled as just 'smart girl'. I'm not a nerd persay but just smart I guess nothing else. My friends see other sides of me as they're always with me, but I hate being labelled as this boring depthless character just because I'm not like them.

I'll never smoke or drink, I've seen what it does from looking at my family. But sometimes, I just want to say screw it and give up studying and all my passions due to this constant peer pressure.

130,"Hi everyone. I apologize in advance if this is long and boring. I’m kind of anxious to make this post, due to reasons you’ll understand in a moment. 

For some background, I come from a lower middle class/working class family. I’m the first child to get my undergrad. My college life was normal until last year. While I was still struggling with severe depression and anxiety, one of my professors suggested I apply for a study abroad program. I didn’t think something like that was possible for me, but she was adamant that it would be good for me to experience the world.

Well, she was right. I worked my ass off and saved up money, and was accepted into a program. I spent 5 months in Italy. It was the most amazing, life changing experience. This was the first time I’ve ever passed a semester with a perfect GPA. I came back a different person and so proud of the changes. 

Reverse culture shock and the depression following my return home hit me hard. I drank a lot this past spring, right after I came home. I did some researching and found out that post study abroad depression is very real. Even now, a full year later, I sometimes will just cry about how much I miss everything. I’m terrified of my memories eventually fading, I’m terrified of losing touch with the people I grew to care about, I’m terrified that I’ll never experience that kind of happiness ever again, or that my personal finances will never allow me to do something like this again. Waking up without feeling sad or numb was addictive, and I lost that excitement when I came home. 

I’ve been told to talk to people about it, share my memories, etc. My problem is that my friends tease me or cut me off if I ever try and talk about the semester. As a private person who naturally bottles things up, and I think it was startling for them to hear me want to talk about how I was feeling. Specifically, if something reminds me of an experience and I want to share it, I’ll get a sarcastic or dismissive remark. Things like “oh you studied abroad? I had no idea!” or “let me stop you there. ____ reminds you of ____ thing?” Overall, they just are not interested in hearing me vent or talk about things related to my trip. 

It really, really hurts. More than I am comfortable or even capable of saying. I know I don’t shove my feelings or the fact that I studied abroad down their throats. So I just don’t bring it up anymore because they were making me feel so self conscious. I feel silenced and alone, especially as this pst week was the anniversary of the start of the semester and I’ve been hit by a lot of emotions from that. 

I just don’t know what to do. I guess I’m looking for advice on how to touch this subject with my friends. I don’t want them to feel like I’m attacking them, or that I’m entitled. I just want to have some emotional support, I want to be able to share beautiful memories without someone rolling their eyes. I’m tired of being sad all the time. ",02Sep2018,2
131,"I grew up with depression, as far as i remember i had it since i was like 13 but i was diagnosticed with clinical depression just at 18. Now im a 20 year old male who failed to grow up like any other of his peers, failed to develop proper social skills, character and charisma. Lack of the life experience of someone from my age and don't know what to do. Is not just that im insecure, im pretty sure that if i somehow gain confidence i simply will not know what to do since i didn't learned how to socialize. Is so unnatural to me. I have few friends, not any to close, can't speak with girls since i was 13 so i have no female friends since then. I don't know how to aproach people or meet new friends even online. And i simply don't see myself being likeable to people. Sometimes i see myself from the outside and i see how boring and uninteresting i am. If i would to meet myself i wouldn't even like myself. I have nothing of interes nor nothing to give to others and is starting to eat my mind. Im starting my 20 and just realized that i need to gain all the experience i should had since my early teens, most of them pretty basic forms of human interaction but i don't know what to do and i am afraid to be already too late to get it. 

I just want to be someone normal, a fully developed, capable and likeable adult male. And i don't know what to do.

Btw in don't go to parties and just started drinking, smoking and did some drugs trying to be interesting and normal like everybody else. I know is stupid but is what society likes.

Im also impatient to get a job, go to school or do something but my family dosen't let me since im under psychiatric treatment and taking meds so they say im not ""ready"" to do so. This depress me a lot and makes me anxious since i should be doing something at my age or at least started and i feel like im wasting my time, precious life years that i will not get back. I feel like a joke of a man. 

What should i do?

133,"Hey all. Last Thursday I went in to an endodontist's office for a root canal. I don't have insurance so I had to pay out of pocket. The long and short of it is that I still can't open my mouth fully, the pain is much worse, and I think my wisdom tooth near the root canal has been shifted. They want me to go back for more treatments this Thursday.

My current thinking is that I should go to an oral surgeon and have the tooth extracted. This one has been so fucked by this root canal that I can't even consider keeping it anyway.

My question is this: should I go into the office on Thursday and ask for a refund, or file a complaint, or even see if the surgeon can bill the endodontist for treatment? I'm also getting a lot of shit from my dad because he helped pay for it, so I'd really like to get a refund, but I don't know what route to take.

He's not his usual self and a few days ago when he was hanging with our usual group, he basically just emanated anger and sadness.

He's usually really full of life and great to be around but his attitude has been very pessimistic (telling us he refuses to make any more friends for a while, being very vocal about his opinion even though its rude, etc.). Of course this attitude isn't healthy but he's not usually like this and we've already reached out to him and told him that if he needs anything, to talk to us. Long story short, he says he rather just keep it to himself and he doesn't want to talk about it.

What can we do from here? We'd love to help him but its also very hard because his attitude is very pessimistic and he's standoffish now.

135,"So I'm a 21 year old college student currently majoring in Bio. I'm sort of going through a crisis because I don't know if i should continue to attend , take a leave of absence, or dropout. I was a little late to decide on my major being that I didnt know what I wanted to do when I entered college. Even now,  I do not particularly want to pursue a career in the medical field, yet it seems like it's the only way I can appease my parents. I am very fortunate enough to have parents willing and able to pay for my education. Problem being, we've never been in the position to be awarded a Pell grant. And yet we aren't wealthy at the same time. My sister is also starting college in a few days. My parents had my sister and I later in life. Needless to say, I have a lot of anxiety with the ""what could happen"" them. My father is currently 65 and my mother is 54. My mother is the primary breadwinner of the family as my father is effectively retired and only earning money through the family school which is split among his 7 siblings. The money he earns isn't much; its approximately less than a thousand per month.  My worries is that if something happens, that leaves me to take care of my younger sister.  I feel as though I should be in a position to take care of my family sooner rather than later. I feel guilty that they're paying for my education and here I am complaining that I'm unhappy. I am from an Asian family and I do fell the pressure from my family to become something ""respectable"" professionally. I introduced them to the idea of me taking a break from school and working so that I could at least get a taste for ""shit jobs"" while saving what I can so that when next year arrives I could at least refocus onto finishing my degree with some money in the bank. Also , I wanted to avoid loans as much as possible so I have not taken any out. So if i do dropout, I dont have to pay anything off.

141,"Hey all,

So I am Male, and recently moved in to a large house with another roomate, who is female. Well, she is pretty cool, down to earth, and I thought we were becoming good friends. We cooked, ate, and just generally hung out together, which is very important to me, since my previous roommates pretended I didn't exist for a reason I still have not figured out.

Anyhow, yesterday I had a date and I spoke with my roomie about her. The date told me she was flying out in the morning, so I told my roomie I wasn't expecting much because of this reason. However, the date was funny and cool and after a couple drinks we decided to come back to my place.  The date told me she had lied about the time of her flight so she wouldn't create any expectations. I did not think much about it and had a fun night. It had been a while, so we went the extra mile, and then again in the morning. 

Well, when I come downstairs the next morning, my roomate won't even make eye contact with me. I ask if she's okay, and I get a, ""yeah, excuse me."" Well, that was super strange, since she's usually very bubbly, but I'm rushing off to work so I don't really have time to ask. 

When I get back I knock on her door and ask to have a talk.  She's like, ""sure"". Well it turns out the walls are much more thin than I expected and she was upset I did not let her know someone was coming over, after I told her she probably wasn't going to. 

I explained I was sorry she had to hear that and will try to be quieter from now on/text her when someone's coming over.  But we had a friend date tomorrow to go shopping and even though we are, ""okay"" it doesnt seem like that's happening anymore.

143,"TL;DR: I'm a college freshman stuck taking care of one of the most ungrateful witches on the planet, and all I have to show for it are the bruises and scratches she left me. I want to get out of this house ASAP, and need to know how to go about it, how much I'll need to do it, and what I'll need to do it.


Long Version:
I'm tired of my mother. I'd go as far as to say I don't love her. She ruined my life. Because of her, I don't know what it's like to be normal. I can't remember what it's like to not be depressed or what it's like to wake up or go to sleep not wanting to kill myself. I can't stand her. She's verbally abusive, physically abusive -she just punched me in the face because she's high off life, came stumbling into my room at 2:30 AM and can't stand on her own 2 feet so I tried to put her back in her room- and a narcissist with a victim complex. After she punched me I grabbed both her arms and she kept wriggling around so much that my nails dug into her, and she starts screaming about how I ""abused"" her. And she does this all the time, even when she's sober. I have scratches and bruises all over my arm because of her and her idiotic behavior, and she's looking me in the face and telling me I abused her.

In any case, I'm fucking tired of this. I don't care if she's my mom, I don't care if me not wanting to be around her to help her with her mental illness makes me morally bankrupt, I don't even care if she's mad about it for the rest of her life or dies still mad about it. She robbed me of a 1 life. All I've ever known all my life is taking care of her sorry ass. Ever since freshman year of high school, all I've ever been doing is cooking all her meals for her, making sure she doesn't overdose and die, cleaning up her urine and feces when she does take one too many of her illegally bought pills, and cleaning the entire house. Everyday I get bombarded with Snapchats from my friends about how fun their new college life is, how they're making new friends and getting to date new people while I'm stuck at community college (because it was most affordable), with stunted social skills because of how she raised me.

I just want to be away from her, staying with her has me constantly thinking that taking those pills she loves so much and downing them myself would be a good idea. The more this happens, the more enticing the idea sounds, even though I know better.",02Sep2018,17

148,"My husband got a DUI in his early 20s when we were still dating. He had five beers over the course of seven hours, got pulled over, and ended up blowing a 0.083, barely over the legal limit. He was convicted and it sucked. Lots of alcohol abuse classes which felt weird to him because he barely drank, ignition interlock, license suspension, and lots of legal fees. The whole thing was terrible and I never wish to repeat it.

Flash forward seven years. My husband does not seem to have a drinking problem. I grew up in a family of problem drinkers so I do feel I know what that looks like. He only drinks socially with friends maybe once a week, usually two beers at a time. I haven’t seen him drunk in at least a year. The two of us rarely drink together at home.

The problem - I feel that given his history of DUI he makes more risky decisions than he should when it comes to driving after a drink. I feel someone like him should not drive even if remotely “feeling it” because in our state you can get a DUI even if under the legal limit if the cop thinks you’re impaired. 

Sometimes at family dinners he will have two light beers and drives home after a few hours, which I don’t think is an issue especially because in that case I can’t even tell that he had a drink. Other times when with friends he will have two “tall boys,” usually a high alcohol content IPA beer, over two or three hours and then come home. He is never “drunk” but during these times I can often tell he is affected by the sound of his voice and even occasionally he parks his car a little further to the right than usual (sounds psycho but I notice these changes).

If he was a dude with no DUI history I don’t think anyone would bat an eye but given his history and especially considering our state’s razor sharp DUI laws I think he is taking risks and it frustrates me to no end. I have had multiple conversations with him about this. In the last year he has made more of an effort to take Uber or ask me for a ride home (which I offer any time) but he still is taking risks. Tonight at a game he had three 20 oz beers over four hours and then drove home. And I could tell he has been drinking. Not sloppy or drunk, just different. And I am feeling frustrated and scared that we could be faced with a second DUI.   

I have had multiple talks with my husband about this and have offered rides. It still keeps happening. What can I do from here!?",02Sep2018,2
149,"We’ve been friends for almost 10 years and she’s always been a bit childish and self-centered. It was something I could tolerate when we were younger and I myself had streaks of immaturity and self absorption. But we’re both in our mid-twenties now with full time jobs and long term relationships.

She came over from her new hometown to visit for the week and we got into a discussion about her boyfriend’s estranged child (he has 4, but one he doesn’t see or keep in touch with). She literally says to me ‘I kind of don’t want him to deal with it, the stress of it all would be so inconvenient’. 
In that moment I felt my respect for her drain, and I called her out (gently, mind you. She was staying over and I didn’t want massive tension in the house). The subject eventually changed (mostly because I think she sensed she had upset me) and we got on with our day but I couldn’t get the thought of it out of my head.

I don’t know why I’m still tolerating her selfishness. Like I said, she’s always been a bit like this and it was easier for me to deal with - even when directed at me (for example like constantly showing up late to things because she ‘knew I’d wait’) 
And it’s not as simple as just breaking the friendship, we’ve been close for a very very long time and the conflict and stress involved in ending the friendship would be a lot for me to handle (I suffer from anxiety pretty bad).

I don’t really know what to do? I don’t know if I want to be her friend anymore but also it’s not as simple as just breaking things off with her. My feelings are very weird and complicated on the matter.

159,"I'm pretty sure this is quite a common post and has been done quite a lot of times, but I still feel the need to post this myself for a more specific advice to my situation. Sorry if posting another request for one of these ""coming out"" advice annoys some people. 

So my mother is a religious christian but not THAT religious. She believes in God (of course), goes to church, attends some christian communities, and occasionally talks about the good God has done and, well you know, the usual stuff. Like i said however, she's not that religious. She sometimes skips church because she's lazy or sleepy that week. She doesn't always relate God to every thought provoking ""why"" questions like some religious people do.

I've been an atheist for quite a while now. Maybe about 2 or 3 years, i don't exactly know when i stopped believing, it just kinda happened. Of course, i haven't actually told my parents. So my mom still brings me to church every week or 2. At first I was okay with this. I mean it takes like a few hours a week, then i get to have lunch with my family, and even less than a few hours a week sometimes as my mom sometimes skips church, no biggy right? 

Well if this pattern continues then yes, no biggy. However, recently my mom is really pushing me to join christian youth communities and more church events. I was a bit hesitant at first but i decided to go along with it, at least until I move out and can financially support myself. Now she's pushing me even further and expecting me to attend one of these christian youth classes every week, on top of weekly churches, weekly gatherings, and other church events that would occasionally happen. 

The problem is I really can't keep up with this. I like to live my life following the motto ""It's not a waste of time if you enjoy it"" and clearly I don't enjoy any of these. I'm also going to start university next week and if I have to attend all these things while starting out university, I'll barely have any time left to rest and enjoy my hobbies. Not to mention I honestly can't stand the religious stuff they say all the time (no offense to any non atheists out there). It's kinda hard to act religious if I don't even know what they mean by ""follow the holy spirit"" or ""listen to God's words in your heart"".

The problem is I'm not sure how my mom would react if i tell her that I'm not a believer and that i don't want to attend any of these anymore. I heard her discussing about atheism with her friend and she said something about letting them do as they please. She said ""as long as we tried to get them to the right path, we did what God told us to do. If they still won't believe, then we can't do anything about it"", or something along those lines. Now at first it might seem like she won't mind too much if i tell her, but she was talking about a friend's friend. I'm not sure how different her view point would be if it's about her own son.

I don't plan to be open to the world about this as I live in Indonesia and Indonesia isn't exactly the most atheist friendly country out there. I don't even have the option to be an atheist or agnostic on my ID. My close friends know I'm an atheist and some of them are atheists/agnostics themselves, so it's not like I'm keeping all this bottled up, but I want to at least be honest with my parents about this.

I also considered telling my dad first and asking him for advice. I'm pretty sure he's not religious at all. He doesn't even go to church and I never really heard him talk about anything close to religion since I was a little kid. Since my mom seems fine with her husband not going to church at all, it may seem like she'd be fine with her kid being a non-believer. However, my parents aren't really a close couple. They don't constantly argue, but they rarely talk at home if not for occasional family dinners.

I know this has been quite a long rant and I thank anyone who actually read through the whole thing. Sorry if I used up a lot of your time, I just needed to really get this out of my system. So any advice on what I should do?",02Sep2018,1

164,"Recently, my former high-school classmates have gathered during the summer. I have been with them for all of high school who took all the highest level courses, although I was never an A student but seemed to persist in those classes without studying at all. Regardless, we got along really well and were great friends. All 11 of them graduated and went on to Ivy leagues or went into similar top-tier colleges. Due to some circumstances, I failed spectacularly in my senior year and 2 years after that, and I was finally attending my local college which apparently has a terrible ranking of 2900.

Naturally, they invited me to their celebration. (They didn't know about my situation) When we gathered, everyone started taking turns about talking about their university with laughs and smiles. When I was asked last, I said my words and their joyousness dwindled and I could see their expressions dropping, like how someone would look at a filthy homeless person who barged into a party. For the rest of the reunion, I received little attention. I was deeply hurt and depressed by this event, especially by a girl I loved, and still love, who reacted the same.

This was the only group of people I had a sense of belonging with. I have tried to get along with other people in my school but I would just not get interested, and they wouldn't accept me either way. I feel so lonely and worried about my future romantic life. ",02Sep2018,9
165," Hi,  


My name is Sunny. I live in Germany. Somehow, I fell in Love with a girl who lives in Malaysia over the Internet. We never met. But we video chat day night to know each other and interested to have a future together .  


She is outgoing in nature, loves drinking in Bar, movies and all. I dont have any issue with it. Sometimes i go out too. She told me she had lots of boyfriend before but now she wants a stable relationship, which i can feel.  


But the thing is her activities are more than i can accept from lover. She is young , and doesnt understand the relationship limits and expectations.  


for example:  
1)She like to go out for drinks in midnight with a boy(friend) alone and come back like 2,3,4 am in morning . one vs one, not group.  


2) she likes to go for movies again alone with a boy(friend) and then in night go out or late night dinner and then drinks.  


3) she text or chat with men(friends), and when i ask who it is, just normal friend and says, she chat because he deosnt have friends .  


3) its okay for her to stay at a male friend overnight(which i have no idea who is)  


And i cant accept all these. I have no problem with a girl having male friends. i have many female friends too. But . Am i wrong ?  


I told her not to do all these stuff, she got pissed and thought i am stopping her freedom. and then she lied to me and said going to grandma and did the same, went out with friend and drinks and came back midnight.  
we faught (i caught her lie)and made things clear.  


Again yesterday, she said, she is going for long drive, and dont go or drinks, coz she doesnt have money and will chill on beach and come back late. later she changed the statement that she will borrow money and go for drinks and come late. I told her no matter how late, just call me when she get back home.  


when its 2AM she texted me, that she is very tired and want to sleep, so when she goes home she cant talk.dont know what her motive was (normally she talk evernight be it 11 pm or 4 am).  


i said no, just call me for a while. then she agrees.  


then again at 3AM she texted me , the guy who she is with is about to faint because he didnt ate anything since morning and she cant leave him alone, so will see what happens. I asked her to get him cab and u come back home. she said no cant. and i asked her so whats her plan. she said dont know, and dont know when she will comes back. According to me she wanted to stay over.  


then later i found out, she is at his place, and i asked her to tell me who she is with ? she said, she cant tell because his friend doesnt want me to know his name. Privacy issues. Really ?????  


and i said ok.  i cant take it anymore. and then she came back after an hour back home and we talked.  


I have been in many relationships but this is weird situation.  


Am i wrong ?  
Does she really love me ?

what should i do ?

174,"I'm a small woman, (5'3 115 pounds) I've always been pretty petite. Since living with my boyfriend who is a pretty big guy, he's fat but not obese. I've experienced some very uncomfortable situations with his family. Every time we go out to eat with his family they always say something about how I eat so little, or make me feel guilty for not finishing my food. They think I have something wrong with me, I've been like this my whole life. My mom always cooked at home for me, I come from a pretty traditional asian family so we very rarely ever ate out at fast food restaurants. My boyfriend once told me his grandpa called me a stick but he never wanted to tell me because it would hurt my feelings. I don't care much about what they think of me, but I care about my boyfriend and his family. How could I change my boyfriend's habit that he grew up with since his whole family is obese? We go to the gym and all but he's so lazy to go I have to beg him. He's not weak or anything though, he can run and do just about anything but he just has a fat torso and a chubby face. How can I convince my boyfriend to see his unhealthy lifestyle and that if his family really cared for him why did they let it get like this? I love him, I love all of him and I never want to lose him, I want both of us to live a long happy life. I can't help but be upset that his family especially the elders would let all their kids become obese. My boyfriend has a little brother who is 12 and he is very obese..he can sleep on his neck and chest. My boyfriend told me awhile ago that they diagnosed his little brother with fatty liver disease, yet they're still feeding him unhealthy foods. My boyfriend's aunt has a baby who is 1 year old and she feeds her McDonalds and fast foods. It seems as if they don't care anymore and accepted their fate. Are they not afraid of death for their loved ones or themselves? How could a mother live her whole life knowing what it's like to be obese and do the exact same to her children? It's sad and frightening that no one seems to care as much as I do. I don't think my help would do anything at this point. Sometimes I want to say something but I feel like it's not my place to, and I have no right to or they'll just see me as a fat shaming narcissist who is being disrespectful.

175,"I would really appreciate some input. I’m a fairly mentally unwell young human and I’m concerned my therapist’s practice is taking advantage of me.

I’ve been going to a cognitive behavioral therapist weekly for over 4 months now. I do love my therapist and I’ve found the experience really rewarding. But there have definitely been some hiccups.

Firstly, I am fully insured in mental health, but have been paying out of pocket ($160) weekly for these 4 months. (This is rough as I’m a student and service industry worker.) At first it was my understanding I had to reach a deductible of $500 and then my visits would be $50 each (as told by my insurance). 

At this point I’ve paid upwards of $2500 liquid cash to this place in 4 months. This is because of a whole slew of reasons, or so I’ve been told. In the beginning the receptionist would say she couldn’t get ahold of my insurance over the phone (I should note, it is an out of state insurance, but a big name, blue cross). This went on for weeks, each week she would say it would be resolved by the next week, and so on. When I would inquire about it with each visit, she would seem surprised, as if each time were the first I’d brought it up. At this point I just assumed she was bad at her job.

Finally, I bring it up to my therapist. He tells me the reason my insurance hasn’t applied yet is because he’s failed to “log our time” or records or something like that to send to the insurance company. I find this a little shocking since I’ve been there for FOUR MONTHS, but he makes a point of reassuring me, stating whatever extra money I’ve spent will be reimbursed when it’s all figured out.

One other small detail that just kind of puts me off. Things have been going really well, my therapist is often commenting lately on how much I’ve improved. We found a suitable medication for me and I’ve been steadily on it and frankly we don’t have anything left to talk about it seems. I voiced that I felt we could lower our meetings to every two weeks or even once a month, but I felt swayed to come back. And then! The last 2 sessions were literally the SAME session and I don’t think he even noticed.  He even spent the last 15 minutes of our last meeting showing me YouTube videos (admittedly psych related, but not at all related to me.)

I know this is incredibly long but I just don’t know who to ask. Normally I’d ask my therapist about anything but I’m really starting to feel doubts about their character and the character of their practice.

189,"I have been practicing driving with my dad every weekend for three weeks for about an hour. My dad lost his patience the last time we went out to practice. I made a huge mistake. I accidentally ran a stop sign while a truck was turning. I noticed the truck was beginning to turn. My dad told me to start moving over so I won't hit the truck. I was so worried about not hitting the truck that I didn't even notice that I ran a stop sign and that I didn't slow down enough to the point where I could've hit the truck.

My dad became furious. I do understand this was a huge mistake. He then asked me ""You have to make a decision, do you want to drive or use public transportation? because I am getting ready to give up."" He then proceeded to tell me that, ""We have been practicing every weekend for three weeks and I feel like you're not making any progress. I have not spent this much time with your brother or sister. It's going to take you a LONGGGGGG time to learn how to drive.""

THOSE COMMENTS DESTROYED MY CONFIDENCE.

I did have some days where I did excellent and he told me that I'm getting better, but now he's telling me I'm getting worse. I just feel like my dad expects me to be a pro driver after only like 7 hours of practice.

I feel like he is rushing me to learn how to drive. I believe he needs to be a little more patient for someone who takes a little longer to learn. I am a beginner driver and I am going to make mistakes.

My Dad is not the best teacher. He has a short fuse and he doesn't have a lot of patience. He's not only critical with teaching me how to drive, but with EVERYTHING he tries to teach me.
And also I still feel like I'm not quite ready yet to start driving. I still don't have my permit. I barely read the book, so I'm not familiar with all the rules. I've never had driving lessons.

Called me a slut and gross. I would hookup with him sometime after that because I felt worthless. He loved nude photos of me he asked sometimes to take photos of me naked and that I was cute


He moved around for work I sexted him regularly. He cheated on almost every girlfriends with me. Said he never date me he feels no emotional connection he only wants sex and nothing more. I traveled to another country and my phone breaks he sends me over 50 messages and posts passive aggressive statuses on social media during that seven weeks.


I stopped seeing him after two years. I haven’t seen him in three years known him 5 total.He took photos one time when we were hooking up with out my permission. He sends me these photos saying “look what I found “ and “don’t you miss this”. Last year he had a girlfriend and I said I don’t feel comfortable sending him nudes with a girlfriend. He blows up my phone asking if I’m okay and why I’m ignoring him. Then asking if he was single would we be cool again. Then texting me two weeks later he was single and he actually was.


He then a couple weeks later gets a new girlfriend and I thought he’d go away because he posted how gorgeous she was on social Media. Then about a month after that he’s texting me asking why I unadded him on a certain social media.

At this point I asked her why didn't you include me, which she told me: Well, you don't have instagram anyway, why would I include you? My mood went from 100 to 0 from that moment. It felt like I wasn't part of being there with her and her sister.  


After the movie ends we walk around the city and she starts teasing me a lot. She randomly touches me, slaps me on my face (not that it did any pain) she starts making jokes out of me, such as: You should go for a run, you obviously need it.  


So I have to leave and we hug. Her and her sister told me it was a fun evening. She told me to text her when I get home because it was around 3 am at that time.  


I text her that I'm safe home. Since then she left me unread for about 1,5 days, obviously she is online since she keeps sending me snaps how much fun she's having with her sister and her friends. Not that I could care much about it.

Science the age of around 9 he has weighed between 175-200. Still growing.
And my dad was there like *snap* 

And soon he is yelling about not hurting him. Take, for example, him sneaking up behind me and strangling me. I push him into a wall. Naturally, he yells at the top of his lungs and pretends to. My dads yelling at me. I explain that he was chocking me and it was self defence. Despite knowing he chocked me, he is grounded for 1
Not a typo

1

Day

Me?
3 days. 
2 years later. I'm 13. He's 10
His tomfuckery has gotten worse. Not just at me. But his 'friends', his classmates, and our now 5 year old brother.
He still assaults me regularly. It happens so regularly that it only now occurred to me that he should have gone to juvenile court. Or, something. He also ""accidentally"" hurts our younger brother, and until recently, he stole from me. Of course he now steals from our younger brother.

I know what goes around is supposed to come around, but he whined at the karma until it ran away. 

I need to teach him a lesson. But my parents are very strict. I will be SEVERELY punished I I get even accused of stuff I didn't do (that also happens regularly)

So I need to teach him a lesson of karma. Not revenge. But karma. 

If it helps: He loves his devices
I can sabotage some stuff
I've cut few wires
I have enough space in my room to hide some small things
I can poison stuff (that's more of a last resort kind of thing)

Remember: my dad has a really good memory.
My dad doesn't believe a word I say half the time.
My stepmom just hates me (maybe pent up anger towards someone but she just resents me) kinda like that one teacher that you treated nice and acted nice around but still hated you even if you got good grades

Let's get creative

Sorry for the really long post

Just needed some advice

210,"My sister just got out of college and had an interview last week, with 3 more scheduled for this week. However, the 2nd job accepted her on the spot. She went to an orientation, etc. I was happy for her, a lot surprised they accepted her on the spot, but attributed that to her skills and grades and experience.

&amp;#x200B;

She was describing the job to me today after I asked her if she was going to the other interviews (she couldn't now) and now I think she should quit the job and go to the other interviews .

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, the first 2-6 weeks is M-F 10 AM to 9 PM with 5-6 hours being door to door trying to get people to sign up for things. Then you get promoted. Whatever that means. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should she quit? If so, how? Face to face? Email? Avoid burning bridges?  Are there bridges to burn? Her first day is in two days. I told her to say she got an offer from somewhere else, my girlfriend says to keep it shorter than that. Be cordial and concise.

Thank you.",02Sep2018,1
211,"My fiance and I have been together for ten years. Seven of these years we've had a dachshund. It turns out that I am allergic to him (which we never would have guessed because I've had plenty of dogs I was previously never allergic to) and he makes my nose stuff up and skin itch. If I take a prescription allergy pill, it alleviates the itch but nose will still clog in certain situations. For example, he sleeps in the bed and when my head touches that pillow, I immediately clog up.

It's important to note that my fiance insists the dog sleeps in the bed.

Since my allergy to this dog has arisen, I have obviously begun to snore because of my clogged sinuses. Within the past year or two, my fiance has seemed to (out of nowhere) develope a complete inability to handle ANY sort of sound when he's trying to sleep (except he insists that the tv is on). So he's taken to getting up frequently, making loud sighs of irritation, telling me to roll off of my back (even though I breathe best that way), and even yanking my pillow under my head to get me to stop making sounds. I know I snore, but he's said himself that it's not that loud. He will insist I'm snoring even when I am wide awake and all I hear is my struggled breathing. He insists I'm ""really asleep but don't know it,"" even though I have been having conscious thoughts the entire time.

It's affecting both of our sleep. He insists that he has misophonia, but he has not talked to his doctor about it. I cannot do anything to fix my allergy issue except getting rid of the allergen, which is not an option for us and since he won't make the dog sleep on the floor, it seems my issue is here to stay for the foreseeable future.

We just got into an argument this morning, because I slept terribly last night due to the fuss he made about my breathing while attempting to fall asleep. Last night he yanked my pillow again and I finally just screamed, ""STOP YANKING MY PILLOW!"" In the events that he sleeps like a damn freight train, I never yank his pillow! Most of the time I try to sleep through it because I know how it feels to be woken up, but on the rare occasion I do need him to move, I gently tap his arm. I don't yank his damn pillow.

I told him I can't keep doing this and that something needs to be done. He started blaming me, telling me that I refuse to get a c-pap machine (who the fuck wants to sleep with that loud thing on?! he'd probably get pissed over the sound that thing makes too) or talk to the doctor about some kind of septum surgery (which I am certain I don't fucking need because I AM ALLERGIC TO THE DOG). He refuses to wear ear plugs because he says he can't hear his alarm. He refuses to talk to his doctor (even though he thinks he has misophonia) because he thinks it won't help anything. 

He insists that I am the sole problem of this situation and this morning I just broke down crying. I can't take this anymore. I know what I need to do in order to breathe better and he won't let me do it.

I don't know what to do about this anymore but I am at my breaking point. Please give advise. ",02Sep2018,2
212,"Hello all, im in a bit of trouble over here deciding what should i do with my current job that im really greatful(inspite of everything that i dont like about it at all) for having. I’ve been working in this particular company for more than 15months now, earned quite alot of good reputation among my colleagues mostly(i think) because of projects that i helped finish efficiently and my personal terms with every one in the office. Now, the problem is that im most probably going abroad for a job that i’ve already accepted. 

There is a bit of a delay in the visa and i’ve informed about it to my immediate(unfortunately i have three bosses, Manager and GM) boss too. Hes fine with me leaving the company for good but hes not happy with me not showing up to the office regularly(i keep skipping office for no reason except that i dont really want to go there anymore) before actually putting the resignation. I mean i JUST DONT want to go there anymore but im scared a little about IF God forbids, i
Dont get visa and loose my job here too. Im unable to crack this tough nut!! 

Another problem with me is that if i skip the office i have a shitty day .. ideally i wanted to put the resignation on the day i get my visa stamped on my passport. I know im a mess .
Please help me make a decision guys :( 

P.s: My dad’ like if you dont feel like going to the office anymore then dont! He said, the process for going abroad is almost through and everything will be fine you can put the resignation .. he knows everything through me i share everything with him. ",02Sep2018,1
213,"So I went on a date with this girl I've been talking to through snapchat. We had never met before so I speculated it to be very awkward at first. So we decided to see a movie and she picked me up. The date went well, I bought her ticket and it was not awkward at all throughout. I did not end up making any moves on her either partially because I am a pussy and partially because I didn't really see an opportunity. I am also very inexperienced with dating so I could just be oblivious to things. Anyways, I thought it went very well and we agreed to go on another one, but that's when it got weird. The very next day after our date, I replied to her morning streak snapchat (yes I do streaks, I am in highschool and it is not weird for people my age) and she opened it and did not reply. Before you all say, ""so what, you didn't even say anything"", that was literally the first snap I sent her all day and we usually start snapping with just faces. So I was a little confused as to why she decided not to snap me the entire day following our date, and now this is the fifth day in a row that she has opened my snaps without replying either to my first snap, or very early on afterwards. I'm very busy with work so I don't snap her much in the morning, but when I do she still doesn't reply. Anyways I don't know what to do. Should I ask her why she's suddenly stopped talking to me?

My mum while living with us was mostly in a bad mood and only kept thinking about her mum but as soon as she went overseas her mood improved and this annoyed my dad as it seems two faced.

While we were barely scraping by every week after my mum went overseas we need to send additional money to her and that's hit us even harder. My dad is constantly stressed cause all his earnings are being sent overseas and we can't save up anything and he isn't fond of his in law due to problems in the past. Now he keeps mentioning about letting my mum go cause she's becoming a burden.

He usually closes for his job, and recently his brother and a couple of friends join the same company he works for. Lately instead of coming straight home he stays with his friends and brother at his brother house, they usually smoke and drink, which I don’t mind that he does.
However lately it seems like he is doing it every night, I’m pregnant and I stay home watching his kids( two of his sons are from another women who he shares joint custody for. We also have a son together.) I love his kids with all my heart they are incredible awesome and I love the time I spend with them. 


I told him I wanted him to come home instead of going out with his friends and he told me that I was controlling him up much that he stresses out about a new baby coming and he thinks he deserves the free time.....his brother also messaged me last night telling me I was a bitch for keeping his brother away from him and how is it fair that I get to see my sister all the time(My sister lives with us) that I should get that stick out of my ass and let my husband chill....which I don’t appreciate.....

I expressed to my husband that he has responsibilities at home and that he needs to come home to us and I don’t mind that he goes out once in awhile but it can’t be an every day thing....but he insists that he deserves the 3 hours of free time after work.....his children’s mother even told me that it’s not my job to watch his kids it’s his job and if I continue to watch his kids without him there she was going to take us to court and I explained that to him but he said he since we are married it basically my job to take care of all the kids......

I was mad so I didn’t say much when she told me, I took the next day to gather my feelings and thoughts and forgive her for the issue, now she is barely talking to me and says she hasn’t forgiven herself.

219,"Hi, thank you for reading this. I just lost my phone, and while it is pattern-locked, I have an unencrypted external SD card that contains my nudes in it. Some of the nudes have my face on it, I know it was stupid and careless of me.

If the person who found it will decide to leak those nudes, I'm very worried about the consequences.

- I am a woman, just right out of university, working a job at a global corporate.

- All my life, I have been an academic achiever, and affiliated with a scholarship organization.

- I live in a third world, Asian country with a huge Catholic/Christian and Muslim population. It is very conservative (sex education is non-existent) and very sexist as well.

- My neighbors and relatives are very much into social media, and are very quick to judge and gossip. Meanwhile,my mother is very conscious of her reputation in the community, and she has always been proud of me and herself for raising me up.

As you can see, this is a recipe for a disaster if my nudes are leaked and linked to me.

- My company will probably fire me. I recently became the breadwinner of my family, and I don't know how else to work (I don't have PC for online job)

- I might get blacklisted for the future job prospects... Maybe recruiters will recognize my name...

- My relatives and neighbors will perpetually gossip and talk about how my mom's educated daughter turned out to be a whore or slutty. This will ruin my mom's image and her self-esteem. My family might very much partly disown me as well (I will and need to have to provide them money).

I am currently suffering a great deal of Anxiety right now. I apologize for sounding dramatic.

I would like to ask for suggestions on what my first actions should be, if the worst case scenario comes and my nudes gets leaked and linked to me.

TL:DR; I lost my phone and the unencrypted external SD card has my identifiable nudes in it. My company might fire me, my name might get blacklisted, my family might disown me and I might be the butt of the joke and gossip and judgement for the years to come.

a dealership over a year ago, and was asking for his half. Backstory- he was in the process of getting a new car at the same dealership about a year ago and decided to use me as a referral. The dealership was supposed to send me a $100 check for the referral. He told me to split it for him, and me being my passive self, I agreed. 

We had a falling out before the was ever mailed. I can’t even remember if I cashed it or not, but it was in my name.

225,"Hello All! So I am going into my third year of University, and I am going into my second year of living with my two housemates. We used to all be the best of friends and really close. However, this past year has really changed my perspective of them for me. Firstly, they are in really difficult programs and have not yet learned how to manage with stress. Their behavior is often erratic, they are constantly stressed and moody. I try my absolute best to always be there to help them with what ever I can and be as understanding as possible. The first problem really occurs when they refuse to take any kind of break to spend quality time with me. No matter how many weeks notice they refuse to make time to do anything else than studying. I am constantly hurt by the minimal effort they put into trying to maintain a friendship with me.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest problem really occurs here. They have befriended a group of guys who attend another school and they worship the ground the boys walk. At first I tried to be friendly to them, but they don't give me the time of day. Through the course of the year these guys have constantly spread lies, rumors and been out right rude to my friends. An example of their disrespect is one of my housemates has lime disease, and they even went to far as to say to her face she is making up her illness. She has been battling lime for years and was devastated, and none of the guys stood up for her in any way. This is one of many examples I could share. They straight out abuse their friendship with my housemates. The sad part is my housemates almost recognize this and forgive them constantly? Being frank, I hate to fact these guys can come in and abuse a friendship with my housemates, I am disappointing in them but I still feel the need to protect them for these people. I really hate them for this. I am always heartbroken when my housemates make so much time for them and barely talk to me anymore, unless its easy for them. All of this on top of regular housemates fights like cleaning etc. They know I dislike the guys they hang out with, and when they come over I use every excuse to leave my own apartment until they are gone. I wish I could tell them to stop being friends with them but I would never put them in that position. Anyway the truth of the fact is we used to have a really great friendship, and I have to live with them this year. I am truly heartbroken everyday living their is a struggle for me, but I want to at least try and give them another chance. One on one they are still very lovely, academic women who I used to be very close with.

I know I should quit it altogether, but it’s all I know and I am absolutely hooked on it for attention and validation. I’m an extrovert living in a country where talking to strangers is considered weird and rude, and my friends can’t be around constantly 24/7.

So I talk to people online a lot. It's good to always have someone accessible to talk to when it's 3 AM and you can't sleep. But I still end up spending time online in warped and unhealthy environments and taking in and internalising a lot of negative shit, and seeing the kind of stupidity and malice that people can have.

I don’t own a television or a radio, nor do I get any newspapers, so I’m also dependent on the internet for most of my news.

On atop of that I’m gay, and there is no ”gay community” irl in my town (the local youth organisation has a cafe for minors but as a grown man I don’t have interest in 14-year-olds), so if I want any shot at a relationship, online communities are the best shot that I have.

Today the subject of hair came up and I asked her why she cared so much about what my hair should look, and she ended up talking about how she'd rather let me smoke and get lung cancer than let me cut my hair. She even ended up comparing hair cutting to self-harm.

I don't know what I should do. I really want to express myself with getting a pixie cut, but my mom would never let that happen.

235,"I recently met up with a friend who is notoriously difficult to make plans with but me (M17), her (F17), her Friend (F16) and My other Friend (M16), where all able to organise a day at my place bc I had an empty. When she came up she explained that she logged out of her SC so her boyfriend would see her location bc he disapproves of her going to guys houses (even-though he both knows me and my other friend are gay), we all though that was pretty shitty but we just ignored it. Later on that night she got a text from him about how she has an EX from 5 years ago on her SC, meaning he logged into her SC and read through all her messages. She hadn't been talking to this guy and he started a whole argument with her about it. (For a bit of context, he cheated on her a year ago, then they went on a break but got back together. He is still in good contact with the girl he cheated with). After that it all came out about how it was a common thing for him to go on to her sc, read her messages and send abuse/delete guys that she was friends with. We advised her to break it off and that it's doing her a lot more harm than good, but she dosent want to. I'm afraid this could lead to more controlling behaviour and abuse from her BF.

236,"So I recently (two weeks) moved in with two roommates. One of them (M, 20) is a friend of mine I share several classes with, who I’ll call K. The other is an exchange student who is here for one semester (F, 25), who I’ll call N.

K has a girlfriend, they’ve been dating since high school. He seemed really committed to her, even having her in his phone as “My future wife”. She lives across the state, and K spends most of his breaks at her place. She expressed concern about him moving in with a female, but he assured her that he’s faithful and has nothing to worry about.

Recently I’ve noticed K spends a lot of time talking to N in her room. No big deal, he does talk a lot. We came home from a party the other night and we watched a show in the living room. K and N were on the couch, and I saw K stroking N’s hair. This shocked me quite a bit, since it was more evidence supporting something I thought was a paranoid suspicion. 

Well last night (actually this morning, around 5 am) I hear N come back from a party. K is asleep on the couch and I’m in my room on my computer. N sounded a bit drunk, which is likely as she tends to drink quite a bit when she goes out. I heard them talking for a while, then she went in her room. I went out to fill my water and K was still on the couch with his eyes closed. When I returned to my room, I shut my computer off and went to bed. At this time, K and N started watching a show in the living room. I heard N laugh a few times, but it was not the kind of laugh one would make at a show, more like a flirty laugh. My room opens into the living room as I can hear pretty much everything going on.

I hear more laughing, then what sounded like moaning (very faint). I quietly went up to my door and listened. Sure enough, I heard N saying stuff like, “Oh, that feels good” and “K, No! No!” (Not in a panicked way, more of a playful way. Still, no is a no). More noises followed which confirmed my suspicion that my friend and roommate was cheating on his gf with N.

I didn’t say anything, I just went to sleep. I don’t know what to do. I can still be friends with K even though he cheated on his gf, that isn’t my problem. What is my problem is them loudly having sex in the living room, and N possibly having been drunk at the time. 

What should I do? I’m thinking about bringing it up privately with N first. If she felt she was taken advantage of by K, then it’ll help if only she knows that I know. OTOH, if it was consensual, then I’d like to privately bring it up with K first, and tell him what I think about cheating.

What do you guys suggest? This has the potential to make things awkward for the rest of the semester, so I want to minimize the chance of that happening. Should I even say anything?",02Sep2018,1
237,So 3 months back I was rear ended at a stop sign. I had the claim all set up and I was just about to take it in to get fixed. Then someone hit my car in a parking lot in about the same place but now broke the tail light and damaged the quarter panel. I've got their insurance info. But they are begging me to let them pay in cash. Either way I guess I need to take it in to get another estimate. Can I just rely on the old damage being fixed by the old claim and have the remained fixed by the other driver/insurance? Also I'm really doubting letting him pay in cash because I want to make sure I get a rental car and hopefully get paid for the depreciation. What do you guys suggest?,02Sep2018,3

In the Summer of 2016 my mom told me and my brother we were going on a vacation to another country (Won’t disclose places or names for privacy).I was also sick of the small apartment we lived in and begged my mom to move to a house or townhome but in the same country.She said the townhome we “signed up” for was going to be available in two months. Stupid me thought wow what a coincidence I’ll believe that.She also said it was going to be a 2 Month vacation Aug-Oct, so we happily agreed and so we went...
We arrived and stayed in our aunts house.And so The 2 months were coming to an end and I was getting ready to pack my bags. My aunt saw me packing up and said “to where?” And I said we”re going back to the original country we came from.And she literally didn’t say anything. The next morning my mom and aunt come into the room i was staying at and said “The landowner said there’s no spaces available “. And we have to wait till January of 2017. I believed it AGAIN and agreed. So that meant I had to go to a school and guess what? I did. She promised me when I pass in the country we’re still in that we would go back. Guess what? I passed!. So the promise is suppose to be kept right? But no.. When we got the results for the exams. She said that other country is too stressful and is not good for me.She said that either I get a job and pay for my own flight. Or I stay here go to a religious school for another TWO years!

Normal is 150-450 and I've been drawn the past month where I am consistently 120-130. I was referred to the med hold doc who said I have a disqualifying criteria for not only my AFSC but for the Air Force in general.

However the disqualifying criteria is chronic low blood platelets. He can't say if just 1 month is enough to say its chronic. I was drawn again on Thursday and I'm supposed to see him again next week. However the wait is killing me. I have no idea what will happen.

Does anyone have any input on this? I've only been in about 4 months and someone said the fact that they found something disqualifying so early in my enlistment makes it more likely I'll be disqualified. Is this accurate? I just need someone to talk to.

247,"Ok my name's Alex and I am a senior in high school. It is time to choose what college I want to go to but there is a big problem im facing. My father and mother have never gotten along my whole life, I have seen them scream at the top of their lungs to each other and say terrible things about each other, about 6 years ago my father decided to leave the house and get a job out of state, now for 6 years in a row he would visit me and my 2 younger brothers for about 1 month and 1/2 each year through out the year. Now all this time I have felt lonely and depressed but im feeling a lot better this senior year now. Ok, so for the past year my mother and father have been trying to work it out having cook outs with me and the kids and all sorts of stuff but a bombshell dropped and everything stopped. Turns out that 2 years ago when my mom and dad were on a ""break"" my dad had a kid with another woman. Now getting to this college thing, for the past 6 years I have become the father figure of my 11 and 9 year old brothers, I am the one that gets after them, teaches them 'life lessons' (or advice), picks them up from school, takes them to their sport games, helps them with their hw, all sorts of 'dad' stuff. Now, keep in mind that my father was still working out of state when him and my mom were trying it out again the same day I was going to tell my father that he needed to stay here at the house and take care of my brothers since I was going away to college the bombshell dropped. Now I ended up not telling him that because things with him and my mom are over and there is no way he can take care of my brothers now. The dilemma I have is that I am a top 5% student who can enter any public university in Texas and I have always dreamt of going to UTSA (just a cool University 5 hours from home)  but remember how I said that through out the years my dad was gone I felt lonely and depressed, well I don't want to do the same thing to my younger brothers. I do not want to leave them by themselves without their role model and their big brother who can help them with anything. I know my mom doesn't like taking them to their sport activities and their extracurricular activities so it breaks my heart to think of them missing out from all this if I go. Ok so the final question I have for yall is should I man up and stay for my brothers and go to a local university, or should I follow my dreams and go to my dream university?

249,"Predators prey on the weak. The strong prevails. Evil triumphs over good. Life is not a movie where good out maneuvers the wicked. 
For 4 years I was in a toxic relationship. I was not perfect, I did and say things I am not proud of. Because I loved a person fearlessly and I was loved carelessly. 
I manipulated my parents in helping me move back to Philly where they handed me a thousand dollars to move in a small one bedroom apartment infested with roaches and mice. So the man I loved at the time to have a place to live. Unbekowst to me he had been manipulating another woman who he was also dating to get an apartment. 
For 5 months he carried on 3 additional relationships and lived between my home and the other female whom lived about 4 train stops away. 
I would take him back countless times, I broke a glass door because he invited his baby mother into my home while I was at work. I caught him with another in my bed with lights turned off watching a movie. After coming back from work early. He was unemployed several times during our relationship. And I supported him throughout. He lessened me by calling me everything under the sun,  to a child he lied on my name to other women. I have been stalked and harassed by women he got involved with. 
He and his baby mother involved themselves with a 17 year old girl whom was my friends little sister. And when I confronted him about the relation he stated it was because I talked about him to my friend. 
We moved into an apartment where he continued the abuse. Putting holes in the walls, one day he threw wet laundry on me for not  wanting to drive him to work. And I kicked myself in a room where he punched his way through a door. And I called his baby mother at the time to help me and she laughed and said to call his other girlfriends. 
There's so much more but I can not bring myself to go on. 
I recently kicked him out. Because he kept contact with former exes leading them on. And started to put me down again, he blared music calling me a bitch and other names.  Because I wanted to explore other options in regards to a start up business. 

He now lives with one of his former girls that throughout the last few months of our relationship I confronted him about the need to keep in contact. 

I live in an apartment I can hardly afford. Debt that was racked up due to him. I work multiple jobs so I can go back to school. And I can't go home and face my parents because of the shame. 

I'm lost.  And I drink because it's the only thing keeping me together. When I'm sober I break down. 
I'm only 25 and I'm broken.

I (23M) am always deeply sad. When I was 19 I had 3 brain surgeries which was very hard for me to deal with and ended up developing short term memory loss. I live in the US and never could afford health insurance to this day (I've lived a poor life &amp; minimum wage jobs). Ever since I've been living in constant emotional, mental, and physical pain. For five years now I find it so difficult to just be happy. No matter what event that comes about to induce happiness it lasts so temporarily for me and once its been said anything done I return to this state of severe sadness. I've tried committing suicide more than a handful of times, but I'm not suicidal now.

I've lived in many awfully toxic living situations continuously and dont have a decent relationship with any of my family. I've dropped almost all of my friends due to me not having the will to communicate, although I have one great friend. My days just feel pointless even if I force myself to get out and try to have fun. 

I've never actually seen a doctor because I've been afraid cause I'm not really sure what they're going to do or how to come about it without having insurance. I dont know what to do, I just want to be happy and be normal again, I'm tired of crying. Who should I got to? What steps should I take? I think my depression is more than a case of simply talking to someone for I've done that with a friends or two.

268,"Context for this sub: I have been passionate about social studies/history since I was in 2nd grade. I have been good at the short term and normal-length teaching gigs I've had so far, and the job market for social studies teachers in IL is about 100-400 people for ONE opening. Not kidding! That's why I've taken short-term gigs...any experience is good, since the market's so bad.

Stay in teaching or go corporate? (Original title in r/teachers) 

&amp;#x200B;

That should be an easy question, right? After waiting for years for a full time social studies position in a competitive state (IL), I finally got an offer yesterday afternoon. School starts Tuesday. But I'd gotten the call to interview only a few hours prior, seeing the voicemail only when I finished up a better-than-expected interview for corporate training.

​

So now I'm a bit stuck. Now, I don't have an offer from the CT position, but I've been emailed a bunch of ""onboarding"" documents and have at least a good chance TBH. I loved the interview. It doesn't seem stressful at all, and the money is ridiculously good.

​

After this, I went to the school for the interview. Red flags everywhere. Nice, supportive staff, but horror stories about the students, at least how I took it. Students swear at the teacher. Classes are 30+. A student there just beat up a teacher (last year) and it made local news. I'm not trying to sound ""above it all""; I don't mind a ""rough"" school, but this place is testing those limits.

​

I want to reiterate that I LOVE teaching. Even if I took the CT job, I'd still be casually searching for mid-year openings and/or not-casually searching for teaching jobs starting in March. I'd still keep my eyes on the prize for a better teaching fit. Hopefully schools would see CT as related, albeit not identical, experience.

​

Anyway I have no fucking idea what to do. I love teaching and I'm good at it. I build relationships with students, no matter where they're from, etc., because I know it's so important! I haven't only worked at perfect schools BTW. But this one seems off the charts bad. I worked at a terrible school (got sworn at, etc., terrible admin) my first year and got non-renewed. I know I've grown as a teacher since then, but a huge part of my brain (which hates risks, oops) is petrified.

They said it was okay to me that I move in.   Shelby told me that I would be treated like family from them (they treat her like family and call her daughter).  They let me live here rent free and are building me my own bedroom into the house.  I'm grateful. I clean, cook, buy food, and watch the baby more then Shelby.

In the last week alone I've been disinvited 4 times :

They went out from hanging out all day, the husband came in and said ""I am going to buy a SINGLE thing of Chinese food,"" to me when I asked what he was doing (in a nice causal way, just seeing how his night is going). He then comes back and gets a bowl for my best friend and wife they start eating in front of me, not even offering me any.

&amp;#x200B;

The husband asked me if I want to go with him and the wife to Shelby's work, a fancy restaurant.   I told  him that I could not afford it, but thank you.   He said ""ok then I have some physical labor for you to do, can you do some yardwork and watch the baby?"" Yet just a few days later Shelby was taken out to eat twice! (she makes more money then me too).

&amp;#x200B;

Two nights ago without even inviting me the husband asked me to watch the baby because he, his wife, and a friend were going to watch a movie.   Shelby walks into the room and he invites her.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I was disinvited from a dinnerparty they had even though Shelby was allowed to attend.

I'm confused.  I'm nice, cook, clean, watch the baby and they treat me terribly. I can't afford to move out yet as my teaching job has only given me a few hours (they promised full time in the near future).

Am  I being overly sensitive? Should  I talk to them?

273,"I don't think I would be able to manage having a job that I don't enjoy, but I don't even know what I really enjoy.

I mean, I like things like video games and watching streams and stuff, but I don't really have any hobbies that could point in a career direction.

For pretty much my entire life until now, I've just done whatever I felt like doing at the time, whether it was playing games, surfing the web, relaxing, or whatever. I'm not used to the idea of planning things out beforehand, without knowing what I'll feel like doing at the time.

I just can't think of anything that I wouldn't get tired of in a few weeks. The only things that I consistently enjoy are video games and watching stuff like Twitch and YouTube, and even then, not having a choice would make me hate it.

Entrepreneurial stuff wouldn't work, since I don't have anywhere near the amount of persistence or self-confidence needed. 

Add all that together with a bunch of other mental health issues including anxiety, poor impulse control, and paralyzing self-esteem issues. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm passionate about, I don't know what makes me happy, and I don't know how I'm going to make a living if I can't find a job that holds my interest for more than a month.",02Sep2018,1

But recently, he’s just been a cocky asshole and I don’t think he realizes it, yesterday we were talking about somthing he was spooked of and I was giving him advice when he told me he didn’t care what I say and that my advice was stupid, and then he got into some things about how I’ve never experienced fear ( I’ve gone through a lot more than him), and right there at dinner, even tho I shouldn’t have said it out loud I called him an asshole.


He then proceeds to cry and leave the dinner my parents bought for him, and then my dad leaves too, and everyone in the family is angry I called him out, I shouldn’t have cussed or done t in public but he got no discipline for his entitlement, and he thinks it’s ok to be rude and nobody will call you or.

277,"I'm writing this because I'm really confused, I'm searching for answers that I don't have and feel lost. I am a 21-year old female and he is a 21 year old male. 

My boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago because he said our relationship wasn't healthy. At first I was really, really shocked and upset because it came seemingly out of no where - I thought we were in a perfectly happy relationship but he identified signs that there were unhealthy unbalances. Our relationship in many ways was very healthy, loving, and affectionate. We support each other wholeheartedly through anything and our compatibility is impeccable - if the concept if someone being the ""one"" is true, I really don't see any other human being better suited for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always loved that he really does want the best for me, that he's smart and ambitious but most of all he's consciously trying to be happy (as I am) but it was definitely unpleasant when he realized that I have unhealthy attachment issues and in trying to do the best for me, he broke up with me and told me I need to spend time loving myself. I hadn't realized there were minuscule ways I attempted to drag out the infatuation stage of our relationship using emotional manipulation even if I never consciously did it or have any intention to hurt him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am addicted to the rush and excitement that's characteristic in the ""falling in love"" stage of a relationship, I realize now I've always been. I've always have idolized the idea of love, romance, affection. I grew up in a neglectful home environment as a child, my mom is and has always been emotionally unavailable, we didn't form appropriate bonds while I was developing and my self esteem is not as high as it should be (but it's better than it was, I really have been working on it and I think realizing I'm addicted to love will majorly change my life). I believe I used the affection I got from relationships to supplement the lack of love I should be giving myself. I just realized I've never been single or not actively looking for a partner, ever... so understanding all of this now I've taken a vow to avoid any romantic interactions for the next 6 months and invest the time and energy I would have invested in the maintenance or pursuit of a romantic relationship into myself, my interests, my platonic friendships.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that I understand fairly well, here's where I'm lost. I truly do believe him and I are soulmates, I hope I'm not saying that from a place of addiction, I believe this is coming from our bond, how supportive we are of each other, our unconditional love for one another, etc. I do love him, I love him for him outside of myself and I don't need any stimulation to remind me that. I've never loved anyone the way I love him. There's this overwhelming intuition that him and I are not done, that this is a case of ""right person, wrong time"". I think that I need to be working on myself firstly for myself but also understanding that I cannot be in a healthy relationship with my current mind state. If he hadn't broken up with me, I feel our relationship may have been damaged over time because of our individual issues left unchecked. I'm willing to be romantically alone for as long as I need to, but I know when it's time for me to be in a healthy relationship again he's the only person I'd want and I don't think that's going to change. I think he knows this too, we spoke yesterday and there's this unspoken agreement between us that this breakup isn't forever but for however long we need it to be before we come back as whole individuals ready to be in a healthy partnership. 

&amp;#x200B;

This puts me in a weird place, I actively still love someone while also knowing that I need to be alone. I have an overwhelming intuition that he and I are going to get back together but I don't want to allow that hope to turn into a fantasy and blind me, I really realize I have a lot to work on but at the same time the love for him I have is real, I don't think that comes from a place of addiction, it just is. Being in this weird place makes it hard for me to really come to a conclusion on how I should view the relationship between my (ex) boyfriend and I and my own recovery. I guess I'm hoping someone will read all of this and help me sort my thoughts, offer advice, or give me new perspective. What can I do right now to better myself and how should I frame all of this in my mind?

It's hard because I've accepted I need to be alone but I also know that I love him. 

Thank you for reading all of this, I know I'm an internet stranger but your kindness is so appreciated.

Honestly I don’t really like being able to see where he’s at or what’s on his story, because he’s talking to other girls and hanging out with a lot of people. His snap map says he’s always somewhere where he’d never normally be when we were together. Should I un-add him again and call it good?

281,"About 6 months ago I moved across the country from a major West Coast city to a major East Coast City. Before I left there was this girl that was a gym instructor at my gym. Over the course of a year we had became friends and I developed a crush on her. We hung out in groups pretty often and got to know each other, but I never made a move because I didn't think I had a real shot.

Anyway, fast forward a few months after moving and her friend told me that she really liked me. I went back for a work trip and saw her and she was over the top happy, told me she really missed me etc. After hanging out this weekend with the usual group I told her that I liked her, but knew it didn't really mean much now (since we lived so far away). She texted me that she felt the same way about me, but knew it couldn't work with distance. Kind of heart wrenching stuff, but fine.

285,"(This will probably just follow the general cliche of depression posts but typing this will atleast keep me occupied for a bit)  


Currently aged 23, had a bad experience with school and ended up leaving aged 14. I was housebound (with anxiety issues) til I was almost 19, so I lost all my friends and fell out of touch with most of my family. Since then I've been trying to catch up with education that I missed and started working full time last year.  


However, although I've 'generally' improved a lot in the last few years I still don't really feel any better. I've grown to hate social contact and actively avoid my family and friends. If I get dragged to a social event I'll either sit on my own til I can leave or sneak off when no one's around. I've started having severe mood swings lately where I can switch from uncontrollably euphoric to crushingly depressed in a matter of seconds and I've developed a very short fuse. I've been having crying spells at work and it's getting difficult to hide. It's also very embarrassing as a construction worker.  


Currently, I work 50+ hours a week. I absolutely detest my job; I'm away from home a lot, the pay is awful and the required social contact exhausts me. Plus, I'm pretty bad at the job and I'm only continuing because it's a small company and leaving would cause a lot of issues. It would inevitably lead to me getting a LOT of heat and I can't handle that at the minute. Plus I'd have no reference and very little experience when looking for a new job.  


I spend every weekend sat alone in my room just eating, sleeping and basically waiting to go back to work. Despite how much I hate it, I don't seem to be able to do anything with my spare time anymore. I play guitar, but for multiple reasons I don't care about playing anymore. I tried to get in to photography (I invested a LOT of money in it) and now it's all collecting dust. Generally I'll go a few weeks without spending any money until I reach a point of boredom singularity and blow a load of money on some kind of new toy. And every time I spend any money, I regret what I've bought and resell it at a loss.  


I'm unsure where to turn at this point. I've tried medication in the past but the side effects and withdrawal put me off for life. I've also tried therapy 2 or 3 times but after making no progress it was suggested that I stop seeing them. I was considering it again, but to me it just seems like more social contact that I don't want and having to pay for it. No matter what I try and get myself to do, I ask myself 'What's the point?'. And I never have answer for that, so I don't do anything.

287,"I want to preface this by saying I love my Grandma and I know what I write is going to make me sound horrible but I just need to ask for some advice and suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my Grandma was perfectly healthy and independent up until six months ago. She would visit us maybe 6 times a year. Then six months ago she became unwell and is now effectively housebound with carers visiting multiple times a day and her unemployed son (I only mention unemployed because it means he has a good amount of free time) visits a few times a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past few months she has started coming round our house every Sunday. When she visits it involves myself or my parents driving to collect her in the morning (a 1 hour round journey) and dropping her off in the evening at around 7pm (another 1 hour round journey). My parents and I all work full time on weekdays which means every weekend we effectively only get one day off to relax and/or do 'weekend things' (shopping, seeing friends, visiting cities, etc). Before we would spend Saturday doing our own thing (see friends and stuff) and then Sunday we would go on a long walk with the dogs and have a family dinner. When my Grandma is round it is not relaxing as she is rude to my mom. We tried to take her shopping to the grocery store the other weekend and she is unsteady on her feet so we asked her to bring her wheelchair but she wouldn't and instead took her walker and her unsteady gait meant she kept walking into people and shopping carts which was embarrassing and not nice for other shoppers but it couldn't be helped.

However I know how important it is for her to get out and see people and just have a change of surroundings which is why I know I am being so horrible and selfish. However it is a sentiment also shared by my parents. I also should add that I have younger siblings too including one with autism, therefore our family life is very busy. I also know we are lucky to have my Grandma's other son (my Uncle) as well as carers as I know some families have to care 24/7 for family members.

I think one of the waiters at the pub I work at is stealing tips.

To start:

I started as a pot wash at a local pub about 5 months ago, and ever since I joined, the chefs and waitresses had been making comments out of my should be ear shot about this waiter stealing tips. I didn't believe it at first, because he seemed like a nice guy, we talked about video games etc when it wasn't busy so I didn't think he would be that kind of person. On a very busy day at work, I would receive about £5 tips. On normal days, i would get about £2/3. However, last week, this waiter was on holiday. I worked 3 times last week, the first 2 times weren't busy, and the 3rd time it was extremely busy. On the 1st day, I got £9 tips. The second day, I got £8 tips, and on the very busy day, I received £18 in tips. I thought this was a bit unusual as I never get this much. The waiter returned this week, and I worked the same 3 days. Lo and behold, I have returned back to the normal £2/3 tips. Obviously, this good be an extreme coincidence, but I find it unlikely, and as the rest of the staff have noticed similar goings on, we all believe it's him. We don't want to bring it up to the boss, in case it backfires or if he isn't and we've accused him of something that wasn't him. None of us know how to prove it but there's no way that it isn't him.

I also have a boyfriend who (23y/o) and we've had a rather smooth relationship for the entire time we've been together. He also recently started living with a roommate and previously, lived alone and we enjoyed plenty of time together knowing that our privacy wasn't compromised. 

However, I feel like with this new dynamic where a third party is involved, we have to adjust a few things, and it's even worse because I am the kind of person who needs time to get used to new situations and when faced with unfamiliar challenges. 
In this case it's mostly having a third party in a space that is equally his as it is his roommate's, which means both of them have a say. The same goes for me as well. 

So recently, I brought this issue up and I let him know that as I adjust to the new living conditions with a new roommate, I also have to involve her in a discussion where we will have to come to an agreement on how we will live in harmony, without compromising too much and also without crossing each others boundaries. This directly affects my relationship with my boyfriend, because I would love to have him come over as much as possible without falling into constant disagreements with my roommate. 

However, my boyfriend feels like by doing this, I am putting my roommate above our relationship. I am also the kind of person who takes time to adjust to situations so it makes it even worse because he feels like just because another party is involved it shouldn't be a problem. While I still feel like it's something to consider. 

So, I'm conflicted. 

By deciding to have  discussion with my roommate about a plan that works, am I putting someone else above our relationship?

What do you think I should do?

304,"I’ve been walking one of my neighbor’s dog. She owed me 50 bucks two weeks ago, and only payed 35 of it, said she’d pay more later, and never did. Then last week I watched her dog for a week while she was out of the country. She came back yesterday, didn’t bring up payment, just said she’d need me to watch her dog for 4 days this week.

It’s really hard to bring up payment with her, I don’t want to give attitude, or start a fight, but I’m walking her dog in almost 90 degree heat at morning and night, keeping the dog company too, it’s a fair amount of work.

Even so, I’m just terrified of bringing it up to her..but I’m getting concerned at how long it’s been since she’s not payed me. Meanwhile she’s got packages delivered to her, and she showed me a few new things she bought last week, so she’s got money to spend, obviously.",02Sep2018,4

306,"Hey guys. I thought about being completely vulnerable and asking for some advice here. I'm 25 and currently living in Madrid and working as an English teacher. When I first came, I was totally scared but somehow I managed to find a job and settle in. I was initially supposed to stay for a year but now I'm going on to my third year. My problem is that I am so afraid of making changes here, even when I know I need to. For example, changing my job, although I love it, the pay is terrible and I keep staying there for the benefit of the kids while I have to run around doing a million other jobs just so I can make ends meet. Next change, is definitely my apartment, although the people are lovely, the rent is just a bit much and now it's set to increase. I also want to do a masters but unless I switch jobs that allow me to have some decent savings, it seems impossible. I have this bad habit of comparing myself, the last guy I was dating here was a lawyer who was better off with a nicer place etc and I started to feel...incompetent..like I wanted to pay more for things and buy him more things but I just couldn't like I wanted to. A little off track, but I guess what I'm getting at is..how does one find the strength and courage to make a change when it literally terrifies them and especially when you feel like there is no fall back plan because you're in a different country alone without family.

309,"I'll keep it brief. My GF (24) used to flirt with this really hunky attractive guy (21) online who is a family friend from New Zealand.

Most of the chats were from 3 years ago and really sexual, but the most recent one was from April this year (while we were dating) saying she wanted to jump on him once he got off the plane.

He is coming to stay at her house next week and I'm worried.

I know she loves me and is attracted to me, in fact she can't keep her hands off me, but whenever I express concern she gets quite defensive and worked up.

She confided in her mom that I was worried about him, and she told her not to push her into doing anything with him (which I find weird) as she's been known to do before (as she doesn't hold much hope for our relationship).

I won't be able to spend any time with her the week he's there and I know they're going to be having day trips, going out drinking etc.

I can't stop this, but based on what you all know do I have a right to be worried? She acts like I'm being unreasonable and that I'm in the wrong for expressing my anxiety about it.

310,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here goes...

I’ve been playing Lineage 2 Revolution on my phone for quite some time, and joined a new clan maybe 2 months ago. Clan leader seems nice at first, but then starts sending DM’s to me about how messed up his life is. He claims he’s had cancer twice, that he’s a veteran and in constant pain, dealing with PTSD, etc. Basically oversharing like crazy, but outside of that is very nice to everyone in the clan.

 Fast forward 3 weeks ago, he starts talking about how his deployments left him in constant pain and how he feels like he has nothing in his life. I try to be supportive, encouraging him to seek a professional to talk to etc. He gives me his phone number and says I should call him- I don’t. 

I took a mini break from the game to see that he posted on the clan chat that he’s going to be ending his life, and starts giving out his name and age and where he lives so “ you can come to the services”, as the clan members are “ my only friends”. 

The following morning at 1am he posts that he’s OD’d on Xanax, and then nothing further. 9 hours pass before I see this, and panic. Thinking I’m doing the right thing, I do a quick google search to find the police department in the city he listed as where he lives. I called them to let them know, sent screecaps if the convo. About a half hour after doing this- the clan leader shows back up online, threatening me and saying I’ve made an “ enemy for life”. He kicked me and every member of the clan out immediately after this, and blocked me on the game entirely as well. Was I in the wrong to do this? I’ve never been in that situation, and it was quite honestly the first thing to come to mind to do. ",02Sep2018,3

314,"I made a throw away because I am at a point where I feel overwhelmed. My boyfriend and I [Im F28, he’s M32, together 6 months] went through a rough patch in the very beginning. He was overly addicted to social media. He was constantly liking half naked women’s posts, porn stars, etc. I told him it bothered me and it took him around 2 weeks to stop liking them. Then I got an uproar of followers and likes. I showed my BF the accounts and asked if he knew them (he followed most of them) and said yes. He said the girls were just friends. One girl in particular started to like every single picture of mine, tell me how pretty I was, etc. I was excited for a new friendship with his female friend. I told him and he just said “interesting.”

A few months later he gave me his old Apple Watch. His old texts were still on there and I wanted to delete them. The very last text I saw was from the female friend saying how “good of a dicking she got last night.” It was the girl who spam liked all my pictures. The texts were from 2 weeks before we met. He completely lied about her being just a friend. I confronted him and he said he thought that information would bother me, and “to be fair, they are just friends now.” I feel lied to. Ever since then I have had issues trusting him. 

Similar instance happened. He was showing me a meme on IG, and going through his inbox scrolled past a conversation with a girl about how she wanted to sit on his face and him saying “mmmm.” This conversation happened a month after we started to see each other. That really hurt me. His response was “ we weren’t officially dating! I haven’t even met her!”

I felt like he kind of had an issue with social media. He would add around 100 new friends a week, mostly females. When we went out to eat he was constantly on his phone, liking half naked women, porn stars, saying he was attending events, etc. I had had enough. I told him I was done with the relationship because it was too much for me to handle. He is a grown man and acting like a high school boy. He broke down and said he had a social media addiction, but said he didn’t want to lose me because I am the love of his life. He (his own choice) said he would take down his Snapchat, IG and facebook. It’s been 2 months and I have noticed a huge improvement. However...

When he goes to big social events (he thrives on them) he usually has to see a ton of people. It’s just not for me. I don’t attend. I don’t mind that he goes at all, and I know that he meets up with his group of friends. I do however each and every time ask him who is there. I want to know a female body count. I want to know how he knows each girl. He has lied to me twice already, and that’s only because I found out on my own. Sometimes I make him take pictures and send them to me. If I see a tagged picture of him on FB and there’s a girl in the picture I will ask who she is and how he knows her. BEFORE I never did this, but since he lied I now feel betrayed. I know this must be exhausting for him, and I hate treating him so poorly and constantly being accusatory. 

How do I break this cycle? I feel like since he broke my trust I don’t ever think we can recover. It’s unfortunate because I think if this hadn’t of happened I could see myself marrying him. We have so much in common, and he understands and respects me on so many emotional and intellectual levels. I’m not trying to be controlling, but it’s difficult for me not to be in this situation. He pretty much does whatever I ask him to at this point, and I come off as a bully, but people don’t know what he put me through, and the paranoia he has caused me. What can I do? What can we do?

318,"Hey all. Mid-20s adult male here.

I'm currently serving in the army. To put it lightly and make a long story very short, mine time here has been... difficult. My personality does not mesh with military culture, and I won't be staying in after my contract expires. End bio.

---

In my time serving, I've discovered something: I don't know how to assert myself—or more specifically, I don't know *when* to assert myself. This is especially true around people in positions of authority (either actual or perceived).

In the military, you are expected to follow orders from superiors. This probably seems obvious. However, as a result, that puts me in a (perceived?) position of complete subordination. If I'm told to do something, I do it because rank is rank, and I'm contractually obligated to serve within the bounds of the military ecosystem until the end of my tenure, no matter what. This is... all obvious.

**But is that how it's supposed to be?**

Maybe it's because I'm in the military—a place where ""chain of command"" is taken very seriously—that I feel I can't disobey. Maybe I wouldn't feel that way if I was in a different place. But when can a person in a subordinate position say ""no""?

I've had some very poor leadership in my time here, and so far my response has always been to just ""take it""—whatever ""it"" is. After all, that leadership has rank and that means they're in charge. But where should lines be drawn? I'm especially concerned about this because once I'm out of the military, I'm worried I will take this submissiveness with me.

I guess I'll end this here since I really don't know what I'm trying to get across. I'm just... confused. So here are a few questions, summed up.

------

**tl;dr—**

1. When should you say ""no"" to someone? Is it different if the person is your employer?
2. How do you say ""no"" to a boss?

320,"Three years ago, I got out of a relationship with a girl cause she wasn't having sex with me. It wasn't that I was asking and her saying no, it was more of it just wasn't building up to it. When we broke up, she told me that she had been planning to have sex with me that weekend. Being a horny 19-year old, I started to try and work things out with her cause I thought it meant getting to have sex. I also thought, by this admission and her wanting to keep hooking up that she wanted to have sex.

Over the course of the next few months, when we would be hooking up, we would keep our underwear on (par for the course for us) and I would take my dick out of my underwear and thrust into her over top of hers (once again, par for the course for us). I decided to try and test the waters out some and push the boundaries of our sexual relationship. I started to move her underwear to the side for 2 reasons: (1) it kind of hurt to thrust into her over top of her underwear and (2) I want to try and get her to ask for sex. So as I moved her underwear to the side, I would tease her a little bit and test the waters. When she'd react positively (i.e. her body language saying she liked it), I would push a little more and put the tip of my dick in. She always reacted positively and enjoyed us hooking up. I eventually worked my way slowly over the course of hookups to getting about half of my dick inside her. She never asked to have sex, so I never really pushed more than a couple thrusts because I was nervous that she wouldn't want it.

This is where I have a ton of guilt. I feel like 19 y/o me knew I shouldn't have been doing it, but I was testing the waters and always pushing when she would have positive reactions and show me that she enjoyed it. But I also feel dirty and sly for moving her underwear to the side and not asking if it was okay. I was young and horny and thought I would be fine if she wasn't saying anything and kept participating. After learning more about consent over the past couple years, I know I should have asked and now I wonder if she truly did know that I was moving her underwear. The reason I think this is because (1) one time she asked if I was over top of her underwear and I immediately stopped and moved it back and (2) the last time we hooked up, we ended up having sex and she asked ""does this mean I'm not a virgin"" which to me meant she didn't realize she didn't know what was happening. I feel guilty because I should have known better, but I was exploring and testing the waters and pushing when she'd react positively. 

I consistently beat myself up for this and am looking for some words of wisdom and some advice on how to move forward. Obviously I'm not going to talk to her about it cause it's been 3 years and we've moved on with our lives, but I really wish i could've made a better decision so I wouldn't be sitting here contemplating if I sexually assaulted somebody in the past.

322,"Hi I am not sure what to do in this particular scenario in which I feel one of the managers is taking her stress out on me. 

For some background info:
I work at an art and craft store as an associate (just recently hired and making some extra money). 

The other day, the manager was really upset over something else and I was basically tasked to make a certain section of the store presentable. There were a lot of feathers and things on the ground, so I grabbed a broom and started sweeping. Then this particular manager came up to me and started yelling at me to recover the section (meaning fixing the shelves). With the broom in my hand, I was going to say I'll will get to that after I put this broom away. But she cut me off when u said I'll get to it and yelled at me to do in right now. One of the employees saw and acknowledged that she was being kind of short with me.

A few days later, the main store manager gather everyone in a group and said that a manager was being challenged and back talked. The main store manager looked at me with full eye contact and I assume I guess she was talking about me because she said if a manager tells you to do something do it immediately. 

I was frustrated because yeah I didn't want to dump  my broom and trash on the aisle in that scenario. I kind of justst shrugged it off and put it as under a miscommunication, but today she still took her frustration out on me and only me again. I didn't know how to use the phone system in the store and had to do a price check. I used a walkie talkie to ask an employee. Then the same manager got really upset I didn't know how to use it. I tried asking another employee how but everyone was swamped with customers, including me. She came up to me short tempered and aggressively told me how to use the phone. I apologized and she walked away. I talked to another appointed manager and she told me that apparently she's going through something.

 I get that, but I don't think it's good to just take it out on me. What should I do?",02Sep2018,1

324,"Hello! 

As the title says, I'm feeling completely burned out when I haven't even started my last year of studies. I'm studying chemical engineering which requires quite a bit of studying and work to be put into it. (But that's not the issue)

However, for the last couple of years things haven't been going for me well. I ran into multiple issues with my mental health (from a hurtful breakup, to my friend passing away) and it seems that everything is not going to be better for a while now.

So, as a person that I am, I'm trying not to put everything for the last minute and to plan my life into the future. I'm 100% sure that after I'm done with my studies next Summer, I will want to take a break for at least a couple of months which led me to the question, what to do then?

I have a lot of working experience, even though I'm only 21. From the age of 16 for 3 years during Summer I've worked at a construction company, for one Summer I did work as an assistant at Mars Inc. company and this Summer for the first time I had a chance to have a job abroad at the Netherlands, which was in a paint making factory. So as far as I'm aware, I'm pretty good at doing physical and mental works. 

I'm from the eastern Europe. We don't have great life here, our economy sucks and we don't have happy and encouraging society. (My country has the highest suicide rate in the world, oh I wonder why..) And spending this Summer working at the Netherlands completely changed my views on the people and on the society itself. I'm a male, and leaving that country has brought me to tears knowing that I'm about to get back to my usual and depressing routine. 

And why I know it's depressing and there's something wrong with me? Well.. Living a dull life as I've been for these 21 years have made me to be scared of many things. Showing yourself out to the people, doing things that I think I would enjoy doing because of the constant fear of failing and constant fear of other people mocking me. Leaving the Netherlands I've had an idea to finally buy a cheap dslr camera and start learning things about photography, since I've always been fascinated about it. But now, when I'm back here it feels that again, everyone is against that and I have to force myself to deal with constant negativity/pressure or whatever you can call it and I'm just afraid of buying it because I know it will be hard to go outside and take those pictures. It's hard to explain everything, especially when it's not my native language (even though I would have a problem doing that in my language as well), but I just want to have something to live for, to wait for me, while I'm doing my last year of university. I just want to know that something is there that I finally be able to enjoy doing and get into it 100%.. All my life people have told me I'm good at things, but I've never managed to overcome that fear of failing and showing yourself, so I've never achieved anything that sitting and playing video games.. So at least I'm thinking if I have a place, further away from society for a couple of months next Summer, I can finally rethink my life, do correct future decisions and just finally relax and get that anxiety out of my head.

So, if there's still anyone reading I really need your advice on what to do. To be more correct, I know that I should take time for myself, but I just need to find a place where. I'm not wealthy, I cannot just go anywhere and enjoy peace. I need to find an income during that time as well. Anyway.. Thank you for reading, even more thank you if you have some suggestions. &lt;3

325,"I broke up with someone, a while back, and the way things were left was really rough. We're not in contact anymore. I've deleted everything I have from her on my phone (text conversations are still there but so deep below other ones that I don't see them anymore). I've tried to forget about her as much as possible, but I always find myself thinking about her at random times, and it sucks. I don't know how to deal with this, but that's not my question.

She and I were long distance, and there was a trip I took a while back where, among other things, I saw her. The way I listen to music is that I add songs to Spotify, they go to the top of ""my songs"" in reverse chronological order, and then I usually listen to the first 5-10 or so on repeat in the car. As a result, I'm really used to the order of songs, and certain songs become associated with certain times (like whenever I hear Sofia by Alvaro Soler I think about when I listened to that song a bunch on the bus in Italy two summers ago). The issue now is that there are a few songs that I'll hear when I let it keep playing, that are associated with that trip, and by extension her, and when I hear them, I think of her. How do I break this association, so I can keep listening to good music without thinking of my ex?

TL;DR: There's some music that's become associated in my mind with my ex -- I don't want to think about her anymore, but I want to listen to the songs still. How?",02Sep2018,1

My parents have talked about divorce for a long time, but my mom being the person who doesn't really take charge with things and just wants things to ""happen"" never took the steps to make it happen. My three sisters and I think my parents would be better off without each other, though they won't divorce each other for whatever reason.

Few more details: My dad got fired in February, my mom is suing someone for sexual harrassment at her old work and is hoping it'll bring her a lot of money, my dad almost died due to hidden serious health conditions about three years ago and my mom taking care of him seemed to bolster their relationship only temporarily.

328,"I’ve been with this guy for five months and at first we talked all the time, and he’d make time for me. Now, it’s like he talks to me when he is bored or just wants someone to talk to. He works weird hours so he also sleeps most of the day. 

We also haven’t been on good terms (my feelings) because we get into fights about stupid stuff all the time. I don’t want to go through his phone because he needs privacy but I also don’t want to get hurt again.

329,"So, my family is originally from another country, but I never actually lived there. I used to be fluent in that language, but now I’ve forgotten most of it.
Now a cousin of mine has temporarily moved in with us (because of work). He however, doesn’t speak english. It’s really awkward whenever we try to talk, because I’m expected to still know my native language... but I don’t.
We’ve kind of been avoiding each other, which has made my parents upset. They want me to spend time with him, but I just don’t know how.

330,"So my story begins in the Summer of 2018. My mom pressured into taking summer classes at UTEP which I was highly against since I just graduated from High-school and a Community college at the same time (I was part of a Early College High-school program which allowed me to graduate with an Associates and Diploma). The reason she wanted me to take Summer classes was so I could get financial aid (2017-2018). So I took her advice and went to school.

I wanted to go into Computer Science (You already see where this is going). I took Intro to CS and I will admit I slacked off the first 2 weeks (Its an 8 week long course) of class like a dumbass and I tried to get my act together which resulted in me failing the class and another online class I was taking. I essentially gave up.

I unfortunately have Aspergers and slight Autism along with ADHD which makes studying a nightmare. There were days where I would leave class early or not to go at all. I was extremely sad and my mind being the way it is loves to blow things out of proportion with my thoughts saying “You’re a failure”, “Still alive retard that’s a shame should’ve put yourself down like a dog years ago.”, “Why the fuck are you still alive you fucking disappointment”, or my least favorite “You’re stupid. Always have been always will be”

To make things worse I don’t think I can qualify for Financial Aid since my GPA is at a 0.42. UTEP also has a student contract thing if I’m probation and do not do well the next semester, I cannot enroll the semester after that. Since i don’t think I can pay for classes,  I will automatically lose the fall and spring semester essentially losing 1 academic year of progress.

Now before you say go look for a doctor here is another kicker. The only reason I’m going to school is so I can get a Bachelors and enlist in the Military (Navy) as an Officer. If I get diagnosed with depression they will not take me (I looked up mental illnesses disqualifying you from enlistment) and since I’m Autistic I need to get a waiver anyway to join.  

So I need help on the situation. 

I can toughen up and get a full time job somewhere for the year I cannot go to school

Say fuck it to school and enlist behind my parents backs ( 1 year sets me back quite a bit)

Or get a job and don’t go back to school

Thank you for reading this post, I don’t want this to become a pity party for me. I just need advice on what to do next.",02Sep2018,1

## 

We were only together for two months, it's been two months since we broke-up and I'm still struggling to move on!

The relationship was intense and got serious very quickly, it felt like it was something very different to anything else I've experienced before and it felt like we'd known each other for years. We both connected so well and he was right there with me, I never felt he wasn't as into it as I was and he took the lead in how serious it got. It just felt so nice to relax into a relationship where everything felt right, I felt safe to let my guard down to go into this fully.

But we started having arguments where he'd become emotionally abusive (including guilt-trips, deflection, gaslighting), I didn't think it was intentional but I tried to talk to him about it...he dumped me immediately. He refused point blank to acknowledge any responsibility, he got nasty and left my things in his front yard, that was that.

He's already moved on like we were nothing, within a few weeks he was back on dating apps and dating someone new.

Meanwhile I'm still struggling with how unfair it was and I just can't make myself get back into dating, I'm struggling to see myself finding something that felt this good again - and even if I do I'll worry it's all an act, that if I let my guard down again I'll get hurt again. Call me naive but I'll always struggle to understand how people behave this way towards each other, I was 100% genuine in how much I gave myself to the relationship so that he's gone from telling me how much he cared for me and introducing me to his family...to dumping me like I was nothing. I just can't get my head around it.

I KNOW I dodged a bullet, given his abusive behavior and the fact he dumped me for trying to talk about it. Logically I can see I'm better without him, but still on some level I'm stuck on how unfair this was and it has totally put me off dating.",02Sep2018,3
335,"100 milligrams. That's the amount of MDMA in a ""point"" - that is, 0.1 grams. It's the standard dose. When I cap it, or dose it out into gelatin capsules, I weigh out anywhere from 100mg to 104mg. It's like a baker's dozen; always better to give people a tiny bit more than to accidentally skimp and underdeliver. The LD50, or dosage that would be lethal to approximately 50% of the general population, of MDMA is around 12mg/kg, or about 1000mg for your typical 200lb male. This leaves enough room for error that I don't feel concerned if a point ends up as 104mg instead of 100mg, and everyone at least gets what they paid for.

&amp;#x200B;

I import my MDMA from overseas, through a personal connection I made on a darknet forum. No darknet markets involved - too much law enforcement focus there because of the opioid crisis. Better pricing, too. I cap it, package it for sale, and sell it to people who resell it to people who use it. I also offer LSD, and psychedelic mushrooms. MDMA, or molly, or ecstasy, whatever your preferred term, though, is what makes me most of my money. When I'm ""working"" to create a sellable product, I listen to NPR or podcasts.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of principles about this business that I stick to, because I think that you lose ownership over who you are if you don't stay true to what you believe:

\- If I sell something, it must be the very best that money can buy. If you do something, do it well.

\- No cuts or underdosing. Ever. Only perfectly pure product, verified by mass spectrometry done on randomly sampled product, measured out with a tiny bit extra. People have a right to get what they paid for.

\- No minors. This isn't hard to stick to, but there was one time I met a guy and he bought my minimum order quantity a couple of times. People who buy the minimum tend to be the people who cause problems. I found out through a mutual acquaintance that he gave several points to two girls who were each 16 years old. Livid, I confronted him, and he argued that they were actually 17. I told him to never speak to me again.

\- No violence. The aforementioned scenario is one of the few times I've had to remind myself of that. There was a guy who stole $200 of product once and I thought about slashing his tires. But no, no violence. Violence is bad for business and gives ammunition to those who say that this business is inherently incompatible with good society.

\- Only MDMA, LSD, mushrooms. If you deal in cocaine, particularly high-quality cocaine, you are directly supporting the central/south American cartels, and they are bad people. If you deal in benzos or opioids, \*you\* are a very bad person, because those are addictive.

&amp;#x200B;

My resellers are all in college. I'm somewhere between 22-25, so I'm not far removed from them. Most are in fraternities. I was a student-athlete at the same university here, so I was never into college greek life, but it's abundantly clear that they go through narcotics like nobody's business. I love the fraternities - they institute risk management practices that indirectly help protect me, they use responsibly, and they offer repeat business. The guys aren't sketchy, either - I try to avoid sketchiness. They like that I keep things professional. I don't seek out new customers, as that's too risky. I took risks to get to this point, but nowadays I only communicate with people who have earned my trust. I want to believe that because of me, many people who would've had horrible experiences with impure, street-quality drugs that could put them in the hospital instead had good experiences that enhanced their lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends outside of dealing drugs. They don't buy from me, because they don't use drugs. They don't endorse what I do, but they've been my friends before this and they're eager to be my friends when I'm no longer doing this. We go camping together, to music festivals, we make dinner, play video games. I volunteer for a shelter that serves victims of violence, and I teach fitness classes at a local gym. I think that if dealing drugs becomes your life, then it owns you. I don't want that.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of things about this work that I enjoy. But I know it's not right.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was about to turn 17 years old, a high school cross-country friend with whom I shared EDM workout tracks on AIM/MSN messenger asked to come hang out. We met up and he told me that he needed to get rid of some stuff. He dropped about $4000 worth of drugs into my lap and told me to consider it a birthday gift since he was worried about police and it needed to go. It had MDMA in gel caps and pressed pills, DMT, LSD, weed, edibles, mushrooms, and more. My only exposure to drugs at the time had been classroom DARE campaigns. I went home, spent a lot of time googling and reading, and decided to try MDMA.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time, I wanted to be a doctor. I had applied to intern at a hospital in my hometown, and my interview was the next week. I had read that MDMA would make me talkative, happy, fun to me around. Things I wanted as a textbook introvert. My stupidly teenage self figured, then, that if I took a 200mg pressed MDMA pill before my interview, I'd be a great applicant.

&amp;#x200B;

It was an experience, to be sure. I loved it. I'll spare you the ""trip report"", since you can easily find that kind of thing on erowid or whatever. I somehow managed to keep my composure enough to pass an interview at a hospital while on drugs, and they gave me the internship. I went back home and realized that I'd made far and away the most stupid decision of my life, and it worked out. I wasn't willing to take my chances again, so I took the rest of the drugs and flushed them down the toilet. I'm still very glad I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't tell anyone about that. Some of my friends know now, but it's not information I share much. I buried the experience soon after, when my life changed.

&amp;#x200B;

Since around the time I turned 10, I went on hiking trips through a summer camp, every year. There would be a couple of trip guides in their 20s, and a bunch of kids like me, and we'd go hiking through remote wilderness for weeks and in later years, months at a time. I really wanted to be one of the trip leaders for these trips, so I applied for an internship with the camp in my last summer before finishing high school and got it, this time without pharmacological assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

On the exceedingly rare occasion that I tell this story, I like to tell a lot more details, but I'm trying to obscure them and keep them to a level here that protects my anonymity. I think that the way I've written this, only my best friends would be able to connect the dots and know who wrote this. I'll skip to the chase here, though. I was raped by a male camp counselor during the internship. I'd known him for a day, he was a stranger. It happened in a cabin full of kids and I chose to not fight so that they wouldn't be a part of that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The camp effectively fired us both. The police were called, but they decided to not prosecute because they didn't think they could meet the legal standard of ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" to convict him. My parents wanted to move on, but I wanted to burn the camp down. I walked into a lawyer's office in the city nearby, and explained everything. They took the case, and I sued the camp. It culminated in a meeting with the camp's lawyers where they said that it was effectively my word against theirs, and they'd only pay what the legal costs of going to trial would be. My lawyers told me to accept a settlement, so I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

After legal expenses, I got a very low five-figure sum. I used it to make a dent in my student debt, as the lawsuit dragged on for over 2 years and concluded at the end of my sophomore year in college.

&amp;#x200B;

By that point, I had walked on to an athletics team at my university, because I felt like I had to prove something to myself and I wanted to restore my trust in guys by having them as teammates. It was a good experience and it did a lot for me. I got therapy, it helped, and I had decided that I wanted to be a police officer. I wanted to eventually become a detective and work with sex crimes, human trafficking, and child exploitation. Things that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

I got to my senior year, and started applying for police jobs. I got to the end of the 8 month hiring process with eight different departments. I passed the polygraph, the background check, the interviews, and they just needed to review some other documents.

&amp;#x200B;

They subpoenaed my therapy transcripts. One of my therapists, for the purpose of getting my insurance to continue to pay for visits, had diagnosed me with PTSD, and downgraded her diagnosis to situational anxiety when I was discharged from her care. I had thought nothing of it at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I got different variations of the same sort of ""We think you're great, and we were looking forward to having some of our overtime burden taken off by getting you on here, but we just can't take the liability of someone with previous post-traumatic stress."" They were concerned that I'd be the next officer on CNN. It was the end of Obama's presidency, and public-police relations were at a boiling point.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know what to do. For months, I had thought that I'd have my pick of where to start my career in my home state. I had a place picked out, a prospective roommate. It felt like the floor had been ripped out from under my feet.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a girlfriend at the time. When I graduated, I stuck around with her since she was a year behind. I figured that I would just work for a year while I figured things out. It was Halloween when I was mulling over the things I'd kept at arms length for half a decade while living the life a police officer is expected to live. I asked her if she wanted to roll. She was surprised, but up for it. She knew a guy, so we got in touch to get some points.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure that it was meth with some non-active cut. All it did was keep us both awake until 5am. No feelings, no sensation, nothing. Well, if you want something done right, do it yourself, right? I spent a weekend researching the darknet drug trade, and putting the pieces in place to receive a tiny order. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it came, it was everything that I remembered from my experience years prior. We had a lovely time. I shared the rest with her friends. They loved it too, so much that they wanted more. That's how it happened. We broke up the next year, though it was due to her cheating on me with girls, rather than anything substance-related. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to be a drug dealer. I do a bunch of other volunteer work, which has occasionally involved me chaperoning kids on tours of the local police station here. I wave to police when I see them on the road. But I know that I'll never be one of them now.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have a lot of anxiety about this. When it was really bad on some nights, I'd go to bed wearing sweat pants and a hoodie, so that if the police came to arrest me in the night I'd at least be comfortable in jail. But over time I've just tempered myself to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to hold down regular jobs for about a year. All I could get around here was restaurant work, and I just honestly hated it. I make about $40,000 a year in untaxed cash income from my business, which for this area is good money. I could make more, but I don't want to become any ""bigger"" than I already am, as I feel that that would introduce an unacceptable amount of risk. I still talk to my mom and dad every other day or so, and they still think that I'm working a job that I quit about a year ago. I love them, and the cognitive dissonance from this situation bothers me more than I like to admit.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go to grad school. I want to be a therapist, like the ones who helped me. I took the GRE this last winter and scored extremely well; a score that would on its own be competitive for ivy-league institutions. I applied for several programs in counseling psychology, but my lack of experience and my undergrad GPA ended with no acceptance. 

&amp;#x200B;

My GPA was around 2.6-2.8. I honestly spent most of my early college years being a mess involved in a big lawsuit and then I focused on athletics. For police work, they don't care about your GPA, they just care that you have a degree. I was stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

I started doing volunteer work. I started teaching fitness classes including meditation. I'm trying to make myself a competitive applicant, but I just don't think it's going to be enough for me to make it into grad school. I used to think that that could be my way out of this mess, and that I could really empathize with people in horrible situations, but I just don't believe in myself anymore. I still hold on to wanting that to be my life's work, because I need something to be able to get out of bed each day and think that I won't be doing this anymore. My resume is a joke because of my lack of actual full-time work. Even thinking about applying for school again makes me nauseous, but I'll still try.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't had any intimate relationships since the aforementioned one, which has been a few years ago at this point. I sabotage any potential romance because I can't accept the risk of how it could interact with my business.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that this is a choice I made. Nobody is holding a gun to my head and telling me that if I want to continue to live, I need to sell drugs. But it's what I did, because it ended up allowing me to volunteer and do things that I feel like matter. I want to help people who've been hurt, and that's what matters to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what will happen to me. I'm scared. I don't know what advice you can offer, but I just want to put this out there and see what I get. Maybe you'll just resent me, and hope that I get caught. I'm sure a lot of people would. But I want to be a good person, and I want my life's legacy to be a good one. I want a better existence than this.

Academics are going great, professional networking is going great.

I'm not happy with the people I have around me.

I fell out with a good number of people my freshman year (not for doing anything bad, I've never hurt anyone) and now they can't stand me. The friends I do have, I've letting down.

I don't even know any girls I could talk to. It KILLS me to see all my friends happy with their girlfriends (their second or third of college) and I'm still alone.

340,"I’m a teen, and I felt as if I’ve been disassociated with my life since April of 2018.

Well,it’s August of 2018, and I felt as if my life simply just stopped in April, and I’m just gone in everything. I’ve gotten dreams that seemed true (voices convincing me in my dream that something’s happening and I’m wide awake) 
,conversations in my head, and my mind convinced me some strange things. I’m thinking it’s some spiritual thing, but nothing much has been happening except some dreams coming true.

This makes me stuck in being overwhelmed and overthinking on what’s gonna happen, and it gives me anxiety. Even if I don’t think of what’s gonna happen next, I still feel faded off the Earth. It makes me feel alone, leading to a depression. 
I’ve been going back to school it’s somewhat of a distraction, but it just feels very weird being there. It doesn’t feel right because my mind is still, like, in April of 2018. 
I believe I’m depressed and have anxiety, but not the psychotic part. 


Anyway, is there any advice people could give me? It’s gotten a little better since school, and I’ve also been working on music more, so I guess that’s a good thing. But I really would love to see someone’s perspective on this. thanks :) 

tldr- Depression, anxiety, paranoia, (psychotic thoughts maybe), how can I get back on track?

341,"Almost a year ago I met my current employer and his business partner. Initially our conversation started off about building a website for his business partner's salon. I am a seasoned web developer but actually have MUCH more experience and skill than just website design, and my boss ended up hiring me on a full-time basis. I have now been there more than 8 months, enjoy my job, and can see myself staying with the company for quite some time.

​

In the eight months that I have been there, I've done a ton of work for his business partner beyond just building her not one, **but two websites.** Graphic Design, marketing, setting up her social media and google listings, her phones, technical support, business consulting, getting her set up with her POS, etc. The initial downpayment for the website was paid by my boss ($1250) and because I became employed by my boss I've done a slew of other things for her without actually being compensated for it. Her website has been live for quite some time and she is utilizing it. She has yet to pay me for the remaining balance of $1250.00.

​

She is a nightmare to work with and never pleased with anything. In each of our meetings, (and there have been many) she is just nasty to me. If she's not quipping out back handed statements and underhanded insults she tries to interrogate me about my boss's personal business dealings outside of their agreement. For the past couple of months my boss has continuously asked me to help her in various ways, and I have. I have expressed my distaste for her with the respect that I'm being asked to do additional work for someone who refuses to pay me who is also rude and condescending in each of our dealings with one another. If she were any other person than my boss's business partner I would have cut ties, shut down the website for non-payment, and proceeded with legal action to be compensated for my time, and also pursuing an additional fee for not having been paid for so long. **We do have a legally binding contract.** Again, the only reason I haven't taken steps I would normally is because it would also impact my boss.

​

Rather than go into a long drawn out rant of how she has been rude and professional to me during the course of our working relationship in which I have been VERY accommodating and patient with her- I'll just cut to the chase. A few days ago, my boss asked that I meet with her to show her how to set up her phones- something I've previously done but she just didn't want to pay attention or take in (because she doesn't respect my time or expertise).

​

I went to her facility on my own time outside of work hours. My 18 y/o daughter also works with me, and because we commute back and forth together had to tag along for the ride and time spent showing this unappreciative woman how to yet again work her phones. We'll call this woman, Fiona Fitster. Well, I get there, and we end up waiting for about 30 minutes for her to finally come over to the lunch room where we are holding this meeting, and I begin showing her the features of the phone system and how to operate it through a convenient app through her cell phone. Midway through the training session, she starts to complain how the phone system is overly complex and state that she doesn't need any of the features. I try to explain that there are only six buttons on the app and how this simplifies usage as well as provides greater functionality and she twigs the fuck out... Only thing is that this is the first time my boss gets to see up close and personal how nasty she is, and she ultimately ends up making herself look like the total bitch she is. She yells out that I'm not her boss and she's done dealing with me- in front of not only my boss but also my kid. My boss stands there in shock and I think to hell with this I'm going to eat dinner with my husband who has now been waiting for me for over an hour at a restaurant.

​

Which brings me to today. She went out and got herself a quote on a maintenance package w/ a web developer for 300/mo. She wants me to give her the website. (Remember there are two on the server). She also wants me to turn over the hosting which is through Godaddy and I don't make a thing off of it, but I would have to go in and unlock the domain for transfer. What if I don't want to give her the website? What if I just say to hell with it on the $1250 that she owes me and shut it down? Honestly, it's insulting that she's willing to pay just a web developer 3600/yr when I wasn't even charging her for all this work I did and now STILL WITH OUT PAYMENT wants the website.

​

I'm curious to know how other people would handle this situation or what they would have done months ago?!?

345,"The 50+-year-old single lady in the unit next to me has been asking to use my phone every day or every other day for the past month. Sometimes it's for 1 minute sometimes 15 minutes. It's getting really annoying. She knocked on my door around 8:30am yesterday and woke me up (I didn't answer the door though). She even came back 10 minutes later and knocked on my door again. What really irritated me is just now I caught her creepily peering through the window of my front door with her face right up against the glass and her hand blocking the glare from the sunlight. When she noticed me watching her from my fridge she stared for a few seconds and then knocked.

I've told her she needs to get a cellphone and she says she has one but something about WiFi and Bell so her phone isn't working and how she's waiting to contact Bell for some reason I don't remember. So basically she has no internet, phone, and she also doesn't drive. I'm the only way she can contact people. I've even casually mentioned there's a payphone at the public library 2 blocks away but then she starts talking about her health problems. I do believe her about her health problems. I just got my phone back after almost 20 minutes. I make a habit of looking up the phone numbers she calls just in case she's calling shady places. She called a shoppers drug mart and a taxi company. Yesterday evening she knocked on my door cause she needed to call her elder or whatever to see if she could get a ride to her Jehovah witness meeting. She could probably tell I was a little annoyed and brought up how her religion and spirituality were important to her.

My coworker tells me to just tell her ""no"" but it's not that easy for me. I get a lump in my stomach and become anxious when she knocks and I lose all the resolve I had to telling her no. I've thought of something such as ""Here, make the calls you need to make because afterwards you can't use my phone anymore. You've woken me up early in the morning, you're invading my privacy coming up to my door and looking in, and you've used almost 100 minutes of my talk time."" Confrontation isn't something I'm skilled at. I know I need to tell her no though.  I've gotten to a point where I try to sneak out of my apartment when I have to leave so she doesn't hear me and stop me to use the phone. Sometimes after using my phone she'll start talking to me then keep talking and talking and talking and talking. She is a very boring conspiratorial religious lady.

346,"Hi. I'm a 17 year old male teenager. I have a brother, who's autistic, who's a little lower in the autism spectrum. He has extreme temper tantrum issues and I don't know how to help him cope with this. My mother and father are very selfish people in the sense that they only do things based on what they feel and not what me and my brother feel. Not saying they dont love us at all, they love us entirely, but my father is leaving our family and moving back to his home country, and my brother will not stop until he's back with us, as there's this ""balance"" issue he has where all of us need to be present at all times and he has to know where we are or where we're going. He's very destructive and explosive and when provoked can cause serious harm to everyone around him, including me and himself.

They both know this but obviously they cant stay together if things arent working out and my brother telling them they all have to stay together or it's the end of the world for him won't change that.

I know if I do nothing to address these issues university will end up terribly, it will become a self fulfilling cycle of procrastination, laziness and feelings of depression.

352," 

Hi. Sorry for long and chaotic post but I have to vent somewhere to get things off my chest. For some background: I'm 22, I'm on third year at uni. I have a big problem with procrastination which gives me anxiety. I couldn't force myself to study for my last exam. I guess it's because I was afraid that even if I studied I would fail because the professor very often likes to stress students and tell them that they don't have the knowledge to pass (passing an oral exam with him depends very much on his mood). I already retake this subject (now I have to admit that I didn't study enough before). I am afraid of couple of things related to it:

* that I have to face him again and he'll get mad and because of that I'm going to lower the chances of passing this exam to the people that will try to pass it after me that day
* that I will dissapoint many people that believe in me. My mom and my friends are very supportive and think that I will pass. They (especially my mom) think I studied for this exam and didn't have the courage to tell them that I didn't. They believe that I'm smart so I shouldn't have the problem passing it but the anxiety is killing me. If I fail this exam I'm failing all year because I have to pass all exams to have bachelor's degree. I think I'm subconsciously failing this exam on purpose because I haven't finished my BA dissertation on time (my major advisor is very laid back and didn't give me hard deadline so I decided myself when to finish it and didn't make it - the closer I was to deadline the more anxiety I was having and couldn't focus on writing because I constantly was thinking that I won't make it on time). I know I shouldn't worry about what will people think. I know it's not the end of the world to repeat a year at uni. I already know that some of my smart friends will repeat year because they failed different exam and I don't judge them because shit happens. Yet I feel like the biggest failure because I know that failing tomorrow's exam will be only my fault. I could have studied more, I had all summer for it and frankly I wasted half of it worrying about it and my BA instead of enjoying vacation. What's interesting, I wasn't stressed for the last week. Don't know if it's because I was in denial or because I was stressed for so long that I'm just now numb. How do I cope with all of it?

TL;DR: I will fail tomorrow's exam because I didn't study enough which will make me fail whole year at uni. I don't know how to cope with it.",02Sep2018,1

Today she came out ranting and raving about my bushes (my lawn and landscaping are immaculate, I’m just that kind of person). I think she’s mistaking her property for mine, and I think she was wanting her side trimmed up, because she said she noticed I had the equipment to take care of it.

He's foreign (from Switzerland) so he's up late at night due to a confused sleep schedule and the other night he just layed there eating Doritos and Chinese food (like 3 am). The crunch was annoying but the sloppy wet clapping of his mouth made me gag. I was actually on the verge of vomiting, it gets to me so bad.

366,"Gather around if you will, to listen to a tale from a weary hearted soul suffering from the chaos that is my new neighbours.

The story begins only a couple of months ago; new neighbours- the couple in question consisting of a tall gangly guy not unlike Stephen Merchant, and his girlfriend, an obese skinhead sporting black lipstick. I’m very much a live and let live person, and expect the same treatment as a neighbour that I give others, a friendly nod and occasional hello. The introduction: within a few minutes this guy is rapidly talking about how he was in rehab for a gambling addiction, that he’s had over 40 jobs at the ripe age of 28, lots of red flag material. At this point the guy seems like he either has special needs, or he’s suffering from a previous drug related problem. 

Moving on to the meat and bones of my plea, we’ve had a myriad of weird problems with them. It began with small things, such as leaving a boat load of gaudy camping equipment dotting the communal garden, blocking footpaths and instantly providing us with a nice trailer park aesthetic. Both on benefits, a badly trained dog that barks constantly all day long. The girlfriend having members of her family stay (from Hungary) including two loud and bratty children stay for an entire week (these flats are one bedroom properties).

They set up a kids paddling pool right outside my flat, ignoring the expanse of private communal garden further down the pathway, they also decided to have a nice BBQ right outside which gave me a panic since I left my windows open as it was such a hot day. 

Now for the worst parts, the guy himself. I’ve caught him multiple times rooting through my ash tray looking for butts to smoke, which he proceeds to do right at my front door. I’ve also caught him looking through my blinds on one occasion. He walks around the garden at night, really late sometimes, wandering aimlessly and speaking to himself quietly. 

Lastly I enjoyed the one day of the week I had off from work this week by having the joy of listening to absolute chaos unfolding next door, hearing it over the sounds of my headphones. To sum it up for you all, essentially they are running a regular day care for a severely autistic child several times a week. Apparently the child strangled their dog which caused the dog to bite him, sending him into a meltdown they couldn’t contain. I heard screaming, thrashing, smashing and crying from the girl. They must have called the mother to come get him- they chat outside with her. Social workers down her neck, she had been leaving him at home while she worked (single mum) and the kid needed specialist care. As they were talking I could hear the kid wailing, knocking my garden chairs over and banging on my windows a few times.

I won’t lie, I’m biased and need some advice regarding this, I admit I hate my neighbours but surely this kinda stuff should seem out of order to most people right? The weird behaviour from the guy makes my partner feel a bit unsafe and we’re quite certain they should not be responsible for looking after a child with needs as great as his, especially with a defenceless pet in the vicinity.

369,"I'm an 18 year old male, and a college sophomore, (it's my first year but I have extra credits). I recently started using tinder as a way to branch out and meet new people. I ended up talking to a girl I was somewhat interested in, but she told me she had just gotten out of a relationship, and we ended up deciding to walk and talk. We ended up connecting quite a bit and ended up cuddling, making out, and watching a movie. As odd as this is for a guy, I wasn't very interested in sex, as I'd only had one experience prior and it wasn't exactly great. However my hormones were kicking in and when she asked if I wanted to  and I agreed. We ended up spending the night together and I felt very good about the experience.

However, as soon as I left, her messages changed tone significantly as if we were merely acquaintances. She had indicated that she wanted to see me again, but she also avoided all plans. She ended up going back home over the weekend and from her snapchat story it seems that she's back with her boyfriend.

Two years ago the doctors told him he had plaque on his brain, which would be helped by physical activity, but that didn't wake any motivation either. He is active in the church and several charities. Outside of that, however, he stays up all night watching movies and sleeps during the daytime. I mentioned to my mom that he sounds depressed, but she says he takes medication for that. I wouldn't be worried if that was all, but I have a three month old he still calls by the wrong name -- the wrong name being nowhere near the correct one.

380,"This isn't an unfolding situation, one that already happened but one I still don't know how I should have handled, and I daren't ask anyone else face-to-face.

I'm a 20-something gay male, and back while at university I met a guy a similar age who worked nearby. We just really hit it off; for the first year or so we were freinds, and then our relationship went further. I was with him for four years, and I loved it, those years with him were the best of my life. Not that everything was perfect all the time, he had a history of mental health and suicide attempts, the guy had a really dark childhood from what I could gather from an older brother who ran away from home with ultra-reigious parents that make Westaboro Baptists look like Tumblurites and said he was getting counselling for that. I never questioned it, he'd been through a lot of shit and if it was helping him, I was all for it. He'd never volunteer what happened during them, but I didn't push. I'd never gone through anything like that, and he'd just offer some vauge platitude about fresh starts and that being an old him. 

That was until one day I sat down and tried fixing something with his laptop with my best freind around and I had a look at his browser history. He'd been looking at pedo shit; videos of adults doing things to children. 

When he showed up hours later I asked him about it . I was calm outside, keeping a straight face trying to get him to open up about but inside...hell, even still typing this I can feel rage building up. What was worse was that he was working around children at the time. He explained that his therapy has nothing to do with him growing up, and it was to ""deal with his urges"", urges he said he'd never acted upon and saught out help himself for.  He swore he'd never done anything, but every now and then he ""slipped"", usually when I was back home or he was in a bad place. 

So what did I do? I'd told him I couldn't fix the laptop (I could have), I went back to my place and I tipped off the cops.

Long story short, they took no action against him but he no longer works with children, first because he found a better job, but last I heard he doesn't work anymore because he got some sort of disability claim. He hates my freind because he thinks she reported him, she knows I did and told me not to correct him which at the time I was grateful for because...I didn't, STILL don't even know what I should have said. Me? I went back home after term finished (We both had a lot on in my final term so not seeing as much of or sleeping with him in the meantime didn't come up, I just pretended like everything was fine, or as fine as they could be until the last week) I made up shit about moving, what I was doing...Anything to throw him off where I might be now. I broke it off, said there was another guy I liked more...He just thinks I was an ass and ditched him as soon as I finished studying.

I haven't got with someone better. Two years later and I still can't decide who I hate more, him for getting kicks out of that shit, or me. Betraying him? Snitching? I just can't stop feeling doubt, hate...And worse of all, missing him. I was crazy about him, I'd been planning to propose soon but he never found out it was me, at least none of the calls and messages I ignored suggested it. I was back around there today and driving past one of our old hang outs...I still miss him, and I hate him. Then I hate me for betraying him, then I doubt if he really ever hadn't done anything in reality, then wonder would he if given the opportunity. It makes me sound obsessive I know but even now, I want him back but don't want to be anywhere near him either. I don't know if that's something caused by his abuse, is he a victim? Ss it innate, is he just a monster? Every time I'm reminded about him or this I keep getting lost in that circle of thought. 

What would you have done reddit? I don't know what I should have done, and the doubt...Did I overreact? Me and her are still good, she told me back then I did the right thing but I know she hated him before  this and was glad to be rid of him. Sometimes I wish I'd never looked at his browser history, other times I think I dodged a bullet. But I still don't know what I should have done once pandora's box was flipped open. It was wrong for me to look, I don't know if I overreacted, and I think I should have owned up that it was me who gave the tip off...But I don- You tell me what I should have done. Please.

387,"To begin with, this is a throwaway account to mask myself from friends that frequent here (took awhile to get a name which reflects my situation lol). Therefore, im not gonna go into age/event specifics

&amp;#x200B;

i have an exceptionally great life, or so i'd like to think. Amazing supportive family (checkin in on me, even after becoming a bum), got a bunch of friends outside my circle and this one group of irreplaceable friends (inner circle, they're family really..), weird sense of humour (even able to joke about my current situation but only to my inner circle) sometimes dark hahah.  
At the moment i just dont know what am i living for, after the most hurtful event in my life, my first breakup.   


To give this a bit of structure, I've always been a flirt/player successfully, seeking others who just wanted to have ""fun""  
However she was exceptional. I stopped my flirtatious act after getting together and started to try to learn to be monogamous. (not immediately)  
During that time i was juggling between my business, pursuing my professional qualification, at the same time learning how to love for the first time. I lost myself in the process trying to juggle between all of this (or so ive been told). She drifted further and further as time went on. This went on for about 2 years.  
One fine day she sat me down and broke it to me that something was amiss and that it wasnt really working out.. She herself couldnt be specific even after me drilling into it. (led me to thinkin, she too was unsure of letting me go, it eats me up everytime i think about it)   
At the time I couldnt comprehend, i played it off like nothing happened. She stuck around, everything seemed fine just without the expectations of our future. It went on for a year or so, and she finally said she cant do this anymore  


To this day, i dont know why she left. (i know for certain it'll be easier on me if i knew she wasnt **unsure**, i would be able to let go of it a lot easier)  


After the breakup, I tried dating a few (after sifting thru my choices, not just any girl), i slowly went back to my old self fuckin around but things just arent the same.. I dont feel the rush i used to get. Im starting to feel that the bar she had set is unattainable, she was perfect.  


Its been roughly 2 years since that tragedy, shes moved on now, and im avoiding her social media at all cost because its literally unbearable (but unable to delete her). Ive lost all drive in entrepreneurship/building a career, I just cant stop blaming myself for what happened, not able to patch things up or spend the time with such busy schedule etc., and even ""what might have been had i done this and that"" (should i have dropped everything to try and save the relationship? im still struggling with this question after all this while.. i know from hindsight what i would have done though, regardless of the rate of success)  


At this very moment, ive now devolved into a ""bum"", shutdown biz, just getting by and making side income just to keep afloat, and also to feed my new addiction of drowning myself in alcohol and mj. Like a barrier to prevent me from thinkin about her, but it all comes flooding in again the next morning and the vicious cycle continues..  


I dont know what am i living for anymore (i believe i have lived a blessed life, with the highs that are so high but the lows are way too low, a matter of what one has experienced). Im this close to taking my own life, but the only thing thats stopping me are the people around me that ill be hurting  


I know the only solution is to erase that part of my life, but well that aint gon happen not in this lifetime lol  


extras: Ive actually been thinkin of how i should ***go*** in an honorable manner, or even just in a memorable fashion.. stuff like Skyking really sparks ideas, but in a more graceful way hahaha. (i guess its just the entrepreneur in me not settling for **normal** lol)    
Also been thinkin of another method like a ""going-away video"" thanking everyone around me for an amazing life and that nobody should feel its anyones fault but mine (esp my dear parents, i know they'll blame themselves), and yes im choosing the easy way out (it aint easy but thats what they always say). The video must be cinematic i must stress, maybe a crash course in videography or some'

390,"So pot is being legalized here woo! Sometime in October I believe? 

&amp;#x200B;

Both my parents are heavily christian and SUPER against pot. My sister did a lot of hard drugs (Pills) when she was around my age (17-19) and they believe the reason why she is so fucked up is because pot was her gateway drug. But the difference between her and I is she NEEDS pot. She smokes it to stay calm, to sleep, to function ""normal"". While I smoke maybe once every two weeks and ONLY at events. I smoke at a party, or if I'm at a buddies house, mainly because in my mind weed = alcohol. It's my party drug, I love smoking and going to a party. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid my mom will ask me ""Are you going to smoke pot once it becomes legalized?"" I can't lie to her so I'll have to say yes. It'll be a giant shit storm and I'm going to have to explain to her that I don't smoke pot because I need too (Like my sister) but because I rather it over alcohol.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still living under their roof, and will be until next year. So obviously when it becomes legalized I will not be smoking at home or even coming home high. I 100% cannot drive high, some say they can but I can't. So I'll tell them but of those things, but other than that I'm not sure what to say?

&amp;#x200B;

I know someone will comment ""Fuck them! You'll be legal to buy it and they can't control you!"" or some shit. But I don't want to have them being constantly pissed off at me. Hell I'd rather convince them that pot isn't as bad as they see it, maybe even get them to try some.

&amp;#x200B;

397,"So, a few months ago I moved across the USA, about 3,000 miles away from where I had been living with my partner, and near all of my closest friends and family. I moved away because the situation with my partner was becoming unhealthy for me, and I needed space. Luckily, the place I moved to (let's call it, ""Place B"") was somewhere I could live for free for a little bit, because it was with my grandmother. Things were OK at first, but started to deteriorate fast as my grandmother was really not enjoying my presence at her place, so she kicked me out after a month (not that I was doing anything wrong, but she is old and is in early stages of dementia and couldn't deal with the new presence in her house and the disturbance of her routine), and I have been sleeping on my Aunt's couch for a couple of weeks now (luckily, my Aunt also lives in Place B, so I had her as a backup). While all of this was happening, I got hired to work for an organization, which I was really excited going into. My coworkers seemed really great, and I actually have been becoming good friends with some of them. However, my boss is an abusive asshole, and after about a month of working there, I decided that this past weekend of work would be my last. 

So now, here I am, no job, sleeping on my aunt's couch, stuck in a place that I am really not too sure that I want to be in. I have made some good friends, but not good enough to convince me to stay here for any reason. I have been looking for rooms to rent in the area, but have had not much luck at all. I'm so so so confused! I'm not sure where I should be going, I'm not sure what I should be doing, all I pretty know at this point is that I want to be traveling, and not staying in any one place for too long. Most of the rooms for rent around here, I would have to sign a year lease for, so I am not sure if I am able to commit to that. Also, I am pretty low on money, but know that my parents are able to help and support me in emergency situations financially. 

Here's some things about me that might help to understand my situation: I really love creative things, making music, painting, that sort of thing. I have also always been really interested in pursuing humanitarian work, or environmental work. I am a female person in her early 20s.

I will cry over anything, and I hate it when it’s during criticism. I’m not crying because of the criticism being mean or hurtful but because I feel internally I’ve done something wrong, and wrong must always equal cry. 

I don’t like crying when talking about these topics because I appear as a person who can’t take topics seriously, when in reality I’m just super emotional. I can’t explain it, I just genuinely cry over anything. 

I really want to grow a thick skin, I’m going into college soon, and I’ve started a job in house keeping which has caused a few tears already. 

I appreciate emotion so much and I try my hardest to be kind and understanding as of why I react certain ways and how to improve, but for as long as I can remember crying has been my number one reaction to everything. 

I don’t want to become emotionally hard and cold just so I can hold my emotion in until the end of the day or something. Somewhere where it is appropriate.

I don't have any strong feelings towards my parents. I simply dislike them even though they are not terrible people. The same goes for my close siblings. I simply like my friends. I don't think that losing them would really hurt me. I've also shown a lack of empathy towards people with grief. Each time a relative of mine that i know dies, I simply don't feel sad. But I do show empathy towards people for much less. I am just a teenager though, so maybe that could be it. I just don't think i have ever felt love and if I have then i just don't know it. How is love supposed to feel?

Btw I know this is really corny and I'm sorry for my bad English(not my first language).",02Sep2018,1

409,"Every now and then I lie awake at night, deep within my own thoughts. And almost every time I get into one of these deep moods, death always seems to crop up and my mind struggles to deal with it. 

I would say that it frightens me, but ‘frightens’ is not the right word. It just makes my spine shiver whenever I think about the fact that someday I will be dead, my mind will be none existent, like it was before I was born. Like being pulled back into the dark void where I was for billions of years before my birth, I understand that I won’t experience nothingness itself, but the idea of not living anymore saddens me. 

I try to tell myself that I will become apart of the cosmos again, my body dissolving back into the universe, but the looming idea of no longer existing is still an unsettling one.

Has anyone got any advice on how to cope with it? I know that’s a big question but any insights into your preferences would be a major help. ",02Sep2018,1
410,"Okay, so I'm a 23 year old woman. When I was 19, i studied abroad in London. During that time, one weekend, a bunch of friends and I went to a club. There I met a guy and we hit it off. We were dancing and drinking and eventually, he asked if I wanted to come back to his place- I said yes, fully aware of what he was implying.
Well, we get to his place and things get hot and heavy. Right when we're about to do the deed, I asked if he had a condom. He said no. I said ""wait"", and for lack of better words, he went in anyway.
Now, to be completely honest, I was drunk and sort of froze up and went along with it until he was finished. Afterwards, I took plan B and had several weeks of fear until a pregnancy test told me I wasn't pregnant.
I've always told myself he probably didn't hear me or something and I really didnt struggle after I said ""wait"". I had an amazing time in London and that incident didn't ruin the city for me, but as I've gotten older, the whole situation seems more and more troubling. Even a few days after I didn't seem what you'd call traumatized but I never really knew how to feel about the situation.
I'm never going to see him again obviously, but at this point I'm just trying to process what happened (not to mention it was my first time). ",02Sep2018,1
411,"Hi!! I need some help! So about five years ago I started dating a guy who I absolutely fell in love with. He moved in with me, I helped him get a job, paid for his glasses because he was literally blind, taught him how to drive, helped him get a license, helped him get into college, helped him with his Visa, took him on several vacations, and so much more. When he had to go to the hospital for a week I stayed with him until he was discharged, because I didn't want to see him sick. 

Our relationship was great for a while. Eventually I got PTSD from working as a first responder and I started drinking a bit. This led me to a suicide attempt in 2016. After that I was placed in treatment for 30 days for post concussive syndrome and the suicide attempt. During this 30 day period, he didn't write or call me. When I got out of treatment he told me that he wanted to break up, but we stayed together for a bit. I was still pretty sick with PTSD and the traumatic brain injury. He eventually stopped coming home at a decent hour, and pretty much hung out with friends, but would never take me around them. 

Eventually I started to get lonely. One night I got drunk and he pushed me down and it broke my Xbox.  so I cheated(but he was hooking up with different people during this period where I thought we were only seeing each other) so I decided to break up with him.  I decided to get back together with him because I really do love him.

After we got back together we moved into an apartment together, for the first time in our own(we were 21). And I still was suffering from my traumatic brain injury and PTSD from working as a first responder. I quit getting drunk, but I would have a beer after work. One day I went home and wanted to have a beer in my apartment (that I paid most of the bills for) and he had a few of his friends over. (One who he might have been cheating on me with). Well, I wasn't drunk, I'd only had one beer. But he went into a rage and said he was moving back to his Moms house because I was too sick to be in a relationship with. Well later that night I discovered he went to that guy's house that was at my apartment earlier that evening with. 

This made me suicidal. Because he was lying. 

I finally got out of that depression, and started to return to a semi okay life. 

Well, he came back into my life. Saying he has changed. And invited me to go on a vacation with him. I agreed to go. But like 1 day before the  vacation he told me that since he was going with friends, I couldn't go because his friends wanted a friend only trip. This broke my heart and I called him out on it. And he proceeded to tell me everything I've ever done wrong in our relationship. So I told him I was sorry, and told him to have a good time with friends. I waited until after he got back from his Vacation to break up with him because I didn't want to ruin his vacation. And I broke up with him when he got back to town.

Now we're back to the beginning.. he wants me back, and says that he's changed. But he still goes out to bars and drinks often when he knows I'm early in soberity. So I told him that I can't be with someone who still goes out to bars and drinks, because that's not part of my life anymore. And he said that we aren't together right now, so I shouldn't be imposing a boundary on him. But he said he wouldn't go back to the bars. I told him that I'm not trying to be controlling, and that he should do it for himself rather than me. 

I'm not sure if I should take him back or run. Because I want to see the best in people, but at the same time, I don't want to be a doormat.

412,"In school I'm generally quite chatty and I get along well with everybody. In some of my classes I would be considered the class clown and I have no problem with attention being on me while in other classes I'm really shy and struggle to talk at all. For example, in my geography class if I'm asked to read, my whole body tenses up and I can feel my skin heating up. I can feel my neck going red and then I realise that the people sitting behind me can tell that I'm going red. This wouldn't happen in my French class though. Also, when I have to give a speech in ANY class, even the ones where I'm not why, my hands shake and my throat tightens and I get really nervous.

I can’t get over the last relationship. I feel like I’m on a Ferris wheel stuck at the bottom, if I get back on top, I almost get dumped on my ass to the bottom again.

recently I've been very sad which got me thinking about my life a lot. I figured out that I get sad very very easily and I sometimes hate life even though I know i am very blessed with an amazing life. I have great family and friends, I am considered very handsome to many ladies, I am very popular, I am at the top of my class in University, my family is not poor at all... but I am not usually happy. I feel extremely bad because I know a lot of people who have it worse than I do and I am here complaining and hating life, I feel like I should be more thankful for where I am at but I don't

I decided to do a quick google search on symptoms of depression and it left me still unsure if I have depression. I do have some symptoms that relate to depression but I don't have all of them and some of my symptoms aren't very severe.  
Here is what I have: Trouble Concentrating, Feelings of worthlessness, insomnia, irritability, loss of interests that once was pleasurable, feeling ""empty"" and occasional suicidal thoughts (however, even though i think of suicide sometimes, I never had the urge to actually attempt it so I am unsure if i am actually suicidal or if that is just me wanting attention). Although, I have only spoken to one person about my suicidal thoughts.

I always thought that these feelings were normal but now I am opening up to the idea that I might have some sort of mental illness. I am not very educated in depression, but in my opinion, I don't think my symptoms are severe enough to be diagnosed with depression. However, I feel like I do have some sort of less severe mental illness. Anybody think they can help diagnose me?",02Sep2018,119

It seems odd that row L is so much cheaper than row K. Could it be that it’s under something or next to something blocking the view or is it more likely that just happens to be where the next price break for seats is and it just happens to be a $244 price break? If it helps, this is at the UMBC event center in Baltimore MD.

418,"Okay, title is exaggeration, I understand I am not ‘stuck’ there per se but it sure feels like it.

I am 18 and work 40 hour weeks at McDonalds. I am paid every 2 weeks and I make around 900 a month.

Shifts go very fast because McDonalds is always busy and time passes quickly while working. This however means I am exhausted from the work I am put through. I have worked there since December 2017 and being a fairly long time employee I feel like some of the managers genuinely dislike me for whatever reason and give me the worst jobs. I see no reason for this since I do everything I am told and am a hardworking person; feels like I am being taken advantage of.

When I told the main manager I want to leave because I can’t handle the stress of the workplace anymore, he was open to it originally, however cast a lot nicer to me now that I brought that idea up, because he obviously doesn’t want me to leave. I am not an outgoing person and prefer to mind my own business usually, which makes me a very easy to persuade person. Manager man takes advantage of this and says he’ll give me a pay rise if I don’t leave; something I am not interested in. He is a quite a scary guy so I comply because easily persuaded. 

I understand the replies “just stand up to him and say no” as something I should definitely do, and I will most likely at some point, however looking mostly for advice adhering to other than that. 

TL;DR I work super hard at McDonalds and want to leave but I am too easily persuaded by my managers.

422,"Hello reddit
I am a 22 y/o male and my relationship with my father is getting worse as the years go by, he's in his late 60's I believe and has been disabled from a moving incident that happened over 17 years ago, I don't know all the details but I know it's a slipped disk and a quack doctor fucked him over.

Anyway I try and help him as much as I can but with him living in a old folks village it's difficult, he only gets social security, has a half functioning vehicle and has no job. He consistently comes to me to ask for help, getting food, cigarettes etc... I am the youngest of 5 kids, the oldest being mid 40s. It often falls on me to buy my dad food (which I don't mind) and cigarettes, I am not comfortable with buying my father cigarettes, though he often just pressures me to do so. 

I want to help my dad but I also want to start my life, I also can't shake the feeling like my siblings are just pushing all of this on me.

So reddit, any advice? 
Does it make me an asshole for wanting to not get my dad cigarettes or just wanting to focus on my own life?
