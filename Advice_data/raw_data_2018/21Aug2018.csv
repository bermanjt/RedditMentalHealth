0,"I've moved into my dorm room a week ago, and I was randomly chosen a roommate because I don't know anyone at my University, and as I don't have a roommate either! What can I do to make friends? Every person I have talked to has not tried to keep the conversation going. Each person in the dorm just hangs out in their room and doesn't leave. I go down ever so often to check our rec room and no one is ever in there. Everyone already seems to know people. No one wants to talk. Im also a transfer student so there is no orientation to meet people. Help me! I also have barely eating or drank in the past week I've been here. And there is no clubs or anything that I can join cause they do not start for another 2 weeks

5,"don’t know if i should cut my hair or not. i have reasoning + backstory for why i want to, so bear with me. 

i’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for about five years now. i was diagnosed with major depression and an anxiety disorder when i was eleven, and since then my mental health has gotten a lot worse, but a lot better in other ways. i used to want to take my own life, and i felt so alone because i just wanted to be normal like the other girls in my grade. they were worried about learning long division, and i was worried about whether or not i have it in me to survive another day. these feelings went on for years. they slowly started getting better, and recently i started a new medication that has completely changed me. i’m suddenly happy to be alive, and i can finish things that i start. i’m able to get out of bed in the morning. i can laugh for the sake of laughter again. 

i feel like i really left my old self behind, and while there’s some parts of myself i’ll miss, i’m excited to become this new me. i want to embrace and welcome the person i’m about to become, and change something about myself. my mind automatically goes to haircut. i’ll paste a link below; picture on the far left is how my hair looks now, and middle and far right are the haircut i’m thinking of getting, minus the bangs.

6,"I (F21) am still with my boyfriend (M21) of almost five years (highschool sweethearts). We have always had such a strong, loving relationship with minimal fights. We love and respect each other tremendously and have talked about our future together since pretty much the beginning of our relationship. However, over the summer I started drinking and going out with my girls a lot and had so much fun. My boyfriend would stay at home and play video games or watch tv and wouldn't get mad at me for going out. 
        This is where it gets bad.. I met this guy one day while we we're out during the day and as we started chatting I could feel a strong chemistry with him and I knew he could feel it too. I put it on the back burner because I knew that was inappropriate as I have a boyfriend. A few days go by and this guy follows my instagram and I follow back. I knew we were into each other but I have a boyfriend so I felt kinda guilty and didn't say anything. Fast forward and I start seeing him out more and we're both into each other but I don't cross the line..Until one night I get so drunk and we hook up. No sex but a few other things. FUCK. I cheated on my amazing boyfriend. I crossed the line and felt like absolute shit. But I couldn't stop thinking about this guy and he reached out to me and said he couldn't stop thinking about me either.. I am dying because on one hand I love my boyfriend and I'm scared of losing him but on the other hand I am into another guy and the thought of being single sounds so fun and freeing.. i don't want to live a life of 'what ifs'.. I'm so conflicted.. any advice would be so appreciated. ",21Aug2018,1

I did not do anything during the school year, which was difficult, but during the summer I have about 4 times. I feel like I have done them well in following what they believe is good for me and have only slipped up a few times. Compared to everyone else it seems like I am the only one who doesn’t, so only a couple slip-ups is good for me and I feel like I have earned it somewhat.

9,"I'm a male in my 30s.  I've been really depressed recently, and I've been addressing it by going out to have shots and wander around downtown alone, just to take in the people and scenery.  I'm only throwing in how I've been dressing in case it's relevant to getting some advice: It's been really hot out so tank top, sometimes jeans but usually shorts, running shoes, hat.  I'm one of these tall-lean guys, I work out sort of.  Anyway what's been weird is for some reason when I've been out, when I'm inside somewhere that's women and men, women will be kind of flirty sometimes but with the younger guys, I have no idea what this is but I catch them just staring at me and smiling.  If I look over and smile or say hello or give a bit of a wave they just keep staring at me and smiling, like it isn't supposed to be friendly.

13,"I’m an anxious person, so I may be overreacting, but what I want to know is how I can keep myself safe and how I can make sure he can’t find me. So here’s the story:

First of all, by affair I don’t mean that I cheated on my spouse, but this relationship was very much a secret from everyone in my life until now.

I was 15 and he was 26 when I met him online. He lived in Europe (I won’t say where to constrain details) and I in North America. It quickly turned sexual. I went to visit him when I turned 18. I learned that he and his family are VERY wealthy. In that same trip, I refused to have sex with him, but he raped me. Anyways, I continued to see him. 

When I got into college, I dated other guys and still continued to see him. He knew about the guys I dated, but the guys I dated never knew about him. He was ok with it. 

We continued to visit each other back and forth and he was all around just a creepy guy. He stayed at home all day, he didn’t have many friends. He was kind of a hermit and really creepy. Possibly a sociopath/psychopath. 

About 9 months ago, i began ignoring him. He tried to reach out to me several times writing countless long letters and emails that were half angry and half trying to get me back. Finally, I wrote him an apologetic letter listing all of the reasons why I would no longer talk to him and that I was done with him for good. He hasn’t tried to correspond with me since.

I worry that he might try to hire someone to kill me. I know that sounds crazy and I don’t have any hard evidence for it, but it just seems like something he would do. He has a ton of money, he knows the city I live in, my school, and he is just gives me the creeps.

I obviously can’t contact the police because there’s no evidence for this. So how can I keep myself safe?

14,"I'm going into my last semester of college at a school several states away from home, and this summer was the first summer that I didn't live at home since I got an apartment at the beginning of last school year. I love my apartment and where I now live, but my mental health has not been good this summer and lately I've been feeling very homesick. I get these DEEP feelings of nostalgia where I vividly remember stuff from growing up and living at home, and it's making me long for those times so much. I really want to see my family because I haven't seen them since June but due to my work schedule and school starting back up it isn't going to possible for at least another month, and even then it's only going to be for a couple days.

15,"I've been working for an organization for 18 months now and recently my job satisfaction has been dropping due to long work hours and extended business trips that have been interfering with my personal life. I've performed well at work, so well in fact, my boss chose me for the most senior position I can hold with my qualifications. The only problem is I know my job satisfaction will be even worse in the new position. 

I recently received an email about a job opening at a branch in a different city that will have better hours and fit better with what I want. I talked to my boss about my job satisfaction and requested a transfer to the different branch, however he rejected my request. His reasoning was that he believed I was the only one in the organization capable of holding the position and could not release me. 

The thing is, if I was just an average employee he would have released me no problem, but because I have performed well, he won't let me go. Now I'm in a position that I don't want with work hours that make me miserable. I'm unable to just quit my job since i'm in a contract so I see my only way of getting out of my current branch is to not perform well in my position so that my boss will let me transfer. (And yes, the other branch will take me even with poor performance at my current branch.) 

I really feel like a move will give me more satisfaction in my work and also help me regain control of my personal life. At the same time, I feel like I would be letting my current branch down and not to mention not doing my best would conflict with my belief that I should always give my full effort. 

Any advice would be much appreciated, Reddit. Thanks in advance.

17,"Hey, so I’m a 16 year old male teenager who constantly comes up with creative ideas and I’m looking for some advice as to how I should go about a clear progression to making myself successful in one/some/all of these different avenues that I want to take in life. Before you offer your help/thoughts/opinion, here are the different main concepts that I want to do.

I’ve always wanted to be a “creator”. That’s what I want to do as a career. I constantly think about it, for hours every single day. Here are the main creative avenues I’ve decided I want to try to pursue, or at least consider.

First, I want to be a music artist. I can sing fairly well, as well as understand music theory and can produce my own music using software such as FL Studio. I have spent money on gear for music making. I’ve considered getting a partner/partners to help me make music, and release it, but it is hard to find people who share my vision or are interested in working with me with the chance of pay if the music is successful.

Second, I want to be a writer. I want to write books of poetry regarding emotions and life experiences and lessons I’ve learned. I want to write TV shows and movies. I’ve considered in the past being a journalist, but I think I’ve decided I’d rather focus on writings more personal to me than news topics. But again, would love to hear your thoughts on that and if I made the right choice.

Third, I want to be an actor in my own TV shows and movies, provided I end up writing them. I always would envision myself as one of the characters, and because of that, I feel I would be best at nailing the performance of the envisioned character.

Fourth, I want to be someone who creates social media-based photography and videography. I have invested in quality camera gear, and understand photo editing as well as movie editing. I’d create comedy-based pieces and such. These would be projects done on the side of the other creative options, more so as a way to connect with my audience more on a personal level. They’d be released on all major social media sites, such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram.

Fifth, I want a podcast.

So, those are some of my creative avenues I’d like to take. The others would involve some form of success beforehand, whether that be traction or money, before I can comfortably pursue them. I was inquiring about your thoughts on what I should do. I know I am young and I have some years to figure it out, but I hate not knowing how to go about becoming a success in the industries I want to go into. It’s almost like I need a mentor or manager or someone to help me process this all better. All my creative avenues come back to the core concept that I like to tell stories, whether fiction or real to me, through different mediums. I’m very curious as to what I should, and was wondering if you had any thoughts, or potentially yourself or one of your connections who would be interested in contacting me to discuss further. I can answer any questions and discuss my thoughts. Just let me know your thoughts, but to some it up, my question is, what should a creative teenager with no major successes like me do in this situation?",21Aug2018,4
18,"Hi, bit of a complicated situation.
I have disabilities that prevent me from working, one of which is severe acid reflux that bothers me every day and has damaged my throat to the point where I can't take pills - they get stuck, and make it worse. This happened because my mom refused to change what she fed me (mostly Italian) since I developed reflux at 14, and when I finally put my foot down because I was on the verge of developing esophageal cancer she kicked me out. (I am 20 - just for flavor, my brother is 24, and ornery, and useless, and still living with her, with no signs of that changing through either party.)
I moved in with my partner in a different state, but he's now going to college (WVU) and living in a dorm. His sister goes to the same college but is renting a house nearby with 3 other people, and has lent me a spare room.
Here's the issues I'm having, nice and tidy.
1. One of the people living here does not pay rent, or anything. As far as I know, he is an able bodied individual who could pay rent. Let's call him John. My partner's sister, let's call her Susan, who's kind of in charge of the house, only allows this because she's too socially anxious to bring it up with John. However. She is making me pay rent. Probably never more than $50 a month, but I only have a couple hundred dollars to my name, and no way to get more.
2. Everyone living in this house purchases their own food, so that includes me. The issues with that are A. I have no transport but the bus system, which runs to Walmart at least B. I've never cooked much before, and have little energy for it, and even less resources, and I don't know where, if anywhere, I could keep my food - I got a box of cereal and noticed someone had been eating it D. again, no income. My partner has meal swipes he's willing to share, and I walk to his dorm just about every other day just to get all you can eat at his dorm's bistro. But I'm not supposed to be there, and we can't take food out. And E. with severe reflux, I can eat very few things. No onion, garlic, tomato, citrus, chocolate, mint, carbonation, caffeine, fried or spicy food. Heavily processed meats are also bad on the system. I've basically been living off instant ramen and saltines.
3. in addition to rent and food, I obviously need to get my throat fixed. I haven't been kicked off my mom's insurance, so that helps costs, but every medication refill (just one - a dissolving antacid) is $15 and every specialist visit is $35 - and my next step in fixing this is an endoscopy, which will be $100, but it's scheduled Four Months Out - good for money, bad for actually fixing this. So who knows how long it'll be before I'm able to, yknow, be back on my depression, pain, and anxiety meds.
4. I sent in an application for disability a couple days ago, but these things take months, and are always denied the first time, and need appeals, and tons of other shit I don't know shit about. My disabilities are also hard to ""prove"". 


I don't know how to exist right now.",21Aug2018,1

23,"This is pretty long but I'd appreciate any sort of help anyone can give me. I come from a south asian family so if someone who understands the usual dynamic can help I'd appreciate that as well:

My older sister has been the ""trouble child"" for probably 7 years. She is constantly arguing with my parents, especially my dad. They have a toxic relationship that basically doesn't exist. When they're arguing they yell and swear at each other and when they're not arguing they basically don't even speak. They're not very comfortable around each other. She argues with my mom as well but that usually doesn't happen too often because my mom is always the mediator when her and my dad are arguing so my mom tries to calm the situation down even if she is upset as well. I have developed some sort of resentment towards my sister because of this. I personally have always listened to my parents. Partly because I see how much of a hard time she gives them and partly because I just feel like it's easier on myself to just listen to them. So when she argues and talks back it frustrates me because I feel like if I can ignore it and just kiss their ass for 10 minutes to avoid a problem for everyone, why can't she? My parents have always tried to instil respect in us as I'm sure all parents do. That's no talking back, swearing, etc. to a certain extent. They obviously understand what our behaviour would be like when we are upset or arguing but there is a certain level that they will accept before it starts to get out of hand. I used to stay home all the time when I was in high school because of how bad their fights used to be. I felt bad leaving my mom alone with my sister and dad because they would fight all. the. time. I am constantly worried about what would come out of every fight. My sister has threatened to kill herself (I don't believe she is suicidal, I think it was something she used to say out of frustration when their arguments were really bad..but either way I used to hide all the pill bottles I could find and stay up all night to make sure I would hear her fall asleep), move out, etc. I know it might be common in many households for children to move out especially at her age, but because we're brown we basically don't move out until we get married. That might sound ridiculous but it's just how it is (in my personal experience). I just wish things could be normal and their fights weren't so bad. I understand it's normal to butt heads with your family and bicker here and there but there has never been a fight with them that hasn't been over the top. I'm worried about what the future looks like. I don't want to be older with a family and have parents and a sister that want nothing to do with each other. It's hard to deal with the fact that her and I have such different opinions of our parents. I'm just tired of constantly worrying about what every fight will bring &amp; what extent it would go. Does anyone have siblings like this? What came of it? What do you suggest needs to be done? I just want to hear that hopefully I'm not alone in this situation. It's such a heavy load on me when they're fighting even though it doesn't involve me. I hope that's not selfish but I just don't know what to do anymore. 

Thanks to anyone who read this. ",21Aug2018,1
24,"Hello, advice-givers! Long-time-lurker, first-time-poster, yada-yada. Sorry for the novel, there's a TL;DR at the end.

Let's get down to business:

First the basics - I live in Texas, and work as an assistant bookstore manager on the campus of a private university. Our company is contracted through the university to provide, well... a functioning bookstore. I technically work for both the university and a larger textbook retailer/wholesaler with stores and warehouses in four states, but I am officially employed by the company. Also, I'm 22; I'm not sure if that matters, but there it is anyway.

In July of this year, I was promoted from 'Customer Service Manager' to 'Assistant Bookstore Manager', which is great! The promotion also came with the benefit that I would be transitioned from an hourly wage to a salary wage (which equated to about a $600/year raise, but hey, whatever).

As we have been quickly approaching the beginning of the semester, I knew that I would be working extra hours, which is something I was and am perfectly fine doing. However, I was unsure whether my position as a salaried ABM was exempt from overtime. So I did what any legal ingenue would do: I checked up on the law.

As I said, I am a novice to the legal profession, and to my untrained and unlawyered eyes, the law seemed to me to say that my position was considered non-exempt in terms of overtime wages, but I did what I thought was a commendable thing: I asked my superiors. My manager said, and I quote, ""Uh, I don't know. Ask [Regional Manager], and maybe ask [Human Resources Contact]. One of them should know.""

I took the advice of my manager, and posed the question (via email) to my H.R. contact, and asked my regional manager in person.

My regional was annoyed when I brought it up, and kept assuring me that salary was better than hourly, and I was getting paid better, and I had benefits; all of which I agreed with, but that still didn't answer my question. I made it explicitly clear (or so I thought) that I was comfortable with salary, and just wanted to know about my position's possible overtime exemption. After the conversation had taken place, I reassured him that I was completely comfortable with my position on salary, and during the conversation my H.R. contact got back to me and explained my exemption, which I was fine with, and made clear both to the H.R. contact, and my regional manager. I left the conversation confident that I was not getting screwed on the back end, and having had my question answered.

The next day, my regional manager informed me that I would be moved back to hourly. That was it. No, ""Is that okay with you?"", no ""We were thinking-"". None of that. Just ""We're moving you back to hourly, effective immediately.""

Now, against my better nature, I let it go. I was confused, obviously, but just felt it better to leave it alone.

Then today, my regional reinforms me of my wage-change. And, while I realize that curiosity very often kills the cat, I asked if there was any reason. I was told, curtly, that ""[Company Name] is an at-will employer, and we can do that."" Fine, sure. I'm not disputing that. I am wondering why. ""Well, whenever someone starts looking into the laws, that can be a problem."" Shouldn't be, but okay. Go on... ""I've only ever had one other person not understand the benefits of salary, but you seemed like you didn't like it."" I was pretty sure that I had been clear about my stance with salary, just not clear on overtime exemption, but okay. Go on... ""Look, there's nothing more to talk about here."" Okay, sorry I asked. ""Fine. But if you're upset with this, you can leave. We can do this without you. You aren't necessary.""

Okay then.

""The plan is to get to a point where you only work a few days a week anyway.""

LOLwut.jpg

First I've heard of this plan.

To recap:

In the space of 120 hours, my single question about overtime exemption got me basically demoted, and my hours, I have since been assured, will be getting cut after our busiest times.

Hence my question: Is this considered employer discrimination?

What are my options?

This is my only income while my wife is in school full-time, and so I've begun looking for something else, but is there anything I can do in the meantime?

Please help.

TL;DR: I asked about my overtime exemption at work. My question got me demoted, and my hours cut. What do I do?",21Aug2018,1

I could probably restore the rough draft of the APUSH paper enough to where it’s almost how the final draft (which I don’t have access to) was from memory, but I’m not sure if that would be ok with Princeton if they ever found out. Also, I’m not taking any english or history classes this semester (well, I’m taking econ, but I don’t really think that counts) so I don’t think that I can really have a new essay to submit before the application deadline. What should I do? Should I explain my problem on the application and not submit a paper, or should I edit and submit the APUSH paper?",21Aug2018,2
31,"My older brother is 20 and just moved back in with my parents and I after his girlfriend kicked him out of her apartment. He’s always had bad anger issues and takes everything out on me. He gets extremely violent and punches walls, threatens to hit me and yells in my face over the smallest things like “turning on the ac because he was cold.” He dropped out of high school a few years ago, He doesn’t have a job, and does drugs all day. He even asks my dad for money to pay for haircuts and clothes. A few months ago police came by looking for him saying they had him on camera shoplifting thousands of dollars worth of clothes from a store and they couldn’t find him, now I’m wondering if I should report him or something.

33,"I am in my third year of mechanical engineering degree. I love everything about engineering. All of my classes are challenging in a good way and I honestly couldn’t see myself doing anything else. However, I’m wondering if having a passion for something is enough. 

I’m worried about getting a job once I’m out of school. This is due to the fact that I’ve applied many times for internships and haven’t been able to get one. I feel that I’m lacking in something and everyone can see it but no one will tell me. 

I’ve brought this concern up to many of my friends and family and they have all told me “you’ll get a job don’t worry”, but I do worry. 

This is what I need advice on: should you go into a field just because you have an interest or a passion in it? Should I instead go into some other field where I could easily get a job and not feel like a failure? ",21Aug2018,1

So a bit of background here. I am 23 years old and have only been working for a year and a half. I have managed to have saved just over $40,000 in the last year and a half of working. Whilst I was studying at university all my friends were working for their holidays so I never got to really travel then. I am currently planning a trip to Africa for July next year and it will cost around 12k for just over a month (Contiki tour + Kilimanjaro climb and Safari).

35,"   At my school we all have chromebooks that were given to us at the start of the year. At first we were all excited to hear this, until the truth came out... On every Chromebook is an extension called ""Securly."" Let me tell you about Securly. Imagine having an 80 year old Christian nun who thinks the internet is evil standing behind you, watching you, ready to delete all your tabs if she sees something she doesn't like. Now imagine if there were 10 nuns. That's what Securly is.

    It blocks everything. All games, personal email, Reddit, and even half of all educational websites! Apparently history itself has enough violence to get censored by Securly, because I can't research the American civil war on this thing. And that's not the worst part. It's a MAJOR violation of privacy. Everything you do, everything you search, and I mean everything, is sent to the school and your parents' email every week. *This is a personal computer by the way. Securly is active even when I'm at home.*

   Can anyone help me get fix this? I can't change any settings, delete Securly, access inspect element, or even download a vpn. What. Should I do?",21Aug2018,0
36,"Sorry long post! Tl;dr: my boss hasn’t told me I don’t have a job anymore but is ignoring me and has posted up a job ad for my position. What do I do? 

I’m a massage therapist that works for myself (technically) but I get my clients through my ‘boss’. I’m on call mostly, so if a client walks in or whatever I’m expected to take the client and drop what I’m doing and go to work. I made it clear that I won’t be able to take every client and we came to an agreement that I take what I can, no stress. I’ve been doing this job for over a year now. 

Last weekend I was violently ill with gastro and was out for the count. She messaged me the morning I first got sick asking if I can work that day and I told her no. She messaged me the next day asking how I was and I told her I was still ill. It took me about a week to get over. 

I went into the shop yesterday just to say hey and see what was going on with clients and whatnot and she completely brushed me off. Like said she was busy and kind of cut the conversation short and started talking to the receptionist. I was pretty shocked but thought she was just busy and was going to touch base with her later. 

My husband just found and ad on Facebook of her looking for a new massage therapist. The ad was placed on the second day I was sick. 

I feel like she was just going to ignore me and hope I go away with no word that she no longer wants me as an employee. 

I’m so shocked because we were friends too. I have been a little less reliable the last months since my husband had lost his license and needed me to drive him to/from work on weekdays and I couldn’t work fridays but she kept saying it’s fine and to not stress. 

Now she’s completely dogged me. It’s worse than being fired over text because she couldn’t even let me know I don’t have a job anymore. 

I’m a passive person, so I think she thought I’d just accept it and move on without a peep from me but it’s just plain rude. 

I want to say something to her, to get the record straight. She still hasn’t told me I don’t have a job. How should I go about this? We live in a small tourist town where all the locals know each other so I can’t burn bridges or anything like that but I want to stand up for myself. I don’t want to be a push over like she thinks I am. 

Where do I go from here?? ",21Aug2018,1

38,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. We have been living with each other essentially from the very beginning and currently I'm sitting in the apartment that we signed a lease for on March 19th this year. On Monday August 13th he confided in me that a couple of days ago he realized he had a ""work crush"" on someone but he didn't think anything of it and we moved on. 2 nights later I was watching t.v. in bed and he paused the t.v. and told me there was more. He then explained his somewhat dark past about middle school. He said he was really lonely and that he had some dark thoughts about himself and the people around him. He said that after some time he and his friend (guy) started experimenting and that was his first and only sexual experience before me. He eventually stopped it and moved on but deep down he still felt depressed. Then he said the last time they ever did anything was roughly 2-3 years into the relationship, so he cheated on me. I said I could forgive him for that and I still believe that I could but he said he needed some time to figure himself out so we separated for a couple of days. 2 nights ago he said he was ready to talk and said we need to break up officially so that he can work on himself wholeheartedly. He said that if we tried to go back to the way things were he truly believes he won't be in the relationship fully and that he'll cheat on me again. He said he doesn't believe he loves me or ever loved me the same way/amount I love him. If a month from now he starts feeling better about himself enough to start talking again we may do just that, but if he never feels good enough, we're going to permanently breakup. I have no place to go except for a couple of couches and we're going to see if we can break the lease tomorrow.

39,"I am 21 and recently moved interstate due to mental issue to live with my father and sibling. 

My dad owns a takeaway store and for 3 months I have been helping out at least 5 times a week at the shop doing lots of prep work and occasional cooking/cleaning. I come in for mostly 4 hours a day but can extend beyond that. 

At home I don't pay board, but I would be willing and want to pay board and utilities if my dad would pay me. Even $20 a day or something just so at the end of the week I can be proud and say  I earned something. He refuses to pay me and today kicked me out of the shop for asking to be paid. 

His excuse is that he doesn't pay my sibling who works every day from 10am till late at night. Which I also think is awful. But then he says he doesn't pay himself and just takes money for himself from the shop he runs. 

I don't expect to be paid what he pays the staff, but the fact that he will take out my sibling and spend hundreds every second night at bars or pokies yet thinks that paying me $20 a day is far too much and selfish of me makes me hate the store and working there. Yet if I don't work I am lazy and even more selfish.

40,"Basically, I got a call this morning from my brother at around 830 AM. Figured something was wrong, as he would never call me that early on a work day. I ask what's up, and he sort of chokes up and says he has something he wants to get off his chest, then continues to say that he cheated on his wife while away on a trip outside the country. he kept saying he was ashamed and couldn't look himself in the mirror, but was very fixed on worrying about having HIV or an STD. I found this strange, as it seemed he focused more on this than the aspects that were very apparent and obvious--potentially ruining a marriage, especially a marriage with a child, how to approach his wife (or not to), etc. No one else in the world knows, and I have been spending all day processing how this happened. I saw it coming from a mile away to be honest, as he's always had problems cheating on partners and has slept with hundreds of women over his life--I knew that issue wouldn't stop once he was married. I asked him why he thinks he's done this, and he thinks the problem is drinking. He reasons that he only makes these bad decisions when drunk. While I get that alcohol doesn't help decision making, that's clearly not the root of the problem. I'm left wondering what the root is, and how it might be helped. He's my brother, and I want him to do well and be happy.

Part of the problem, I think, might be his dad (we're actually half brothers and don't share a dad but i just call him my brother). His dad, while incredibly present and supportive in his endeavors, was also emotionally abusive. Had a terrible temper and tendency to scream at my brother and say awful things to him at times. I wonder if his current actions are an attempt to feel a competence and worthiness that his dad didn't give him.

At the same time, he has always been the kind of person who seems to believe the rules don't apply to him. He's been suspended from college, gotten in trouble at a job, etc. for breaking rules in really dumb ways. In short, I'm really worried about him and I don't think this is the right place to post this but just looking for support and potentially insight. Feel free to ask more questions about the situation and my brother to give better insight.",21Aug2018,1

42,"So I’m a junior in college this year. I finally moved in with my best friend, and a couple other friends in our group. I enjoy that a lot but they always want to go out and party or throw parties at our apartment. Which in itself isn’t a big deal, I’m not bothered by that personally. The issue for me is that when they want to go out to these things, or have them here, I’m kind of expected to go and parties honestly freak me out. The music blaring in the back, everybody talking to everybody, it’s just not my vibe. I had really bad social anxiety when I was younger so I’m guessing this is factoring into this, or maybe just introversion.

I’m scared I’ll lose my friends if I say I don’t want to participate. If they want to have a chill night where it’s just a smaller group of us and we all hang and get to know each other, I’d be totally down. But the party thing just fucks with me. I’ve tried so many times but it usually ends up with me sitting there anxiously, trying hard to be able to barely hear what others are saying.

This isn’t to say I don’t want to be around people or meet new people. I need friends and social interaction. I don’t want to be alone. But I can’t be a party person either. I feel like I’m stuck in a weird world and I just want to feel like I belong. But I don’t know how to do that. I try my best but I can’t enjoy parties like my friends do, but I don’t want to spend my nights alone. Any advice on how to make this work?

43,"I could use some advice on getting a decent, stable job for once in my life.

A little back story.

I’m in my early twenties, dropped out of high school at 17 but got my GED at 19, I’m a college student, I live in the Western United States, and I’m still living at home.

I didn’t get my first job until I was 18. It was as a customer service rep for a Wal-Mart down the street. I stayed there for about a year before I had enough of feeling like a dropout going nowhere so I quit and spent the better part of the spring studying for my GED. 

After getting my diploma and starting my first semester of college I got a job at a political firm a few blocks away from campus (I’m a Poly Sci major so it seemed like a good opportunity to get my foot in the door.) 

I worked there for almost three years working on different political campaigns in local and state politics but they had a management shakeup which did not go over very well.

Myself, as well as my co-workers, were swindled out of over $2,000 each. Over the course of three months I only made $350. 

Management said it would all sort itself out eventually and that we would be receiving our usual payment in a few months.

This was a huge red light for me so I resigned to find more stable work.

It’s been three months of applying for jobs and I haven’t received any call backs whatsoever.

I don’t know why, and it’s starting to get financially stressful.

44,"When i (male) was 14 i was abused by a family friend who was 17/18 at the time i believe, and our families were very close, this sexual abuse went on for about a year and a half and i never fought back and even pretended to go along with it because i was afraid at times, the only way i could get him to stop (for maybe 5 seconds max) is to say something like ""my dads right there"" as if i was trying to protect him. sometimes i did beg him not to do certain things to me, we had to share beds when we slept over and hed say he was gonna do things to me in my sleep and i wouldnt be able to stop him, such as putting his dick in my ear/butt etc. Or walking in the mall and hed grab my ass and put his fingers in my ass. I dont know what hes done to me while i slept, he said things about cumming on my face one night. And i cant tell family because it would cause so much fucking disaster... im gonna be 22 soon and i think about it more and more and its to the point where it makes me really want to cry, largely due to the fact that i was so fucking miserably pathetically helpless that i actually pretended to 'protect' him by saying things like ""your dad/my dad is right there"" and i feel so fucking ashamed of how fucking weak i was and ofcourse if someone else told me this i would tell them ""dont be ashamed its not your fault you werent weak"" and i believe that for other kids but i cant accept it for myself i think because of how embarressed i feel? I just really need help because i feel like its played a big role in influencing my sexuality, i became very very sexually deviant and a year after that i molested someone myself and it feels like a big fucking cycle. Difference is i got caught thank god and was sent to a program for 2 years when i was 16.

We clicked and became pretty good friends, telling each other secrets we’ve told no one, our greatest fears and insecurities, what we wanted to do, asked each other about everything. Eventually, we tried dating but about 3 months in, we thought what other kids at our school would think since we never really heard of two pairs of siblings dating each other and broke it off. We talked after still but after breaking her phone we could only really talk to each other in person once in a while. Fast forward a year later after relationships with others didn’t work out, here we are talking more and more again like we use to. I could sort of tell when she had feelings for me before. I feel like she does again, but this time I feel like the feelings are stronger, and I think i’m starting to like her like that again.

46,"I already asked this on malehairadvice but only 1 person replied, however I need multiple answers.

So hey there. I'm really really scared, from the ages 16-17 I had really cool funky hairstyles and my hair was really thick. I almost feel like it was yesterday. Now my hair is thinner and when I brush my hair I lost bits of hair (not a whole patch just like 5 or 6, especially when I apply pomade). I'm just terrified in going bald. I don't want to literally i would kill myself. So basically I don't think my lifestyle has changed drastically. At 16-17 I barely excersized or play sports, I just skateboarded more than now. (I hit the gym at 16 tho for only 2 months for the summer though). My eating habits were wayy better at 16-17 as I ate more fruits and veggies. That's only the difference in my 16-17 age than 18. In high school I was pretty stressed and I heard that's a cause of hair loss. Who doesn;t get stressed for exams though??? Now as a high school graduate im going to university and now i feel like im not even ready physically.

Now, here are things that I need to mention before you guys make a conclusion:

I went to the doctors today for a physical checkup and everything was pretty normal. As in height, blood pressure, heart beat, breathing, etc. But i addressed the hair issue and she said I'm def getting thinner hair, but I will need a blood test to see if im low on anything like hormones then she will give me a treatment or the actual cause.

Now here are things that I do that may be important to mention: - I masturbate at least once a day. I say this because I heard they have a negative impact on your health and hair - I usually sleep from 1am-11am. This is horrible I know but im trying to change this habit. - barely go outside or excersize... - I barely eat too to be honest, like I have a good breakfast but everything goes downhill from there. Its just there's like nothing to eat here. Im very picky though, which is kinda why I just don't eat - I use a hairbrush that's 2 years old. (The time when my hair was thick and awesome). I used to get compliments and shi*. I really need it back. - I use gel or pomade but I just got a fresh cut so im not applying that anytime soon.

ALSO: I dont take drugs, or smoke, or drink alcohol.

Any help is appreciated!! Please im just very scared :(

Edit: My family has no background on balding at an early age. Honestly I just stare into my computer screen and it's like im in a whole nother realm where I forget about food and water. I also drink like 5-6 glasses of water everyday. But sometimes I drink a lot when Im eating with food

48,"I’m on mobile posting this so sorry for any bad... things.

So basically I have a whole group of internet buddies and pals to talk to, play games with, etc. They’re the brutally honest type. No beating around the bush, no sugaring up a problem. The problem came when I vented to them about how much my dad yelled at me and even got a wee personal about how he can treat me like shit. 


Sooner or later I tell them why I get booted off the computer so much; my dad streams on twitch. He got banned for reasons I’ll explain soon but I’m not telling reddit his username for his safety. What happened was he started streaming really late at night, usually not a huge deal but one of the internet people were awake. He started going on and on about how it’s wrong to shit on me the way he does. Honestly compared to what he told me and my family it’s nothing. All he said was to stop making me want to die and that. Again, brutally honest. I didn’t want him to do this btw. 


At about 3:00 am I am awaken by a drunken father taking my phone and telling me to come to his room. To summarize his rant he said that a bunch of people told him to kill himself and sent him death threats. Which were COMPLETE. LIES. And I know this because the friend who did it sent me his stream and the full chat. 

My dad lied about receiving death threats.
He fucking tore me up like an animal. I was informed that my world could be fucked up by him. And that’d he kill every person who told him off. (He threatened to kill my best friend, which is why he got banned.) Right now things are normal but I’m not sure he’s found out he got banned and I’m worried I’ll get shit on for it.
Also I might be isolated from all of my friends forever but that’s if the asshole levels reach maximum.

Also, mobile. Sorry format. 

After working as a professor at a University for almost 10 years I got fired. I spend the next 3 years jobless, working as a photographer just to barely make ends meet. 
I had 100k savings. I used that for my stupid idea: a PhD in other countries. This happened one year after being fired. Moved to another country. Became a PhD candidate. This whole process cost me 50k (house, appliances, everything from scratch. I only had bag with my clothes. ) things don't work out and i move back.

Resume photography gigs again. 

Decide to go a Specialization course in my field. Another year jobless. But finish specialization. 

2 months after that, the same uni calls me for an interview. Now I've been working as a professor, again for over 1 year. 
Money is... decent . But I'm super happy with my new job. Other professors are nice. Boss is really funny but is serious when needed, super correct and makes us aim for perfection. 


Now, the assistance part:

I have my own clinic (aesthetic procedures. Dermaroller, botox, fillers, peelings, etc). I own the place,but I don't have money to paint, and make the furniture, and electric wiring, and to buy a lot of stuff. 

My question is:
Should I get a 15.000 loan from a bank? I'd have to pay them  Back around 45 k. With this, I can get my clinic running in 3 months. I'll be in debt, and I have no assurance that I will have patients.

Or should I only use whatever I can save from my teaching salary to do what I need to do in my clinic,one thing at a time. In that option it would be ready by April 2019. No debts.

There are a lot of courses I want to do and I don't do them because they are super expensive. My salary as a professor is good, but it varies (if I teach 1, 2, 3 or 4 classes per month. Its their decision, not mine. But usually I teach 3or4) and this money is not enough to pay for courses and workshops or deposit into a savings account. That's why I thought of a loan. Maybe it would allow me to have a second source of income faster than the other option. ",21Aug2018,1

54,"A little background first. My now husband(25) and I(24) started dating my freshman year of college but had known each other for three years prior. I knew within three months of dating that he’d be the guy I marry. This outraged my parents. My mom and sister, who are three years older, convinced me to break up with him because I should not be in such a serious relationship so young. My mom told me since my husband is a type 1 diabetic he isn’t worth all the medical bills we will have and he is going to die so young I could do better. They also said because he had worked a fast food job through high school and half of college that he wouldn’t ever be able to support me and I would have to constantly work to pay the bills. When I introduce my now husband to my parents they ignored him for the first year of our relationship, like literally would talk to everyone else in the room but pretended he did not exist. We broke up for a while because it seemed easier than constantly having my family give me so much shit but ended up reconnecting. 
After college we got engaged and my parents again were outraged. My mom again tried postpone the marriage by using 3 arguments: 1. I didn’t have a Masters degree yet. I had just got my Bachelors and was 22 at the time. 2. My sister wasn’t married yet and it would be hard for her if her baby sister gets married first. At the time my sister was single and had no intentions of ever getting married. 3. She wouldn’t pay for the wedding if I didn’t wait for a more convenient time for her and my dad. My fiancée and I ended up paying for as much as we could (mainly venue and the dress) before my parents realized we were serious about getting married on our own timeline. We ended up getting married with minimal hiccups from my family. 
Fast forward to earlier this year, January 2018. My husband and I announced to my parents that we were pregnant. We had been trying to get pregnant for almost 5 months. Literally the first thing they said was “oops that’s an expensive mistake!” The next thing they said was “well you better tell your sister asap.” Shortly after all this I had a miscarriage. My mom tried to be there for me but isn’t great with showing empathy towards me. My sister told me “You better get used to it because it probably won’t be your last miscarriage. Plus you aren’t special anyways because everyone has miscarriages.” When I talked to my mom about it she said my sister just didn’t know what to say and probably didn’t mean it like it sounds. 
Fast forward to now. My husband and I are pregnant again! We waited to tell my family until the first sono came back with good news. My family again reacted with “congratulations” in the form of statements like better sleep while you can you won’t when the baby comes and you better teach your dogs to behave or they will hurt your baby. We accepted this attitude from them as it’s pretty normal to us by now. But things have been getting worse every week. My sister is mad I can’t tell her the exact week she should come visit after the baby comes. Like I have control of exactly when the baby arrives. I told her to come the last week of January as my due date is 1/12 but my sister didn’t like those instructions. My mom was adamant she plan a gender reveal “because a baby shower is too much work and she hates planning dumb games”. So I told her we’ll find out the gender on August 29th and should plan the gender reveal for that weekend. My sister lives two states away and told me it’s inconvenient for her to travel that weekend for the gender reveal so I need to wait till September 21st to tell all my friends and family. Unsurprisingly my mom took her side. My mother is now giving me the silent treatment because My husband and I won’t wait to find out the gender of our child until a better more convenient time for my sister. My sister told me because I won’t wait to find out the gender she isn’t going to spend the $200 on the gift she was planning to buy, that I’m too childish to understand what it means to be a mom, that I am not being inclusive to her, and it’s hurtful because she isn’t going to ever have kids she wants to experience everything in my pregnancy. My mom told me I’m selfish, and hateful towards my sister. She told me if I continue on this path she will no longer help me with crafts around my house and will cut contact with me. 
I mainly want to know what you all think I should do moving forward. Everything I’ve done to resolve conflicts with them in the past always ends with me being the bad guy no matter what. I’m just trying to do what’s best for my husband and I’s growing family. 

TL;DR My family constantly tries to talk me out of my relationship with my now spouse by telling me it isn’t fair to my older sister. They are now trying to make my pregnancy all about my sister and what works best for her. ",21Aug2018,1

56,"So.. i have been unable to hold a job due to physical and mental health stuff. I had a very rough childhood with various forms of neglect and abuse involved with my parents..  hard catching up. Bipolar , severe generalized social anxiety, adhd.. lots of issues with my physical health. Couldn't hold normal jobs.. still can't. I completely break down to the point of not remembering my own name. Some days its difficult to care for myself at all. I've been forced to rely on family (grandparents in this case) . Never had any independence or such. Tried meds and therapy to no success .So yea, I'm scared.. very. At the end of the day i have to get by and live somehow after all.  Um, I've found some ways to earn an income online recently for now and it's much better this way. I've been saving everything I can for a couple months now .  Slowly helping to pay some of my own stuff.. But I still can barely go out on my own for a simple trip to a gas station or the bank much less everything else. Eventually I'm going to have to learn how to do stuff. Like.. everything. To name a few.. Bill paying , laundry, taxes, budgets, moving out, doing stuff like utilities and shopping is involved their amongst tons of other stuff involved in living on my own or with others , socially interactions with people in basic situations.. I just don't have the life experience. And with the anxiety on top it's difficult to be willing to be fail and feel like a man child in order to achieve it at this point.  So yea I have made changes. I've been forcing myself to go out.. I've been working out (although at home.not a gym) , dieting.. working on my pc, taking online courses and classes to open options for myself in the future, looking for accommodating jobs or other opportunities that could fit my needs which is so far not possible.  .. I know that I need to get out of here where i get a healthy mix of being looked down on, controlled , feeling like a burden and equally as guilty about my reliance and being supported.    ..  I'm thankful don't get me wrong. .. it's complicated. i have no friends, or anything like that.  I think I've gotten so accustomed to not having my own opinions and being very controlled in.my  actions and choices and daily life that I have no ability to be decisive , make decisions for.myself or anything any more at this point.  All I have is being terrified about everything and not trusting myself at all.  Getting back to the point.. I.need advice on what I could do to start preparing myself to move forward i guess.

My sister just doesn’t want to communicate with me she avoids me whenever I go near her around the house (for reference she’s a year younger and we are usually very close) she also just shows no interest in any conversation I start and blantly tells me to leave the room she’s in or walks away and tells me she just doesn’t want to talk to me.

Outside family is no help as everyone backs away from responsibility (grandma is terminal with cancer and everyone is pushing everything on my mom, and she feels guilty for not being able to).

All this is giving them a bunch of stress and anxiety. My parents are very traditional, and tend not to talk about their problems outside of the family, and are so focused on what others would think about them.

My mom basically broken down crying talking to me about how she can't seem to do anything anymore and how she's expected to do all these things.

72,"I don’t know if this will get noticed lol and I didn’t know what r/ to put it in so whatever, I placed it here. Basically, I’m thinking about making a visual novel. 

I kinda have an idea on how the game’s gonna work? Like, the player will decide their gender, then what their sexuality is(gay, lesbian, bi) But ultimately the character’s personality will be the same. 

And I don’t want it to be a game where the player only makes like one or two decisions, but then I don’t want the choices to be so... forced?

Like you know those decisions where it’s either 
- “omg you are my wife/husband, please love me”
- “fuck you I hope your children die in a fire with you in it”

Lol I know that’s an exaggeration, but you get me? I was thinking maybe the player would get a variety of choices that varies based on the chosen personality, like a shy player would choose the timid options, or the flirty player would choose the more bold options? But they would have like 4-5 choices to choose from, because I’m all about that variety 👌 

However, those choices are like the... normal choices? Like they don’t affect the story TOO much. Like, your set personality appears more frequently. Let’s say you pick the timid options, then later on in the game your character acts more timid without having to pick choices, and so on. Of course, you’d still be able to pick certain dialogue choices. 

Butttt I kinda wanna add a bad ending/route?I’m not trying to give to much away since this actually might become a game lol but I want some decisions to make an impact at the end?

I saw this post on tumblr about some guy saying that it would be cool if visual novels didn’t tell you about the impact your choices had, and left it up to the player to be “good” and whatnot. For example, lets say the player was comforting their friend. They would have two options. 
- “Hey, I’m sorry that happened to you. You can talk to me anytime, alright?” [Truth]
- “Hey, I’m sorry that happened to you. You can talk to me anytime, alright?” [Lie]

And when I saw that it legit BLEW my mind! So I rlly wanna add it in my game. The result is the same, the character in that instance will thank the player, but at the end the characters the player grew attached to will realize that the player is nothing but a manipulative, cold hearted monster? 

So... let me know what you think! Lol I’m very interested to here some more visual novel ideas, or just some advice on my game! If you made it all the way, you sir(or ma’m) get a gold star 🌟 ",21Aug2018,1

Hi all, I have been having an issue with my best friend for a time now. She is depressed, and she won't seek help for it. Therapy quite literally saved my life a few years back, and I've tried talking to her about it but she is adament on not going. She has excruciatingly low self esteem, her home life isn't the best, and her mom just got diagnosed with breast cancer.  She's spiraling, and I can see it even if she can't. 

I want to let her know that I love her, and I'm here for her, but the problem is that I don't know how to tell her that. 

She is very touch-adverse, and I'm still learning how to communicate effectively enough that I can just come out and say, ""hey. I love you and touching you makes me feel loved and wanted."" Especially since I know it is something she doesn't want. 

I show my love with physical affection, and I have no clue how else to show her that I care. Actually talking to her is obviously something important, and I do tell her I love her! But she always turns it back around to be self-deprecating, and it hurts me to see her go through the same shit I did. 

I just want her to be okay again, and I don't know how to help her. I feel so helpless not doing anything, but she doesn't want help and there's nothing I can do to change her mind on that. ",21Aug2018,1
79,"I have a lot of dreams about being at school. Some I'm running up and down the stairs trying not to get caught out of class when there are no other students around, others I'm becoming friends with the girls who bullied me, or I'm already friends with them and trying not to screw up that friendship - but in neither I'm happy. 


I always feel out of place, different to everyone else, anxious, nervous and guilty. Sometimes I wake up and feel like it was a happy dream, I enjoyed being friends with those girls, for example, but on reflection even when I'm 'happy' in those dreams there's always the underlying feelings of anxiety etc. that I mentioned earlier. 


I left secondary school 8 years ago and I haven't seen those girls since then except crossing paths accidently a couple of times - we didn't speak when we saw each other and those feelings all came flooding in and rushing back but I just tried to carry out the rest of my day each time.


Sometimes I dream that I'm in primary/middle school again I'm always wandering the coridoors. 
Sometimes I'm trying to escape and I'm terrified, or I'm walking to or from school and I'm terrified and potentially getting lost, other times I've killed someone and I don't remember doing it and I'm trying to run to or from school because of that.
These dreams are absolutely haunting me, I hate going to sleep and spending the night feeling awful or thinking about girls I'd rather forget.


Does anyone dream about anything similar? Or have anything to say that they think might be helpful? I just don't want to be transported back 10 years in a horrible fashion every time I go to sleep.

80,"I'm  debating asking this one girl  at my church out. To give a little back  story I am 20 years old and had  three relationships. All of them the  girl asked me out and all of them  ended up being so bad that I  briefly(for a year and a half) gave up  women because I believed modern  society had made them shit. But, after  seeing many of my friends get  into relationships and never have to deal  with near the level of  bullshit I had to deal with, I realized the  saying, ""if everything  smells like shit, check your shoe"" applied here. I  had always had low  confidence, I honestly can't see my life as being  worth anything. I  feel this is more of a defense mechanism so I can  never really fix  anything in my life and can wallow in depression living  a life I don't  want to live instead of getting off my ass and doing  something that  requires effort. One of the reasons I broke up with my  third girlfriend  because of this, because I wanted to fix myself, and a  year and a half  later I have realized thats an arbitrary goal that will  constantly get  moved and never actually met and part of my problem is  the fact I am  really lonely and don't have an active social life outside  of the  computer.

The only thing that has changed  is I am dressing better, sleeping better, changed my hair cut, improved  personal hygiene, and got a better job. Not much else has changed since  then.

Back to the girl in question, shes  the daughter of the church's  pastor and is 17. I have known her for a  couple years and because when I  first met her(when I was 16) I was  addicted to opioids and a total mess  and didn't even comprehend women  and I am sure she has watched me clean  myself up a lot. But I didn't  speak to her tell about a month ago when I  helped her brother build his  first PC. It wasn't a memorable  conversation, she was awkward and shy  is the best way I can put her, but  it was kinda cute if I am going to  be honest. Whenever I see her at  church I want to talk to her some more  and get to know her but shes  always busy with a bunch of things since  she helps her dad run the place  that I don't have much of a chance to  talk a lot. I'm debating asking  her out to something, but I have no  idea to what, and I have also never  asked out a girl before. I also  don't know if its a good idea since my  family goes to this church too  and if this doesn't work out, its going  to be like dating a coworker  and just fuck with a lot of things there.

What  do you all think? Do you have any first date advice? Should I do  this,  period? Should I somehow fix my low self worth before I even think  about  dating?",21Aug2018,2
81,"My last day before going to college I was hanging out with my friends who often drink and smoke (they are older). I never joined in because I just didn't want to. I ended up deciding I wanted my first drink to be with my friends instead of with a bunch of shit head 18 year olds I'd meet at college.

I had a mikes hard lemonade, and everyone went outside to smoke except for me and one other guy who we'll call Jason. He is a known alcoholic, he likes shots, and wanted to be the one to give me my first one. There was no real peer pressure as I knew he would offer it and I already decided I'd do a little one. The taste was heavily masked by flavoring so it wasn't bad. I had like a third of a real shot, and so did he. It was nice and I liked it. He was eager to hear what I thought and I told him the feeling was cool. He was happy with this response and went on to tell me the reasons he likes to drink, and I understood. Whenever he had talked about drinking before I just kind of laughed along, but I was starting to understand. It scared me that I understood, though, because Jason does have a problem. (Don't get me wrong, I know I'm not experienced at all, that I'm a babe in the woods, and that I don't truly get anything, but I got my first idea) The warm feeling was just super nice. I had another baby shot a couple hours later and (of course) the same warm feeling appeared. In total I had about a half a real shot and two beers over about 4 hours. I was very far from drunk. (I didn't drive home, don't worry)

It's been about four days and I've thought of having another shot about once an hour. It sounds really stupid putting it down concretely. I can't wait to go home again so I can drink with them again. I know there are a lot of things in play here, a large thing being it was the last thing I did before leaving to go to school a few states away. I also know I'm great at overthinking things.

My question is, is it normal to think so frequently about drinking again after just once? I have friends and relatives who are alcoholics and I want to avoid that path. I can't wait for a party to happen so I can have another drink. As I said, I feel silly putting this out there, I'm terrified of my friends seeing this and figuring out who I am, and I wouldn't be surprised if this is all fucking normal. I'm just scared I feel mildly empty without the warm feeling after a shot, and I haven't even had a fucking full sized shot.

TL;DR

I drank for the first time a few days ago and I can't stop thinking about having another drink. Is this normal? If not is there anything specific I should do? I don't know where else to ask this.

Thanks,

85,"I will be unbiased as possible so here I go. 

TlDr; Work at a cafe. Got into an arguement with 3 (possibly 2) drunk customers because told him before hand we do not serve a certain dessert at the actual premises after 10. They came at 10:10 we close at 11. But we could do to-go. He ordered to go and they began eating it at tje resturant. Told them they couldn'tGot into an argument about closing time. Got into another argument that he could eat it at the resturant because he paid. So here is my question am I in the wrong because I wouldnt let them eat there? Is our store policy bs? And how do you deal with drunk customers?

Edit: sorry for long tldr. 

I work at a cafe that sells bread, coffee and make desserts like bingsu (korean dessert usually shaved ice or shaved frozen milk with different toppings). Our hours are late like most cafes around 11. 3 customer came at 10:10 and ordered desserts. They were drunk but not too drunk and they ordered bingsu. We dont accept bingsu past 10 because we have to mop and clean. I told them we can do To-Go but we cant let them eat here because of specified reasons above.  

They accept and paid but when i gave them the to-go order. They proceeded to eat it at the back. I confronted them and told them politely that they were not allowed to. They began argueing that the resturant closes at 11 and they can eat it here. I told them the specified reason why they couldn't and that is why we only allow to go. One of the customers started arguring that he is allowed to eat his to-go order anywhere he wants and there is nothing specified (he means posted sign) that he could not eat it here. I told him the name is to-go and that means the food is meant to be eaten usually outside the resturant. 

His friend started yelling at me in korean to shutup and stop complaining. While the other one is asking me why he cant eat here. The 3rd customer a young guy kept trying to subtlety  tell them to leave and when that didnt work he just kept quiet. (My guess he works for them and because they were korean trying tp tell ur superiors that they are wrong will get you on their shit list. So i dont blame him). The one customer that started yelling about the closing time began asking ""me do you serve coffee past 10, because if they spill its the same thing"". I said no because we throw out the hot coffee because we brew it early that day and we can not brew a whole batch just to give one cup of coffee to a customer. (But we do make coffees that are made with espresso machine because we can just clean that part. Didnt specify because i was so mad i forgot to mention). They also started to tell me to call the cops, and to see what the cops had to say after I asked if they were drunk. 

Because I was so mad i just left. Another customer comes and orders ice coffee and the customers that i had an argument with began to yell at them ""They dont sell coffee past 10"". I told him we do make ice coffee and coffee that is made with espresso past 10. And they asked me what happened. I told them and when the 3 customers were leaving he heard I was telling him a story and he began to say ""oh telling him a funny story"" and just left. (They laughed because how ridicules the situation was). The customers since he was undertanding kept saying out loud so the others can hear ""Oh wow i love my ice coffee so glad I could get an ice coffee made so late at night"". I laughed and gave him some free bread. 

So after a long as text here is my question.
What do you do with drunk customers?

Does the establishment at your place have some similar policy where they dont serve a certain dish close to closing time?

And if you do how do you deal with those tyoe of customers?(we had certain types of customers like this before but this is the first time it was this bad).

87,"Hello! I came asking for opinions on this whole ordeal.. I really need advice on what I should about it, if I don't say anything about it now and get it off my chest, it will get in the way of a lot of things. Im currently living with my dad, his girlfriend, and her two sons. Just two months ago, days before my grad, I was getting ready in my room for a party when suddenly my younger (two years younger) step brother who I will just call ""HIM"", messaged me through snapchat. I was hesitant to open it because I was busy getting ready obviously. I eventually opened it to find him asking for a favour. and to ""keep it a secret between us"" I joked around as a sister and said ""*what? do you want me to pluck your eyebrows?*"" I kind of knew what he was hinting at but I didn't want to believe it. He continued to messaged me and, this ladies and gents, is the fucked up part. He says something along the lines, ""*can you give me* ***HEAD****? I usually have a girl come over to our place but she's busy right now with her* ***BOYFRIEND****, it will be a secret between us.*"" 

I was so mad!! shocked!! I felt sick and disgusted. I didnt get any screenshots because I was so caught up in the moment. I only got one after I realized its proof if he tried to do anything. About 10 minutes past after me cussing him out on snapchat. He knocks on my door, as I'm still TRYING to get ready in between all of this mess. and says ""*\[my name\] I'm so sorry, I don't know why I said that, please don't tell* ***MOM*** *and* ***DAD***."" still disgusted I tell him to get out and to not ask me for anything anymore. and that if he did, Ill rat him out. He didn't look or sound sorry. I have the one screenshot of him apologizing. he also told me he thought it was ""cool"". Clearly I told him I probably won't ever forgive him for what he said. I then packed up my shit and left right after my grad day. and I've been gone the whole summer.  Because I didn't want to be around him. 

Anyways, to get the real point. I don't want our parents to break up, and that's the only reason I've kept it a secret this long. Because one, she makes my dad happy, they've been together for a couple years now and I really think it can last longer. and two, I'm starting school and this is the only place I've got to stay at the moment. Its big help in my part since I won't have to pay for residency at the uni. So, since I'm back now, I will be seeing ""HIM"" quite a bit since we live in the same house.

88,"But lately I really have been thinking about passing over. I am 26 years old. I haven't had a girlfriend or sex. The only sexual experience I ever had I really didn't want at all but lost respect for myself and attempted to get hard for her and couldn't.   


Basically, I realize that I was a piece of shit during my teen years. I really gave up all my morals and values because of internet porn. I grew up during the explosion of the internet. I had unlimited access at nighttime since I was like 11. You pretty much know what that means. This was the dial up days where you literally went to [porn.com](https://porn.com) or [boobs.com](https://boobs.com) .   


Now that I have been able to examine myself, I realize why I did most of the dumb things I did when I was young. Looking deep into myself I realized it was because I had become not myself. How did this happen? Well, I grew up in a place called Kingsgate Washington. A nice area. I got to know the shadiness of these types of people subconsciously when I was a kid. I think subconsciously I just knew I was being lied to about something. I knew the power of money, and knew that life wasnt fair. So how am I suppose to function knowing these things so young? How is a young man to make it in a world dominated by money and old assholes who use young women and make the young men feel small by crushing their confidence. 

  
I cant be a hypocrite and say I never compared myself to another and felt like I was superior. But I was different. I didn't have the tools to see.   


I pretty much have decided that I really don't see any value in this world anymore. I realize that I made bad decisions that affected me negatively. But at the same time I am deeply depressed beyond repair. I never did anything ""all that bad"" by normal people standards but lately have kindof learned to read in between the lines. ... 

What does that leave for options?  


I don't know. I really wanted to be able to find a wife before I went rotten from the bad porn and stupid social shit and everything that went wrong. I had loving parents. I saw the value in that bond. It mean so much to me. I miss being a kid and walking down the neighborhood meeting the other kids and whatnot. I used to love being around people. The internet destroyed that.   


Everything that I really ever wanted I let go down the drain. I feel peoples pain. The reason I am not successful really is that I am just too nice. I miss that feeling...... its gone forever",21Aug2018,1
89,"I need to find a place to live by the end of the month since my current lease is ending or I would have to move my stuff into storage and rent an AirBnB until I can secure more permanent housing.

I checked out a room that somebody is renting out. She would be the other occupant. The neighborhood is kinda sketchy, but the town house is gated and parking is also gated. Here's where I had a gut feeling. 

Initially, when I met her to view the place, everything checked out besides the neighborhood. I tell her that I am interested and would like an application to go in on a lease with her. I text her over the next couple of days and it takes her almost an entire day to respond. I have no proof of this, but she is making shit up like how she tried to text me earlier, but I didn't get it because she put the wrong number? Even though we've been texting back and fourth previously. I also saw her still trying to advertise the room even though she agreed to go in on the lease with me. I finally get the application and asked her what that shit was all about and she said that she was considering moving out, but couldn't find a better place to live. She also suddenly told me that she was raising my potential rent by $25 more than advertised so we would be splitting it 50/50. I had no clue she was initially paying more. She also suddenly mentioned that the lease is month to month, but she *plans* to stay for 1 year which is what I need. When I was leaving, she also casually told me that she wanted to find somebody to share her room with her to reduce her rent. Also random side note and I don't want to be racist, but this happened. I was walking back to my car with the application and I passed by 3 black young men. One was shirtless and holding a beer which I assume he got from the liquor store on the corner. He straight up said ""ay bruh, you want this beer""? I just replied nah, I'm good thanks. I know that sounded super racist, but it's what happened. I'm not white nor do I have a problem with black people, but this happened in an already sketchy neighborhood.

I'm kinda desperate for housing at this point, but my gut feeling is telling me that she is gonna fuck me over and things will not end well for me. Am I just being paranoid?",21Aug2018,1

U-haul has two types of trailers one dolly style where the rear wheels stay on the ground and the other is a platform for the car to sit on. We are towing this behind a 15ft moving truck.

The latter is twice as expensive but I think it may be worth it to protect the tires from uneven ware. My lady is concerned that this option might be less stable as the wheels are positioned under the middle of the car instead of on the ends. (--oo--) vs (o---o)

91,"I've a friend that I met almost a year ago who is experiencing difficulties. She's young, around 14 years old, and has emotional/depression-related issues. 

I text her every night, and recently, she always brings the conversation back to her issues. She tells how she's always had issues of spontaneous panic attacks, and she really hated them. Recently, though, she admitted to having depression. She has only told myself and another of our mutual friends. A lot of the time, we'll have a conversation about something unrelated, she'll make a passing joke along the lines of ""haha i wanna die"", I'll respond jokingly, and she'll come back seriously with ""no but seriously I need help."" Or sometimes she'll just spontaneously text me something like ""hey... (sad face emoji)"". She really overuses ellipses and crying emojis, much more than ever before. 

And she'll send me things personally all sad, saying ""I wanna just give up"" or something similar, and then simultaneously send memes or make jokes in another group chat we're both in. Just last night, she sent a video of her cheering on her sister accomplishing something and acting excited, then sent me a few hours later ""I don't even really feel anything anymore but numb"". 

She refuses to get help, tell her parents, or bring up the subject to anyone besides me and the other friend. We both insist she do, but she always tells us how she's just not ready. And when we have conversations, sometimes, she'll say ""I'm really close to having a panic attack. It's coming any second"". Which, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think they work that way.

Anyway, my point is not to throw around accusations, and I probably would've made it longer before reaching out for external help, but this is seriously affecting me. I'm okay with talking her through it and comforting her, even though I'm not the best at it (she seems to think I'm pretty helpful, though), but due to this, it's kind of bringing my mood down, especially with her texting all sad more often, and I can't stay up until 4:00 am every morning talking to her. I need sleep, I have a schedule to attend to, and when school starts back up in a few weeks, this will really be my death if something doesn't happen.

So, finally, I'm asking for help dealing with this. I don't know what to do. I don't get to see her in person often enough to talk to her parents personally or anything, and if she's faking any bit of this for attention, I'm sure she would hate me for it. I love her as a friend, but this is becoming too much. I don't want to accuse her of lying about a serious issue like this, because if she is, I'm worried that one of the only people she trusts accusing her like that would put her over the edge. Please guys, I'm really in need here.

92,"I'm visiting my parents for the first time in a long time and see they have acquired some bad habits including a terrible diet (sugary or salty foods,  infrequent eating), being too hyperactive and far too wound up (too much coffee, salt, sugar), not using recommended medical equipment (not like taking meds, but not using equipment which as been prescribed by doctors) and so forth. They've just turned 70, are both overweight and don't seem to have the motivation to better themselves. I worry if they continue on this path, this will be the last time I visit with them.

I have a 4.0 and take 13 credits (normally 18 but this semester I have an internship with a Congressional candidate’s Finance office), participate in speech and debate, and am studying for Actuarial exams in addition to my BA Economics.

I work 12 hours per week at my parents’ company at a minimum wage entry level job, and have applied to work in a tea shop but have not quit yet because I haven’t received acceptance (submitted application today). I probably won’t work more than 15 hours because then it would be too much.

112,"My boyfriend and I are 19, have been dating for a year and a half, and are very secure in our relationship. His family has accepted me as one of their own, and my family has done the same with him. His family is extremely supportive in our endeavors as individuals and as a couple, and his grandma (a landlady) has extended an offer to us: a studio apartment that she rents out. My boyfriend and I have decided that this is where we will live, once we have the funds to put a deposit down...and once I get the nerve to announce this big decision to my parents. More specifically, my mother. 
My mom is hypercritical of my decisions and who I am as a person. If I get a B in one of my courses, she asks why I didn’t get an A. When I got the job as an office assistant at the law firm I applied to, she told me to keep my old job as a “backup,” in case this new job “doesn’t work out.” This is generally how most conversations with her go; I announce something in my life, she replies with something negative about me or my decisions, I try to reason with her, she tells me that I’m wrong, that I don’t know what I’m talking about. Always something along those lines. So naturally, I am nervous about talking to her about this big step in my life.
I care about her and her feelings. I want to make sure she feels heard, but I’m tired of her making me feel like I’m not doing good enough, or not doing what is “right” in her mind. This is a big decision that my boyfriend and I have made together after a lot of consideration, reasoning, and planning. I want to have this conversation as two adults, not as a mother and her adult baby - and this is how she likes it to be. I know that if I don’t do this the right way, she’ll manipulate the conversation to have the outcome that she wants...and unfortunately, I inherited my mother’s stubbornness.

116,"Hey everyone, I don't know who to talk to about this so I'm just gonna try it here.

I don't know where to start... first of all my mom has breast cancer and is already in a lot of stress because of it. Also my mom is generally not the most psychological stable person and has been to a psychiatry multiple times. Additionally she doesn't have a job and recently got her german unemployment benefit cut, so the last two months she has been without any money in the middle of the month. They even cut off the electricity for her house last month, so she has probably not paid some bills for a while. Luckily she was able to pay it after a week and they restored the electricity but it will probably happen again. I already lend her 300€ but obviously if nothing changes I would always have to lend her money in the middle of the month and I'm just a student, so I told her that I would not lend her money anymore because obviously I also don't have that much money as a student. Also she is not putting any effort in getting a job as she says she will not earn much more than the unemployment benefits and can't do physically demanding jobs because of her cancer and wants to start her own business instead (obviously won't work in this situation). So cancer, no money, psychological issues how can it get worse? Well she received a cancellation of her rental contract without notice because she got into a fight with her neighbours. She still didn't move out so I'm just waiting for the police to throw her out with no place to move. She accuses the ""system"" for the trouble she is in now, which is somewhat true as she got fucked over a few times, e.g. at her divorce etc. The last few days she is having multiple breakdowns and threatens to kill herself and I really don't know what to do. I really understand that she is stuck in this situation but she is the only one who can get herself out of this shit. She has no real friends who could support her with this anymore because she also got in trouble with them (I think that was also because of her psychological issues, not sure though). I also can't force her to go to the psychiatry. Worst thing is my sister is just 12 and has to experience all of this.. I wish I could take her to my place so that she is away from all this shit but I can't do that.

119,"I had been trying to help my sister, she shows signs of depression and to cope with it she turns to putting all the blame of her problems on me. Today she had an appointment and I wrongfully chose to take a picture of her medication as to prove to her doctor that she is not taking them, medication made to decrease depression and psychotic behavior. It was my mistake of telling the other super depressed person this and angered them. As soon as she came home they got together and told me if I ever got near them they would call the police. I though I had nothing to worry about until I remembered, she had accused her ex of rape and perhaps she would do the same as they both hate me to no end. So far I Feel torn about how to approach this. of course I will not talk to her or get involved with anything she  does, hoever I feel if sh just gets the thought of doing it she would accuse me of rape even though I never touch her or even leave my room at times because of the people I live with,. She had already claimed to want me dead and tried to make me kill myself and put a wedge between me and the rest of my family. 

I may have some things that may help in my defense however that fear is still hanging over me. She had been abusive and had no empathy to my little brother in the past, actually beating and abusing him, She and her other sister both hate me and I feel any retaliation will be backed up in numbers. My sister, one that Agrees with how terrible they act and help me out on this is trying to save money to move out and I feel once I get my job and pay off some debt I will start to save for a lease so we can move out and live in peace.

She is the most genuine person i have had to privilege to know. I value her as a person. I have never felt so close to a person in a very long time and i don't want to screw it up. I really care about her on a human level. She makes me happy. I have never been in a relationship relationship but if i did, i would want to be with her. We are such good friends that it would make sense. Its important to be friends first. we are just very reserved and i really dont want to screw it up. She makes me feel like i matter. Any advice ?

125,"30/F/California, no previous driving record. I was making a legal left turn on a busy street with no stop signs or intersections (that’s LA for you). Underturned and hit the curb of the center divider. I braked right before I collision, so the actual hit was light.

If you are standing and looking at the front of the car, it looks fine aesthetically since I had only driven into a curb. But if you crawl onto your knees and look underneath, there is some big black piece of plastic that is dangling, and something else is leaking, and even the hatch looks slightly crooked on closer inspection. The bottom of the car looks kind of jacked up.

What should I do? I have AAA and Mercury insurance.

126,My Facebook account was deleted. I only used it to mess with antivaxxer groups and talk to her. Now I can't find her because she deleted hers for some reason. Is there any black magic way I can get back on contact with her?,21Aug2018,3
127,So me and her have been best friends for about a year but around the beginning of may I started developing feelings for her that I can’t shake. Anyway she has a boyfriend who’s an actual piece of shit like they’ve been dating for about 6 months they’ve been on a total of 2 dates in that time. So the other day me and her were talking about going mini golfing together as she’s never went and betting dinner on it. Anyway like 4 days pass and me and my friends decide to go mini golfing cause there’s nothing else to do and look who we run into my best friend and her boyfriend. So like I’m a little crushed not going to lie we say hi whatever they’re like a couple of holes in front of us so we can see them in the distance but we aren’t really close enough to interact.so she leaves and gets home and calls her friend and says I saw John (which is my name) while mini golfing with (insert boyfriends name) and the entire time I was there I was thinking how much I’d rather have been with John then him I think I have feelings for him. Her friend then in turn tells me about this and then tells her that I have feelings for her. But now is the hard part I’m leaving for school in a day and like long distance I’m finally getting my potential shot with this girl that I’ve waited 4 months to get and I don’t want to fuck it up cause I can’t come home and see her and not only that but she has a boyfriend that In the past she’s been to scared to break up with of course I’m in the car with all my friends so they hear what me the person on the phone are talking about and they’re all yelling at me to not do it.literally everyone I’ve asked has said don’t do it except for one and I’m really conflicted and one of my friends said it’s not morally right to be the reason they break up which I mean is like I guess he’s right but I’ve been dying for a chance with her I can’t just let this go right ,21Aug2018,1
128,"5 months ago I bought 2 plane tickets to Spain at $400 each.  One for me and another for a woman who'd I'd been seeing casually for about 6 months.  We had a non-monogamous relationship (we both were seeing other people) yet always had a nice time hanging out.

Admittedly, buying the tickets was an impulse (darn you Scotts Cheap Flights!) yet, at the time, I asked her if she wanted to go and she said yes.  The implication was that I would pay for her ticket.

Fast forward to present day:  I saw her a few days ago and, though nothing has changed on my end, it seems maybe she has lost interest in me and is hedging on going with me on the trip.

It's not the end of the world - I'll go by myself and most likely have an awesome time.  Yet, I feel a bit miffed that she is canceling on me.  

As we were talking about this the other night she mentioned if she doesn't go she'll just pay me for the ticket. We had had a few drinks so it's hard to know how sincere she was about this offer.  BTW, the ticket is non-refundable and no name changes.  Though if the ticket is canceled a flight can be re-booked at a fee of $200 plus with the credit of $400.

I've described this situation to a few friends.  Some think that I should just eat the ticket cost as I was going to pay anyway.  Others said that she should pay me for the ticket since the deal was she was going to accompany me.

129,"TLDR at the bottom.  My two best friends are a married couple who we will refer to(anonymously) the Smiths. The Smiths introduced me to their friend who we will also anonymously refer to as Mary.  I spend a lot of time with the Smith’s. I’ve been neighbors with them for the better part of a decade and we see each other often.  Mary is one of Mrs. Smith’s best friends but she doesn’t hang out with us very often. I don’t know Mary that well. But I know she is married as well and has a 5 year old daughter. Her husband is not the father and they’ve only been married a little over a year. Also, all of us are the same age in our early twenties.

I’ve never met her husband, but from stories I hear from the Smiths, the general opinion of him is that he’s a jerk.  He would constantly yell and be verbally abusive.  But this weekend it’s gotten worse.  This story was just told to me by Mrs. Smith.

Mrs. Smith and Mary and a few other girls were having a night out at a bar when Mary’s husband showed up and started yelling.  He was demanding she get in the car and come home with him. She was reluctant until her husband said he has her daughter in the car(at 1:00AM in a bar parking lot). So Mary went outside to see that he didn’t actually bring her daughter, and that’s when he attacked her. Mrs. Smith went outside to see Mary in a head lock. After a yelling match between everybody, Mary was able to get in the car with Mrs. Smith and get the hell out. The husband followed them for a bit but they were able to lose him and spend the night at Mrs. Smith’s parent’s house since he didn’t know where that was.

And that’s all I know.

No one called the police. Mary won’t do anything about it. The Smith’s won’t do anything about it.
This guy is obviously dangerous but no one will do anything about it and I’m barely an acquaintance to Mary. I wasn’t even supposed to know this all happened.

I know someone needs to step in. But I don’t know who. Should I push the Smith’s to do something about it since they are Mary’s friend? Should i directly reach out to Mary? Or should I myself call the police.

I’m hesitant to do it myself because I have no way of confirming this even took place the way that it was told to me. I understand why Mary does nothing because I know it’s common for abuse victims to stay quiet.  But I don’t know why the Smith’s just stand by and do nothing.

TL;DR
Friend of a friend who I barely know is being physically harmed by her psycho husband and no one seems to want to do anything about it.

130,"I'm gonna lead off with how it happened to fill in some back story. I'm currently 20, Male, in the Navy, and in fairly good shape and with no real health issues, and I'm quite a shy guy. I normally don't talk to attractive women often because of how nervous I become and I fold like a lawn chair when I try, but a weekend ago I was down to visit a friend and help her move into her apartment with her roommate. I knew the roommate was fairly attractive but had never interacted with her before so I was nervous like always, but we kinda hit it off sharing lots of likes and generally had alot of fun together, and I decided to ask if she wanted me to join her in bed the last night I was there (I had been sleeping on the couch). She excitedly told me yes and before I know it cuddling turned into much more.. and this is where I began to notice my problem, I was having trouble getting it up, which for someone my age has never been an issue.. it had been well over a year since I'd been with anyone else and have regularly masturbated so I know it had worked a few days prior. It's now been over a week and I can count on one hand the amount of times it's even been at half mast when before it would rise to the sight of anything slightly resembling a female. I've talked to a friend about it and he had no ideas what to do besides seeing a doc, which I'm deathly afraid of doing, and would like some advice on what it might be.. I've thought maybe stress, nervousness, performance anxiety, and things along those lines but still can't get anything to happen.... Anyways thanks in advance for any help guys/girls.",21Aug2018,1

133,"At work today I had the chance to work with someone that I don't usually work with, since she was helping in my area. We got along really well and I enjoyed talking to her. She also flirted  with me - at one point she complimented my eyes and winked when my supervisor wasn't looking. Problem is I was too caught off guard to react much besides thanking her, so I probably gave the impression I wasn't into her.

Tomorrow is her last day at work before she'll be studying abroad for a year and I will be off. We work retail so technically I could go shopping on my day off and slip her my number. I also found her on Facebook (which I don't even really use) but I'm worried it might come across as slightly creepy that I found her since we don't even have any mutual friends because I barely use it.

I'm interested in getting to know her though but I know it likely wouldn't go anywhere anyway since she'll be abroad for a year. Any advice? ",21Aug2018,1

My plan is that to take a year off from university and work during that time so that I can set up myself to make my university life more comfortable. But, I fear that my parents and siblings would be disappointed in me and I tried to tell them this jokingly and they replied that I would never come back to university because of the money I am currently earning and would be satisfied with that.

136,"I was in a relationship that was codependent, and abusive. This was my getaway. A chance to become independent. Within two days of moving everything out here, I’m working for a construction company. 12$/hr. I’m doing so well, I enjoy what I’m doing, I feel wholesome. 2 hours before the incident my father is hugging me, telling me how happy he is that I’ve finally had the epiphany (independence and the joy that independence brings). (22m btw)

My father has been my hero my entire life. I moved from one very fucked up relationship to the next. My father and my stepmom are absolutely miserable with each other and turning to substances as a form of self medication for their shortcomings. There’s no communication whatsoever and I tried to be the mediator. Big mistake. 

Long story short, they get into a heated argument. I just moved blind into the middle of this, and I’ve known my dad for 22 years and my stepmom for about 12. I have two brothers. (7 and 10) Them, and two neighborhood boys were staying the night. We were going to grill brats, smothered in caramelized onions and beer cheese. Phenomenal. My dad has had 6 (heavy) vodka drinks and I had about 6 beers. The fight between them started, which was not uncommon. My stepmom runs off visibly upset and hyperventilating, and her being there for most of my memorable life, I go to comfort her and make sure she’s okay. It was successful, I come back inside with her with the hopes of having the good night that we planned and step outside on the patio where my dad is.

“Go. Fuck. Yourself.” He said.

My dad walks back inside. Confused, I follow him in and ask him why he told me to go fuck myself. I push. I’m offended, “why the fuck did you say that? WHY the fuck would you say that?” He follows me outside, at which point he head butts me in the face, gets me on the ground and punches me square in the face. I’ve got a black eye. We wrestle on the ground and I kept telling him that I wasn’t going to fight him. He chokes me out and pins me down in the yard for about 15 minutes. I never fought back. I knew he was drunk, I just didn’t have it in me. Anybody else would’ve been in the hospital. My hero was sitting here beating the shit out of me. I got free, ran, and walked about 15 miles. I fell asleep at a local Starbucks and a family friend (chance in a million, the mother of the other two kids that were there that night) found me there on her way to church. I go back to their house with them, they convince me to return, so I do. Talk it out with him, he takes me for steak and now everything is buddy buddy. I’m a very forgiving person, and I’m the best I know at exercising restraint. (Obviously)

I don’t know how to handle it other than stay on the path that I was on, with the goals I had in mind. Maybe I just needed to get it off my chest. I don’t think I’m handling it that well, I’m very emotionally conflicted here, I’m just going to continue focusing on work and write it off as a hiccup. He’s convinced that I “betrayed” him in his own house by talking to her. I just wanted to grill some fucking brats, man. I don’t know. Thank you for reading, I think I just needed to write it out. 

tl;dr: wanted to grill some brats, and got assaulted with nowhere to go.

side note: on my 15 mile trek into town, I got kissed by a random girl? fun fact :D

side side note: how do I handle this situation, in all seriousness? (Other than continuing to work in order to get the fuck out of this crazy house.)",21Aug2018,22
138,"Work took me to a rural location in Odisha when I was 25 in July-2014. There, I met a man after 8-9 months. He was 24 years old. We both were metropolitan kids. We met in a place where you don't find compatible young people. 

We dated in that small town of 2-3 sq.km. He would come over to my place once-twice a week. After two years of dating, I moved to a nearby city (100kms away) in May-2017 to continue working on the same project. 
We became distant. I began socialising with other people in city since I was living independently in a city for the first time in three years. 
We spoke less on phone, met once a month. The last trip we had together was in April-2016. He would never come anywhere with me. 
He started preparing for higher studies in Oct-2017. We texted once a week. 

He cleared many exams and got admission in Mumbai.  I was elated. He was going back to the metropolitan, something he wanted to do for a long time. I supported him. 

He stopped replying to my texts when he moved out of Odisha in May-2018. He would text one word once in a while.

One day (In July-2018), we were discussing the course of us via text and he said he does not see this moving ahead. He wanted physical intimacy on a regular basis, he wants to have more sex, he wants to sleep with someone every night and he does not know if we will survive because he does not want to come back to my work city and I don't want to move to a metropolitan. This was not a discussion. He had made up his mind about us without my involvement. We did not put effort into saving us. It was over and I did not have a say. 

We broke-up. I felt disrespected and betrayed. I supported this man and was loyal. The reason why I did not text much was before I was comfortable with us. I did not had to put extra effort. We were dating for three years. I thought we were over the phase of impressing him. I also spent a great deal of my day working. I like my work. 

Now post break-up,
Once in a while, he would call asking me if I am dating someone. I would never say anything because I thought that's my personal life now. I don't want to share. He would hang up if I don't tell and then call 4-5 days later again, asking the same question. 
Last week, I told him that I am interested in someone. 
And then yesterday, without my asking, he texted he's dating someone too. 

What I fail to comprehend is how can he date someone within six weeks of breaking up with me. When exactly was he out of this? Because I was in it till the end. Why was I not aware that he was over it? 

The heart breaks to know that I was disrespected by the person I dated for three years. ",21Aug2018,1

140,"It was a mutual break up that needed to happen after two years of toxicity. 

He lied a LOT, so I didn’t trust him. Because of how much he lied, my insecurities and anxiety became much worse and I projected them onto him. 

For the year before we officially dated he told me we were exclusive. Come to find out he was hooking up with five other girls. 

He lied about hanging out with exes so I’d constantly ask him if any of them snapped or messaged him, and wouldn’t believe him if he said no. Then he’d get mad and frustrated and call me out for not trusting him. 

He stayed good friends with exes and ex flings. When I expressed my insecurities he claimed that he wasn’t going to break off friendships for me. Which wasn’t what I asked. I always just asked for transparency when the my texted. I’d have to drag it out of him, and I’d try not to get upset but just ask him to be honest wit it. 

When we broke up I felt relieved. Relieved that I didn’t have to worry about who he was messaging or whatever. 

It was a sore spot because of how much of a life change it was...to go from a relationship to being single. 

It’s good, I don’t miss him.

However, two days after the break up he hung out with an ex hookup who he assured me he wasn’t talking to while we were dating (he drove two hours to see her....no way he’d do that for someone he hadn’t been talking to). He’s being openly flirty and he has even posted “I have a crush on a girl. We’ve gone on a few dates, I’m super excited” we blocked each other on everything but I asked a friend to send me anything like that. So I’m guessing he didn’t post it intending me to see it. 

While dating he made me a 30-song playlist and after our breakup he posted “I made a playlist for a girl and she said it was too long. Now I’m insecure about how many to put in a playlist.”  I was being facetious about how long it was. But I wrote him a three page letter for our anniversary and it took him MONTHS to read it. I had to resend it to him. He kept telling me my anniversary present was “on the way.” I didn’t need a present, and I told him I’d rather have something free but thoughtful. But what a fucked thing to post. 

He seems so unaffected by the break up. I’m not expecting him to outwardly post that he’s upset or bothered, but to already have moved on less than a month after a two year relationship? 

I’m not jealous, I’m just hurt. Was I that easy to move on from? Maybe I was the toxic one? My friends wanted me to break up with him for months but I never listened. It’s just making me think that maybe I made him out to be the bad guy, when maybe I was really the bad guy? I shouldn’t have projected my insecurities onto him. I should have seen his red flags. But also, I’m always seeing the situation from my side. Maybe I’m being too biased? What if the failure of the relationship was my fault? Because I’m the toxic one? For him to be so okay with our break up makes me feel that he must have thought I was THAT awful? 

Idk what to think. Sorry for how scattered and crazy this post seems. I kind of just wanna get everything out. Any input is much appreciated ",21Aug2018,1

I moved in with my housemate about 1 and a half years ago and things are just getting worse and worse.

When I first moved in everything was fine, we had boundaries and are great friends.

For the last 6 months she has been losing it mentally, and I have done my best to help her back up on her feet whether it’s financial or just being there and what not. I feel as though I’ve done everything and I mean literally everything in the house. All of her messes through to doing just basic house work like mowing and such. You get the drift.

All the while this has been happening I’ve been struggling my self whether it’s financially or mentally now but I never once showed any negative emotion towards her. I’ve done my best.

Now she’s drinking obscenely and always analysing me and is become more and more erratic and it turns out she has been telling other people that I do things I simply don’t do like drugs and having shady people around. 

I’ve reached the point that I simply cannot trust her and every time I’ve attempted to have any minor discussion it turns to her racing off or blaming me for her problems.

I’m not sure what to do, I’m currently looking for another place but it’s hard in my area and I’m currently working 3 jobs so don’t have much time to look around beyond the internet. 

I think this may be more of rant and apologises if it’s hard to read but I’m walking to work and writing as it pops in my head.

150,"I recently graduated. I've been applying for graduate jobs. Most start next year though.

I also applied for some internships (unpaid, 3 months only). The reason was to gain experience in my field. However if I'm accepted into a grad position, all training necessary would be provided.

I should note, I do currently work 15 hrs a week in retail, and 5 hours a week in a casual teaching/tutoring position.

Recently I've got some interview offers for internships, but I'm not feeling motivated anymore to pursue them. The main reasons:

\- They are all situated quite far away (1.5 hr commute; unfortunately, jobs in my field are in the city, which I cannot afford to live there). 

\- Considering the above, they are unpaid.

\- Considering the above, I will be sleep-deprived; my work in retail is night shifts and often get to sleep by about 2am or 3am. If I want to commute to an internship, I would have to wake up 6:30am to get ready and be there by 9am. I can't change my hours (the job I have specifically works in late hours) and it's my only source of income (besides the teaching, but that's hardly a couple hours per week).

As mentioned, I mainly applied because I could gain some valuable experience in my field. But if I get into a grad job, it won't matter much. In regards to having extra curricular activities, I already have a lot of stuff on my resume for that, so I'm not too concerned with it. i.e. it probably wouldn't make a difference if I have it there or not.

So here are my options:

1. Keep applying to grad positions in hopes of finding a paid job. During this, continue working in retail and teaching job.
2. Do the above, PLUS do an internship to gain experience.
3. Other?

I guess I'm just wondering if it will be worth the time, travel and sleep deprivation. Any advice?

154,"I was working at the time and I am a health professional so I work in a medical environment with patients and other staff. 

One of our patients who was elderly and wheelchair bound was being assisted by one of the receptionists to navigate into the building via the back (staff) parking lot. He ended up driving his electric wheelchair into the back of my car and scraping all the way across the rear end my car. 

I walk out to discover the receptionist had lazily told him to enter through the back even though this is prohibited, and she failed to realise that his wheelchair would not fit the gap between my car and the gate. Therefore hitting my car and causing quite deep gashes scratching paint off my infiniti. 

I am livid! I feel horrible because I don't want to make the disabled patient pay for the repair but it will otherwise cost me about $1000 to fix it. The receptionist is denying responsibility and I just want to scream. Advice needed. Thanks ",21Aug2018,0
155,"Hi guys first time posting on this sub, and i need some advice. So the story goes, in my country if you have a negative grade on a subject you need to corret your grade on an additional date, most of the time after the school year ends and you can try twice, i was negative in maths and went to correct my grade but i was too lazy the first time and failed so i went again on the second try, this time i had an math instructor help me but i still couldnt make it . So i have two choices either to repeat the class or to ask the principal for a third date where i can correct my grade but in order to get my third date i have to have a good excuse and i need to have proof to acompany that excuse , in the rule book of my school it states: the head of the school may decide that a student who has failed to fulfill his educational program obligations due to illnes or other justifiable reasons progresses to the next year and determines the conditions that he/ she has to fulfill. Any advice would be realy helpfull . in terms of any illnesses the only things i could think of was that my sister gave birth , my mom is on hormone pills , and that i may have an addiction to electronic devices other than that i dont know .

I know that the best thing would be to repeat the class since it was my layzines that caused me to fail but i realy want to got to the next year with school mates from my generation and id feel realy embarrassed. If you have any advice please share thank you",21Aug2018,1
156,"Don’t take healthy too literally, but you’ll see what I mean. And I’m talking about an online friendship here, not a real life one. I’m going to be using they/them, but I know their gender.

I met this person about a month ago here on Reddit. We clicked really well, talked about many things, from the things we’re into to some really deep stuff and got really open with each other at times, which is great, I always like that.

They were sick for some of the time and I was too, so we didn’t get to chat that much, that’s all been fine. Of course, when we’re busy too, you can’t text every single day. I’ve been fine with all of that.

Recently they told me that they were trying to be the best person that they could, that they weren’t doing their best and I just told them that I was there for them for anything they needed. Again, completely understandable, don’t want to be intrusive.

They almost always text me first because of the timezones and it’s something I got used to, because it’s night here where I’m at and I’m not usually doing anything, so we kind of talk when they are free.

Now after this short description of how it has been, here is where the problem might be. I feel like we only talk when they want to, they just text me, we talk and then they leave. If I see that they haven’t texted, I text them, we have a short conversation and then they leave. Yesterday we were supposed to text, but I told them I was really tired and that I’d really like if we could chat tomorrow and they said that they would see since weren’t feeling it lately.

Kind of see the pattern here? Is this healthy (maybe for the lack of a better word)? What should I do?",21Aug2018,1

158,I started a new job a month ago and they never filed my direct deposit so I was forced to accept paper checks instead. I am supposed to be paid weekly but the check for my whole second week of work has gone missing. Four managers have nothing and can find nothing in the office. I’ve asked them to check every day and they’ve collectively done nothing to help me acquire the lost paycheck. I’ve talked to coworkers and the same thing has happened to them in the past...they never got paid. I was actually told to shut up by a manager because I complained about the missing check! I’m mad as hell and my bills are short/late because of their screw up yet they act like they’re completely inconvenienced by me requesting pay for work.

160,"To start off, I had this girl in my college math class, never really talked with her, but she seemed like a kind, elegant, beautiful woman. I ended up finding out that she was actually roommates with a mutual friend from High School, the mutual friend and I don't tend to talk, but I have nothing wrong against her, nor should she have anything against me (unless there is something I don't know about). Anyways, I was just wondering my best options to go around talking to this girl from my math class, is it best to go thru the mutual friend in a message, simply stating that I am into her friend and would like to take her out and get to know her? Or should I wait till the next time I see the girl I'm trying to get with, and just ask her in person instead?

169,"So I just got done with breaking up with my gf last week. We where together for 2.5 months. My reasoning...I did not like her. I couldn't find the spark from day one even though she loved me. I feel like a major part of this is becuase 5 months ago i broke up with my bestfriend, who we had been dating for 15 months. She was my highschool crush and on the last week of highschool I admired my feelings and we hit off so fast. The break up was terrible though. I mean the worst breakup ever. We both left on such a bad note. Blocked each other on everything. I though never to see each other again. She will be leaving next January for 18 months out of state. Next January I become a police to start my career. So I thought I would never see her again. Last night before uni started I was really thinking how if I could have one wish, it would be to make everything better between us, or atleast earn her forgiveness and tell her that I do forgive her. Well without knowing she decided to start a semester at my uni...and what so you know she is in my class. It through me for such a loop I have no idea what my professor said at all. We both saw each other since everyone had to introduce ourself. She sat in front of me for whatever reason not sure. A lot of feeling came back, none good. All hatred and sadness. As soon as class was over I quickly left, got in my car, and drove home just so angry. However a few hours ago I remembered my wish to make things better. I have a whole semester to try and make things better before we we dont see each other for a year and half at minimum, possibly for life. Should I try to make it better between us, or let it go? I'm not saying get back together, it would never work, not even saying friends, becuase I know that we both still have anger in us. However it has been eating away at me for so many months.

171," Sunday my boyfriend txted me saying he had work until 6:30, he works two hours away so I knew he would be home around 8-9 which he did. Today Monday, while lying in bed with my boyfriend I found a receipt that said: ""Pole Position Go Cart"" created at 6:50 pm in a town an hour and a half away from where he works dated Sunday. I asked him why he didn't tell me he went and he said: "" I didn't go? Give me the receipt!"" I handed it over to him, and his name was on the receipt since he paid with a card too. I told him there was no way he didn't go and then he said: ""I did but I only went to see if it was fun and worth it to take you!"" I said, ""I don't believe you went alone, who does go-cart racing alone."" I walked away into the kitchen and he came in minutes later and stood behind me, I could see him in the reflection from the window. He was looking down and at me back and forth for over a minute or two, while I was washing dishes. He looked like he was trying to gather his thoughts and like he had something to tell me. Then he said, ""I didn't go alone but I went with my friend Danny, we were working in the area so I figured we would stop by."" Did he forget I know where this go-cart place is? It's almost two hours away, and no where near his work! Now, in my head, I'm thinking first he didn't admit to going at all. Then he said he went alone, and then with a friend, and because its near to his work which untrue. So I said ""it is nowhere near your work"" and he said I was right and that he was thinking of a different day he did work out in the area. Um, what? That didn't make any sense but I didn't care, it was three lies and I was ready for him to leave. Then he said, "" Okay, I just didn't want to tell you because I thought you would have been jealous!"" He also said he was high and that's why he couldn't keep his story straight, and I don't smoke but I also don't think weed makes you into a lier though. So now I'm annoyed. I told him I didn't like all the lying, and regardless of being high, he had yesterday night to tell me he went, and all today too but choose not to so its hard to believe him now. I told him I wanted him to leave my place because I don't want to sleep next to him, he left.

 Afterwards, I did the math, he texted me at 5 pm saying he works until 6:30, and since he works two hours away I believed him when he got home around 8:30-9. But now that I know he was at the go-cart racing place at 6:50 pm and it takes almost two hours to get there [I looked up the traffic time], that would mean he texted me that he would get off at 6:30 while he was already off work and on the way to the go-cart place. So he was intending to lie in the very first place which to me is weird as hell. I'm not the type of person to get angry that he does stuff with his friends, in fact, he does often and I never questioned it until today.  
I feel frustrated about being lied to especially since I took today off work to be with him and took him out to dinner, all the while he's lying to me for god knows what reason. We have been together for 3 years now too and have a lot of time away from each other he works almost two hours away from me, 6 days a week.

 I cannot stand liers, my dad always lied to my mom and it constantly broke her heart. So what I'm wondering is this: Did I overreact by telling him to leave my apartment? Does this seem suspicious to anyone?  What should I do now? Please help!!

Tldr: My boyfriend was out go-cart racing when he said he was working, lied to me multiple times when I found the receipt stating so. ",21Aug2018,2

175,"Hello,

I'm 18 and I recently moved to the UK, I've lived and worked here for nearly 3 months and I'm originally from Poland.

Due to mental health, I quit school back in Poland as I just couldn't cope. I barely studied or not at all, and I just stayed home and didn't do anything for half a year, then I came here to my sister for a month, and after that I rented a room.

I'm currently working through a work agency, but these jobs are certainly not what I'd like to do at all, I'm into IT, and I know somewhat about programming. In Poland I studied IT for a year, perhaps in college? The education is different there, but I suppose it could be translated into college. I passed the first grade with like 60% attendance and then I quit in the beginning of the second grade. 

I've been looking forward to study here, as I realize that the degree is super important if I want to actually get some job related to IT, but the difficulties are:

I don't have GCSE, since I didn't go to school in the UK

I am not sure how I'd be able to work to pay my rent and food / go to school and pay for it at the same time.

192,"I was embarrassed beyond belief the first time I posted this, and I'm more embarrassed now. 

I have a very, \*very\* strong fear of being cheated on. No, not a ""well it would suck if it happens"" fear. It's more of the kind of fear that makes you lose entire nights' worth of sleep constantly. A legitimate fear that makes me want to vomit if If I even think about it, and it's pretty much the only insecurity that I really have. I've had it for a while now, and it just keeps on getting worse and worse. 

I posted about it around 3 months back on a different subreddit, so if you want something that goes more in depth then please go there. I'm feeling embarrassed enough posting about it again. To put it simply, I haven't gotten over it and I'm really starting to worry that I can't. It's been a nonstop roller coaster of me being content, to then having it come back and hit me even harder than it did before. It's like a ""relapse"", and every time I have this ""relapse"", it gets worse and worse. 

It's an insecurity that heavily contradicts one of my life goals, which is to have a happy, long-lasting relationship with a life partner (something that's easier said than done obviously). It feels like one part of me really wants to be in, and work on, a good relationship with no significant problems (cheating specifically), but I'm starting to have my doubts that it's even possible to have a relationship without cheating nowadays. It feels like it's inevitable or, in the very least, extremely likely, no matter what I do. It's causing huge amounts of stress in my life where there otherwise shouldn't be any stress. I mean, for fuck's sake, I'm a teenager who just finished school. This should be one of the most relaxing few months of my life. Instead, I just feel sick due to raw anxiety. I'm terrified of going into the future and possibly ending up with someone. I feel like one of my biggest goals in life is just blatantly impossible. 

As you can probably guess, I haven't shared this with anyone who I actually know. I don't want anyone who knows me personally to know that this, of all things, is what I'm scared of. Something that seems as common as sneezing. So I just try to deal with it myself. If that had turned out well, then I wouldn't be asking for advice from complete strangers. But I am.

At this point, I just feel like attempting to date isn't worth it at all. I seriously feel that a relationship would just add a massive amount of stress in my life and that I should just stay single. I know it sounds pathetic, but that's how I feel and I'm worried that I might not be able to change that. I feel like therapy would be going overboard, but what do I know? Maybe it isn't. Even if it wasn't, I can't afford it. 

\*\*Again, I made a post about this before a while back. It goes more in depth, but if I just copy and pasted it then this would be twice as long than it already is. If you want to read it, just go through my post history or something.\*\*",21Aug2018,1
193,"Tl;Dr at the bottom. 

I recently left my job at a day care center and moved to a new town. While looking for jobs I found an in-home child care job for this family and their two year old son. That’s the age I worked with at the center and I love working with toddlers. 

I contact the family and outline my experience (college degree in developmental services/autism, work experience with all ages, current duties at the day care center, etc). We have a brief interview over the phone where they tell me their son is slightly delayed but it’s “nothing too serious especially with your background”. 

I met the son a couple of times before starting full time and each time I left with more concern. He is clearly on the spectrum. He is being seen once a month by an early intervention program and they want the parents to have him tested for any spectrum disorders. The parents want to postpone those tests because “with your help he may get back on track”. 

Here’s what I’m concerned about: 

1. He seriously needs to be tested for ASD. I know they’re scared of a diagnosis but he needs more services. 

2. The parents lack of urgency with his care. He desperately needs to be more social. I don’t have a car and we live in a rural area. He’s missing out on early intervention programs because I can’t bring him. They say “oh we’ll figure it out”. Why hire me if I can’t provide an essential part of his development? I don’t want to lose my job but I was very upfront about not having a vehicle. They reassured me I didn’t need one. My observations tell me otherwise. 

3. This feels petty but- providing autism services is way different than babysitting and I feel I should be paid for those services. Originally, they needed someone to watch their son while they worked; I would change diapers, cook meals, etc. A job that would give me some cash for gas and groceries while my husbands better paying job pays rent. Currently, I don’t have the resources to provide what I think they want. 

This isn’t necessarily about getting paid more- I knew the amount before I agreed to the job. But I do feel like they want me to be more than I agreed to just because I know about developmental delays.

195,"So I’m 22, from the UK, graduated from university last year and have been working since. Since the last year I have had student overdraft debt for which I’ve missed a few payments, my previous job was pretty low paid but it wouldn’t have been a problem had I properly budgeted and expressed more self control with certain things. The bank called me up and I’m now on an arrangement with them where I’m regularly paying off the debt. It’s currently at ~£1000 and I’m paying £200/month on it after which I’ve requested they close my old student account. I now have a higher paying job and am more easily able to pay off the debt, but it’s still there on my credit report. After being afraid to for so long, I’ve checked my Experian credit rating and it is ugly. That’s the only debt I’ve had but I haven’t taken out any more credit apart from a phone contract and internet contract and they’ve always been paid off but they’re small so I’m not sure they count much. The worst thing is that I’ve been renting apartments for a year and I have ALWAYS paid the rent on time without fail but because I never registered on the electoral roll, unfortunately none of that matters, the credit bureau only knows about the bad stuff and none of the good stuff. The student account is listed as ‘delinquent’ and I don’t have much visible else going for me. I understand that this is my fault entirely, I’m not nor will I ever try to blame someone or something else for this situation I got myself into. From the looks of things, lenders would rather just throw their money into a burning dumpster fire than trust me with even a penny of it. I don’t have any defaults, CCJs, insolvencies, bankruptcies or anything of that nature but I don’t get brownie points for not being in serious legal trouble. The delinquent bank account can be paid off in 6months or less, but paying it off doesn’t make it go away, it’s going to haunt me for the rest of my life. I never plan to get any loans or start a business, don’t plan on getting a car anytime soon as I live in a decently connected city but one thing I do want in some years time is to be able to get a house but all this considered, it looks like pigs will fly before I’m ever approved for a mortgage. I tried, I tried and failed miserably to be an adult and I feel like a total failure, I really hate myself for getting myself into this situation and how my irresponsibility and immaturity have permanently screwed my life and status. I mostly needed to get this off my chest but I want to ask, is there anyway I can at least attempt to pull myself out of this hole? Is there anyway I can get my perfect rent record on the credit report? More importantly, I’m currently looking for apartments to rent in this new city and is this going to make it impossible to find somewhere to live? (I currently live with a non parental family member).  Am I ever going to be able to get a phone ever again once this contracts expired?

I am a 19 year old filipino guy, The education system is different here than the US and I'm supposed to be in my 3rd year now, but I dropped out during my freshman year 2 times because of anxiety and depression, I have been diagnosed with both, I'm also sure I have some sort of BpD or BPD too. I know there's a stigma and I don't blame you if you feel anything negative after reading that, but please try to look at my point of view. I was bullied in highschool because of the typical reasons, and I think this is the reason why I turned out the way I am today. It's kind of cliche and ""laughable ""to read but I have never looked at life  with a hopeful and positive outlook, I'm a negative person but I deny it to myself, i simply do not give a fuck because I am deeply hurt and empty and I feel nothing and no one in life helps me and so I have the mindset that ""fuck it we will die anyways right?"" I think im addicted to coffee and cigarettes too bc of the way I feel, im trying to give those up too, i just wanted to point that out since it probably fucks with chemicals in my brain too. I have a very low self esteem and I have so many fucking complexes which affect my life more than I have realized until now.I This is probably due to a emotionally exhausting upbringing, I look like a crazy person right now because I ""assume"" I have the disorders I named, but I just want to point out that I believe my parents have some sort of thing too, I honestly swear. I was from a private really high class elementary school and I was really proud of it, I think this developed my narcissistic tenedencies, and then I started high school in a free community public school and I got major culture shock and even a reality wake up call. I cannot stress this enough but religion fucked me up. I do not care to hide the ""religion""'s name, it's called Iglesia Ni Cristo, there's alot of things to explain about it, but TLDR its very culty and they say only members of the church go in heaven, and so from my point of view, and some factual evidence from other people's behavior, being in this religion makes you act better than everyone since they are ""evil"" since theyre not in the group. Fuck them. My only vent and output is music, I love music, but I found something I had never found before with hip hop, everything about it, I make beats and I rap, This will sound fucking stupid, and I swear it doesn't have anything to do with me loving hip hop, this happened before I even liked hip hop this much, but I have started to abuse my prescription Xanax, (My prescription expired but I buy it from someone I know) I became addicted to cough syrup. I do both alot, 2-3 times a week I guess. But I decided to quit both COMPLETELY, I know the road is hard, believe me I have relapsed so many times but I cannot take my life anymore and it's going nowhere and I am the most prepared I can be for the upcoming sober times. I have never had a girlfriend, I don't even take myself seriously, I'm super awkward and non witty (also because of misguided thoughts and reasoning probably) I guess i look about average? I'm 19 years old but I'm about 5'2 since im Filipino, i started to have the poorest hygiene i ever had these past few months, I have long nails, acne, body odor, etc.  I only have online friends and I don't even talk with them because I'm such a stupid annoying  cringy piece of shit, I will change this too. People say that ""I feel like Im losing my mind"" and Im one of them, but I think there's a possibility I really am, since I do not even recognize my thoughts anymore, why do i act a certain way, if someone were to go insane? its highly possible they would see some changes early on in their life, but wouldnt realize it when it does happen to them, if you lose your mind you are fucked for life since you cannot do anything to help yourself since the mind basically does everything..  I will have a better diet, I will exercise, I will focus on my hygiene,Im even gonna watch youtube self help vids and other similar things, Idk how to meditate but I will do anything it takes. I will be more present minded, I will try my best to force my emotional shortcomings out of my decision making. I pouted my heart out and I'm just gonna end it here I guess. Sorry for the long post but thank you very fucking much for reading this, please don't create a visualization of me in your mind from the things ive said about me, it's probably inaccurate since i cant articulate myself 100% well but i guess it's close to what i actually am.

I received my associates degree in this field, but I was afraid that it would be too emotional for me since my mother was schizophrenic growing up. I am now 26 and have decided to return back to school for nursing, a career that is emotional but less close to home. I am taking classes right now but I can't help to be continually pulled back into wanting to go for psychology. Opinions? Thoughts? I know I am only the one to make this decision, but it is always interesting to hear an outsider's perspective. ",21Aug2018,2

237,"So I am having an affair with a good friend of mine (there was always something between us and eventually we made out while sleeping on the same couch after a party). We can however not really start a realationship, since she will be abroad for a year in a few months, so we decided to keep it a secret in order to not generate akward situations.
Now (2 months into the affair) we went to a festival with the whole group and she constantly cuddled (while drunk) with a few other male friends and ignored me for the biggest part.
Well that's why I'm jelous and today (festival is over and we are at home) I told her I needed to talk to her. Now my question is how do I tell her to not cuddle/kiss other guys in front of my eyes again without sounding like an abusive husband with a 2 inch penis.

Despite this she continues to prescribe things for him and has very poor insight on how she is enabling his addiction.

248,"I've always wondered about my sexuality (Im female, for reference). For the longest time, I thought I was bisexual. Sometimes I thought maybe it was just gay, because I thought I was romantically attracted to women and sexually attracted to men.

I've just had a one night stand with a gorgeous guy, and objectively good sex, but it was like my mind was entirely elsewhere. I've slept with more than a few people over the years, male and female, and it happens every single time. The moment we get into it, I am waiting for it to be over. And I've really liked some of those people. Wanted to enjoy it.

The confusing thing is, I do masturbate. But it's more stress relief than anything else. It's like my body has these reactions to things completely seperate from what my mind wants 

I think maybe I like the idea of sex far more than the reality of it, and the reality is I just don't want to have sex with anyone. 

Does anyone else experience this?",21Aug2018,2
249,"This goes way back, but I feel the detail is important...and I'm rational with everyone but him. 

Two middle schools from one town filtered into one high school. At the end of 8th grade year, we took a joint field trip to get to know one another. I was seated on the bus, right behind this guy who (I thought was cute) was sitting alone. I said hello and he snapped at me, but I didn't leave it alone. We'll call him C. Later, I found out C had been intensely bullied and I ended up being his friend. We were inseparable in high school, and I'm quite sure everyone knew we liked each other but us. We developed a friend group and all hung out. Nothing ever happened romantically, but we spent all our time together and/or on the phone. I never knew him to date anyone, but I dated a couple people no big deal.

Fast-forward to undergrad. Different colleges, but still kept in touch, still inseparable. The friend group got together at least once a month and talked via IM and phone all the time. All of a sudden not too long before graduation, the entire friend group gets an email from C thanking us for being his friend and for all the time we had put in. His IM and all internet presence went silent, phone number didn't work, and we were all terrified he had killed himself. Efforts to find him didn't work, two of us even drove to his apartment two states away - nothing. 

Time passed, he never popped up on social media. Never could find his mom where she used to work, and I guess we all gave up and just hoped he was ok. I literally never stopped wondering about him - music, movies, books, all of our shared random interests brought him to mind often. 

Back in May 2017, he emails me. At my work email, which was publicly searchable. He apologizes for disappearing and explains  that he was in a relationship and had been married and even had a couple kids. They're split up, he always loved me, still does and wants to make amends at least as friends. I agree to talk to him and we again spend hours on the phone but never meet up since he lives a few hours away. I tell him I'm in a relationship but it's rocky, and then I end up breaking that off. I was going through some major health issues and he kept pressing to meet, but I didn't want him to see me as a mess and told him so. Couple weeks later, he ends up with a girlfriend. They've been together for a little bit now and he says it's serious. 

I can't seem to get over it. He wants to still be my closest friend like we used to be, but I feel like this is the second time he used me to get better and then left me hanging. Am I just crazy? Should I stop talking to him altogether? I can't imagine doing that, but this feels like it's killing me. ",21Aug2018,1

256,"Hi last night my friends came over and we ended up playing Mario Kart Double Dash, we play it a lot and usually I get my ass kicked, even though I usually do ok when I'm by myself. Last time they were here my eyes started watering from staring at the screen and from all the colors. It happens often, when me and my gf play Mario Kart 8 i start bawling basically its even worse on that game. I told them that I was sensitive to light and colors and that I wasn't actually crying because I was losing. I figured they understood and didn't think much of it. 


Last night they came over, and we were playing having fun, I was getting third place often but I didn't care. My eyes would water but that's normal and it didn't bother me until my friend looks at me and says something about me being in last and tells me i dont need to be upset. And then my other friend tried to be like ""hey don't be mean"" meanwhile I'm taken aback because I thought we were having fun even if most of the time I was last. I guess they think I'm getting upset? I tried to tell them that I wasn't really upset and having fun but they just noded their heads in awkward silence. 


I'm not really upset and hadn't expressed any rage nor did I even really say anything. And it's like when I try to explain I'm not upset it makes it worse. I really don't care about Mario Kart that much D:

260,"So my roommates and I recently moved into an apartment complex and originally it was inconvenient for them to be moving out of the way and the bedrooms were only supposed to be slightly different sizes (about 10sqft) so we told them that they could have the bigger room and we would split the cost.

So we decided that whoever has the bigger room should pay more (they do not want the bigger room if they have to pay more). The bigger issue is that the original paperwork says that we get a certain amount of square feet but the layout is not what we received and we feel like we are paying the same amount total for less square feet.

267,"Hello -I'm on mobile please forgive slight spelling errors and formatting -

I love my Aunt very much and she has always been a bit kooky but things have gone way off the deep end. 

I will first explain that all my life she has needed attention to an unhealthy degree. She needed to buy all the best things, even when her and my Uncle couldn't afford them so that she could show them off and talk about them. She needed to be the loudest attention-grabbing person at any social event. She would call my house *constantly* to talk to my mom. And if you ever didn't give her attention she would cry in a fit and yell that the world hated her. She would also always be ""sick"". Something was always *wrong* with her, it often felt like she wanted the pity. I know it sounds like the type of person you may not want to be around but I can tell you this woman has a heart of gold. She will do anything she can to help you and support you in all that you do. So much so the family has looked past her shopping, sickness and attention problems for many years. 

Over the past few years, some big things have happened. The biggest was she got breast cancer. It was very scary but all of her doctors said they caught it early and she had a very good chance of pulling through. She did. She had it removed and has been cancer free for over a year. But she has been using this cancer ""card"" as a reason to be put on more and more medications. The doctors always recommend against them but she hops from doctor to doctor until she finds one that will give her more medication. 

The medication is, I think, making her mental state much worse. She has episodes of crying fits now when someone doesn't give her the attention she *needs*. At least once a week she is sprawled on the floor in one of these fits. She has told me many times how depressed she is and that she is suicidal. But- then she started asking me about what medication I was on for my depression ... More medication. She hasn't even seen a therapist yet and she says she needs more medication. I've given her my therapist's number and the suicide hotline and told her she needs to call me when she's feeling this way. She never called my therapist.

Recently, Aunts sister reached a breaking point and cut my Aunt of her life. This has made my Aunt spiral out if control. She has been calling my cousin (Aunts Daughter) a minimum of once a day talking about how depressed she is and that my cousin needs to help her. My cousin will talk to her and go to her parents for dinner but she's engaged and living, kind of far, with her fiance. She has tried telling her mom she needs councilling because she isn't equipped to handle this, but this leads to my Aunt screaming about how nobody loves her and crying. She has begun to post on facebook about how depressed she is and how nobody loves her. It's really causing a rift in the family.

A few days ago my Uncle found my Aunt passed out face down in their hot tub. He had to drag her out and do CPR. He said she coughed up a ton of water and vomited but after that she was ok. He said she had been drinking - she cannot drink while on all the medication she is taking. He said she has been drinking more and more since her sister stopped talking to her. He also went through her phone the night of the Hot Tub and found she has been harassing her sister. Texting her back to back to back and calling non stop. This is all extremely concerning. The next day she said she ""didn't remember passing out or any of that happening, therefore it didn't happen"".


My cousin is at a loss and wants to have an intervention. She wants the drinking to stop and she wants my Aunt to get help, we all do. She and I have been looking up therapists and psychiatrists that fall under her insurance. I don't know what to say or do, the intervention is tonight and I'm very nervous. I'm not sure how she is going to react. Any help or advice would be really appreciated.

As a kid I was abused by parents and it left me pretty f***ed up in the head. I have severe depression, anxiety, and I eat to calm myself as well. I take meds for my psych problems but they only do so much. The feelings returned last week as I started thinking about school starting back up and I always doubt myself about everything I can do. I have a 3.3 gpa but I always doubt myself about how smart I am and if I can actually make it through this year. See, I switched majors a few times and switching really didn't help with my depression. Switching also put me behind a semester, if not two. I'm not sure how long it'll take me to finish, honestly. My parents put incredible amounts of pressure on me to do really well and keep a state scholarship. They expect perfection out of me since my brother hasn't done so well with college. When my mom called and told me about his plans to withdraw from his second college and enroll in tech school it brought back the feelings of wanting to drop out.

About this time last year my parents got divorced. Me and my siblings live in the same city as our dad but we always try to make sure we visit our mom once a month.
My parents, although divorced, are still on talking terms and we all hang out as a family every once and awhile.

My parents made sure to never yell at each other and always made sure the other would be getting what they wanted when it came down to compromises and have told us that they don't have problems with each other but rather they fell out of love after being together for over half of their life since they were teens.

My problem is that recently my dad has been getting anonymous letters in the mail from someone saying that he was abusive to my mother. My mom got upset when she found out and said that he doesn't deserve letters like that but none of us seem to know who on earth could be writing them.

My dad doesn't want to do anything about it but I'm worried someone might try to slander his name which wouldn't be good since he has a respectable job and none of us would want that for him after being such a great dad and person in general. 

I know I probably shouldn't be meddling in stuff like this but as an adult this whole situation makes me feel like a useless kid again.

Is something like this enough to goto the police to? The letters have been sent to his house directly and to be honest it makes me fear his and our own safety.

280,"Ok so to start this out I’m 17 I have depression, anxiety, and I’m super insecure. So anyways i has my gf over Sunday August, 19th and we were just cuddling, kissing, watching tv, in my room and then it started getting more serious. We started touching each other and getting frisky, so to make a long story shorter I ended up eating her out, and although we haven’t been dating for super long we have been the best of friends for almost a year, so I’m pretty confident that we can tell each other any and everything 100% truthfully... anyways I wanted that night to be about her, I wanted to make her feel extra special, so I wanted to make her l cum and she knew I wanted to. So after a while of eating her out she apparently came and right after she had came my dad had knocked on the door because it was almost time for her to leave. She had told me that I did an amazing job and she didn’t believe it was my first time eating a girl out, I told her “ I want you to be a 100% honest with me did I actually make you cum, if not that’s fine I just want to know so I can get better” and after asking her multiple times due to how insecure and sensitive I am she swore up and down that I did actually make her cum, but the next day talked on the phone and she told me once she got home she master bated, so that’s why I’m posting this I need opinions, did I make her cum but she was just so horny she had to cum again once she got home or did she fake it to make me feel better about myself.

282,"I've been a pizza delivery person for 13 years and I delivered Chinese food for a couple of years before that. I've had other jobs in restaurants and construction.

I graduated from college five years ago with a degree in creative writing and a certificate and Publishing, but never found a job in my small Southeastern town that would actually make use of these credentials. I've been doing the delivery job so long that it makes me miserable. It's an easy job for the money, but I know I'm capable of more and that I'm worth more. it feels like I've gotten so good at the job that they just keep throwing extra work at me without really being able to offer me a raise anymore. I end up doing a good portion of what I would consider managerial work, and completing other peoples cleaning tasks, or finishing things in the morning that should have been done the previous night, including stuff that is not part of my job description. I probably average between 400 and 500 a week working pretty much full-time, but thanks to tax returns I have enough in my savings that I could get by without working for a few months if need be. 

I'm debating on giving my two weeks notice asap and digging for a new job. I would really love to do something entrepreneurial or freelance, perhaps copy editing and proofreading for a job where I work from home or telecommute, but I don't know if I'll make enough money that way. I've been worn away from sites like upwork because there was a race to the bottom the cheapest bid gets the work. I'm not opposed to just getting another regular job either, but I don't want to get stuck in the same rut.
I'm also worried that potential employers will look at my job history and see that I have been a delivery boy for 12 years, haven't pursued a job sitting my degree in 5 years, and just not take me under serious consideration. One of the reasons I stayed in this job so long is because of social anxiety, and fear of interviews, but I think I'm ready to go for it.  So should I just quit the job at his killing my soul a little more each day and start looking for another one while hunting freelance jobs online or what? Please any advice for anybody who's been here or got stuck in a job that they hated but we're too afraid to get out of their comfort zone to do something better.",21Aug2018,3

\- I´m a weak skinny boi.

\- Everyone thinks I´m gay. (But I´m not) I ask why and they say that I look gay, sound gay and act gay.

294,"So this man that works in café at my job makes me so uncomfortable. He is a creep! 

I don’t know if he is just socially awkward, but whatever the case it is not ok &amp; I am thinking about reporting him.

He’s not very nice actually. I think he realized he would never have a shot, so he reacts with anger.

A long time ago I was watching a video on my phone and he came from across the room to ask me if I was watching a video of my son.

I then said no? because 1. I was scared how the heck did you see what I was watching from across the room &amp; 2. How is that any of your business? 

He also literally stares at me. I know a lot of people think people stare at them, but I am telling you I’ve never experienced this.

Even when I make a rude face like “Wtf are you looking at” he still continues. When I’m walking across a room he follows me with his eyes, his head, his body. He doesn’t care. He just watches like a creep. 

I have had multiple people tell me that have caught him looking me up &amp; down in a very weird &amp; perverted manner. In fact once a girl pulled me aside and said that he was walking out of the kitchen, but when he saw me coming he ducked back inside &amp; watched me walk across the café. 

I try to never make eye-contact with him because I think that’s what he wants. I feel like he gets angry when I don’t acknowledge him.

Today he stopped what he was doing (making quesadillas) while I was ringing out. Went to right where I was standing &amp; poured pop into another cup (held the cup right near his genitals) and stared at me the entire time he did it. He then threw away the bottle and walked away. I just did my best to pretend he wasn’t there, but my friend watched the entire thing &amp; said she thought it was so inappropriate and weird. I legit thought he was going to pour it on me or something my heart was pounding. It was so bizarre. 

The kicker is his wife works at my job as well! She is super nice but she works in a different building. It scares me for her the fact she is married to such a creep.

Since I've recognised what has happened to me I don't feel as connected to him than I used to and somehow I don't trust his promise to change (he stated that he understands if I don't trust it but that he really wants to change this time and that I should give him a chance) .

300,"I'm not talking about big mistakes - usually they are small, stupid mistakes that involve me being socially awkward. I'm a very blunt, talkative person, and often I find myself recalling incidents earlier in the week, or even years ago, where I said something that was TMI, or told a stranger my unsolicited life story, or dominated a conversation. And then I feel like an idiot. 

I've accepted that I'm this way, I have plenty of friends that love me even though I'm weird and awkward, and I also love myself, so I'm not looking to ""fix"" myself. I think most everyone has awkward moments like this, so I don't need to get rid of the social awkwardness, I just want to get rid of the fact that my brain harps on those memories so much.

Does anyone know some technique that I can use when these awkward memories come back to haunt me? Something I can do to quickly push those thoughts out of my head so I don't feel like cringing for the rest of the day just because I remembered something dumb I did the week before.

I'd rather be able to shrug my shoulders and be like, ""Meh. I'm a socially awkward person. Oh well. It happens."" But instead I can't shake the feeling, often for hours and hours.

301,"So, long story short: I lost someone very important to me, but in losing them I was free to do what I wanted, explore new adventures and general treat myself nice. 

I had this freedom for only a brief year until I met my boyfriend who has, essentially, taken all of what I was given away from me and left me only with the guilt and sadness of that persons passing. 

I’ve gained 100 pounds, lost over 50,000 dollars and am humored in going out maybe once or twice a year. It’s been two years now since we met, and I can’t help feeling resentment towards him. He doesn’t work, he makes me feel awful for helping him when he won’t help me, and lies to me regularly about where money has gone/what he has been doing/about what jobs he’s looking for. 

I don’t know what to do. I want my freedom back but am dependent upon my boyfriend to support me now. I know that sounds weird but I have no motivation or courage left. My options are leaving and filing for bankruptcy, or disappearing hoping no one, not him or anyone after my money, can find me. 

I’m lost. I feel like I’ve ruined my entire life. I have no interest in trying again with anyone else because of what’s happened and who I am. I just feel like giving up. I can’t pay for anything, I don’t make enough money to support two people.

302,"Hi Reddit,  I'm significantly hearing impaired.  I used to have an awesome pair of hearing aids ($5000) through my old job's medical insurance, about ten years ago.  They died about 3-4 years ago. My current job doesn't cover but I've been using some cheap ones manufactured by Siemens called the Lotus 12p.  

They were $125 and gave sound quality that was about 90% of what my old hearing aids were.  I've gone through a few pairs over the last few years and now they have an upgrade called the Signia Run SP.

This new hearing aid has a mobile app that helps find your hearing loss and allows you to set up the hearing aid properly.  Unfortunately for me, the app called MobileFitting by Sivantos Pte. Ltd. is not available in the good ole USA.  My best guess is that this aid is used for emerging markets and is not used here because they'd want to charge a kajillion dollars for it.

The thought of doing it for the rest of my life is miserable. Sitting at a desk staring at a screen crunching numbers and data for 40-50 hours a week. 
I went to Australia last year to see if it would be any different out there. Still hated it. I tried to make a career transition out there, but I couldn’t afford to sit around in Sydney, too expensive. Also tried 1/2 different companies here in Ireland , small and large, no difference. Despite the “boom” in construction at the moment and demand for QS’, I wouldn’t take another job in it for any money, that would be insanity. It’s the whole sitting-in-an-office environment all day and the demanding high stress mentality of construction industry. The work is very repetitive too, even from project to project. Ive did both PQS (in a consultancy) and for a main contractor.

I’ve thought about going back to college, moved down to Dublin from the North in March when I came back from Sydney. But I’m not sure what course I’d actually do a masters in or worse, back to an under grad degree for 4 years! A masters for one year mightn’t be so bad, it could open a few doors. But to start an undergrad again, I’d be 29 by then! Psychology and going down the clinical route to become a counselor /therapist to help people interests me but it’s a long difficult route, and competitive to even get into the course.

Ive taken off 2 months “garden leave” from work at the moment but I know I’ll not be back. And the finances are getting low, so I need to make a decision to either go back to college or get back into work. I took the [16PersonalitiesTest](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-careers) personality test which is very in depth about careers and it is me to a tee. It threw this up:

“being able to work face-to-face with clients, seeing that their personal effort really impacts another’s quality of life. Service careers such as massage therapy, physical rehabilitation, counselling, social work, psychology and even academic roles and retraining can be exceptionally rewarding for Mediators, who take pride in the progress and growth they help to foster. People with the Mediator personality type have a tendency to put others’ interests ahead of their own, a mixed blessing by itself, but when a patient takes their first unaided step in the long road to recovery after an accident, nothing will feel more rewarding than that selflessness.” It also mentioned a passion for expression through writing, which I do have. But I could never see myself becoming an author.

308,"Before I jump into it all here are my questions:

1. With the situation, can  trust be brought back?
2. What can I ask myself to help process this and make a decision?
3. Should I stay in the relationship?
4. Not advice, but do you think there was infidelity?

My  GF and I had a mixed first year. We had a lot of great times and grew  very close. The only issue was her Ex-FWB. According to her, she ended  their physical relationship soon before we met. He would still flirt  with her and sent her a drunk text saying he was in love with her.  Anyway, maybe 5 months after they ended their romantic relationship, we  became a couple. He was pissed because he had feelings for her. Still,  she wanted to be friends with him.

During  that first year, he would repeatedly text her inappropriate messages  about how he ""wanted her."" I started snooping on her phone and found  messages from him about what he wanted to do to her, what he liked doing  to her etc. As far as I saw, she never responded back saying she wanted  him to. It was always ""mhm"" or she didn't respond. She told me later  when I confronted her that he was drunk, and she would just brush the  comments off.

After a few months in the  relationship, it was obvious that I did not like him or that she hung  out with him. At one point, I asked her to stop inviting him over to her  apartment at night. The very next day, after looking on her phone, I  saw that she invited him over anyway. In those first few months, I saw a  lot of that. Her inviting him over.

Long  story short, I decided to do an ultimatum: cut him out of her life for  good or I would walk. She cut him out and blocked him on everything. It  has been 10 months since then. Neither of us have heard or seen him  again. He literally disappeared. Mutual friends of him and my GF didn't  even know where he went. I check social media once in a while, and found  that he is living back in his hometown a few hours away.

During  the ultimatum and before it, she did tell me that she invited him over  sometimes when she wasn't able to sleep. If there was alcohol involved,  she didn't want him driving home, so she let him sleep in her bed (its a  dorm, so its the only place to sleep).  Even when there wasn't alcohol,  he would stay the night. I asked if they ever touched and she looked a  little disgusted and quickly shook her head and said ""never.""

This  week, I found some old messages where she invited him over and he was  bringing a change of clothes. It was dated more than a year and a half  ago. We talked and she was scared that I was about to dump her or that I  haven't decided yet on whether or not I wanted to stay with her.

She  promises she never cheated or did anything physical with him. I know  with the circumstances, it sounds shaky, but my problem is that I do not  know whether or not she is lying for a few reasons:

1. She  never hid her phone or messages from him. I have admitted to snooping  multiple times during the first year and even asked her to change her  passcode, but she still left her phone with me repeatedly and refused to  change her password. This is probably the biggest thing. Every cheating  story I've heard says that they will hide away their phone.
2. I never really had to pry information out her. If I asked if he stayed over, she would immediately say he did.
3. When  the subject comes up, she breaks down and says that she knows that  inviting him over was a huge mistake. She's told me before that I should  have dumped her because of how bad she treated me. She does not want me  to leave and is terrified to the point of tears that I may.
4. She  says that she kept him around because of the validation. Her first 2  relationships ended when her boyfriend cheated on her. She started the  FWB relationship for that but ended it when she wanted a serious  relationship.
5. The  main part that makes me very unsure is that she lied or hid for  possibly months about inviting him over to ""hang out"" and spend the  night.
6. I  have a habit of doubting my relationships, even with my friends and  family. When I get told someone cares about me, I am immediately  skeptical and find reasons to think they are lying (yes, I am going to  therapy now for this).

HERE'S  MY TROUBLE: If she did not physically cheat, I would honestly be fine  with that after some time. She lied to me and hid her inviting him, but  she has tried to fix my trust. She still gives me access to her phone  and she honestly cut him out her life. She has said that if she ever saw  him again, she would ignore him because she did not want me to think  anything and leave. We had a long discussion recently, and she cried  because she said she was a terrible GF to me and she hates that she  didn't realize it during that time. She told me multiple times that she  only wants me and my trust back. She also repeatedly told me that she  never cheated on me, and I have asked a few times.

My  mind keeps bringing up the idea or ""fantasy"" I guess that she cheated,  and if she did, I don't think I could ever forgive her. The problem is  that I have no evidence saying she cheated. So far, with all I have seen  and know, he was a desperate ex and she needed validation, so she  played with him and invited him over, hiding it from me because she knew  I would get mad.

I AM TERRIFIED OF MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE. If I broke it off and she didn't cheat, I couldn't live with myself.

After  the ultimatum, our relationship has had no serious problems for 10  months. No new guy replaced her ex, the ex never showed up again and we  had rare fights that weren't deal breakers. In every fight, we both  ended up going to sleep happy.

What  should I do? Should I work on getting over it and improving the  relationship or should I jump ship? If he comes back or a similar  situation occurs, I'll leave in a heartbeat, and she knows that.

TL:DR  GF invited over her ExFWB multiple times without telling me during our  first year together, but I don't have anything to say she cheated.

315,"Hello reddit! 

This is going to be a longish one, so please, bare with me. I (F, 32) am married for 2 years for a wonderful man. We've been together for 5 years now, and our relationship has always been happy and stable. We had our ups and downs, but overall we have respect for each other and are both in similar paths in our life. Basically, things work. Right now we're in a very calm phase. We're not fighting, but we're not super excited around one another. You know - just going with the flow. Maybe this is the root of this problem I have?

When I was a student, there was this colleague of mine who I fancied quite a lot. We hooked up 3-4 times over a couple of years, but nothing serious came of it. I tried talking to him and tried to initiate a relationship, but he turned me down. He had an ex girlfriend and he chose to get back with her. That talk was quite unpleasant experience for me, as I could tell that he was feeling pleased with himself while I was basically asking for love. Anyway, I chose to look at that experience as an -If I didn't give it a shot, I'd always ask myself - what if? type of situation and I actually felt a relief after a couple of days. I was still very much into him (I dreamed of him often for a while, but eventually it passed). We were part of the same friend group, so we got to see each other regularly. We always flirted, but nothing happened after the talk. 

When we graduated, he chose to pursue a career over seas. After a while, we exchanged a couple of emails, and eventually he told me that he'll always have feelings for me, but that he's again back with his ex. At that point I told him to leave me alone, and to not contact me anymore. I needed to think about myself and distance myself from this toxic situation.

We've seen each other maybe 3-4 times since that, always as a part of the group get together, and we had a normal interaction. It was always a bit tense between us, but we just kept it to ourselves and that was the end of it. That was the end of it until couple of months before my weeding, when he got drunk and told me that he feels sorry for everything. That he feels like he missed out, and that he's not happy etc. I told him I was sorry to hear that, and that there is time for him to fix his situation and gave him some advice. Later that evening he tried to hook up with me, but I didn't want to cheat on my fiancee. I was temped, but at the end - happy with myself for not doing it. 

I got married, had a wonderful wedding (he was invited, but I honestly didn't care at that point). I was so happy and excited. It was my day, and day of my husband, and it went just as we hoped it will.  

Lately, I had stumbled upon the guy again. We had a long talk, and were discussing all of the missed opportunities. It was honest and sad and it moved me a lot. After that we saw each other couple of times more and just talked. 

The problem (and I'm sure all of you are expecting this) is - I CANNOT stop thinking about him. It's so overwhelming, and I just cant' help it. I love my husband, and I see clearly that he is a far better man than this guy, and jet, I fail. I know that he is flawed (not just in a way - we all have flaws, this guy truly has issues), I know that he's nothing but bad news, and when we're together in a group I see some of his behavior which is repulsive to me. I see his lack of self confidence, and I see that most of his extrovert personality is a coping mechanism. I'm not wearing pink glasses, I see all of his flaws of which there are many.

So why can't I stop thinking about him? Why can't I distance myself from him and just have piece? When you read this, it seems like we had a lot of interaction, but have in mind that all of this has happened during a course of 10ish years. So in reality - couple of isolated incidents. 

I need advice - How to persuade my subconscious in all the things I already know? How to convince myself to let him go once and for all?",21Aug2018,1

My fingers are constantly bloody and look a mess. It’s really gross but I can’t stop.
 
I also think that I’m desensitized to the pain, because it doesn’t hurt anymore. 

The doctor said it was a miracle that my fingers haven’t been infected. 

I’m entering sophomore year of high school and I just want to stop. I’ve tried so many ways to stop but I always find myself pulling at my skin. 

I do talk to a therapist and she says that it’s linked to my anxiety, but even when I’m not anxious I’ll just peel and pick away. 

Sometimes it really does hurt, but I do it anyway. 

I need some methods for breaking destructive habits that actually work, please!

319,"Hello there, I just graduated from highschool and because university isin't for me, I decided to get into the work force. I had an interview on the 17th of this month to a airline company so I can become a flight attendant. Their terms required a maximum height (1.88) and in my passport it said that I'm 1.90 even if I'm 1.87, with this in mind I tought my response that I was going to get woulbe be a negative, also known as rejection. So today I went to another interview in a local restaurant, the manager offered me a job at that place and said that I have time until monday to respond to his offer if I want the job or not. Long story short, I recieved an email just an hour ago from that airline offering me a position as flight attendant. And now I feel so hopeless because I don't know what to choose between these two. Keep in mind that if I take the flight attendant job I will need to relocate to another country, another city for the duration of the contract, wich is 2 years. Before the interview I was convinced that I want to do that but now when I see it written in front of my eyes looks so scary, to choose between a job close to home, close to my friends or a job in another country all on my own, without knowing anybody.

321,"My cousin has a slight mental disability that has held her back a little in life — nothing severe, but she does have a slight disability. She recently got married and moved into a trailer with her new husband and, as I’ve recently discovered, they’ve decided it would be a magnificent idea to buy a tattoo gun. She has since gotten 4 tattoos from her husband (that I’ve seen), as well as he’s added onto an existing one she had and totally ruined it ... these two are the last people that should own a tattoo gun and the tattoos she’s getting from him and posting online are ATROCIOUS. I’m talking about art that you’d maybe see a second grader do. I have no idea how to confront her about this in an effort to hopefully get this to stop before it gets worse. Her husband has since drawn up a Jack and Sally tattoo and is soon about to make what looks like a 2nd grade (permanent!) cartoon drawing on my cousin. The unfortunate thing is that my cousin has previously had people confront her about other questionable life decisions and she has this, “I’m an adult, you can’t tell me what to do.” Sort of attitude. I’m looking for a way to approach this in the most effective (but least offensive) way possible.

323,"Ill keep this short. I was sexually assaulted, raped and abused as a child by my belligerent uncle. It was insanely traumatic and i dont really want to go into more detail. 

My friend however is confiding in me that many months ago, her boyfriend ""raped"" her. This is what happened from what she told me;

So basically they were both fully naked, making out, oral all of that. He was on her rubbing his dick on her, she told me it felt good and that she was liking it. She told him she didnt want him to put it in, and then in a slow movement she said he put it in. She immediately told him ""take it out! it hurts!"" and he complied. He then asked if she was Ok, and asked if she wanted him to put it back in, and she said YES. Apparently the sex was really enjoyable and he asked multiple times during if she was okay with it. And at one point SHE was riding HIM. 

She had literally been telling me that she wanted to have sex but she was nervous and didnt know if she was ready. OBVIOUSLY she figured out she was ready, if she ACTUALLY didnt want it and ACTUALLY wasnt ready then she would not have asked him to continue.

Ok i know the whole ""he put it in when she said not to"" violates consent, but she literally enjoyed the sex and he asked her if she was okay with it and she said yea, and she has the fuckin NERVE to say she was raped. I am beyond furious about this, she knows i was violently raped as a child and its so fuckin offensive that she would even classify what happened to her as rape.

HOW the fuck could she say that she didnt want it when as soon as he put it in, she wanted it. Like i can not get over it. 

It makes me laugh too because she literally had sex with him for MONTHS
after this event occurred and even got mad at him once because he didnt want to have sex with her. I am so over talking with her i dont even want to be around her anymore. THESE people are what give rape victims a bad name. She watched thirteen reasons why and had the fuckin audacity to say she related to those awful scenes. I am so upset. Im sorry for all the swear words im jus shaking typing this out right now. 

I got up and just straight up left when she told me with a giggle that when he asked if she was okay with it a second time she said ""shut up and give me your cock"". Im about to fuckin block her on everything im literally so upset.",21Aug2018,4
325,"Hello there, I am a fairly young guy [20M]. I know I’ve always wanted a family of my own (a wife and one child). However, I am having doubts on the prospect of that happening. Sorry in advance if this is a long post. Tl;dr at bottom.


The number one issue is that I’m finding it very hard to come across a girl that will also want a child in the future. Many of the women I’ve come across and including in my friend groups are vehemently childfree or on that spectrum of not wanting a child. 


Alongside this there are of course the challenges of raising a child. Needing to care for it, care for my partner, it’s education, health, etc. Though I do believe I would be able to overcome these.


For some background, I come from a big family with 4 other siblings. We’re very loving, we take care of each other, and we’re close. I would take care of my 2 younger sisters and my parents. When I take a step back sometimes, I look and see how happy and content my parents are having children that also care and laugh along with them. Seeing my two sisters grow into the strong women they’ll be one day is also a joy.


What I initially wanted was a family with a wife and one daughter. Reason being I want the family aspect, someone to raise to be strong, one child because I know the burden of having all of us has on our parents, and a daughter specifically because of my younger sisters and because I know I am a handful to my parents as a guy.


Going back to the doubts. Maybe it’s not in my best interest to have a child. My dating pool is limited. The challenges of raising a child. The resources/money/time needed for a child. The state of the world (environment and money).


And although I will miss out on having a family, I could see some positive outcomes such as more time and money which can also be put into charitable causes. If I can’t have a kid I could help other kids in need. More of my time can be put into work or personal projects. I could get a pet.


In the end, I’m still having doubts and could use some guidance on if I should forget having a kid.


Tl;dr: Due to factors, I am having doubts on whether I should drop the idea of having a kid and would like guidance/opinions.",21Aug2018,0

328,"rked as a seasonal employee for a quarter above minimum wage ($9.50), doing things like sending and catching people on zip lines, operating a ropes course, etc. The season officially ends the first of November, but starting the first of September everything but one station closes for the year.

About a month ago I suffered from a concussion and had a doctor's note which told my employers I couldn't be around loud noises or do heavy activity. Unfortunately they failed to tell me that my first day back would be the busiest day of the season and put me on an incredibly busy station by myself that required me to shout at regular intervals while keeping track of a half dozen different things.

I let it go and got as much rest as I could, until last week when there was another incident. Some preteens took my fan from me, tried to go through my cash drawer, and repeatedly yanked on my hair while shouting at me. I was absolutely devastated and felt attacked. I had a history if being in a DV relationship, and this was traumatizing. I spent my entire lunch crying and wasn't allowed to be sent home.

This week the boss put me on that station three more times, including an 12 hour long shift without asking me if I was able to work it or if I'd be okay. In fact, I was scheduled for almost 60 hours for both this week and next week, and on three different instances I'd been scheduled from 10am to 9:30pm.

Before my Monday shift, which was supposed to be at the place I previously was attacked, I had a major panic attack. I ended up telling HR everything that happened, which they were sympathetic towards, and quit with their blessing.

Now I feel like a failure though that I wasn't able to stick it out those last 2 weeks to leave on a happy note. I'm afraid I'll never have a job that cool again and that I'll regret it the rest of my life. At the same time I know having a job that put so much stress on me and didn't allow me to make doctors or therapy appointments was slowly ruining my health, and that no amount of money (especially minimum wage) is worth that.

Do you guys think I'm being too sensitive about all of this? Or did I just make a huge mistake? Is it really a big deal to quit a job without notice in this situation given that it was a temporary position for minimum wage and it was hurting my mental and physical health?",21Aug2018,1

339,"I'm 34 and broke.  I've spent my life since high school working a series of shitty jobs and basically just treading water, barely keeping the bills paid.  My wife makes decent money, but our son was born 16 months ago, and I stopped working to stay home with him and be a full-time dad, mainly because daycare would have cost more than I was making.  As-is, we are barely scraping by.

I have a lot of regrets about how I've treated myself and my life, but I now have a genuine opportunity to change.  My grandfather has offered to pay for any education I choose and the childcare to make it happen, provided I choose a career, determine the education I need, and basically grow up and follow through.  I want to do this, and I need to do it for the sake of my family, and it needs to happen quickly.  I'm not getting any younger.

My grandfather (a retired architect/carpenter) has strongly suggested I choose a trade school and become a carpenter, pipefitter, boilermaker, machinist, electrician, etc.  His opinion is that a paid apprenticeship makes the most sense for me, and that I'm well-suited for a trade.  I do enjoy physical work, seeing a job come together, being able to build or fix things using specialized tools and techniques, and learning new things.  However, I do have concerns that skilled trade jobs may not be as in-demand or lucrative as some believe.  

I wonder if it might be smarter to actually go to school and do some variety of computer science.  It's one thing I've always wanted to do, but I wonder too if it's a saturated job market where I'm at a disadvantage due to my age and having no coding experience since writing HTML from scratch in high school.

To be honest, I don't care much what I end up doing.  To me, it's more about doing a good job, putting in your all, and providing a valuable service.  My satisfaction and sanity will come from working hard and supporting my family, and that's all I really care about at this point.  I just can't fail at this.  And I can't tell what the smart option is for me.  I have done pretty poorly with my life up to this point, so I barely trust my own judgment anymore.  I have some lunches scheduled to talk to successful people I respect and get their opinions, but I was hoping to also get advice from people who are in skilled trades, computer sciences, or even unrelated fields that just need workers and provide job security and decent wages.

Idk if something’s wrong with me but I get anxiety when messaging her.  Maybe it’s because she refers to me as hun and other thing a mom would refer to her child.

I feel like shit because I spent all this time looking for her and she was praying I would find her. But now that it’s actually happened I feel almost overwhelmed and I don’t really want to talk to her.

350,"I feel like I can't turn to my friends and family for advice... so dear OP... please help. 

My BF and I have been together a little over 2 years, I have had doubts through the whole relationship, but he has always made me feel comfortable and secure, something I have lacked in other relationships. I love him deeply, but more and more I feel like their is a lack of passion that scares me. His only passion is for football and beer trading. He makes virtually no effort in the relationship, despite me telling him exactly what I need to be happy. I even wrote him out a ""cheat sheet"" with tips on how to make me feel loved in our relationship... but it has long since been forgotten.  I feel more like his mother and caretaker than I do his lover. I cook for him every meal, if I am not there to cook he doesn't eat. I plan us dates, vacations, and leave him love notes in the hopes that he will do the same to me.. but he never does. I have brought all this up to him and he got emotional saying he was just trying to make me happy, and knows I like to do these things for him, and when he asks a million questions (which inevitably leads me to doing whatever task I was trying to get him to do) he says it's because he just wants to do it right for me. 

Don't get me wrong he is a great guy. He says that he cares about me a lot. He never gets upset with me or says a bad word about me. I love the way he feels next to me when we sleep and I used to picture a perfect life for us together. 

We moved in together last month. I thought that once we got settled the stress of moving would be gone and we would go back to happy and carefree. But then he lost his job. I have tried to help him, sent him postings to apply to, edited his resume, and then even typed out thank you emails to send to people he interviewed with.. but its been a month and he has applied to maybe 15 places, and seems content to sit at home playing video games. I come home and am expected to make dinner and cheer him up, and I just don't think I can take it anymore. We have only lived with each other for a month... am I jumping the gun, do I need to give him time to adjust and pull himself together? I do love him, and care about him so much. But I keep dreaming about a man who I don't have to take care of, a man who takes care of me...

351,"23-years-old, Finance degree from a good university and working as a bank teller. 

Pay is decent for what I do ($16/hour), but how do I go higher? All the $40k-$50k+ jobs all require 5+ experience that I’m not getting as a bank teller, and I don’t want to go higher in retail banking due to hating customer service- having to deal with the public is contributing to my depression because I’m naturally an introvert and have to force myself to change my personality daily.

Every time I see finance jobs such as financial analyst positions, they all require 7+ years of financial analysis experience and 5+ years of statistical work and things of that nature. I’m not sure how to move out of the $14/hour-$16/hour jobs. Everything I qualify for only pay my current wage or less. How do I climb over this wall to start making serious money? ",21Aug2018,1
352,"I don't really know where to start but I just really need to write this out and hopefully get some responses.

I admittedly have a very anxious and depressive disposition, however, I am on drugs to manage that. My life written down does seem pretty good: own car, full time job, heading back to uni for post graduate study in January, boyfriend and future husband of 5 years (we have our entire elopement planned in 1.5 years) and currently on holiday in Italy. I'm just having a hard time mentally with a lot of things and I don't really feel I can reach out for friends and family for a number of reasons.

I moved home after living abroad last year and was severely bullied in my job there and it soured the whole experience. Everything that happens still continues to have an effect on me today. I also have had a difficult relationship with my brother and sister-in-law during the time I've been with my boyfriend. I'm one of those people that will shower new people with tons of love and affection and gifts, not to necessary 'buy' it but I guess to show my love and affection to them in an actual way? Maybe gift giving is my love language? But then I find that people are never this generous back and no matter how amazing or generous my gift is, it doesn't seem to get the reaction I expected nor the end results, whatever that may be?

Since the bad experience, I've lost a lot of trust and faith in people. Some family members have not kept private things I have told them and I guess I have learnt my lesson with that and know not to tell them stuff. I struggle to get on with my family members (mum, dad and three siblings) and on reflection, I realise that they are all extremely dismissive of my opinions, thoughts and feelings. They are disrespectful towards my property and I'm interrupted when talking. I question my personality and style of thinking so much. I've been called 'crazy' by people who know me well as well as those who don't (some random careers counsellor) and Ive also been told that I seem 'hostile because I laugh at the end of my sentences'.

There's a lot of people in my life who I love and are important to me but despite my extensive travelling alone around the world and living in various places, I find a lot of people (mainly parents on both sides) feel the need to give a lot of advice. It makes me feel very belittled as well as suggesting to me that they think I'm incapable of looking after myself as an adult and I think that contributes to me no longer wanting to talk to people. 

I feel so lost in to how to act, balance relationships without suffering myself as well as feeling comfortable in my personality whether people like it or not. It's resulted in a slow journey I guess to stop talking to people to avoid being given unwanted advice (like make sure you bring water to this super popular tourist attraction!). I don't want to wreck relationships and then regret it down the line but I'm at a loss of how to balance all these thoughts and just feel I'm suffering a lot.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated. ",21Aug2018,2

Theres nothing to claim, but insisted that if he finds something wrong with his truck he would call. I told him he can drive it and if theres something wrong we can call our insurance on the spot. He said he was to busy and insisted that he will make the call later if he finds something wrong with his truck. I told him if hes serious to call right now and not to hold it off. He then drove off and I had to follow him. I called the police and they got a report in. Even the officer said there was no damage to either vehicle only if he wants to call an insurance advisor to check it it would be more money for him. He couldnt do anything since the guy didnt want to call but I wanted to be safe he didnt claim something false on his end because there was no damage.

Am I in the wrong? should I expect a call from my insurance? Nothing gets damaged going 2mph and he had the bigger vehicle so if there was damage it would of been noticable.

354,"My friend's sister is suicidal, and we don't know what to do. 

I want to preface this by saying that I don't know her sister very well; I've only talked to her a handful of times. I'm not personally involved with preventing her suicide or anything, but I've been offering ideas and talking to my friend about it. Unfortunately, it seems like we're out of options. 

The sister (Who we'll call X) doesn't really have any friends, hobbies, or professional ambitions. She still lives with her parents. X has tried most of the conventional treatments for depression. She's been on and off of SSRIs for many years and refuses to try them again. She's been to several therapists, but won't open up because she doesn't trust them (She admitted some serious problems to a therapist once and police were at her door the next day). She (involuntarily) spent some time in a psychiatric ward, which temporarily prevented her from killing herself, but made things worse in the long run. She's tried self help and expressive hobbies like art, but none of it eases her pain. She says she just wants to die. 

X recently took a trip to Canada to see her only real friend and long-time love interest (We'll call him Y). Y told X's mother that he thinks that X will kill herself after this trip. During her time in Canada, X met Y's girlfriend. That same day, X cut her wrists and left the bloody knife lying on Y's sink. X is getting back home today, and we're all convinced that she's going to kill herself in the next week or two. 

X's mom got in contact with one of her old therapists, who suggested taking her straight from the airport to psych (she can have X involuntarily institutionalized because she has evidence that X is a serious danger to herself). We don't know what to do. 

If she's still willing to try treatment, her mom is thinking about electroconvulsive therapy, but even that might not work. We're running out of ideas and time. What should we do? ",21Aug2018,2

We didn't keep much contact after that but I've always thought of her and haven't forgotten these feelings, though I still fell for another girl after a while. Anyway, she texted me about a month ago, just a picture of us and ""I miss you ❤️"", I told her I missed her a lot too and that I hoped to see her soon if everything goes well for me.

362,"Been a supervisor for about 3 months now and still trying to get the hang of it. I am a pretty by the books type of person, which I think irritates some team members a bit when I get on them do their listed tasks or ask them to do things. 

I have a hard time knowing when I am going or pushing too much in asking them to do things. This is especially relevant when closing comes around since most of the team in closing wants to get out and just get home as opposed to doing a good job, then leaving.  This mainly comes down to individual work ethic, but when they usually mess up I just say, ""Fuck it"" internally and just do it myself. I should be forcing them to do it, but it just gets to me with the lack of care to do anything I just do it myself. 

I guess any and all advice is wanted here, not even on what I have put, but overall on what are good steps to takes and how to administer a healthier work environment for other coworkers, but also knowing when to put my foot down if it comes too it.

364,"My mom has always been emotionally abusive. She’s the type that would throw things I cared about away when I would forget to clean my room or didn’t clean it well enough (when I was 12 and under). She would take my phone away if I wouldn’t stop talking to people she didn’t like which resulted in me not having my phone for 3 months when I was dating my ex. She even threatened to take my phone away when I switched to my dad’s plan. I would talk to my current boyfriend on the phone late at night and unintentionally kept my brother up two nights in a row. That came up in an argument that started after I’d take short naps almost every day from community college and didn’t do my homework immediately like she wanted me to. She then kicked me out of the house so I called my dad to help me come get my stuff. While I was packing to leave, she came back and said that I should stay. But she now tells people that she kicked me out in a “moment of bravery”. When I weighed 125 pounds in my senior year of high school she told me I should run on the treadmill because I was starting to get chubby. She insults my father in front of my brother and I (they’re divorced) even though she knows it bothers us. Plus she constantly says things that she KNOWS bother me then gets mad at me when I bring it up.

Bringing this back to now... Any time I bring up a problem I have with her or with anything in general, she ALWAYS brings it back to her. Just the other day she was on my ass about something I couldn’t control and compared me to my father. It very much upset me and I let her know. She, the narcissist as usual, started yelling at me saying, “you two weren’t the only ones hurt by him, you know?” Which I understand, but she completely avoided my piece of it. The thing she’s loved lately is basically saying that my relationship is shit because my boyfriend and I argue too much (we do sometimes but this is a separate issue) and basically is trying to say he’s like my dad - again, something she’s been told bothers me dozens of times - even though he’s not. She’s always had a way of knowing just what to say to upset me and chip away at my self esteem then somehow bring it back to herself. Every time she says something critical, it’s my fault for taking it the wrong way. Every time she insults me, it’s my low self esteem issues.

My main problem is that, other than my brother, she’s the only one left in my family I can talk to about things. A lot of the time she has good advice and knows how to calm me down when I’m spiraling. But she’s so narcissistic I don’t know if she’s capable of thinking of things as unselfishly as she thinks she does.

I know how unrealistic it would’ve been and that it would, more than likely, not have lead to anything serious, yet I can’t really get over the fact, because we had such a good time together, and didn’t split because of fights/obvious reasons why someone would split. I sort of definitely saw it coming though, and I know it is for the best, but I feel like even though I know it, I can’t be happy with the thought of it and the memory and just let it go, especially because even though we had such a good connection other than the romantic one, obviously we do not talk anymore and I don’t really see that happening in the future either, which also means I lost a “friend” who I could casually have great conversations with.

380,"I have a memory from my childhood that has been troubling me for years. I just need to make sense of it once and for all. So here goes...   


I grew up in a smallish town. I mean, it was large enough to have a lot of city amenities, but it was still small enough so that most people knew each other or at least, knew them within at least two degrees of separation.   


My dad was away quite a lot with work when I was between 8 and 12, but other than that, my childhood was pretty normal. My mom worked part-time and raised me and my younger brother. My dad had his hobbies and so did my mom. She was very much into caring for birds - owls, sparrows, robins, woodtits, even an injured hawk once or twice. She was always feeding them and going on bird-watching trips (I know, yawn!). We had a few cages beside our house, near the side entrance, where my mom would house injured birds until they were well enough to be released.   


Well, one day, a friend of my dad's who was working as postman came to our house to do the mail deliveries. He was very upset. My mom was asking him what was wrong. It seems he was very upset about being told he would have to deliver TWICE the normal amount of mail without any extra pay from then on. He was crying and shouting. The weird thing is, he had brought along a strange kind of shoulder-held air-blowing device, kind of like a reverse vacuum cleaner. Apparently he had adapted one of the machines from the sorting office that was used to quickly 'shoot' mail into the right delivery bag, once it had been sorted.   


The mailman told my mom he had put a kind of shredder inside the air-blower, and he was so angry that he felt like taking all the mail he had and just feeding it into the machine, and shredding it all. My mom was trying to talk him out of it, telling him that he might lose his job, and that he should come inside the house for a little while and she would make him a cup of tea. I was watching through the side door, the one that led to the bird cages, as my mom stood on the steps beside the bird cages trying to talk sense as the man was waving the air-blower around, crying while he did so. The birds in the cages - a group of baby woodtits, as I recall - were flapping around and getting agitated by all the commotion. And then all of a sudden THE MAN SHOT HIS HEAVY MAIL LOAD ALL OVER MY MOM'S T ITS INSTEAD OF COMING INSIDE LIKE SHE WANTED!!

382,"This girl is so goddamn annoying. Starting fights with my brother in front of me when I’m there to have fun with my bro, always asking for shit (I wanna be like “bitch, you don’t know me like that! Stop asking me for shit”), just generally inconveniencing others.

Like today my brother is moving out of his house. I get there to help him move and his gf is gone. The house is barely packed. I’m like “Dude... wtf?” He then tells me his gf said they should wait until the day of the move, but when today came she conveniently needed to go to her cousins house. But she showed up after an hour and a half and disappeared again.

Then, later my brother, mother, and I got hungry so we agreed to get 2 pizzas. My bro took the u-haul to the house and I went to the pizza junt with his gf. We get there and she asks if I’m getting both pizzas, I laughed and said “no”. So after I order my pizza the cashier asks if she’s getting something also.. guess what the dumb bitch said. Just guess. I’ll wait...

This bitch said, “no”. She has my brother’s debit card in her pocket but she doesn’t get the second pizza so our mom could eat also. Reddit, forgive me for saying this, but I wanted to slap this dumb hoe across a table right there in the middle of Marco’s. I really wanted to.

I’m so fucking tired of this dumb bitch!! What the fuck is wrong with her? And how do I stop caring about this shit? I really can’t talk to my brother about it. I mean, I could, but I try to refrain from telling people how their children (gf’s included) should behave. 

I just want to NOT have the urge to cuss the bitch out or slap the shit out her when she pisses me off. I try to keep my headphones in as much as possible when she’s around, but in situations like this, I can’t escape the annoyances.

394,"I'm turning 18 tomorrow. It's weird because most people are excited to finally be a legal adult. There are a few perks but overall I don't care that much. I'm going into my senior year of high school and will graduate next June. My plans are to go to a community college to save money and because I'm not ready to leave home yet. My entire life I've always said I want to go into teaching but lately I've considered other things. I want a job with livable wages where I don't have to completely exhaust myself life my dad did. He's been a factory worker his entire life and has lived paycheck to paycheck and still continuously struggles now while waiting to hopefully be approved for disability because he cannot stand long periods of time anymore like most labor jobs require. I've already decided that I do not want that for myself and I know my parents don't either. 

I'm my parents last kid. My mom had my two siblings (both in their 30s) before she met my dad and had me years later. I'm my dad's only kid. When my older sister moved out my mom took it really hard. I don't remember it because I was still little but my mom is really emotional and protective. I know that moving out will have to come eventually but I really don't want to hurt my parents &amp; the change that comes with it. On the other hand, I still want my own life and experiences. My parents are both in their mid to late 50s. Although that's not extremely old I can barely stand thinking about losing them. Most people my age have younger parents and will have them around for likely a longer period of time than I'll have mine. Their health is ok despite a few things. My older brother is 30 and entirely lacks independence, a job, and never finished school. I love him but I don't wanna be 30 still living at home as it has took a pretty toll on him but that's a long story. Lol. 

I have a job. I'm going to try to get my license soon. I don't have much experience yet and drivers training is VERY expensive here so I decided to wait until I was 18 so I didn't have to legally pay for that. I really don't know what should come next. I understand everyone moves at different paces but thinking about everyone else I've grew up leaving home in a year or so while I'm still attached to what I have now is a little stressful. We're not very well off nor do we have much and I do know that I want to be a able to live more of a fulfilling lifestyle when I'm older. My parents also want that. I still have time to think about everything so any advice is welcomed.

396,"Hi all,

I'll try and keep the story short. Excuse me for my English.

So I've recently started working at this place and got to know a guy who seems like a nice and funny guy. He asked me for some money because apparently he had problems with his bank card or something (red flag - very strange story). I gave him the money because I felt like whatever, let's 'trust/believe' him. I told him I'll give you the money but I do need it back at the end of the week. 

One day later he asks me if he can lend some more money because he really needs it to travel and eat and is desperate because he can't find someone else (including family he told me). I told him that what he asked for I cannot give him (we are talking about 30ish here); then he asked me can you maybe give me 1/3 of that. I've decided to give him that with the agreement that I'll get everything back at the end of the week (naive I guess).

What should I do if I don't get my money back at the end of the week and how to deal with people like this (I was shocked that someone who barely knows me and is a new colleague asks me for money, I mean where I'm from you don't ask anyone for money LET ALONE SOMEONE YOU BARELY KNOW..), should I delete him if I don't get my money back or confront him first alone and otherwise in front of the other colleagues? I probably shouldn't have lend him the money in the first place. But given the sad story I was like, whatever, hes a new colleague and surely there's something wrong with his card.

But then the next day he needs more? This can't be good. How to deal with this situation? Keep in my mind hes a 'colleague'.

398,"I posted this in r/relationships but I think it will fit here too. Looking for any insight.

*(Also - this post got ridiculously long - the gist is that she's abusive and I cut ties, you can start reading @ ""The Dilemma."")*

My fiance (together 3 years) and I are recently engaged, and plan to get married next year around summertime. We want to have a small wedding (I'm talking like 10 people max - immediate family and a few close friends), however will likely have a large reception to celebrate.

As I am thinking of who to invite, there is one person in particular that I know I don't want to invite, but I feel guilty, because she's my mother. Let's dive into our history:

**My Mother**

I should mention that she is Korean, so a lot of her actions \*might\* make sense with a Korean-filtered lens.

Long story short, she is a very abusive woman - physically and mentally. My entire life has been a battle with her, or so it feels. In her eyes, I am never good enough. Here is a list of things she's pointed out and disapproved of:

*- My weight.* Apparently I'm too fat. There was a point when I was 120lbs, and at 5'10'' that's really thin. People told me I looked sick - my mom told me I looked fat. I got braces when I was in middle school, and I couldn't eat because my teeth were so sore. My mother said, ""Good, now you won't eat too much because you're so fat.""

\- *My looks.* She loves to take me down a peg, and I realize looking back it's her own insecurities she projecting, but they still bug me to this day. She said I had a huge ugly nose (which she later admitted she only said that because she was jealous of my nose). She told me I had no chin and needed implants (still super insecure about my soft chin), and that my legs were like huge hams.

*- My intelligence.* I remember in 3rd grade I came home super excited about my report card. (We didn't have the traditional A, B, C grades, it was more like C, S, and F - honestly I forgot what they stood for), but I got all C's (which was the best score) and she slapped me across the face, saying ""How dare you bring those grades home!"" (Korean-ness coming out). My dad had to convince her they were ""A's"".

*- My career choice.* I joined the military and she was so embarrassed by it, she told her family I went to a prestigious university and was studying medicine. Honestly, the job I had in the military was pretty difficult to get into, and I learned a new language in the process (Korean actually - which she refused to speak to me with because I was terrible and it wasn't worth her time) - still not good enough.

\- *My presents.* You'll probably laugh at this one - this one will show how selfish and materialistic my mother is. I love giving gifts, and after my first year in the military I finally had enough money to share the wealth and hand-pick gifts for everyone. I got my mother a beautiful purse with a matching scarf - I knew it was her taste. She just snuffed at it and said, ""Why didn't you just give me money?"" I broke down to my dad - who loved my gifts by the way.

**The Abuse**

As I mentioned, my mother was, and is pretty abusive. She would take me in car rides to beat me because if she did it in front of my dad he would stop her. So she took matters in her own hands. She loved using wooden utensils - spoons, spatulas, you name it. She broke a number of them on me. Even as I look back, her punishing me was never to teach me a lesson - she did it out of pure rage, because she couldn't control herself. Her face would get all red, and she would hit with all her strength.

After I moved out (not really by choice - long story short she was sitting on my chest chocking me and my dad sent me to my grandparents) things seemed fine. I would call once in a while, but as you can clearly see, I'm not too attached to my mother so I didn't call every week - maybe once a month or every other month.

Well that never sat well with her. She would complain to my father that I never called her. Well the reason I never called her was because every conversation went like this:

Me: ""Hey mom!""  
Mom: ""Why don't you ever call?""

Me: ""Sorry mom I've just been busy and haven't been keeping track of time..""

Mom: ""You never call, why do I even bother? You're never going to call me. When are you going to take care of your mother?"" (She believes that I should take care of her when she gets old because that's Korean tradition - but I'm not the eldest, and I'm not her son. She likes to pick and choose what rules apply to her).

**The Last Straw**

The last straw was when I last visited my parents over 2 years ago. I usually went home to visit over the holidays. I got to see my dad, my little brother, the family dog, and my mother. Well - she acted very cold to me. I literally went up for a hug and she turned away. Hugged her anyway.

We were planning on driving to another state the following morning to visit other family, but the car broke down a couple of hours in. While my brother and dad frantically tried to fix the issue, I went ahead and tried to call for help. My mom sat in the car doing nothing, and I remember asking for a pen to write down a number, and she aggressively said ""I don't have a pen."" I looked at her and said, ""You can either give me one of your six pens I know you have in your gigantic purse, or we can just all sit here and wait for no one.""

After this trip I decided to cut my mother out. I never called her except on holidays and her birthday but she never picked up - straight to voicemail. Then proceeds to complain to dad ""Why does my daughter never call me?!""

**The Dilemma**

I haven't spoken to my mother in nearly 2 years now (except once by accident because I was trying to reach someone else but she answered. It was awkward).

I will say, since I have cut off communications, I don't have nightmares about her anymore (it used to be once a week, where I wake up in a panic, or I have nightmares where we are physically fighting). Life has been good.

My dad keeps begging me to talk to her - be the bigger man and just call. But I'm tired of being the bigger person. She is the mother, I am the child (though adult).

So with all that backstory, here I am asking for advice. I don't know if I should invite her to my wedding next year. I fear that it's going to be a disaster where she will start a fight with me, or that she'll be cold. With such a small wedding it's going to be uncomfortable for everyone. A part of me feels guilty because she is my mother and she raised me through some hard times. But those hard times don't justify the abuse that followed.

I guess I'm asking for justification. Or if not - how do I proceed the situation delicately? Do I bite the bullet and start talking to her now so that by this time next year we'll be decent (at best) and have her at the wedding?

**TL;DR** *I have a very strained relationship with my mother. We haven't spoken in years. She's physically beaten me, verbally abused me, and made fun of me my whole life. I finally cut her out and feel better without her. My wedding is next year and I'm starting to feel guilty because I don't know if I should invite her or not. Need some outside perspective.*",21Aug2018,1

I have seen a two bed apartment which is nice &amp; affordable &amp; my father could stay in the other bedroom which would be my sons most of the time. I am due to go view it tomorrow but I am a little concerned as it is a First floor apartment &amp; the only access is from a steep set of concrete steps that my Father would really struggle getting up. I have mentioned it my Father &amp; he said I should do what I feel is right &amp; if I like the apartment then I should go for it. 

My heart is saying not to take it &amp; wait for something more appropriate for my Father but he is saying go for it.

Any advice please?",21Aug2018,1
415,"My girlfriend and I are in our senior year of high school. She's taking a couple AP courses, and the rest are honors. She's a very back and forth person. Sometimes she's extremely motivated to do one specific task and will not rest until it's done. Other times she's super lazy, or at least wants to be, and has little to no motivation for anything. Is there anything I can do to help her? She's in this slump where she just doesn't want to do anything and I just feel useless.

418,"Three months ago my ex finished with me and i was/still am absolutely devastated. I begged her for a few weeks for her to come back telling her that I would change (bad idea I know). But after i stopped doing that i sent her a letter and some flowers basically saying i am going to get some counselling and help to sort my issues out. I specifically said in the letter if you have no intention of ever getting back with me then please never contact me again so i can try and heal from this situation and move on. She never reached out to me after that.

So we hadn't been in contact for two months, then all of a sudden she text me at 4am on a Thursday morning when she was drunk telling me that we cant be together but she still has feelings for me. I replied in a none desperate way basically saying i felt the same but i am not the same person i was in the relationship and am now an improved version of myself. She said that's amazing im really happy for you and that she wanted to phone me. I declined this phone call as i said talk to me tomorrow if you would like to talk to me, i do not want to talk to you drunk. But when i woke up in the morning i had once again been blocked from being able to contact her.

So the day after i message her through a separate instagram account basically saying i am still interested and i do still miss her as well and that i'm sorry if i came across as a jerk the other night. She once again said we cant be together and that she cant be with anyone at all because she has a new job coming up in September that she wants to focus on. But she still admitted she cares for me and still has feelings. I then turned a bit bitter and it got a bit heated to which she replied see this shows me that you haven't changed at all and it brings back negative emotions from the relationship. I wrote a last message saying that i had changed and i wouldn't hurt her again in the future and if she would like to talk to me i'm always here for a conversation.

​

The problem is i wish i didn't text her again the day after and instead left her wanting more. Now i feel like she has power over the situation as i basically begged her once again to come back to me. What should i do? i love this girl so much and all i want to do is win her back, but i feel like im fighting a losing battle and i just want to be able to have her back in my life. She made me so happy and the last three months have been hell for me. The reason we broke up was that i was too insecure and wanted to see her too much. This became too overwhelming for her.

Can someone help me? or give me some advice. Thanks

433,"Hey Reddit. I could really use some help on this one.

I'm a sophomore in college. I dated this guy for just over a year between my sophomore and junior years in high school. We broke up for a lot of reasons: we both had depression and I felt like he was just handing me the worst parts of him every day. He was constantly negative, in such a way that it ruined our prom  (he refused to dance with me for more than half a song because his foot hurt and he wouldn't shut up about it and got angry with me for suggesting he leave the table) and other social events with our friend group. He also was very interested in the sexual part of our relationship, to the point where he tried to go farther than I wanted to. To his credit, he stopped as soon as I said no, but after that I couldn't let him kiss me or even really touch me because it felt icky. At one point I considered getting back together with him but couldn't get over how bad him touching me made me feel.

Now, we went to small school and he was a really good friend of mine before we started dating. So going into senior year I was aiming to try to stay friends-- if anything for the sake of less awkward days. At first, he was short with me, but eventually we began talking again. We became really good friends and texted almost every day. We talked about our relationship and I thought we had closed the book on it... but no. I started going out with another guy (a different shit show for a different time :P) and he got icy again. He got angry when I would post anything about my relationship on social media, claiming I was ""rubbing it in"". He hasn't dated anyone after me. Eventually I got sick of that shit and called him out on it. Eventually he shut up about it and became my friend again.

My first year of college was hard. I go to school out of state, and was in a long distance relationship that went bad for half that time. My depression and anxiety hit record levels thanks to working, class, relationship shit, and roommate drama. I'm pretty sure I had a nervous breakdown. (I've been going to therapy and it's really helping). He was there through all of it. AGAIN, I asked multiple times if he still had feelings for me or if I was saying too much or too personal things. He says no, at least none that he would ever dream of acting on, and he understands that I'm different and don't want to be with him. He said it was all okay, that he was my friend and wanted to be there for me. He helped me, a lot, and I helped him in return when the nights were really bad and when he made the choice to go on medication for his depression.

He was excited to hang out this summer. So was I, initially, since we go to college in different states and I was excited to see him. After all, we texted so much I thought it would be natural. But when we did see each other... well, we haven't hung out in person since we dated. And he fell back into a lot of the physical patters we used to have: touching my nose, hand on my knee, elbowing me... and the icky feeling just came back full force. Like, I avoided physically being around him for the rest of the summer icky. We still texted because hell: he doesn't have a driver's licence, no actual job... just not much going on. And then he would come to me (working 30 hours a week and able to get out and do things) and complain about how stuck he feels. He could fix it. But he hasn't. By now I have run out of positivity and sunshine to sprinkle on the situation. But I felt like I owed him my best effort.

My friends and ex-boyfriend have insisted that he still has a thing for me. I recognize that and have spoken to him about it MULTIPLE TIMES. But he claims that he knows I don't want that and won't do anything. He doesn't have a lot of friends to begin with and I don't want to be a bitch for leaving him without someone to talk to. He's also listened to so much of my shit that it feels disloyal to walk away. I've been talking to him less and less, and he says he's ""giving me the space [he] thinks I need"". But honestly, Reddit? This is exhausting. I feel like I always need a guard up now, like I always have to be watching for signs of attraction and shutting them down ASAP. It's exhausting and making me paranoid and I don't know what to do.

437,"I met this girl that I work with and I became very close with her very fast. It started around February and it was just simple things like snapchatting and talking at work. At the time I had a girlfriend and her relationship status was unclear. When I broke up with my girlfriend we became even closer and it got to the point where we were sending each other novels hourly every day for about two months. I initiated the first move and I was the one who started opening up to her because I thought that she was just a girl that was very interested in me and I always thought there was going to be some potential that we could be more than friends if I ever was available and I thought she was available which is where I was completely wrong. Every social media she added me on she was single with not a trace of a boyfriend within two years, so I assumed that she was single and continued to enhance our friendship or relationship. I found out from another coworker that she was in a relationship of four or more years which really upset me. I asked her why she failed to mention him and her response was that I never asked and that also they were in a rough patch and she did not consider him to be a boyfriend at the time. To me that meant stick around because I like you but I’m dealing with something right now. So I did stick around for about a month and during that time we were still talking and very cordial towards each other but it was different, and I had just been fed up with waiting so I came clean to her. I told her I had feelings for her and she said oh no I am happily in a relationship at the moment and I’m sorry you feel that way I wish we could’ve worked something out. I was very confused because I thought that what she was saying to me a little while ago when I found out about her boyfriend meant that things were not good with him but little did I know that a rough patch can be easily fixed within the course of three weeks and I just felt used and hurt but she still wanted to be friends and I said sure whatever but things were really different as in I was not responding promptly and I really just wasn’t feeling it at all. She then the next night after I told her how I felt send me a Snapchat of her on his lap with the caption along the lines of I love how tall he is. So that is really irritated me because I told her how I felt and she said oh no I’m happy with him and then decides to rub in my face. This not only destroyed me but it also just put me in a really really really weird mental funk and I decided that I just wanted to cut her out of my life completely and that’s what I told her, I said I didn’t want to talk to her anymore if she was happy with her boyfriend and I felt like I was being used. I said I appreciate you as a friend but I don’t view you as a friend and this isn’t fair for going to do this if I don’t view you as a friend and you view me as just a friend.Little did I know that that would be a huge mistake because it created a hostile environment. We were both passive aggressive towards each other and there is definitely something going on there. But I continue to ignore it and assumed that everything would figure itself out and work could become fun and enjoyable again like it was. 

About two more months past and nothing is getting better at work, So I decided to text her and say that I wanted to meet up with her. I wanted to discuss working with her because it was just a very uncomfortable situation and I was on the fence about quitting just because of her and I thought that was ridiculous and that all things can be worked out. So we hung out for a couple hours which flew by and I just thanked her for being a good friend and I asked her if when we were really close like if there was any romantic feelings. I wanted to ask her face-to-face because last time she gave me answers that had double meanings and I just wanted to get a straightforward yes or no from her and not have to wait and deal with the texting and all the annoying stuff. Her response to that was it’s fucked up to say it but I don’t know how to say it and I said it’s either yes or no and then she said yes but it feels really wrong saying it and I said OK if that’s the case then where are you now I said are you over it or not and she said I don’t know if I should say it and I said it’s either yes or no and she said yes. She then continued to tell me that I’m somebody that she feels like she can always talk to about anything anytime anywhere and I can always run late and I feel the exact same way. The only issue is that she is still with her boyfriend and she just confessed feelings for me I have no idea what to do or even where to go from here I am just absolutely obsessed with hair and everything that she’s doing and I cannot stop thinking about her and I just want to know how to stop or where to go. I want to know what role he plays in her life if I’m somebody that she can always talk then what the hell is he? I’m so frustrated with this entire situation and I cannot tell if I’m being strung along or if she’s serious, all I know is that the day I did hang out with her, I felt really high on life and it was probably the best day of my summer, but the next day I realized that she’s not mine to have fun with and I’ve been pretty down ever since.

When I went to the doctors concerning my height they said that I need to get more calories in me (was never aware that this was an issue? i noticed my height but I always thought I ate fine?) They said I was ""in puberty"" but technically I have been ""in puberty"" since 6th grade. I haven't had any significant changes. Sometimes my voice sounds like it is deepening but it reverts like the next day. Sometimes I look taller and then when I check it looks like I shrunk. 

I have only been losing weight really. It is a struggle for me to gain any significant pounds. I have stagnated and dropped 2 within 4 or so years.

Anyway, I was in class and it was kinda cold. I thought that I smelled something but I wasn't really sure. There was someone sitting next to me and I think he noticed. He started laughing at nothing and turned over talking to a girl. They started laughing together and some others did. When they walked out I saw her look at me and she quickly turned away.

I couldn't smell anything when I left class.

I go to my next class and they still are looking over and laughing. I don't understand what it was. I saw her point at me laughing and she started sniffing (they thought I couldn't see them).

I've looked up things and I eat healthy. I'm having trouble dealing with this because it isn't a common occurrence. but I find that people are always whispering things behind my back so I am worried it has always been this way.

I'm thinking it MAY have been the area I was sitting at and it affected me, because up until then there was no odor. However, this followed me so I think I was the problem.

I smelled my clothes and there was a smell but it wasn't horrible or anything. I've sniffed myself and i'm fine so maybe I sat in something. I took a shower today and I feel kinda sick (stomach issues/gagging) so MAYBE they could smell the 'sickness' on me?

I am afraid to go back.

This is silly and irrational but I can't deal with these kind of things. I was kinda sad at first but then I just got more irritable and pissed off. One time I took a week off from school because of the stress. There were people laughing and making jokes and I couldn't deal with it.

I wasn’t ready to move out at 18, and 2.) I wanted to save money. So while my friends went off to UF and other big universities, I’m here in my small town going to community college. Which I am totally ok with. For now. However, I want to start drafting a plan for me to move out at 21. I started officially August 17th, since it was my first paycheck at my new job. Prior to this job I was working inconsistent hours at a retail position. Now that I’m getting over 500 dollars bi-weekly, I’ve decided to start budgeting for my future.  I figured that I would be complete with my AA at 21 the latest. It typically would only take a person to complete their AA by 20, but since I’m working full time I have to factor in that I won’t always be working a full course load. So I’m figuring 3 years max for my AA. So, if I put away 100 dollars a pay check for three years that’s 3,600 dollars by the time I’m ready to move out. Not including bonus checks I’ll be putting away for this and other factors. Now here’s where it gets hard. I want to move to California. Pretty much the most expensive state for cost of living in the US. But if other people can do it, so can I- right? Does this all just seem like a pipe dream? I’m not saying I need to park it right in the heart of L.A or in Beverly Hills. But I’ve always seen myself living in California. And I currently live in the Orlando area, and have visited California before so it’s not like it would be such a culture shock. As far as finances, do you think 3600 is even relatively close to enough money to start out with? I may move out with a s/o but for my own purposes I’d rather not factor that in because that’s a huge risk to take into account an entire other person when nothing is certain. I want to be able to rely on just myself for this one. 
TLDR: Do you guys have any tips for moving out at 21 across the country to one of the most expensive states, California?? What can I do as an 18 year old in the next three years to financially and mentally prepare for this huge step. Am I crazy?",21Aug2018,1
443,"I have a friend that I really only see at school. We're not super close, but he can be really funny, if not a little annoying at times. Today, he came out to me as a furry. This was a shock to me, as he is the last person on Earth I'd expect to be one. I'm the only person who knows this. Not even his own family knows. He said that I'm the only person he can really trust telling. I can't look at him the same way anymore. It's like I don't know him. He told not to tell a soul about it, so the only place I can is on the internet. 

I also want to put it out there that I don't hate furries or anything, I just don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle choice. I'll remain friends with him and do my best to support him. ",21Aug2018,13
444,"I've only been working at this job for a few weeks but I love it. Part of the job is sending out a mass e-mail to customers. Usually, we use a program that bbc's automatically, but this program won't allow me to send a link. I needed to attach a link so I used my work e-mail and maxed out the number of e-mails I could send out at 1 time, which is 100. I did this 4 times (400 people)  before I realized that everyone was going to be able to see each other's private e-mails. That's when I learned what bbc was.

I'm mortified right now. I've gotten a few e-mails back from customers who were excited about the contents of the e-mail, and one customer who was upset about the leak. That was a couple of hours ago and I haven't heard anything from my higher-ups.

I don't know what to do from here. Should I e-mail everyone back with an apology? I feel like that would just draw attention to the issue and make people upset about something they might not have noticed. Should I tell my higher-ups? I feel like I'd just be telling on myself. I'm really hoping it will just blow over but I'm scared and I don't think I'll be able to rest easy for the next few days. I feel like I should do some damage control but I don't know what or how.

446,"So as the title says I recently had a minor carcrash. No big damage, mainly cosmetic stuff, no one was injured. Insurance covers it all.

(Can you guess where this is going)

At first the girl (24) that crashed into my car was a bit shocked by the event (as this was both our first accident) let alone by my mother who was basically flipping  (adrenaline i guess).
So we both take some photos and move our cars to a nearby parking lot to fill in the insurance paperwork.
By now her dad shows up to help fill in her paperwork while my mother was already filling in my side of the papers (yes i know, not cool when you're a 25m. but there is no stopping her).
Anyway, in the meantime i notice she's getting all teary eyed (probably the shock kicking in) so i try to calm her a bit and tell her there's nothing to be worried about, im not angry this happend, could have happend to anyone. Afterward we sign our part of the papers exchange further contact info (yay girl number) and part our ways. 

Later on while filling in additional paperwork i notice some things where missing, so i give her a call asking to meet again to fill those in. she shows up, we fill everything in, meanwhile  chatting a bit. 
I give her some copies of the files and she leaves.

Now this is where it gets complicated for me and i need advice.

I quite like the gal, based of our al be it short conversations.
And i would like keep the ball rolling  (is that even a thing to say?).
Anyway im in unknown water and i don't want to look like a fool/weirdo.

My social skills are ""ok-ish"", i just run out off things to say pretty quick. 


Tldr: got in a carcrash, started to like the girl that drove int my car. Don't know wat to do next.

He will tell her he'll take care of her financially and turnaround make up reasons why she needs to give him money.

Now, he is starting to involve me in his manipulation games with her. Without being specific, he is basically trying to use me to score better points with her by promising and offering friendly gestures to me since I'm her best friend. He and I don't talk, but he just tells his gf what he wants to offer and watches her get all excited. She told me about yet another ""nice gesture"" recently, and wants me to like him now and be best buddies with him basically.

When I said stop involving me and don't tell me when he drops my name cuz I hate it, now she's mad at me. Thinking that I was being rude by rejecting his offers of nice gestures... But to me, he was never going to fulfill them, he has yet to fulfill any offers he's promised to her.. He banks on polite people saying no, and once he sees that, he offers more, which is why his offers are getting bigger and bigger with both her and me.

I realize he's about to tear our relationship apart, I suspect it's part of his control as he's been distancing her from her other friends and family too.

I take Ap and Honors classes and have a few extracurriculars so I know I could get into a decent college and do well in plenty of careers.

I’m an extroverted, nice, and happy person so a career where I talk to people would be nice. I like traveling but it’s not really a must, and id like to settle down and start a family one day, so I’d not like to be out of town constantly. Additionally I’d like to be able to make at decent amount of money so I can give my future family a good life.

I love anything to do with music; I’m in chorus and sing all the time, I play guitar and piano, write songs, and just listen to tons of music. I don’t believe I’m good enough to make a career in making music so that’s kind of off the table.

The one career that excites me would to be able to go into daytime radio. I could share my love of music, and as an extroverted and humorous person I feel I could do well. The one issue with this is that radio seems to be dying off due to streaming services, so that’s not really a good option.

I don’t think I’d enjoy a career in medicine— I’m too squeamish. Additionally a career as a researcher or scientist doesn’t seem to interest me that much.

In late 2014, we began going through a rough patch in our friendship that really began a series of rough patches. We began not getting along and getting upset with each other. I ended up leaving the friendship around summer of 2015, but eventually going back to make amends and fix things by winter of 2016. 

Since then, we’ve been trying to work on getting things improved, but rough times still occur and occur often. After those, we would make up, but it felt like it was a vicious cycle, always happening every few months and sometimes every few weeks or days.  I began to feel that this kind of thing was toxic for me. It ruined my moods and got me really down. Hailey too has been depressed and self destructive since things really got messed up between us, feeling that she’s a trouble and torment to everyone she knows. She tells me that everyone she knows seems to hate her and her presence.

Now, in 2018, we’ve continued our efforts to restore the friendship, but it just feels pointless at times. Conversing feels awkward and contrived at times. I don’t find myself being able to talk about things with her and I can’t always get invested in conversations. It’s tough. So because of that, I decided they maybe the friendship needs to end. That it was best for me to leave. It would take a huge load off my shoulders. Just this past Sunday, I told her how I felt, that I couldn’t keep going with this relationship and that I thought it was best that we stopped talking. 

As a response, she told me that if I left, there was nothing for her to live for. Most of her relationships have failed and she doesn’t know what else she has. She threatened to commit suicide. I’ve been trying to talk her out of it, giving advice and even providing her with New Zealand suicide and depression hotline/helpline numbers, but she refuses to call any of them or change her mind on this decision.

But if I were to leave, I feel it’s likely she’d kill herself and that’s something I just don’t know if I can have on my conscious, whether it was my fault or not.

469,"Hey, so I’m a 16 year old male teenager who constantly comes up with creative ideas and I’m looking for some advice as to how I should go about a clear progression to making myself successful in one/some/all of these different avenues that I want to take in life. Before you offer your help/thoughts/opinion, here are the different main concepts that I want to do.

I’ve always wanted to be a “creator”. That’s what I want to do as a career. I constantly think about it, for hours every single day. Here are the main creative avenues I’ve decided I want to try to pursue, or at least consider.

First, I want to be a music artist. I can sing fairly well, as well as understand music theory and can produce my own music using software such as FL Studio. I have spent money on gear for music making. I’ve considered getting a partner/partners to help me make music, and release it, but it is hard to find people who share my vision or are interested in working with me with the chance of pay if the music is successful.

Second, I want to be a writer. I want to write books of poetry regarding emotions and life experiences and lessons I’ve learned. I want to write TV shows and movies. I’ve considered in the past being a journalist, but I think I’ve decided I’d rather focus on writings more personal to me than news topics. But again, would love to hear your thoughts on that and if I made the right choice.

Third, I want to be an actor in my own TV shows and movies, provided I end up writing them. I always would envision myself as one of the characters, and because of that, I feel I would be best at nailing the performance of the envisioned character.

Fourth, I want to be someone who creates social media-based photography and videography. I have invested in quality camera gear, and understand photo editing as well as movie editing. I’d create comedy-based pieces and such. These would be projects done on the side of the other creative options, more so as a way to connect with my audience more on a personal level. They’d be released on all major social media sites, such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram.

Fifth, I want a podcast.

So, those are some of my creative avenues I’d like to take. The others would involve some form of success beforehand, whether that be traction or money, before I can comfortably pursue them. I was inquiring about your thoughts on what I should do. I know I am young and I have some years to figure it out, but I hate not knowing how to go about becoming a success in the industries I want to go into. It’s almost like I need a mentor or manager or someone to help me process this all better. All my creative avenues come back to the core concept that I like to tell stories, whether fiction or real to me, through different mediums. I’m very curious as to what I should, and was wondering if you had any thoughts, or potentially yourself or one of your connections who would be interested in contacting me to discuss further. I can answer any questions and discuss my thoughts. Just let me know your thoughts, but to some it up, my question is, what should a creative teenager with no major successes like me do in this situation?",21Aug2018,2

473,"So I’ve been talking to this girl who just got out of a long relationship about a month ago. We talked for about a week and a half before we went out this past week and since the date, we’ve been together everyday since for at least a short amount of time. However we were always in groups or out at a bar or something, which is perfectly fine with me. However yesterday we were out and met up at the bar and we were talking and everything was great. Now when it came to bar close her roommates were still there with her, so I figured she would just go home with them and besides I had to walk a friend home who was way too drunk. So I said my goodbye and headed out, I was just getting my friend to bed, when I get a “hey did you get home safe” text, and I said something like “not yet, I had to get my friend home how about yourself?” and she actually walked back alone. Then she went to bed, and today she  was just a little off in her messages, and not really being very engaging. Turns out she didn’t go to bed, when she told me she did. Instead she went back out and spent the night at a guys house, now I don’t know what happened, if anything at all did between them as she may have just crashed there with some friends. And even something did, that’s not my place to get angry. But my question is, should I continue to talk to this girl? Or am I overthinking all of this?",21Aug2018,1
474,"Hey everyone, been trying to figure this out on my own for a while. I'm constantly changing my mind, or coming up with new ideas, but I still question whether any of them are good ideas. 

As the title says, I'm looking to buy a car, I'm 20 years old, have no credit, have an income of roughly $3k-$4k a month, and have ~$9,000 in the bank. I have no bills, as I haven't moved out of my parents house yet. 

About a month ago I decided I was tired of driving around ""my"" Jeep. It's not technically even mine, just a car my parents have lent me since I've got my license. I understand I could wait a few months, or even a year, and have plenty saved up for a nice car to buy in full, however, I'm extremely impatient and tired of driving what I drive. That won't change. 

With all of that said, I need advice on moving forward. With no credit, I'm not sure what options I have loan wise, or if that's a terrible idea. I just really don't know what to do. 

I'm also really into cars (newer cars at that), and am looking for a luxury car, or performance car. I've been looking around in the under $10,000 range, and nothing is to my liking (I'm picky). 

So, my question really is, how do I move forward with this? What car should I buy, and how should I buy it? Like I said, I'm into cars, so I understand buying certain cars will have crazy repair and maintenance costs, and that doesn't bother me. 

Thanks in advance everyone. ",21Aug2018,2
475,"I am looking for advice on a good career path for myself.

I have an associates in business and have worked random dead end jobs (currently a landscape foreman) that have put me further behind achieving my life goals. 

I enjoy construction and understanding how things work. However I do not want to do grunt work I feel my intellect would be wasted. I have been leaning towards going to a construction management course.

477,"I essentially need to make “small” money while I’m in school. Somewhere in the realm of $500 per month — I don’t pay rent, but I need to cover gas, food, and other basic expenses. I’d also like to put a small amount away for the future. I realize the easiest route is to get a part time job somewhere, but that option is out. 

I’ve explored Uber Eats (can’t drive people because I’m not 21) and similar options. They seem like viable routes, but I’d like to explore other options as well.

479,"Okay some background, my friend (M19) has some serious issues and disorders (body dysmorphia and anorexia, all of which haven't been diagnosed, however, he does see a therapist. But he asked me (F19) about what the difference between liking someone and caring about someone (in a general sense). I have had to explain different ""human lessons"" as we call them because he has difficulty understanding people's emotions and more complex emotions in general. But I answered by saying liking is where it's more about how they make you feel where caring is about focusing on how the other person feels, to put in simple terms. He just said he didn't care about anyone then and struggled with caring about people dying. He said he doubted that he would be sad if his mother even died, then preceded to say ""I like when you're around but if you died, I wouldn't really care"" or something along those lines. I dont think he is going to go all psycho on anyone, but his lack of empathy and emotions for anyone makes me uncomfortable. I dont know how to be around him much anymore. We have been friends for almost 6 years but now I dont even think it matters. Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated ",21Aug2018,1
480,"Well, I have “friends” but I’ve kinda grown to dislike them and they don’t invite me anywhere anyways so it doesn’t really count.

481,"My best friend has been in the foster care system for a hot minute by now and they are constantly bouncing her around between cities which causes her to lose her job, fall behind in school etc. We've been battling the system for awhile now trying to prove to them that the foster care system isnt right for her. (She is able to sustain herself, has her driving license and can get back and forth to school on her own) but they refuse to emancipate her since she is a year behind in school (The system told her she could be out of school and work on her GED but then backpedaled and said she had to go to school after two month of working on it). We're out of places for her here where I live and they plan on placing her back in a childern's haven a town over and will take away all her freedoms once again and we are trying to avoid that.   


However, I have no idea if I want to go through with this idea. Dont get me wrong, I love my best friend and I know I've told her countless times I would help solve any problems she has but this is a big one yet I feel bound to go through with it because like I said, I've told her I would basically be her knight in shining armour.   


Could really use some advice. She says we wouldnt have to stay married for long, if anything it would be a month and then we would file for divorce (Shes offered to pay for all the fees, I wont have to pay a dime) and she could get her father to sign the paperwork. But still. Help? ",21Aug2018,74

483,"I won't get too deep into specifics, but I've been through a lot in the 32 years I've been alive, from my aunt who lived in town being murdered when I was 16 to my best friend being murdered not even a year and a half later to living with various mental, emotional and behavioral issues that affect every moment of my life. I spent a lot of time in court between both murder trials, which stole a lot of my time shortly after high school. My scholarships ran out by the time I felt I was ready to go to college, and I was devasted knowing I couldn't afford it, nor could my family. I relegated myself to finding work and I've been bouncing from job to job ever since. Everything from restaurants to retail to hotel management to call centers. I even worked at Build-a-Bear as a seasonal worker just to make a little extra money on the side one year. But I've never felt happy at any of these jobs. Until one I almost lucked into.

I was working at a tech retail chain activating phones and one my customers was very happy with my service and knowledge of the products and industry and told me that if I were ever looking for work to call him, and he gave me his business card. It was for a company I was familiar with but didn't truly know much about. At the time this occurred I was trying to be transferred to another location due to a new manager who took over the department and was running it into the ground. We set up an interview right then and there.

The position was essentially a tech support job, but very specialized, not customer facing and at the corporate level. I did my training, helped develop their help desk structure and team, and started doing phone support for all the stores in the company. It was always interesting, fun most of the time, an incredible environment and I was able to use my tech knowledge on a daily basis in a positive way. It was the best job I've ever had. I had built my team,and they were great. I was the manager, just as assistant manager, but it was still great, and the manager was terrific.

One day I arrived at work and was met at the elevator bay by the above mentioned manager. He said we needed to go over some things. I was pulled into one of our conference rooms and told flat out by him and our manager above us that I was being let go. I pressed for reasoning and was simply told that due to Florida being a right to work state that they didn't have to tell me anything. My desk's contents were brought to me in a box, my badge taken away and I was led back to the elevators, essentially escorted out.

I spent the next four months living off the little amount of money I had saved up. I spent a few hours every day out of the apartment looking for work and a few at the apartment applying for things online. My mother had a major surgery during this time as well so I was at her place fairly often to help due to my father working out of state. 

I finally got a job in July (didn't start until August due to my first ever car accident taking my means of transport from me) but it's at a much more regimented call center that does not play into my strengths. The training was abysmal. The trainer actually missed 20% of the scheduled classes and this company has no backup trainer so those were wasted days.

I just started on the floor yesterday and know now for a fact, poor training or not, this isn't the job for me. So now I have to go back to looking for work while also working essentially 7:45am to 7pm(ish) Monday through Friday (that includes travel time to and from work). It took four months to find a job when I dedicated everyday to it so I'm terrified at the prospect of how long this might take, or if I might even be fired before then. I had to take a sick day today due to food poisoning, and because of the way my brain works (I'm diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, depression and ADD) I'm legitimately concerned that they'll up and decide to fire me for the crime of having food poisoning considering my last job fired me for absolutely no reason.

So I've spent all day either in the bathroom or laying on a towel in bed sweating, and all I can think is that I need a major change in my life, but I don't know what to do. I don't want to wake up and my first thought be that I'd rather kill myself than go to work (no suicidal tendencies or aspirations, once again just how my broken brain works). I can't live like that. But I also have no money in savings after spending it all on rent, utilities, minimal groceries and gas while out of work. I've always worked paycheck to paycheck so savings have always been slim. Had around four grand in my account before I was let go unceremoniously. Now? Nothing. So even saving up for school or a trade school is going to be very slow going.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so dejected by my current circumstances that I honestly just want to get in bed and never get out at this point. Please, any and all constructive advice is welcome. I am a fairly open book. I'll answer whatever questions anyone asks of me truthfully and take into account whatever is offered. 

It's around 8pm EST and I won't be awake much longer but trust that I'll check in here ASAP. The company I work for is in a cellular dead zone, doesn't offer WIFI to their employees and my account doesn't allow smart devices on the floor so I have minimal access during work hours. But I'll read any and all replies whenever I can.

Thank you.",21Aug2018,1

485,"Long story short, I didn't lie on my application.  I noted all my degrees, all easily verifiable.  My current job references, the first two most recent no problem, but my last one which was a retail position may be difficult to verify.  I worked in various positions at Staples, but I worked the last 8 months as a supervisor, and worked at two stores (but there's no paper trail).  When I left my manager said I could list my most senior position on my resume for the entire period I worked their because I was routinely in that role 3/4 of the time. But now she no longer works there, and I have no way of contacting her.  Should I contact the office doing the background check?  Just ignore it unless they ask me, in which case I can address it.  My position is conditional and I'm concerned that if I leave my current job I'll be out of work. Advice?",21Aug2018,1
