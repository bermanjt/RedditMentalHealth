2,"I go to appointments fortnightly  with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet)  ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she  said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s.

4,"So I'm in a weird position. I live with my girlfriend at her parents house. 

This Fall, I'm transferring to a four year university to finish my computer science degree. I used to deliver pizzas and my girlfriend worked with me in the store. Then she got a job as a waitress and started making about the same amount of money as me and we were paying rent easily and saving money. I was struggling to work and go to school at the same so for my last semester at community we agreed that I would focus completely on school and she would handle the bills. I kicked butt in the spring semester and I got straight As while taking 17 units. In my free time I do lyft and uber but its pretty depressing and I know her job as a waitress is really stressful too. 

I've worked since I was 15 years old (I'm 26 now, about to be 27) and I'm used to providing and being the breadwinner so her working and me just studying gets to me. I know that if I can get the degree then I'll be able to hopefully get a job that will put us in a better place and then I can work and she can go school. 

We have a goal and an endgame in sight but I'm frustrated because its at best two years away if I take really heavy semesters that are nothing but core classes. For example my Fall semester will be Probability, Advanced Data Structures, Discrete Math, Comp Architecture &amp; Assembly, French 2, and some US Music History class. Even though I like math a lot and am an intermediate programmer I feel like its going to be a really heavy and stressful semester because of the rigor of the math courses and time in class and time outside of class studying. 

The following semesters are all going to be like that but with higher and higher level courses and I won't be able to participate in any extra-curricular projects/teams or make some networking connections because I think I'll be busy all the time.

If I do it in three years then it will be less stressful for me and I'll be able to participate in more extra curricular stuff which might make it easier for me to get a job but then my girlfriend has to tough it out for one more year. She tells me she's okay with it as long as I finish but it doesn't make it easy for me try to do it in three years. 

I'm not a dumb guy but I don't feel smart all the time. I was late in submitting some financial aid documents so I don't know how much financial aid I'm going to be getting. I had to pay for my classes out of our savings so I wouldn't get automatically dropped. I wish I would have just done my homework as a kid but this is where I am in life at the moment and I worry about being able to get a job one day. I really want to do this for our future but I'm not sure if I'm going about it the best way.

I'm not trying to take advantage of my girlfriend. I love her very much and we've been together for almost twelve years. I'm gonna put a ring on it as soon as I get a good job. Sometimes I beat myself up because I feel like I'm not doing enough.",30Jul2018,1

8,"29 yo Architect living in Tirana, AL (EU).

Sadly, lately I've come te the conclusion that it's near to impossible to make a good living in my country (no real perspective):
-no perspective in here and now real way to change it.
-real estate prices are astronomically high considering the salaries
-healthcare is basically inexistent (they literally let people die due to state hospitals not having equipment or pharmaceuticals)
-poverty is everywhere
-And since basically every politician is corrupted, nothing really works.
I am aware that utopias dont exist and these are issues that every country has, but not at this scale or proportions.

Anyhow, I worked for 6 years now and managed to make about 10k$ in private savings ( I know its not much, but considering my familly issues and financial problems we had, its not that bad).
Lately I started a very good job in an important construction company , in the hopes that my perspective would change, but still I cant stand this place ( I dont want to seem edgy but Im really fed up).

It would mean a lot to me any advice, or any clue where to start to apply for jobs/career/masters or anything in my in my field of work, abroad, so I could start with a little more perspective on life.

13,"Since about 2 months ago I have noticed that I've been slowly distancing myself from my friends. It started off with me just taking a little longer to respond to their messages, and now it has progressed to days. I love my friends more than anything and I am so grateful that they are in my life, so I absolutely hate how I have become like this. Im not too sure if this is something that I should be asking advice on, but I cant help but feel like this is hurting my friends.. and I dont want  to lose them.A little bit of background on me as well as things that I have recently noticed: Im 17f, currently on summer holidays. I have been spending a lot of my time indoors, not really going out much. Most of my friends are quite far away, so texting is our best way of keeping in touch.

When I see a message, I cant help but feel anxious about it. This is probably going to sound weird since they're my friends but I think I worry too much about my response being embarrassing/ offensive/ boring, which could lead to them being uninterested and eventually leaving me... Im not sure if this is the entire reason for the anxiety of responding, but if it is, it seems like Im just distancing myself to avoid doing something that they will leave me for :/ ughh im so confused.

I've also been having problems with confidence in interacting with others, and having conversations. Conversing with others is a major weakness of mine which has been around for most of my life. Its something I have noticed but haven't payed much attention to in the past, except recently. I struggle with small talk, getting to know someone, remembering details and having a natural conversational flow . I think this happens not only when interacting face-to-face with others, but also when texting. I definitely feel a lot of pressure when messaging others, which makes the idea of responding seem daunting.

I am really struggling to figure out how to overcome this, and it is affecting my friendships..

Does any one have any advice? I would really appreciate it &lt;3

14,"I used to talk to and take a class with a guy. Initially, just like whenever you start talking to someone, conversations were light and we avoided controversial topics. Over time I started to notice he was a pretty mean person. He would constantly rant about and criticize trans people, ""snowflakes"", liberals, sjw, black people and women. Basically our conversations turned into heavy discussions, which was obviously tiring (not only because they borderlined on arguments but also because it's unpleasant to see someone be so hateful). One day in January I just decided to stop talking to him, and obviously didn't feel the need to justify my actions to him or say goodbye. Since then he has messaged me multiple times on more than one social media either acting as if everything is normal, or asking why I'm ignoring him. Initially I felt as if I didn't have to justify myself to him since he is about 30 and at this point I doubt he will change since he just wants to feel right all the time and since I'm pretty sure he would have viewed me not wanting to talk to him as a ""haha look at this snowflake being \*T R I G G E R E D\*"" type of thing, but last night he sent me a paragraph actually addressing the situation and saying he missed our friendship and valued it. I obviously think there's no benefit in us being friends, and I have no interest in being his friend since I don't expect him to change, but I kind of think it (hopefully) might be a learning experience for him? I wish to tell him that I chose to not talk to him because of his backwards views and how hateful he was (and maybe he will see that his behavior pushes people away, although he had told me that people in his life did that because they disagreed with him).

16,"TL;DR, Dated a guy four months ago for a brief time, and felt greatly concerned and stopped dating him.  Four months later I'm still afflicted if I overreacted or if I was being true to myself/perceptive.  I feel lots of guilt and am afraid this could pose an issue for future dating.  I tried spelling it all out to give the most full picture I can give within reason, and on Reddit.  

If you were dating someone and they did/said the following, would you think it strange/uncomfortable?  Also, did my sudden split towards him make you think of an abusive person?

1.  Wanting to know every last detail about me, super interested in everything about me, and initiating texting like twelve times a day. (I was very responsive and flattered, albeit self consciously).  For some reason was always very encouraging of sharing everything with him, to never feel like I need to hold back.  Despite the intense interest bestowed upon me, he was mostly very vague about his feelings towards me, whereas I shared my feelings a few times.

2.  When I set a boundary to not stay in such constant contact (my work was suffering and I felt this growing dependency) they thought I was losing interest, gushed all their feelings for me, disagreed that it was necessary though ""understood"" (""If things are able to work out with us without constant contact then fucking awesome and yay!""), didn't change constant contact at all but continued as usual the next morning, planning our next date a week in advance.  I was responsive and just got swept away again.  (But I also didn't give him a week or so to really see if he was in fact ignoring me)

3.  When I brought up the weirdness surrounding the #2 very gently the next day....and what I perceive to be excessive fawning from #1, they became very defensive saying, ""I'm not some weak, fragile being"", ""I can love but I can cut a bitch out"", ""I don't build my being on you"".  Maybe his intense fawning wasn't that big a deal and I made it one?

4.  Contradictory about describing self and past.  Disorienting for me. (""My intense interest  towards people in the past can come off as obssession and I don't want that to be misunderstood"" vs. ""My lone wolf nature in the past has made people think I'm not interested, so I'm especially mindful of this."")

5.  After #3, suddenly acts like they didn't see us as dating but just ""fucking around"".   Questions my affections despite the fact that I had told him a few times that I really liked him, looked so much forward to seeing him every week, was always attentive to his contact.  That same night he implies he wants to move in together in the future literally the same day he says he just sees us as ""fucking around."".  (I mean, I would too if things developed and I decided I wanted to be in a relationship.  I was very serious about dating for the purpose of finding a long term partner.)

Everything was going pretty great until #2...and after #5, I brought up my concerns about how it seemed he was manipulating me...that his communication confused me.  After I said we should give it some time and thought, within three hours he said something strange like, ""Quit analyzing me, we agree that we should move on from the honeymoon phase and into something substantial.""  I certainly never used those words or agreed that things were moving that way.  I had simply expressed that I was serious about finding a partner, and that an infatuation phase is temporary.

 It seemed to get worse, and I completely broke and felt all this anger inside of me (which I'm not used to feeling) and I got (admittedly) over reactionary and told him that he didn't really care about me....painted him as a deceptive, manipulative person.  He didn't back down but kept maneuvering to keep me in his life, seemingly unaware of how any of the above was questionable.  Was I just making something out of nothing, projecting something, or intuiting something dangerous?

He asked me to think honestly of why I was reacting this way, once saying he felt he was triggering me....and I really thought hard about it and I couldn't think of some ulterior motive.  I felt scared and betrayed.

As I was cutting things off, he told me all these things that I still can't get out of my head 2 months later:

""You don't seem to be led by love""

""Love gives one strength"" (implying I was overreacting from apparently bad experiences in the past.  In the past he said a couple times how he admired my strength for moving on from a cult experience)

""Love makes someone vulnerable"" (implying that by cutting it off I was being invulnerable)

""Maybe the universe has something else planned for us.""

""You can be mean and blind"". (never expressed before that I was mean and blind)

""You aren't the only one who has suffering"" (I rarely shared suffering with him)

""You should embrace experiences while you're still young and able to."" (...........I'm 33?  What?)

""You have learned a lot, but you still don't know shit."" (Previously had said how frighteningly perceptive I was)

Etc.  He had never said things like this before, but only after I had challenged him.  After I had said it was over.  He told me he felt I was attacking his character, maybe he said all these things out of hurt.

A week later I felt terrible for how I had painted him as a manipulative person (however, I never went for his vulnerabilities...I accused more broadly)....I was scared I had abused him in some way or influenced him in a negative way...that, perhaps it was just insecurities or something, but not a real issue...and I apologized.  I had no interest in pursuing him any further.  He first said he ""of course"" forgave me, and then it devolved into how much I hurt him and that I was just apologizing to remove guilt so I could move on.  He also threw in a doubting I ever had feelings for him again, as the icing on top.

Before all of this, I didnt see any issues besides his hyper focus on me.  I had been struggling some to make sense of my feelings at times, but I think this was more related to an anxiety.  I had about three instances over 6 weeks where I reached out to him in a mental funk, needing support.  His advice was always spot on and encouraging.

For four months this whole experience has consumed my mind and entire being.  I've felt so much guilt and shame and confusion.  I can't seem to decide if I did the right thing, which things I did right, this feeling of needing to atone to him, that he is a better and more advanced person than I will ever be, that I'm a crazy person, that I ruined something.  I feel like he could take what unfolded and easily say I was a toxic person for having become so hypervigilant against him at the end.",30Jul2018,2

19,"Not like this is a daily occurrence- but I find myself un-able to classify what i'm feeling but I experience it the same type of way I would experience other emotions so it seems to make sense to classify them as such.

Something heavy on my mind has been not a paranoia or anxiety, but that my friends are not the right fit for me and they aren't really my ""friends"". Not that they're faking it, but that we just fell into friendship and we are probably not right for each other. I feel this way about every single friend I have, even my closest friends. I have no problem falling out of touch, I feel unfazed by it. Not that I don't enjoy their company either. It's weird.

I'll also have a feeling of doom or like a bad omen or something. Usually nothing happens, and if anything has it's not been memorable enough for me to recall, and i've written off as coincidental.

Anyways! These are the only two I can think of at the moment if anyone has experience feeling this way, or can point me somewhere to be classified. Thanks!

21,"I'm  in a very vanilla relationship, which is something that suits both me and my girlfriend very well. We love each other very much, and plan on moving in together very soon. 

And then there is this guy, sorta mutual ""friend"", that we often bump into on parties and shit. He's the definition of a Chad, muscular, cocky, et cetera. He hits on many ""taken"" girls quite often, and recently noticed that I also have a girlfriend. So far he's only talking shit, implying he's going to so-and-so fuck her. I never thought that anything like that would have any effect on me. I was wrong.

 He never laid a finger on her, if he did, I would probably outright kill the fucker (already fought him once in the past and won), but she is feeling uneasy around him (She has mild haphephobia, and usually feels frightened when touched by anyone, with the exception being me and some close friends.) This is where it gets hard. I have never in my life despised anyone as much as this guy. The moment I lay my eyes on him, I'm immediately flooded by blind rage and urge to kill. It's quite frightening for me, because he hasn't really done anything yet, and I know that resorting to violence isn't going to bring anything good, but it's getting increasingly difficult to contain myself around this degenerate. I find myself anticipating the moment when he makes a move, just so I would have any excuse for murder. 

More and more often my mind starts producing images of him raping my girlfriend, which fuels my rage even more. What is wrong with me? Is this a manifestation of some cuckold fantasy I've never known I had, or is it genuine hatred? I feel like a horrible person, because deep down I want him to violate and abuse her, so that I could retaliate with clear conscience. I have never had any anger issues or anything like that. This is the first time I've hated anyone so much.

there are a few reasons i’m so scared and one of them is, i don’t want to hurt him or be an unhealthy impact on his life...
so this guy (18M) is genuinely so loving, caring and just wants the best for me. (17F) 

i do reciprocate these feelings but i’ve been through a lot in my early childhood in regards to watching my mum be in abusive relationships and me being sexually assaulted many times as a young girl. i haven’t been able to properly resolve these with a psychologist *yet* as they are so hard for me to talk about.
it’s not that sex makes me uncomfortable, i can have casual sex with no worries.

but i know that i have an unhealthy way of looking at relationships and i really just, don’t want to hurt him. 

i’m scared that ill hurt him. somehow. 

i also feel like i’m a bad influence on him, he stopped doing drugs ages and ages ago now and i’m still experimenting and having fun with drugs. he’s still in school and i dropped out, so i’ve been doing a lot of partying recently and he’s been coming with me.
i feel like i’m dragging him back into that dysfunctional cycle. i don’t know.
and the fact that i am struggling so much with mental issues, i don’t want that to become a stress for him. because i know he cares so much about me, i don’t want him to be worrying constantly. 

if i have all these worries, should i back off from him? it’ll hurt as both if i back off but i’m scared i could hurt him even worse in the future.
i really don’t know what to do, ever since i was fucked up one night and i told him i loved him, i felt so much anxiety.

30,"I've felt really guilty about this lately, let me first start out by saying I [24f] have a boyfriend [24m] of about a year now. We are extremely close and very rarely argue as we are both pretty laid back and easily talk things out. He treats me like a princess but he has a lot of motivational issues. We live relatively different lifestyles in terms of financial backgrounds (I'm still somewhat dependent on my family while I'm in school) and he dropped out for various reasons, one being that he is fully dependent on himself and even helps other family members with bills. Needless to say, he's an extremely kind hearted person and I adore him for that.

a little over four years ago (back in college) I started hooking up with this person (lets call them Jerry) I'm not going to say I got around a lot during this time but I was definitely pretty care free and adventurous. For some reason I find myself relatively talented at avoiding feelings so hook ups never ended too horrible for me. Jerry and I consistently hooked up for a year or so during college, being with him was different, we'd actually hang out during the day. We'd get food and watch movies, we'd hang out with our friends together and he always seemed to be in to me. We smoked all the time and would go to random places around campus to have sex. Through all that, we never talked about feelings, not once. I know I didn't want to because I didn't want to be turned away, and maybe he didn't want to because this was just a fun friendship to have. We even talked about how we never talked about feelings. The next year we hooked up once, I told him I didn't want to fuck around with people anymore and he wasn't trying to be exclusive so I deleted his number to avoid drunk texts and told myself we would be friends eventually. 

Fast forward a little later and I have a new boyfriend, (different from current boyfriend). Jerry and I decide to hang out and smoke. He was very open with me about his mental health and I felt like I could be pretty open with him too which is also rare for someone you treat as a fuck buddy. When I told him about my boyfriend he immediately said he was talking to this ""really cool girl"" and ended up dating her shortly after. 

A few months later he went abroad, cheated on her, and that was the end of that. 
The first time I saw him when he came back, I was (attempting) an open relationship with my now boyfriend. When Jerry and I hung out we both agreed it felt exactly like old times. We have the same humor and always have great conversations. He's a pretty smart guy so it's always fun getting into deep conversations with him. We hooked up a few times after that until the open relationship kinda went south and we agreed to be monogamous. For the next few weeks after that I would get occasional texts and calls on weekend nights to hang out and obviously hook up. There was one weekend he was calling me all day to come meet his friends from home because he thought I would really like them, there was another time when he called me to hang out and when he hung up the phone he said ""I love you"" by accident (I assume).

Jerry is definitely one of the most attractive people I've ever hooked up with, the sex was amazing and the connection was there

Since then I have hung out with jerry multiple times, he was unaware I was with my current boyfriend and when I informed him he immediately told me he has a long distance girlfriend back from high school. We proceeded to talk like we always did but there was so much sexual tension in the air, we even talked about how much sexual tension there was and I let him know that I felt it too but I would never do anything to hurt to my boyfriend. We are no longer in the same town and when I visited his town a few months ago, he invited me over to his place, it was so normal again and I can't help but think I should have brought up feelings at some point. 

So now I'm at the point where all I feel is guilt. My boyfriend is incredible to me, he goes out of his way and though he doesn't necessarily have the funds to buy me nice things and take me out to dinner all the time he treats me like a princess and spends the extra money he has on me which is something I am extremely grateful for (even though I tell him to save up more) The problem is that I constantly think about Jerry and I have no idea why. I can't stop questioning whether or not something was there between us. He's one of the most attractive guys I've ever been with and we have a lot in common, but like I said he also has a girlfriend right now. We always talked about the ""timing being off"" but now I feel like it's too late and I also feel terrible for thinking about another man so often. 

Sometimes I feel like straight up texting him and asking him about it. I just want to know if he ever felt the same way as I did. That would also be super fucking weird so I'm not about to do that. Maybe some day at some point I will see him again and get the chance to bring it up, but just like always I'll probably chicken out. 

Until then I will continue loving my boyfriend with occasional anxiety attacks because I am thinking of how things could have been with another man.

31,"Hello r/Advice

I'm a 24 year old guy from Los Angeles who's strongly considering joining the Army, although most of my research seems  that most people would point me towards the Air Force or Navy. Now I'm NOT looking to go infantry. I would like to have a job that would translate into civilian life. (25B, 88K are two jobs that interest me)

Current situation: Single with no kids or debt and still living at home. I'm currently a ""full-time student"" at the local community college and this upcoming Fall semester will be my 3rd at the college. I have a GED which means that I would need 15 college credits to enlist as a high school graduate. I currently have 9 and will be taking 14 units next semester. Right now I don't feel that school is working out for me and tbh I feel like I'm wasting my time. I've thought about enlisting since mid 2016, but had to get my GED first which I did last June 2017. Once I earned it, I decided to give school a shot as my parents pleaded with me not to join. I've been there since and don't feel like this is for me. I've spoken with 2 different recruiters within the past 8 months, but now I'm really considering joining. At 24 and soon to be 25 in December I don't see myself moving out with the way my life is heading in right now not because I don't want to and trust me I would love to have a place of my own, but because living here in LA is costly. No way I can support myself with just a GED and making 12-15 bucks an hour. ",30Jul2018,1
32,"I'm a Junior in high school right now, and I'm wondering if I'm even able to graduate.

The main reason is because of math. I'm really good at doing quick math in my head, and I actually enjoy it, but I haven't been able to grasp algebra or anything above that level. 

I'm doing online school now because when I tried to get help from teachers they gave up or told me that they couldn't help me. It's not like I was rude to them, I just didn't understand the way they explained it at all. One or two teachers actually resorted to tearing me down by basically saying I was stupid and that I was never going to graduate. I'm sure they had good intentions, but that seems like the worst thing to say to an eighth grader who is begging for help. 

To this day, I can't do algebra, and no amount of tutoring or countless hours studying and scouring the internet or anything has helped me. I'm smart in literally every other subject but the stress from math is making all my other grades suffer. I know that I won't be able to graduate or get my GED in this condition so my immediate thought is to not pour everything into school and short-circuit my brain.

I'm ashamed to say that I have had several mental breakdowns over this. The biggest problem for me is that math is mandatory unlike financing and budget which I enjoy and I can see their practical uses.

The reason I'm even considering dropping out is because of the career that I could try to pursue. I am a good singer, and I love acting. I've gotten accepted and taken college courses on these and aced them. I can pour my heart and soul into these things and I don't get stressed out at all. I'm super passionate about performing but focusing on school, and most specifically math just sucks all my energy and makes me hate life.

I don't need a diploma for acting, however, if I can't make it as an actor or have a period where I don't get any gigs then I need something to fall back on which I do need a diploma for. 

I would really appreciate help. My parents have told me that if I really think dropping out is the best choice, they'd talk about it and support me, but I'm just scared of being a disappointment.",30Jul2018,1

I text her while shes out asking what they were doing because i forgot to ask, wanted to know when she was coming back home. No response just a heart response.  I get a response 20 min saying petstore and walking his dog to talk. Prior to leaving for work we made plans to go to the beach and watch the sunset. Thinking that was still in order i was ready around 730 thinking this is when she was grtting home. I text her no response. She gets home at 9 well after when we made plans to leave at 8. Come to find out when she gets home she tells me she forgot. I ask her what they did and she tells me tthey went to the store got a new leash took dog for a walk in the woods then went to the beach with the dog. This all makes no damn sense to me. She was gone for 5 hours. Only doing that? I trust her but at the same time this is making me not know if i should. She smells like him as if he put his arms around her. Not only her clothing but her herself. Her shpulders when i gave her a hug and her lips taste of something. She told me they didnt eat anything. Im lost. She is acting distant now.

Picture James McAvoy office character in wanted and that's really all the context you need. I'm 22 didn't go to college but I do have a decent sales job so there that but the environment is full of uncertainty and an asshat boss.i really want to change my life but to be honest theirs a situation in my life that's cutting the time I do have to improve by just months. I keep thinking what's the point of it all anyways but deep down I know I have potential, hopes, dreams, desire, the availability to get there. It's a feeling I can only describe it as the ""real me"" is burried underneath all this rubble of bullshit I've piled on for years. Even writting this has drained me I feel my throat closing up and this intense pressure in my chest. It happens every time I try to deal with my conflict. It's tiring.

35,"Long story short I was given a car by a family friend a year ago. The plates were in their names, and from what I understand, I had thirty days to get new ones in my name for the car. 

I unfortunately did not do this. The tags for the license plate are now expired and I cannot legally drive the car. I cannot get new tags either, since the plates are not in my name. I've been trying to look into the laws/how things are suppose to work, and I'm very confused as to what I'm suppose to do in this situation, or what would be the cheapest route to go. 

Can I even get new license plates in my name, this long after having the title put in my name? Would it be cheaper to just transfer the title back to them, have them buy tags for it, to avoid the fee for a new license plate? 

I'm at a loss here guys. The laws in this state make no fucking sense, from what I understand most states make fucking sense and the license plates are attached to the vehicle itself, not a person. Thanks in advance for anyone who has the time to look into this and help me out, I appreciate it. ",30Jul2018,1
36,"I have always had this feeling that my friends don’t really want me around, but aren’t comfortable in telling me this. 

For some context, I was pretty self-destructive/self-loathing back in high school (well I am still) - and my friends were always there to listen and help. I was very toxic and unreasonable, though they didn’t hesitate to give the tough love/hard words I didn’t want to hear. I did a lot of things for attention, because I was just unhappy about my life and myself. Eventually, I was able to realize my own wrongdoings and worked it out with my friends. Apologized for what I had done and said.

While we all went to different colleges, we’re all reasonably close to each other so we can occasionally hangout. And we also communicate through a group chat on Facebook messenger. My friends have already found great friends at their respective colleges. But I’m currently struggling to make friends. 
Even when we talk, I’ve avoided talking too much about my personal life to them.

Most, if not all, chatting happens on the FB group chat. I never really talk to my friends one-on-one (over chat), and at times I’m genuinely nervous about even trying. Though it seems my friends are comfortable talking to each other, as they would tell me about these deep or  late night ramblings that have taken place before between them.
It’s apparent from Facebook pictures that my friends are pretty well adjusted to their college life, and found friends they share interests with (as opposed to proximity). 
They’re probably ridiculously busy as is, and they might see me as a huge burden to their emotional/mental health. And they have expressed in the past that I can be. 
I’m pretty obnoxious when I get comfortable with people, oversharing or being way too loud .. idk what I’m getting at. 

So I was thinking, maybe I should just move on? Not cut ties, obviously- but just distance myself while trying to find what works for me. I know I haven’t tried my best to find other friends. One thing’s for sure, whether or not my high school friends like me- MY relationship with them isn’t healthy. I just don’t know what the healthiest way to go about this.
I’ve deleted Facebook messenger so many times before thinking my friends don’t like me, but I relapse.

I told them I was all good and they said I seemed okay. Then I believe that I was either roofied or something because I have no recollection of leaving the bar, I woke up in the hospital, and apparently had been given an IV. My cell phone was stolen along with my debit card. I got my debit card cancelled and have done everything I can with the phone for now. My sister and brother in law felt bad because they said they should've just said no and made me come with them, but it was my decision and I don't blame them at all.

But recently he’s been giving hints that he wants me to offer him a ride( he says stuff like “I might walk today”) and I usually try to change the topic like saying “it’s a nice night, see you tomorrow” then leave.

It’s important to know this because it causes a lot of conflict when I try to decide what I want to do. My sisters always have told me never to lose my virginity just because everyone else around me is. 
Not only that but I noticed that a lot of guys I’ve talked to are after my virginity. They get all prideful and fetishize it. I think that’s one of the main things that is stopping me from being in a committed relationship because I’m never sure whether the person actually likes me or is lusting over me.

23 y/o. Just bought a condo in the North FL area. First time buyer. So I'm new to this and wondering the best way to pay off/juggle things. Had a couple of quick questions. 

First is. 15 or 30 year loan? All I know is 15 will require higher monthly payments but I think I can afford it. Are there any major differences here? 

Second, I put $1,000 per month in a non-retirement brokerage account. This is along with me maxing out my IRA/401k yearly. So my question here is should I just be focusing on paying off my mortgage/principal first or continue investing in my non-retirement account? 

Also, I've got three different loan estimates. What numbers/things should I be looking for in these 3 loan estimates that I might overlook and hopefully pick the best one? 

After seeing the numbers for the interest I'll be paying on a mortgage I was shocked. It's nuts.

53,"Please do take a time to read that post, im sorry it got this long, but this is a really complicated thing and since i cant be open to friends and family here, since im closeted, here i am.

So, hello all, i have this thing which has been goin on for a while, theres this friend i know from a long time and has been my ultimate crush since i met him, im closeted af, he claims hes heterosexual af and talks about these gorgeous girls hes been with, even tho none of our friends has ever seen him with a girl.

It all began for real, a few months ago, we were at a friend's house for a sleepover, no alcohol involded, it was late and we all decided to watch a movie, our friends all went to the other sofas in the room and we stayed at a 3 space sofa, i wanted to lay down so i did and put my legs over his lap, after some time i just started rubbing his dick with my leg slowly cuz im a bitch, then after some time i just felt something hard and very hot on my legs then i lifted my blanked and saw his volume hard inside his shorts, we stood like that for the duration of the movie, after the movie ended he moved to the floor and slept there, in the morning we were the first to wake, he stood there laying on the floor with his tummy down, then i went near him, used his gorgeous ass as a pillow and starded running my hands through his hair for about a hour then i went home.

The other day i asked him if he had liked the sleepover then told him next time i would make him even more comfortable but he didnt say much bout it just he just said he enjoyed and was looking foward to the next one.

After some months he got a scholarship in one of the country's best college and was soon to move to another city, to celebrate all of us went to his home, where he lived with his parents and brother, we drank from lunch to late night, everyone went home except for me, i stayed there cuz his mother begged me to sleep there and look out for him cuz he had drank so much, so i put him to bed and he didnt sleep, he kept talking to me, after some time he vomited on his pants and i had to take them out, he was laying on his briefs, i went close to him to see if he was ok and he started kissing/biting near my armpit, then he said ""put your mouth in it"", even tho i really wanted to i just went to sleep cuz he was drunk and his family on the house.

He always hosts those drinking nights in his parents house where all our friends go, there was also a night where i was just stanting in the doorway and he started rubbing his dick on my ass (clothed) in front of all our friends and i just pretended i was not liking it and walked away.

I visited his new home, alone, on this other town, surprisingly nothing happened.

After the end of the semester he came for vacation, the squad went to a nightclub we had a few drinks and everyone went to the dancefloor, i did too but i wasnt in the mood, so i told them i would just stand by the bar, they all begged me to stay but i didnt, and when i just stood on the dancefloor before leaving it this friend im talking about just started going up and down on me rubbing himself on my side, again i pretended to not like it and stood by the bar, i looked at the dancefloor an this hot chick just started twerking nearly on his dick and tried to kiss him, he pushed her and kissed her on the forehead, i was like wtf.

He's also very affecionate towards me, hes a hugger and is always telling me about how he misses me, he also keeps slapping my thighs and resting his hand on them whenever we sit close. And his mother also told me hes really not looking foward to return to his college city because he misses me so much.

So this is all, what do you guys make of it?",30Jul2018,1

It sucks being told to lose weight by people comparing us. He'll probably gain it back statistically speaking, but he's kept it off for a long time and gets a lot of P for it.

55,"Ok, so to condense it a lot. I’m a girl and in 8th grade I thought I was gay for the first time. Started dating a girl freshman year right after I officially came out. My mom went through my phone a few months later, found out, and pulled me out of the school. Never finished my freshman year. Stayed in touch with friends and my girlfriend even though I wasn’t supposed to, obviously. Went to summer school, met up with my girlfriend a few times. She was acting normal. I came back sophomore year and she acted totally different, barely acknowledging my existence. I didn’t do anything because I had put her through a lot and I was just happy to be back. She left the school halfway through sophomore year without an explanation, just told me she was leaving. So I spent the rest of the year with my friends. I snuck out to see her a few times and she always acted the way she had before. She rarely answered my texts though and it fucked with my head. I got caught again at the end of sophomore year, my mom saw I was still talking to the same people and she hadn’t magically made me straight. She let me finish up sophomore year just because there was literally a week left. I explained what was going on to my friends and that I wouldn’t be back. We talked to a few teachers and they decided to call cps because I literally wasn’t allowed to finish school or leave the house. When cps showed up it scared my mom, and she took me out of state to avoid them. Couldn’t talk to my friends, hadn’t heard from my girlfriend since I got caught. Spent two weeks sleeping in a car in Arizona. My mom threatened to leave me in the desert, drop me off at mental institutions, and once said she’d drop me off at the California border so I could “crawl back to my whore of a girlfriend”. My girlfriend hadn’t done anything wrong. Not to my mom. She was going through a lot at home and it made it hard for her to communicate. So anyway. We finally make it back to California. I wait until my mom falls asleep and charge my old phone up and text everyone, keep them updated. My girlfriend finally agrees to talk to me and we break up but agree to stay friends. It was for the best, it wouldn’t have kept working the way it did in my situation. I didn’t see any friends for months. I spent months alone, texting my friends when I could. My mom went on a trip to Florida and while my dad and sister were gone, I snuck out and walked to my old school, said hi to all my friends, and met up with my ex. We talked for a while. I have nothing against her. No hard feelings. I was going to a charter school at the time where I only went to school two days a week. So that gave me a lot of time to myself while my sister was at school and my dad worked. I went to see my friends a few more times. My mom finally let me talk to my best friend again and every once in a while him and I sneak out and see another friend. So anyway. I’ve got a year left until I move out. It’s been a year since I got caught and cps got involved. I went to two schools last year. I don’t know which school I’m going to this year. I can’t see my friends often but I text them whenever I can. Recently I’ve started to feel like they don’t want to stay in contact with me. I know I’m probably just paranoid. I’m basically stuck here for the next year and I have nowhere to go once I leave. I know I’m young and it doesn’t seem as serious. ",30Jul2018,1

His father lived on another city, and she went to see him recently, they had a happy get togheter. They took pictures, etc.

57,"Hi,

I'm having a hard time being nice anymore.  I have seen so much stupidity and vanity.  So many people fighting for the wrong thing.  So many quick gains.  So much in the way of eat in, leave the trash.  Hyper convenience for the sake of some meta meaning that doesn't even make sense.  I'm just done.

A month ago I became depressed.  I can't even express myself because everyone is speaking a different language now.  They'll hear it in some way and take and do with some other useless thing that mirrors my own feelings of futility, but it's just gone out some different way.

I can't heavily pretend a belief in it.  Sometimes, if I need to, I'll shake my arms and legs like a happy sailor if it makes the music carry on.  I just want out.  It's not that I want to go somewhere.  It's not that I want people to change.  I just want the peace of mind that comes from figuring out my own slice of earth.  

I'm not religious, but I know religion and more important moral principles are sure under attack.  I'd be ok to take a wife, even if it's got some paperwork attached to it because who knows if it'll make it ten years.  I'm not trying to ignore everyone, I'm just beginning to realize how much I've ignored my own needs and how much other people knowingly abused my time on earth.

My land, my wife, and my ability to protect it.  Need some people I can make money with, because if anything, we've scaled up the number of people on planet earth and the way and people who I make money probably isn't the way and people you make money with.

Just my own health and the periodic want to have company.  That's all.

 So I have this friend lets call him D, now D is one of my best friends who I’ve been friends with for 7 years, theres been quite a few rocky moments, mostly due to me not wanting to be D’s friend anymore and treating him badly, which I still feel pretty guilty about, but D was and has always been extremely loyal to me. D is pretty out there personality wise to say the least, he is extremely impulsive, blurts out very random things, and has very little social awareness that can make it VERY hard to be with him in public sometimes, but he means well so Im OK with it. 
  Over the years I’ve come to accept D’s personality and know he’s a nice guy but because he can be very polarizing Im one of if not the only very good friend he has. Something he does though that really annoys me, is he is a huge know it all, If I ever ask him a question that he doesn’t know the answer too he’ll just describe my question in extreme detail and give me a 15 minute word salad answer that doesn’t make any sense. 
  Whenever I try to talk to him about a passion I have he just acts like he knows exactly what Im talking about when it is extremely obvious he doesn’t and it is really cringey and uncomfortable for me. This is something people including me have made fun of him a lot for before and it can get pretty ridiculous to the point where everyone is laughing at him and when this happens he’ll laugh at himself too in like an embarrassed, self deprived way like he knows he’s full of shit but he still will continue to do it anyway. 
   So what I’d like to know is should I confront him about this? I don’t know if it’s right to criticize him because I have so many flaws myself as a person but this is just something thats been bugging me for the longest, and if I should how would I do this without hurting his feelings or coming off like I think I’m perfect or something?

59,"Some background: 21 yr old male here. I found out my childhood friends were using me and have been distancing  themselves from me and only talking to me when they need something for their sake. So basically I reached a point where I just want nothing to do with them. 

The last month has been brutal socially. I really have only had that group to socialize and go out with so I realize that there is a void of friendship in my life. But because I considered these individuals my only friends for so long, I realize I’m really shy to socialize with others and try to branch out. Do any of you guys have tips on meeting new people?

61,"Just 5 days ago I bought a car from a private party for $3200. I saw the ad online and when I got there, it wasn't in nearly as good of condition as I was expecting. I should have went with my gut instinct to pass on it, but my current car is on its last leg and I rushed into buying something I now regret. At the end of the day, it's my fault. But now I'm stuck with a car I'm really kicking myself in the butt for. I wanted something inexpensive but heck, I spent $2300 on my car when I bought it 5 years ago and it's actually in much better shape than this car. 

The issues aren't insane, but there's a number of issues that I really overlooked. I wanted something inexpensive, but I could have waited and bought something much nicer :/

Is it 'okay' to just turn around and re sell the car? Is it going to raise a red flag that I bought it and sold it right away?",30Jul2018,0
62,"i’ve been friends with my friend for about 11 years . from the beginning we were always close ! she was always so funny , she always put me in a good mood over anything . as we grew older , she became attached to electronics . she does suffer with depression on and off but she’s just always had something as a distraction for herself . first it was her laptop , then her phones . and i never really realized what was going on because i always like to see the best in people. but i got annoyed early on about this because i’d be talking to her and it would just go out of one ear . now it’s her phone and it is impossible to have her put it down for more than a second . she always has her vibrate on and texting people while she’s with me . and i don’t mean for like a second i mean she skips meals at my house and just stays on her phone on purpose. our family is like a second family to her because our moms met in high school . so it’s not like she doesn’t feel comfortable. that’s just what she does . when i’m sad she gets on the phone with me and she tries to comfort me . even though i know that’s probably not where her focus is . and when she’s down she knows i’m always available for her . and i try my absolute hardest to pick her up and sometimes i do but it is hard because she is struggling. i know she loves me but whenever i’m with her she’s never really “here” with me . just her and her phone . okay so here’s what happened . she was texting me about wanting to go back out with her ex . now her ex is also my friend and we all three have hanged out plenty of times over last summer when they were together . it was great for them . they only broke up because...  actually i’m not sure but it wasn’t a fight or anything . it was just because of something idk . so i was telling her you should go back out with him then because he’s a really great guy . and so she did and eventually she broke up with him that had him and i both in shock because i didn’t hear it from her first i heard it from him . he texted me early like “did you know she was gonna do that” and i didn’t know what he was talking about . and i asked her why . and she said it was because she wasn’t emotionally available . and she is still hung up on her other ex , and it’s not fair to him . and i was like okay then . and my friend was pretty downed but he said he was going to be moving away soon anyway so it’s okay and stuff but i really felt bad for him . i don’t want to date him but any girl would be lucky to. he is such a great guy . through that period of time she would text me stuff and i would be like “so you’re looking for a relationship again? “ and she’s like no , i’m not emotionally available . and i’m like oh yeah sorry . and then she goes and sends streaks with her and her friend pretending to kiss and i’m like “oh , i knew it “ because they are always like super close , and not like friend close . this seemed to be like MORE than friends . from the amount she posts of her friend and stuff . and she’s like “ what no that was fake , we didn’t really kiss “ . and i’m like oh i’m sorry . and just three days ago she was like don’t tell anyone but i lost my v . and i’m like to who . and she made me guess. and it was that same “friend”. and i went on their instagram account to find out that they have been dating since the day after she broke up with my friend ... and i’m like oh wow so y’all have been dating since him huh . and she’s like yeah , and it takes her a while but then she says i’m sorry . and at this point in my life . i cant tolerate conflict anymore and i don’t have time to be mad at people because honestly it’s just a a waste of time . so i said i forgive you and she said she loves me and stuff . but i deleted everything , i ended my streaks with everyone i deleted almost all my socials . i’m tired of everyone now . i don’t want to talk to her but she knows i forgive her . i just don’t want any part with her right now or for how ever long ... idk what to do . i don’t want to lose her as a friend but i’m tired . she doesn’t even pay attention to me when i’m around anyway . last time she was over , i was crying . and she was in the same room . and she didn’t even know because she was so hung up in her phone . and yes i told her about that a couple days later and she was sorry . but i don’t know what to do anymore , please help me if you even read this far lol . thank you and i’m sorry if that was everywhere .  on different days when we’re together we usually go out , with her being on her phone or we our makeup together . but with her now i see we don’t really have similar interests as in going out . so we usually stay in ... honesty is first in any relationship i have , i take that seriously . and i’m not even afraid to put myself out there . i told her “i know i’ve made lots of mistakes in the past “ ... i had on going lies . i don’t get it . please someone tell me what to do . if you read the whole thing , i hope you have a great day and for your life to be full of happiness .

63,"Hello redditors. A little backstory to my situation is about 2 months ago I had gotten hired at a local steakhouse originally to be a waiter then was changed to host. In the first two weeks I was there I was shadowing the waiters and learning the basics \[side note this establishment was only open weekends and only opens weeklong in the summer. I live in a tourist town in southern ontario canada where most establishments make most of their income during the warmest months of the year.\] so really it was only the first two weekends I was shadowing the waiters. at that point the owner pulled me aside told me I was shit, his own words which he pulled me aside a day later to apologize, but still not okay right? Anyways I got my first paycheck and it was low and I went to the owner and said hey isnt this illegal here what youre doing? asking about why im not being paid all my hours. So he says do you think you deserve it? You think if I look at those cameras I wont find you standing around or going for walks? Which I only did the first day or two because the building his restaurant is in is huge. And me thinking ok that is technically true but when there is nothing to do for 5 minutes and no customers I would see every other waiter on their phone except the two oldest guys. but me thinking it IS only like $40 bucks its not a big deal as long as next check is fixed. I would rather not fight the owner in the first week. He continues to go on fuck no its not legal but can you really blame me? and if you want to make a fuss about it youll be gone. Threatening me and im thinking ok buddy fuck you and youre restaurant. But everyone else I worked with was great, even the owners mom who would come in almost everynight at 6 was one of the sweetest ladies ive ever met. It was solely just the owner. So for the next couple weeks he would tell me how shit i was doing and moved me to a host position because my last job was sales and I am pretty good with talking to people. But heres the thing, Im still being paid as a waiter at 12.20 because they get tips. But I never got a tip ever except for the one time I brought a guy and his son into the bar part and he handed it to me personally. for those who do not know minimum wage in Ontario is $14/hr. On top of that the dress code for hosting was dress clothes with a tie and a vest. I had to stand outside for 7 hours a day in 90 degree weather dressed in all that. Everyday around the 5th hour it was so hot it would make me dizzy if i didnt get a glass of water every half hour but heres the messed up part whenever id go inside to get water if the owner was standing right there he would ask me why im not out there? \*doing my job\* as he would put it. The guy would guilt me saying he was the only one who didnt want to fire me when everyone else thought i was bad. He was often verbally abusive stating things like "" I swear to god if you ask me one more stupid question I will hit you"" and "" If i see you inside without customers you wont have a job tomorrow."" My stupid question by the way was if he was setting up for a bus because he was setting tables that are generally only used for the tour busses. 

My last day i was going to work I had to bike because my car was in the shop and it was so hot on the way i got heatstroke after 20 minutes so i sat down thinking I could get up in a couple minutes and keep going but after 20 more minutes i ended up calling in telling the owner what happened because hes also the main manager i guess but there already is a general manager idk. any ways hes not understanding in the slightest and sarcastically says thanks for champing it out for us youre a real champ i hope your next employer puts up with your shit, youre done here, etc. So next day the HR rep calls me and says what happened yesterday and i tell her and she asks what im going to do if i want to come in for my next shift and i say i dont think so but they need someone so i say yes because i did feel bad because it was only the owner i had a problem with. but then I call back half an hour later and say i dont think it would be best and I dont want to disrespect the owner etc. declining her offer because i just didnt want to work with that guy. So i go in to get my last check and my vest and tie. Everyone was nice and the HR rep talked to me in her office and it was all pleasant and i was saying goodbye. Then the owner comes in, again, and is like what are you doing here? She tells him ""he was getting his last paycheck"" and he said ""we'll mail it to you"" and I said I was also grabbing my vest and tie and just saying bye to everyone. And he then tells me why are you interrupting their work? You know their job? and I just say ok and walk out.  

I went from $3000 a month to $600 because this hoser catfished me with a job and since day one he's been a hotheaded verbally abusive dick. Is there any legal action or labor board help I can reach out to in this situation?",30Jul2018,1

69,"Me and my family went on vacation. I take medication for depression (zoloft). I accidently left it at home, and it's been 3 days since I took it last and I'm starting to feel a little off. Is there any way of getting my medication out here?",30Jul2018,2
70,"Obligatory, ""I'm on mobile"" warning. Sorry for the long post. And sorry it's so jumbled. There's just a lot of moving parts.

So background, I work for a nondescript company and started last October, part time in an office for 25 hrs/week at $13/hr. My original job description was pretty narrow, but over the year I've been added to more and more projects that were not at all something I was prepared for or described to me when I initially took the job. That has been fine with me because more often than not I had the extra time and I excelled at anything they gave me.

However, our parent company demanded a ton of layoffs for the coming year. I was asked to stay on. I am the only part timer still around. Later I found out that one of the admins would be taking over my position as the ""Lead"" to our team (the team being just me for the entire past year).

The executive director later asked me if I'd be interested in moving to a slightly different department, the department that they just cut all but one of their workers from. I really have no interest in this job because I was good friends with many of the people that had that position and they were at the bottom of the pecking order. They were the ones that were put in impossible positions and expecting to make gold from dirt. It is a live-in position and more often than not that got abused by the upper workers to get them to do things even on days off or after putting in 60 hour weeks. 

There are pros, no rent, 2/3 meals are provided every day, its much closer to the office and its full time whereas I'm part time now. 

In addition, from what they've described to me for this position I will be keeping my old job duties as a part of the ""team"" while also doing this live-in position and also doing the job of busing our ""clients"" to their destinations everyday. These were all three separate positions last year. I am beyond worried that this new position will be just me doing three jobs and slowly being drained like all my friends were last year.

When in the original talks and negotiations I told them I needed Sundays off and that was nonnegotiable for me. I told them of that made them reconsider me for the position I would understand. This was in late May. All I've heard since then is that it is in the works and they are drafting the paperwork. I have no doubts there is actually a job for me. They are too desperate for there not to be.

The present: The past three weeks I've been working my ass off. I've been getting home past 9pm and working over the weekend and working some 10 hour days. I've been putting my everything into my current project. I let the head of HR know two weeks in advance that of this continued I'd run out of hours for the month. Well, that went unheeded and now my ""Lead"" went into labor (she'll be on maternity leave until at least September) and my other team member is on vacation all week. I was approved for overtime, but HR said they'll need me for 40 hours this week (she told me this today, Sunday). It's my job and project so I'll do the work if I'm being compensated, but this work schedule doesn't look like it will be stopping any time soon.

My company has a terrible track record for having a work/life balance and my biggest fear is they won't respect the balance I need if I take the new position. I will be expected to do 3 jobs and live where I work. I had an anxiety attack over just the thought today as I frantically searched Indeed for other options.

What's keeping me then? It sounds terrible, right? Well, remember those friends who I said got laid off? At least one is still looking for work three months later. I was out of a job for over a year before finding this one. My biggest concern is my student loans that are $300+ each month.

If I can stay on with this team, I'd like to. It is a job where I can use my degree and when I'm not being overworked to sickness I find it very rewarding. I outright refuse to budge on my free Sundays for personal reasons and I'm not thrilled at the idea of taking on the duties of two extra jobs for the same $13/hr pay.

So my bottom line is, if this new position keeps putting up all these red flag I know will make me miserable, should I threaten and follow through with putting in my two weeks?

TL;DR My work place sucks and my new position might be worse, but I have bills to pay. Should I quit anyway?

75,"So maybe this is a bit too deep for this sub, not quite sure. Just figured I'd try. I've spoken with friends of mine, family, therapists, and nobody has shared this sentiment nor given me any help in trying to figure out what my problem is (though I can't honestly blame them).

The title essentially says it all. I don't care about anything. I've never been interested in dating, nor starting a family, I don't have many lofty career aspirations (though I do make money), I don't like to travel, and wealth/fame have always seemed extremely offputting. As I grow up more and more (I'm 20 and in college), I get the distinct impression that I don't really have much to live for, or to care about. It's not that I don't have a plan for my entire life, but moreso that I'm not sure what I'm really working towards, or that there's nothing to motivate me.

I have friends. Lots, actually, and I'm fairly sociable at that. I don't really have much of an issue functioning in society, though forming legitimate connections with people is almost impossible for me (hence not being interested in dating). The concept of being in a relationship like that doesn't really appeal to me. 

I also don't really get sad at all. I've had deaths in the family, pets die, parents divorced, etc. etc., and I've never really had much of an emotional reaction at all. I just don't talk to everyone while they cry and mourn and then I go off and keep doing my own thing. I'd entertain the thought of myself being a sociopath if I wasn't so capable of functioning pretty healthily in social situations.

I don't really know precisely what I'm expecting out of this. I guess I'm just wondering if anybody has ever experienced this before, and if it's maybe just a temporary state of mind? Or if anybody does share these sentiments, let me know how you cope with it. It would be nice just to know that I'm not the only one. Anyway, sorry for the lack of brevity here. I tried to keep it short, but that wasn't too easy. ",30Jul2018,2
76,"I am 18F and my boyfriend is 18M. We just graduated high school and are both taking a gap year to work and make some money for university. In high school I was close with maybe 5 people (including bf). All of these people are going away to university this fall so it will be just us left when summer is over. 

I have no other friends and I don’t know how to make any. Lately I’ve started to feel really isolated and I just wish I had somebody (besides my bf) to talk to. I feel like I’m being too clingy and dependant on him. I’m very shy and have a lot of social anxiety, and I tend to embarrass myself when meeting new people.

77,"Before I say anything, I want to say that there is no use finding my identity through this account, the work I do through it is purely fictional (Save for, this post). Even the roast me on my profile isn't me, it's a close family member.

I am 17, 18 in a month and I have no aspirations, no real will to live, and a general apathy about everything. I've been on both sides of the hill, I've committed crimes (Sexual harassment, assault on a woman, theft, though these were years ago back when I was much more foolish about how I handled life and my emotions.) and I've done good things too, (Volunteered at nursing home, defended a girl from sexual stalkers, small stuff like that). 

After being on both sides of the hill, I can say that I prefer being a good person, its easy, free and will immortalize you. However a thought came to my mind last night, I'm a big strong guy, I have no immediate family I care about and nothing to lose. I'm not even depressed is the funny thing, maybe I'm just crazy. I could totally body the criminals that surround this town with little to no effort required. The police in this town are complete jokes, fat lazy psychopaths (Police brutality here on black people is nuts, I live in a really small town I will not mention as I don't want my identity easily figured out if this comes out against me later) who are still raw that Mitt Romney didn't win the election in 2012.

The criminals here take advantage of the towns size and low security/lack of police force. These aren't deadly or scary people by any means, I've witnessed and been victim to them before, they are little scrawny meth addicts who like to rob, assault and rape people. I've got a few hundred in the bank, I'm thinking ill buy a couple pieces of undershirt/leg armor for general threats (Knife/gunfire attacks). A big strong metal motorcycle helmet, and a nightstick and patrol next month when I am 18. 

4 people are victim to stupid bullshit a night here, and nobody is doing anything about it, so I think that its time somebody showed a little affection.

It's hard to resell furniture in my city because I live in a university town and also I won't be here towards the end of the lease because I have co-op. And I'd rather own one item and be responsible for it than part ownership in everything.

85,"Hello! I'm currently a rising junior at a small university in Chicago. I'm majoring in accounting, and mostly I've stuck with it for the past 2 years because I was getting a $6,000 per year scholarship for sticking with it. Welp, I figured out pretty quickly I'm not really interested in accounting through the classes and my audit internship. I started looking into other majors, and I realized that I really enjoy working with computers. I've taken a few programming classes and really enjoyed them, but I haven't declared a double major or minor in CS yet.

I also applied and was accepted as a transfer student (for this fall) to a larger university within my state. They're reputable for having a great CS program, but it's really hard to get into, so I only got into the economics program. 

I'm wondering if it would be a good move to transfer into the state university for economics and perhaps minor in CS. I am interested in econ, but I'd rather find a job in CS.

86,"So a few weeks ago I was at work, checking the dates on the chilled products, when this guy who I recognise as a fairly regular customer asks to talk to me about something for a moment. I was surprised and had no idea what it could be about at first, then he asked me if I could lend him £20 for cigarettes and beer. (Apparently for work?!) Now because I usually do like to help people out in these situations, I gave him a 20, he saying he'd get it back to me same time the next day. 

A day passes. Nothing. Next time I see him is a week later. He says he'll give it to me when he gets paid in a week. Fine, I think, I get that he might be short if he hasn't been paid yet. I give him some more time. Two nights ago, I see him again, after another week or two. He tells me he'll leave it for someone to hand over to me tomorrow, when I'm in later than usual. I get through the next day, then think to ask my boss if someone left any money for me. Of course, no one has. Now I'm getting angry. If he doesn't have it next time I see him, I'll he proper upset. My question is, does he have intention of paying me back or is he just playing me? Should I be more forceful in insisting that he give me the money?

Also note that he's brought beer and cigs since and I've seen plenty of money in his wallet. He's buying non essential stuff instead of paying me back.

Advice? ",30Jul2018,5
88,"I'll try to make this concise.

Some things to know:

- My parents own a small convenience store together that was bought over a decade ago. It used to run really well, up until my parents legal separation, and our income was cut in half. Employees have been let go because they threatened workers' comp for non-existent injuries and current employee (only 1) has no sense of customer service and knows we are at his mercy, as my mom cannot run the store herself. My dad cannot help or run the store due to issues below.

- My father is an alcoholic with mental illness that cannot be resolved for god knows what reason, and other physical health problems (he had his gallbladder removed and now is constantly having pains). He was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and possible bipolarity, and given medication that he tried to take consistently (it turned him into a zombie, no feelings and dead inside). Sometimes he is normal, sometimes he slurs his words and doesn't remember a thing, and completely slumps over. He cannot work at our store for these reasons, as his mood swings are wild and he threatens people, and drinks alcohol from the store and get drunk there. All in all, he cannot control himself. He has gotten a DUI and has been arrested recently for public intoxication, and has been hospitalized approximately 2-3 times a month for the past 2 years. Social workers and police have called me about him on many ocassions. 

- My mom is another handful, a woman with an attitude, but suffered abuse (not mainly physical) from my father and her previous marriage, which has left her bitter. Now has to work 7 days a week almost 10 hours a day herself to maintain our small business, and is exhausted in all shapes in forms. 

- I also have a younger brother, 16, who is smart and great, but traumatized from the shit my father, he cannot do much in this moment, until he turns 18 when he is free to go to college and not have to deal with my father, and neither do I. 

My parents have been legally separated (not full on divorced) for about 3 years. Divorce couldn't happen because our house and store are on loans/mortgages against each other in some form, and neither parent can buy the store/house off each other. In order to retain some income, my mom took over the store (my father was drinking too much and would drink from the store, get drunk, act stupid basically, not professional for business).

In the past 5ish years it has become run down, not sure if it has to do with decreased income of the area, political issues making people spend less (high volume of Hispanics for our store demographics, many who could be deported but are diligent workers), or poor business tactics on our end (I think my dad used to have drugs involved on the side when he was running the business which may have made our income, I may be wrong though).

I work/live about 2 hours away near my old uni which I graduated from. I have a good job that is sustaining me for another 2 months, and then I need to find another as I have a lease here until June 2019. I think I can manage myself, my mom has been helping me a little here and there. I can't take time off to go and help my mom with our business or with my brother (like taking him to school, since his pickup/dropoff times conflict with how long my mom can work at the store).

A big issue is my dad's financials. He has an expensive car which we were thinking of selling, but hald the time he is not sober enough or awake, so we can't take him anywhere to sign papers to sell it.
He also has 13k in debt on a credit card and he kept failing to make payment because again, he was never sober enough to know what was happening.
He also has a lease on an apartment, and even if we can find a replacement the issue is getting him sober enough to sign papers.

My father is ruining our lives and costing us thousands of dollars a month plus his debt which ultimately comes and attacks my mom's accounts, since they have a joint account somewhere from the same bank he had his account with debt, and they said that they will take it from there. 

I guess my real question is how do I even begin to handle this?

- Can I become my dad's guardian since he is out of his mind so I can make legal decisions for him and get him somewhere better? 

- I want to send him to India with his family because no one here wants to help him (for good reasons, he made our lives miserable the last 5 years), but I also can't just dump him on the street. I think his drinking recently comes from anger of being alone and having no job, so I thought maybe if he sends some time with his family he will feel better and get to his senses.

I just need any guidance that can help me through any part of this mess.",30Jul2018,1
89,"So, I'm a video game designer. It's a cool industry, and I like working in the field. I get to be creative, it's challenging, and it's rewarding.

I've worked in big and small studios in my career, and I prefer the small ones. I like that my boss is ""in the trenches"" with us. I like the camaraderie.

Right now, I'm working on a project for a very small company (we're talking 5 employees) that's starting from the ground. I believe in the project, and I think it'll be successful, but...

I can't even say anything without him taking over a conversation.

So, all of this aside he talks down to people. Like... A lot. He has a snarky voice when answering a question, and it always seems like he's doing us a favour by honouring us with knowledge.

By way of background, my neighbor is elderly, but clearly a very capable woman. She does her own yard work and has declined many offers to shovel snow. She is also very reserved. We are by no means close, though we’re always friendly and she has let me help a few times when we got a significant snowfall and she couldn’t handle shoveling on her own. 

Earlier today, she casually mentioned that her relative was coming to move in with her and, in a flurry of more words than I think she’s said combined in years, told me that this relative: has terminal cancer; does not intend to seek any treatment; and will be living with her until the end. 

I know my neighbor is involved in her church, but she rarely has people over and she shared today that she and this relative have no other family. Having gone through the process of helping a relative live out their last years at home, I know how much work is likely to be involved, and I want to help without being intrusive or invading my neighbor’s privacy.

110,"My girlfriend of just under a year is the best thing to ever happen to me.  We haven't seen each other since the semester ended over two months ago, but we Facetime almost every night and things have seemed good. About a week ago though she told me that some random guy has been hitting on her, and assured me everything was ok and she was trying to get him to stop talking to her. She told me she made a reddit post with a throwaway account to ask for advice, but she seemed hesitant or uncomfortable about the subject. Something felt a little off, so I checked her reddit account, as I snooped a little and found the username. I know this isn't healthy behavior, and I've done nothing like it before. Her account had only one post, on /r/offmychest which said this.

""As the title and my username reveal, I’ve been feeling a bit anxious for the past few days. So, I’ve been with my boyfriend for about five months and we’re currently in a stable, loving relationship. I can envision a future with him and I love him very much. Yesterday, a male acquaintance who I briefly met a week ago sent me an Instagram follow request. I thought it was harmless to accept his follow request, so I did. There are many pictures of my boyfriend and I together on my account, making it pretty obvious that I’m not single.

Almost immediately after I accepted his follow request, he started Insta messaging me. We’ve mainly just been getting to know each other a little better (e.g. jobs, education, hobbies, etc.). We were talking about the fact that we both enjoy going fishing and hunting. After a while, though, some of his messages became a bit flirty. He said that I was very attractive and cute. I thanked him for the compliment, but I didn’t flirt back. I’ve noticed that he responds really quickly whenever I message back, almost as if he is staring at his phone waiting for the next text.

Shortly after, he invited me to come over to his apartment for dinner and drinks. He thinks it’ll be fun to get drunk together. This made me feel a bit uneasy, because he knows that I have a boyfriend, but decided to flirt with me and ask me out anyway. I don’t feel comfortable going on something that feels like a “date” with a guy who isn’t my boyfriend. I also don’t want to be drunk and alone with this guy, who I have known for a week.

I also told my sister about the situation. I have told her numerous times that I would feel guilty hanging out one-on-one with this guy, especially because he seems to think that we would be on a date. She just seems to brush aside my relationship and suggests that I hang out with him soon. She wants me to consider dating other guys and to be open-minded with this guy. I have only ever seriously dated my current boyfriend, and my sister suggested that he could be a way for me to get more dating experience. She also admires the fact that he has a full-time job and a master’s degree.

I kinda gave into her pressure and told this guy that we could go out to dinner sometime. However, I’m regretting saying this to him. I’m really anxious about the thought of going on a “date” with him. He obviously wants to see me soon, but I’m not so sure. What do I do now?""

It wasn't nearly as bad as all the things I had envisioned, but it definitely makes me feel sad and somewhat betrayed. She seems uncomfortable about the idea, but the fact that she is considering going on a ""date"" to drink with some random guy - based on the passing comments of her sister - gives me a terrible feeling in my stomach, and I know I'm not going to get any sleep tonight. Why does she need dating experience if she envisions a future with me? Does she want to just expose herself to new men who have their lives put together and see if she prefers that? I'm sorry for the long post, I just really don't know how to feel right now and needed to put this out there.

I'm looking to see where I stand on how other people spend their days so I can see if I should be pushing myself harder or if I'm on the right track and get some relief! So it would actually really help me if people could be specific with what the day would look like. Did you work out? Did you do chores? Run errands? Go to school? Do homework? How much tv do you watch? Computer time? etc. I'm sure others wonder the same thing!

Here's what my days off (not working) generally look like:

\-I wake up around 8:30 and eat breakfast/drink coffee. I'll either watch tv or read.

\-I usually will do the dishes for the family (everyone is at work except for me) and start my laundry.

\-After doing those two things, I'll usually just be chill and browse the internet, catch up on tv shows, read, write, study lines for any show I'm in or monologue I'm working on, etc. until like noon. Usually though I just watch tv until like noon, then I'll eat lunch.

\-I'll fold the laundry, do some straightening up the house, run any errands I need to run until like 3 o'clock. So usually a solid 3 hour block of productivity.

\-Then my family gets home and we all usually talk about our days for a while and hang out for like a half hour. I'll go in my room and do homework if I have any, or browse the internet until dinner.

\-Then after dinner its usually chillsville for me. Either reading, writing, or watching tv. I'll go out with friends like twice a week at night.

I feel like I should be doing more. Working harder on my craft (I want to be an actor), or something that has to do with the career I want. I should work out or something. Even writing this I feel like I had a lot of downtime in it.

I cry within 20 minutes when I get in because I can't handle it that fact she can't do the bare minimum of her job. She leave me hours behind schedule. This lady doesn't care. She walks around putting blame on everyone else but won't do her job.
My problem has become to get out my frustration I rant. It just feels so good to get everything out to people who understand the situation. Sometime I do say awful things. But I rant to anyone that wants to listen. This includes my workers I supervise. This is not professional. I'd rather find another way to get out my frustration. Or try not getting frustrated.
And I rather not have what I've said to a few people to get around the building because of lack of judgement on my part. 

They wont replace her or move me to a different location. I can't quit my job or find another one that pays the same.
I just need help getting through the day without going insane and talking badly about the previous supervisor. Any advice would help.",30Jul2018,1
119,"In October 2017 depression hit me. (26F)  I thought it would go away and didn't. I began to see a therapist in January 2018.  She helped a lot, but then I seemed to plateau and then things got drastically worse.  She suggested I start a  partial hospitalization program /intense outpatient program (PHP/IOP)  I absolutely hated my job and applied for FMLA, took a month off to do treatment (May 2018),  got help, got on the right medication and got hired at a job I now absolutely love.

 The problem now is that my depression has taken such a toll on my sex life and relationship with my boyfriend, that now that I'm feeling better I'm still having a hard time getting it all back.  I see him suffering and he has told me it has made him resentful towards me.   We used to have such a crazy fun sex life, and now sex is almost non existent.

And the other part is that my parents are tree service business owners so currently I work full time in summers doing that and my dad told me that to help with college he will instead of giving me money out right, will just pay me way more than what ill get at any job at this point(this way there is less taxes so he says).

125,"Hi there.

I'm 21 years old and just moved back in with my parents temporarily after college and have come to realize that the way my parents ""care"" for their pets is lacking. My parents have four dogs (shih tzus) and three cats. 

My mom doesn't have a job or any means of income and refuses to work any job because of her bad back and lack of job skills. My dad is an independent mechanic. I work part-time until my paid internship starts next month, but the stipend isn't large. Our household uses food stamps to get by. The financial situation here isn't great. 

My dad is the one who buys cat/dog food and cat litter, but he doesn't buy them much else unless my mom repeatedly tells him to. This means the dogs often have shaggy hair, long nails, and a weird smell before they're groomed. The cats sometimes subsist on food crumbs before they get more food.

Right now, it turns out the dogs have fleas. Two of them have chewed the bases of their tails raw, so they are now scabbed. I have leftover student loan money I was hoping not to touch until I had to start paying it back, but it appears I'll need to dip into it to pitch in.

I can't foresee myself paying for their pets forever, and it makes me feel awful knowing they're not living their best lives. I'm trying my best to help with what I have. I already know they won't want to give any of the pets up.

What can I do?

126,"Ok so a bit of background. I'm a student living with my parents, but they're on holiday right now. My parents are married. I'm home alone watching the house so to speak.

So a day ago I needed my prescribed ADD medication to study. I had run out so I call my mom if she had left some spare tablets laying around the house. She told me that they where in this jewelery box. So I look in the box, and there they are. There was also this little black ring-box. I know I'm not supposed to snoop around and I have no business looking that which I came for, but curiosity got the better of me.

There were 2 rings that looked like they could be wedding rings. Engraved in both was a date, one that came some years before my parent's wedding, and there were names. One was my mother's, but the other I had never heard of.

My mom and I are quite close and we talk a lot, but I've never heard the name of the guy in the ring.
So here comes the million dollar question: what do I do with this information? 

Do I ask her who he is/was?
Do I live life like I found nothing and nothing happened?
Do I ask my dad?

Any suggestions or questions are welcome

127,"Sorry for the wall of text and the rant, I’m just so frustrated and need help navigating my life. I just want to lay down and sleep and I just want things to stop. 

TLDR: I don’t think I’m good at my current job. Idk if I should quit being a lawyer. I have a new opportunity to work in my field of choice but I feel disloyal,  I’m afraid I’m not good enough, and I dont want to let anyone down. What can I do to get out of this rut? I outline this as (1) background, (2) issue and (3) advice? 

***Background: I finished the bar this time last year. I went through contract job after contract job. Passed the bar and kept working contract jobs just to make rent. No matter how bad it got I just kept working b/c I thought I wanted to be a litigator. I finally landed a firm job in construction last March, I was over the moon. I finally got to practice as an associate rather than just a contract lawyer. I had health insurance, enough to make rent, food, and I could start paying my loans back. It felt so good to be able to spoil my girl, and take my family out to dinner for my birthday last week. I was feeling so good when I first got this job 4 months ago. 

I have a lot of background in employment law, I read that stuff for fun, but I have never worked in construction law. It’s not hard but it takes me time to get up to speed with all the terms and stuff. I thought if I work hard it would all be ok, I would work to build my skills as a litigator and move to an employment law position in the future. But I suck at my job. I have never worked in construction. Idk anything about buildings, I know this is just an excuse for my own incompetence, others have done it why can’t I? 

Nevertheless I kept working, I tried so hard but my work is still shit. I feel like I always need help. What did I even learn in law school? I’m starting to resent my job. I work 10-12 hours a day and still a few hours on the weekends but it’s never enough. I can’t bill and I’m barely making it by (work wise). I put in at least 12 hours this weekend already. 

It takes me so long to do things. But my team is amazing, my boss takes time to work with me with what little time is available and I feel comfortable asking questions but when I try to do things on my own it never works out. I have money, not a lot, but no time to enjoy it. I’m exhausted all the time. My gf is worried b/c I pass out as soon as I get home. I think she’s starting to hate it because I don’t spend any time with her. I’m either working, thinking about work or sleeping. Nothing else. We just got into an argument b/c she wanted to take a trip for a few days but I couldn’t let myself take those days off. I get it it’s my fault, I do this to my self I don’t have to work so much, I can take time off whenever I want. But I just can’t do it, idk why. 

I use to train BJJ and lift everyday and now the most exercise I get now is walking to my office from the bathroom. 

***issue: I don’t know what to do, I feel like maybe it’s the job or maybe I wasn’t meant to be a lawyer. I keep thinking, even if I change jobs I would still be miserable. I would still suck at being a lawyer. 

Now my problem is I was not expecting to look for a new job until at least a year at my current firm, but this morning a friend of mine hit me up, and told me there was a position opening up on her team and she thought of me. It would be in employment, the type of law I’m all about. My salary would shoot up about 20k-40k at least. My billables would be about 50hours less. And the firm would be a lot bigger and more prestigious. 

All that fluff is nice and it does mean something to me but I’m more excited that its employment law. Everything sounds good but I have two fears. I feel disloyal leaving only 4 months in at this firm. They have taken the time to train me and probably losing money as I’m working here. Idk if I can do that to my Partner. My second and biggest fear is that I might make a fool of my self at this new firm. I want to do good work, I don’t want anyone to be burdened by me and I do not want to jeopardize my friend’s reputation in case I can’t actually do the work. What if I end up hating it? This is not even a for sure thing, I still have to interview. I’m such a little shit for worrying about something that’s not even mine yet, wtf? 

****advise?: I don’t know how to navigate my life. Idk what to do. I just want to be a good litigator and be happy. I want to love my job and be challenged. I want to be able to hangout with friends, see my family more and enjoy time with my girl. I feel so lost and alone, how do I do this? ",30Jul2018,1

132,"So a little bit of a story. Sorry if it’s a little long. 

I live with my parents and my older sister (she’s almost 18, I’m 15). She and I get along really well for the most part, and we hang out pretty often. A couple nights ago, she came to my room and invited me to come watch a movie with her. It was close to 10pm and I was pretty tired, but I accepted cause I never turn down a movie. It was weird she was inviting me that late but I  didn’t think to much about it. 

We were in the living room on our couch under a blanket, we had the lights off, and my parents were upstairs. I was cuddled up to her, which is pretty common for us, and just kind of dozing. I wasn’t really keeping up with the movie but I was enjoying her company anyway. 

At some point, it must have been about an hour in, she puts her hand on my chin (gently) and kisses me on the lips. I didn’t fight her at first, I didn’t really know how to react. She kisses me a little harder and puts her hand on my breast. The whole thing was pretty gentle. It didn’t feel like she was forcing herself on me, I guess. I pulled away and asked her what she was doing. She didn’t say anything and darted away back upstairs and slams the door. 

This was about three days ago, and she hasn’t talked to me since. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to go to my parents because I don’t want her to get in trouble. I don’t know how to feel about any of this. Was I molested? Am I overreacting? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.  ",30Jul2018,348
133,"This is going to be a long one.

I’ve been holding this post off for months now, but I realized I’m in need of help. I'm guy 18 who has just graduated high school, and I’m not sure what is the “best” plan given my circumstances. But let me give you the full rundown, so you guys can give me other opinions.

This “story/issue” starts my junior year of high school (2016-2017) year. My parents tell me we are going to move at the end of that year for financial reasons (taxes are high, poor in a wealthy community, a family of 7), I’m feeling sad as fuck that I’ll be leaving all the friends. 

So we move I’m in a new state 2 hours from my old house. This is now the summer of my junior year going into senior year of of high school. My mom who’s very catholic brings up the idea that we should me and my other 2 younger siblings should be homeschooled (for the first time in my life). I personally wasn’t sure if I wanted that, but on the other hand moving to a new school senior year would’ve been ass. So my mom forces us to be homeschooled, in addition to this going on I work on marketing this game my 2 older brothers are working on. (Not to be confused with my 2 younger siblings, there’s 5 children including myself).  

So my older brothers who haven’t found work yet decided to work on developing a game, I said I wanted to learn marketing, so I did tons of research and applied t to the game they were making. I grew the social media accounts with 0 dollars and followers to over 6k, we had people who were interested....but no game insight since the coder we were paying for, in a paid/rev share Deal was taking forever since they had personal issue going on in their life. So this was an issue the entire senior year. 

In addition, this senior year I was learning some 3D art skills. I was originally thinking of joining the VfX industry, but this changed more recently. I went to a couple of colleges touring to see which was the right fit, but ultimately given my family’s financial situation, my parents were not going to give me any money for college which I understand some they have 5 kids, and me knowing debt crisis right now I did not hop on to any University loan train. 

So now to present time, I finally finished up school. I’m 18 currently, you’re probably wondering what happened to that game you’re working on? That game is still on hold, the dev didn’t take the money we paid him yet, but as of now we don’t know the ETA, (it will cost us $500). Given that I had a years worth of marketing knowledge for a game that didn’t launch, we decided to become a marketing company for the indie games. 

We have 4 clients, we are promoting their content, but remember, we are running on a zero budget...so marketing is very creative with us. We have made money technically but it’s very tiny ad revenue from each game since the service we provide is “we will market you game for free and you give us 10-25% of sales of your game”. So we’ve gotten downloads and I’m seeing progress and we have some bigger strategies to put into play, but the issue now (do to time)  is do I go to college or do I stay working on “real” business for the next year (as a gap year).  I have to make this decision in the next 3 days... so I’m not sure.

Here’s the info on the college deal, so I’d be going to community college which I’d have to commute to, it would be paid for with scholarships, and If I do go their and I maintain a 3.2 GPA, then I’ll get $5k from some rich donor (BTW I’ve always been a B student so...). 

The other part of me says no, I may never have this chance to work on a business on my own, even if our business fails it’s still good information I’ve learned that most of people my age have never done. Also I’d basically being high school again since that’s what you do in your first 2 years of college. 

You’re probably also wondering to what happened to my desire for 3D art and becoming a VFX artist in the industry. I did some soul searching and more research into the industry and found out that it is not what I thought, and I’d have to be obsessed with art to even make it and I realized I’m more of a hobbyist anyway.

Back to the big decision on what I’ll do this fall 2018. I want to make the decision that will probably benefit me the most (obviously), my dad is in support of me and my older brothers working on a startup, my mom, all of my extended family believe we are crazy for trying our own business. They think I should start college immediately this fall, also I haven’t told all my friends that I’m doing this company. Tbh I’m a little embarrassed because they make think I’m not totally “serious”. Besides from that a lot of the people I know think I’m going to school this fall, but I really need to see this through. 

Some extra information, I haven’t been working any part-time jobs recently. I’ve been very busy working on marketing related work. It doesn’t take up 100% of my day, but it does take up random chunks of time. As I said before about money, our company was started this June 2018, and our income is revenue on our clients games, so it’s been very tiny, we are trying to grow, and our biggest issue has been money. We do have plans to try to do bigger deals with YouTubers.

Me personally, I’ve never wanted to be a 9-5 worker, so going entrepreneurial is something that I really enjoy. I do understand risk to reward ratio, and I do know that this company could very well fail. Knowing that this might be my only chance I can try this out, I feel that it needs to be finished, I want to see us win or lose and I don’t want regret. As I said before, I could skip a year and if our company bombed, my tuition at the community college would be paid for and I could go next year. I’d go into marketing since I do have minor experience with and I kind of enjoy it. Like the only thing holding me back from just going straight to the gap year and saying fuck college, is that all of friends/extended (who will now be at different colleges) will think I’m going to fail. In addition, if it does fail I’ll be a year behind going into school. Also this year since I was homeschooled, I literally didn’t make ANY new friends. (This would require a whole other post), so yeah homeschooling should pretty ass, and seeing people at a college would make me feel in “reality” again, but I’m sure I could find some social group if I do go for a gap year which I’m leaning towards. 



So what do you guys think? That was the whole run down, Am I crazy for considering a gap year?

We've had conversations here and there in which he says he is straight. 
I technically never said I was straight, but I implied it. However, he also knows I'm more fluid with my sexuality. I have mentioned I would date a transgender. I also have mentioned if a guy asked me out I'd probably say yes (with the caveat that there wouldn't be any sex...eh, kinda lied there but I didnt want to fully say it because I'm afraid. I dont know why as he is LGBT supporter)... 
He hates physical contact (touch, hugs etc) but whenever there is a dog, or cat he gets super close. Like I'd be hugging the doggy and he wants to pet it or kiss it and he'd borderline kiss me. Fucks me up every time. Ofcourse it never does happen if there isnt an animal involved. 
I cant tell if he is in the closet or if he means it when he says he is straight. Even if he was, he'd still have to like me.

138,"Hi everyone, I have an older sister who has borderline personality disorder, with multiple suicide attempts in the past, all of which I've been the one to handle first-hand (receiving suicide note/text/post, calling police, etc)...which might be what's caused a lot of my depression and anxiety. I have a lot of anxiety about the future and the unknown, I tend to be a person that likes to have plans and at least some structure (not militaristic-ally so though). Surprise visits, etc can stress me out, even if they are good and fun.
 
My relationship with my older sister has always been unhealthy. I've been living out of fear, obligation and guilt for nearly 8 years. I feel like I've just lived my life running around making sure she's well enough to not kill herself and making sure I don't ignite her. This past year, my sister has been somewhat ""stable"" in that there's been no known suicide attempts. It's also the year that's been very hard for me to try and have a more ""normal"" relationship with my sister, such as trying to draw some boundaries but I feel like it's too late.

The thing keeping me up the most tonight is actually something pretty simple/stupid. I live in my own condo that I own, but have 2 roommates to help pay the mortgage/HOA fees. My sister has a key and usually tells me when she'll come visit (she lives about 3hrs away) but only gives me notice the night before. She's actually planning to sleep over at my place for 2-3 days with a friend. Out of respect for my roommates (or even just for me), I want her to give me a little more notice. Now I feel like she thinks I'm being ""too controlling"" but asking her to give me &gt;24-hr notice if she plans to sleep over with a friend...but this is common courtesy no? 

Am I controlling and insane or is it just that my sister walks all over me? Any particular resources that you can give to help me draw boundaries with her? Maybe let go of this fear that if I don't let her walk all over me, that she'll end up killing herself again?",30Jul2018,1

140,"I’m 5’9” (175 cm). I’ve always been big. Not in a bad way! Just built like that. I’m not looking for a pity party or anything, but lately I’ve been having some body issues. Last time I checked, average BMI for my height is 150 lb. (60kg). I’m estimating I’m around 180 lb. (81kg) now; no scale at home, but I know I’ve gained from the 174 I was at my last physical. I’m fairly lucky in the looks department, and I don’t mind being on the larger side, but it’s been eating away at me. 
I have a really large chest so it’s easy to not see, but I feel like my waist is huge. Seriously. Every time I look in a mirror I feel unhealthy. Back to school shopping hasn’t helped with that issue. Problem is, I’m terribly un-motivated. Always have been. A slew of depression, anxiety, ptsd and whatever thrown in with a dash of general laziness simply eats away at my desire to do anything. It’s always affected my life, but for the most part I’ve been able to overcome it! I know I can lose the weight if I work at it. I’ve been able to succeed in school, and my social life has improved greatly. I just can’t seem to stick with losing the weight.
My longterm goal is 160 (72kg), just 10 lb over average. I’ll move onto 150 from there if I still don’t feel like I’m at a good weight. Short term goal is to lose 5 pounds over the next 3 weeks at 1 or 2 pounds per week. My plan is to portion my meals and exercise at home everyday or at the gym when I can for at least 30 minutes, goal being an hour, and to walk instead of drive when I can. But with all the above, how can I keep myself motivated? How can I stay inspired to get down to my desired weight over a long period of time? Any resources for at home exercise or even just general things you personally do to stay motivated and healthy would be a huge help. Thank you!

143,"I am just wondering whether I should trust her to take it well, or whether is more productive to work on it and hope it gets better before I feel sore enough to talk to her about it. Nonetheless, I have a script in mind:

&gt;I just wanted to apologize, I have been acting super awkward recently. My brain's just been scrambled. (Wait for a cue to talk about it.)

&gt;Well, I have just been having bad memories, of something that happened in 2012. BASICALLY, one of my closest friends at the time stopped talking to me entirely. That was bad enough, but no one told me why for months and months, until a mutual friend said that she thought I was a creep, and got turned off.

&gt;This is why, I don't know if you have noticed, but I get kind of nervous when I'm talking to you. I just don't want to say or do anything that's going to make you feel uncomfortable. I know, you're cool: you're probably one of the most genuine people I have ever met, but the fear is still there. I just don't want to isolate myself.

&gt;It's super embarrassing, I know, but I have kind of blown it out of proportion by panicking about it, so I didn't want to hold it in much longer. 

The only thing is, it is SUPER difficult to calibrate, because stupidly, the management of the company we work at sends the casuals home fifteen minutes early, to save money, and so she is already gone by the time I finish. Sometimes we finish together, but even then, there's no guarantee she'll be alone.

Should I? Any recommendations on what to say are welcome as well.",30Jul2018,1
144,"[x-post from /r/dogadvice ] 
I have a friend who got rid of her cat to get a dog because I got a dog. I advised her not to get a husky since she lives in a multiple story apartment and shes just not the type that would go out for runs... or give enough time for the dog. (She got a husky/german shepard puppy) she just got whatever husky on craigslist she could find that was cheap anyways. Ever since then she kept telling me about how her dog is so crazy, destroys stuff, jumps on the couch, wont listen, barks, tries to escape, etc. I've told her she needs to physically and mentally tire him out, but her response is that she already does by walking him for 15 minutes a day and letting him run after balls in courts with her toddler son. I've explained how he needs more stimulation. And now she says she wants to get rid of him and get a great dane when she gets a different a place with a backyard. I dont know what to really do.... I feel so bad for her dog... even her son. All she does is worry about how she looks and how to get more instagram followers and likes. 
(Oh yea, she also got a kid when she found out I did... these would only be 2 out of the many things I realised she has done similar to me. My boyfriend/his friends also noticed this and are really weirded out)

Do I tell her to rehome her dog? I know shes waiting for me to approve -.-""",30Jul2018,1

146,"I had a friend named lauren she was probably one on the closest friends i’ve ever had. We were friends for 8 years until a couple of months ago...

Lauren had started hanging around the wrong crowd in 2016. She was on coke and messing around with guys much older than her (she was underage) and i was extremely worried about her. Ever since i met her i knew something was off with her but i loved her. She has told me and shown me multiple time her multiple personalities. One is named Nathan, a particularly violent character. I never questioned her about her personalities i just went with it. She also claims she does not feel pain, like at all. It also worries me because she has self harmed multiple times. 


Here’s the main story i’m here to tell which leads to my question for advice. A couple of months ago i began dating a guy named Ryan. To make a long story short Lauren had been sexting with Ryan while i was over at her house. I was extremely upset but i had already planned to stay the night at her house again so i took a calm approach and decided to stay over again and talk about things with her. We argued quite a bit that night. Around one AM  i had enough of it so i decided to grab my bags and leave. There was also one other friend there that night. She decided to come with me because she was worried about me walking home alone. The other friend and I walked out and went on our way. We got to the end of the driveway and my friend had forgot her charger so we went back to the house to get it. We walked inside and Lauren was standing there loading a shotgun. I immediately broke down and couldn’t comprehend what was happening. My other friend grabbed the gun from her and i called my mom. At this point i didn’t know whether i hated lauren or i felt bad for her. Anyways, my mom picked us all up and lauren slept on my couch that night because her parents were not able to pick her up. Lauren was picked up the following morning by her parents, and she no longer has a phone so i have not been in contact with her. I do know that she was not put in a mental hospital or anything, i’ve been texting her mom every week asking about lauren and she claims she’s doing good, but i’m not sure if i believe that. I am still friends with some people who are still friends with lauren. i’ve been told that lauren is still on hard drugs and sneaking out every night. 


In conclusion, I want to know how i can get her put in therapy or something because i am extremely worried about her. i have always felt like something happened to her as a child and that is the reasoning for her multiple personalities and the way she acts. This isnt to make lauren seem like a bad person im just asking how i can get her some help, without being her guardian. ",30Jul2018,1
148,I've recently developed this idea that the world is too ugly to inhabit. The thought of people constantly being two-faced has really taken a toll on me. It makes me physically sick to hear or watch others bully one another. Social media is ugly. It makes me sick having to stare at all these people and feel like my life is NOT enough because it's not like theirs. I hate the way young girls act now. Innocence and pureness is gone. All of this shakes me to my core. I want to give up on the world. It scares me. I hate how evil the world is and I no longer want to be apart of it. I want real people. I want friends who love me. I want a family who doesn't feel the need to talk about each other behind closed doors. I want passionate love. I want to be able to feel my soul connecting with another persons through sex. I want to feel happy. I want to experience geniune laughs and warm bodies. I want to stop feeling like I'm dying. The lack of good experiences has left a hole in my psyche. I feel empty.

150,"I had a best friend when I was eleven. But then we grew really apart when our classes shuffled. 5 years later, we got in the same class again and I have absolutely no interest in talking to him. Here is why :

1) *he looks fake af*
He is completely changed, arrogant and a double-faced person. 
2) *he is irritating and annoying*
He doesn't understand what personal space is. He is curious about everything I do and keeps giving me unsolicited advice on why I should not talk to girls but to guys only. No matter what you say to him, he will remain stubborn.
3) *he is stubborn*
He keeps calling my name again and again, again and again even if I ignore him even when he knows I am ignoring him. If I show any reaction, he does something stupid. I mean, when I tell him to back off he doesn't listen. I don't know what's wrong with him.
4) *he doesn't know how to talk normally*
If not for anything, if he was a good listener or a good speaker, I would have no problem talking to him. But he is almost never serious and he is the type of person who can use anything against you what you say to him. 

I tried being friends with him to calm him down, but within some time, he just shows me why my decision was wrong and I have to go back to ignoring him. No matter how much I threaten him or try to beat him, he will continue to stay an asshole. I didn't really hit him yet but I do try to use the tip of a pen to give him pain and to make him back off. That's all I can do but its effect only stays for some time. I don't know why he does that but it's annoying. Help!",30Jul2018,0

I am living in a good area for history jobs, SE Virginia, but it is pretty clear now that I am over a year out of school that a job in this field is nearly impossible. I know someone with a master's degree and way more experience that can't find full time work in the field. 

For the last year I have been looking (not as hard as I should) for work in the field. The best hope I seem to have is part time, working weekends. I believe I will be offered this job soon.

Just for clarification I’m older and will be 19 in about a month. 

I met her my freshman year of high school and we shared most of our classes together. She introduced me to her friends and we became close. I didn’t start dating her till a little before her 18th birthday. So I’ve known her for about 4 years and we have dates for around 4 months. Long story short I proposed and she said yes. 

My parents turned justno and allowed my pervert estranged older brother to move in. A while later we moved out into a house of our own. It’s a long complicated and messed up story. 

But now I’m heading back to my last year of high school. She wears her engagement ring all the time. I wear mine as well and I’m a little nervous. I know I’m going to be the only guy in high school engaged. As well as the only one who lives in a rented home with his girlfriend. What I’m not prepared for are all the questions.

168,"Hey guys!! 

So I’m in Thailand for one month with my friends that I have known for 5 years on my course. We’re medical students on an elective here so we work in the same hospital, for the past two weeks the other 2 (3 of us inc. me in total) have been in another department and me in another. 

I’m quite an introverted person. I love doing stuff alone and just being alone. They know this. Everyone in my year at uni lives with each other and I’m one of the few that live alone. 

In the first week I followed them around seeing temple after temple and ticking off the usual Tripadvisor tourist destinations. Usually involves us going there taking a few pictures and leaving to the next attraction. I hate it. We came to our current city 5 days after landing in Bangkok and I finally got my own room and my own space. Freedom at last. The last few days were torture as they are SO useless at doing anything. I had to book all the taxis, sort all the SIM cards out, take them to places they wanted to go because none of them can use google maps, it felt like I was their carer. 

I was on Grindr in the area and a few guys told me to checkout this one bar and even the owner was online and was telling me to come. I told my friends to come along but they had told me in a taxi earlier they weren’t up for getting drunk and going out, but I asked them before I left anyway. I share my location with them in case I get kidnapped and off I go. 

I meet so many people there and as a result I’ve made two friends and been on a few “dates” with guys (I just spent the day with them and they showed me round places and we went to a few cafes). And at the hospital the doctor I’m with invited me and this other girl who’s not with our uni (but also on an elective) for dinner and I’m like sure. Oh and I should mention on the first day this doctor also invited me to lunch to which I accepted and the other two were keen to go home at midday so I just told them I’d meet them at home. 

Now that’s been the past few weeks. On Friday we were meant to go to another small town (Pai) for a few days but one of the group couldn’t come so it’s just me and the girl. When we get there we sit down in a cafe trying to figure out what to do. And it all starts. 

Apparently they have both found it so disrespectful and disgusting (actual words) that I have been going off on my own and leaving them on their ones. I have “snaked” them for other people. And they found it rude as we came together therefore we should do things together. 

That literally hit me like a tonne of bricks. I had no idea what to say. I can be feisty, but decided against it as I didn’t want to have a full blown argument in a small town with just me and her because that would create some serious tension I just didn’t want and we were there till today. 

I put my case forward but no response and she brings up the dinner I went to, the fact I’ve been spending time with other people, she was upset by the two friends I’ve made (“you’ve been hanging around with those girls”) and was just generally rude. They also found it disrespectful that on the first day I left them to go to lunch with the Doctor. I let the whole thing slide and said “I’m sorry you’re upset” and just left it at that. The rest of the trip she thought everything was okay between us but I have been so pissed off since. 

Since we came back today I have been thinking about this constantly, I’m constantly having arguments with her in my head, because I’m so paranoid about every action I take such as going to the corner store or doing my laundry cause she’ll say something. We have two more weeks left and I have no idea what to do. Shall I bring this up again? I don’t want to reopen old wounds but this is seriously annoying me, how can I best go about it? And am I actually in the wrong? Is it “disrespectful” that I have left them alone?",30Jul2018,1
170,"Hey guys, first time posting here. I'm a 20yo dude and about 5 years ago I met a girl online. She became my very first girlfriend ~6months later and we dated for about 4 months, ended it because I didn't have feelings for her to begin with and she stopped having feelings for me.

Fast forward to nowadays, the last 4 years have been full of depression, suicidal thoughts and overwhelming anxiety as I did develop feelings, but too late. She has been my best friend for these years as I promised myself if I can't get in a relationship with her, I might as well try and make her life as easy as possible by assisting anyway I could.

We were very close for these years, but as you can guess she slowly but surely made other friends, boyfriends and whatnot so we spent less and less time talking to eachother. I grew bitter and jealous, but she changed too. The kind, caring, sweet and intelligent girl I knew started acting careless, and It may sound like I'm asking for attention but believe me on that one, she changed.

About a month ago we got in an argument. I got extremely mad and quit talking to her, as I seemed to no longer enjoy her presence. This last month has been great on the psychological side. I'm no longer suicidal and in a much better mood overall (you can understand it kinda destroyed me everytime she told me she had a new boyfriend).

What's the problem then ? Well, as much as I hate to say it, I still miss her a lot and I'm thinking about re-establishing contact. I know i shouldn't, my friends tell me I shouldn't, but I want to. What do I do ? I don't want her out of my life, she started occupying every thought I have again.

We relate on alot of topics especially because we met in the hospital due to depression. We're alike in alot of ways, our sense of humor, we like make up, some of our music. But I'm really starting to realize how into herself she is. 

I think im a pretty laid back person so I can be quiet, so I find that the conversations are mostly her talking. Literally, *all* she talks about are dudes shes hooked up with, all the guys the right swipe/super like her on tinder, how lame her exes are, how many guys are in her dms. it can get overwhelming for me because she talks alot. i can no longer keep up with who she is dating anymore. I'm used to it but where I get upset is when I finally want to talk she does not listen, she just scrolls on her phone and gives me short answers and response, OR she'll redirect it to herself. Today we went to a baseball game which consisted of her taking selfies and showing me how easy it is for her to get matches on tinder. We had great seats and she barely looked up. Sometimes when we're out in public she doesn't pay attention to us hanging out, I catch her just serving looks(posing) lol. She's in her own world.

I know she means well, but sometimes i feel like she only knows how to show love through material things. like buying me food or the baseball game tickets (which i appreciate). Sometimes i think she does it so to keep me listening. she'll go on about her exboyfriends but the minute i talk about mine she shows no interest. I dont know if im overreacting, if I should say something? I don't mean to sound like a hater, I'm on tinder as well and I check out guys but thats the depth of our conversation... for hours.

176,"I’m not saying my age,.. 
My mom says a lot of mean things to me. For example , a while ago my school principle made a comment that a lot of doors will open for me because of my beauty, but I needed to focus on my grades( they were poor grades). He was trying to uplift me. My mom looked disappointed at what he said and when we got in the car she said “you are not that pretty. Pretty is a dime a dozen anyway” 

I told her that ppl have told me I could model and she said “you’re nothing special. You are not even tall enough” because I am 5’4.


She is just mean. She told me one day “you will get prettier when you’re older. I didn’t grow into my looks til later” ummmm so you don’t think I am now?

181,"Ok, so my partner and I (both late 20s) have moved in together about a year ago after we've been in a long-distance relationship (3 hrs ish) for also about a year. We would see each other almost every weekend and it was great, absolutely no jealousy and we both accepted the fact that there is no other option. Of course, if we could do it long distance, we could do it in the same city, so she moved to mine (major German city).

Long story short, we kind of can't. She started to get super jealous right after we received the keys. From one day to another, she was super clingy and all this makes it more difficult every day to ask for time and space for myself - which I need. 

I know that it's hard for her, moving to another city, not having the friends she used to have (that were super important to her), having to adjust to a new job (which she quit because they've been treating her badly, she starts her new one soon) and having to living with another person after having a huge apartment on her own. 

But I’m not sure if I can cut back anymore. We’ve been fighting a lot and every time we try to get our shits together It seems like it’s fine for here and she talks about getting married which I wanted to do as well, but now I’m not sure if I wanna be with her anymore.  

I think why I haven’t broken up with her yet is that I of course like her lots and I would like to give her the time to get accustomed to the new life on one hand, but one the other hand, I really like our apartment and it’s super hard to find anything close to that. I used to live together with an ex before here and after that relationship ended, I had to live in super shitty flat shares and I can’t do that anymore. 

I guess the advice I am asking for is: should I keep fighting for that relationship?

TL;DR: I live together with my partner and am not sure if it’s because I wanna be with here or because I don’t wanna live in shitty flat share.",30Jul2018,1

186,"I've been involved in a situation at work for quite some time. A guy got promoted but didn't want it and had to be spoken too by several members of the team to persuade him to take it. He's turned down the same offer in the past but this time decided to take it.  This guy has been relaxed and coasting since the promotion but the manager is happy with him, so my opinion doesnt matter there but I did use this a point in time to improve my standard, I suppose it was ego that needed me to improve.

This improvement was noticed by another manager and ever since then has been a form of mentor for me.  The guy is smart and has plenty of work and political experience. Basically someone I can learn from.  

Here's the issue. The other manager works in a department what is considered higher level work.  I currently work with standard level, so being placed in that team would be considered a jump of levels, not the norm.  Just the idea of this has caused resistance from many people. Your always going to find these people so I need to learn how to deal with these types. Examples are trying to coherce the other manager in dropping the idea and comments in my direction. 

My current manager hates the idea. Hes quite insecure. Always need to be centre of attention. When he makes a mistake he literally looks over his shoulder to see who took notice from other departments. Hes inconsistent in his decision making which is openly discussed by a few members when he's not there. He hates the idea because when it works it shows he's incapable of developing.

I have three reasons why I've stayed. The first being the opportunity. It will be a good move for my current and long term career. Im capable and would like to improve in all departments. Handling more complex projects would be a great challenge. I would continue that learning curve at home to aid my day work. Second, as this manager has shown faith I have loyalty to this peron. That's the type of guy I am. Third, I actually like what I do.

It's been going on for so long that right now I believe it's not a case of giving this guy, me, an opportunity so i can develop but now it's a case if it doesn't happen he will lose power.  Hope I'm wrong. The only scenario that works for him and me is a successful move or am I not seeing something that he could drop me after a while so he regains control.

The reason the promotion hasn't happened I used to take things personally when sideways hits but I've improved on that note because it something I've had to do. Mentor would agree but still room for improvement.

So that's the situation. The good news  so far is I do like my job, I've also  learnt alot from this other manager even more so than any other person but I ask myself and would like to ask this subreddit is this a normal situation? How will things play out? What advice can people give?",30Jul2018,1
187,"I live in a small building of graduate students at my university. This morning I found a bike in the trash area outside my building (where the dumpsters are. It's enclosed but not locked.) The bike is a nice, fully functional road bike, and it was unlocked. There's a gated area for locking up next to the trash area, and I've never seen this bike there in the year that I've lived here, so I'm almost certain that it doesn't belong to anyone in the building. 

I locked the bike to mine so it doesn't get taken away with the trash. What should I do with it? Normally I'd think something left in the trash area is abandoned. Is it stealing to keep it?

A few things to consider: my neighborhood has a bike theft issue, the trash area is sometimes occupied by people doing drugs/sleeping there, and people have attempted to steal bikes locked in the bike area before. So it's not really a place someone would leave a bike unlocked if they planned on coming back for it.",30Jul2018,3
189,"this is a throwaway because my friends know my other account name and I do NOT want them to know about this

I've always been pretty confused about my sexuality. It all started because when I was little I experimented with my neighbor. We were the same age and would play doctor and do weird things. Looking back I do not know how he learned those things because they were pretty weird for 7 or 8 year old to be doing. He was probably molested. I have no Idea though just my guess. I hope I'm not right. Also once I saw a shemale in porn and I thought they were hot. I immediately told myself no you're not gay. Time goes by and I wank it to gay porn and here and there maybe once a month. That is not a whole lot for me (I think I have a porn addiction). I do own a toy and enjoy stimulation down there. But, does that make you gay? Most of the time I would do it to straight porn, I have no idea why but I thought girls like Bailey Jay and all of those girls are super attractive. In my mind they are women, which they are, but in context of sexuality idk, but that's a whole different discussion.

This whole shit storm all started because one of my friends told me he thought I was gay. I could NOT let that get out. I was very fragile about my masculinity and still am. My friend group always messes with each other, and most of the time the comments are pretty harsh. I think my friend saying I was gay was especially hurtful to me because I didn't even know myself. He asks me ""when are you going to come out?"" almost everyday. Also saying ""we all know, so if you did come out you wouldn't be surprising anyone."" For some reason I took this as comfort. I think I wanted an answer as bad as he did. Drunkenly one night I told them I was bi. I thought I was. The same banter goes on for another year. I don't get many girls, so it looks like to my friends that obviously I'm gay. I end up gaining a lot of weight over all of this time because I stress eat.

One night we were all chatting and for some reason I said that I think trans women are just as much of a women as any other women. This was music to their ears. We were also having a weird conversation about different kinks and I said pegging. Again, this did not help my case. After them digging and digging and digging I finally said ""yeah I'm bi."" I just was so tired of feeling like I was hiding something. I don't think I was hiding something but when people tell you you're something so many times you start to believe it yourself. I don't know why but when I came out they said stuff like ""if you had to fuck one guy in the friend group who would it be and you have to answer."" I answered and they told him after they said they would not tell him. The thing is is that I'm not even remotely attracted to this guy, he's just my favorite guy in the group. Time goes on and I come out to all my friends and even my parents. Everyone was super supportive which I am so thankful for.

This is the end of the backstory. I end up signing up on Grindr to meet someone. I get a message from a guy saying he wants to give me a bj. I am pretty stoked. I end up driving to his place. The guy didn't really look like his picture and his apartment was a pretty small studio with outdated furniture. There were some cats there too. I walk in and he asks me how I'm doing, we chat for 5 min and we talk about how this is my first time doing something like this. I was extremely nervous. At that point I felt as though I was with one of my dad's friends and it was kinda weird. I take off my shirt and unbuckle my pants. I don't even undo the first button and I say ""sorry man, but I don't think I can do this."" He was super amazing about it and just said if you're not ready its ok. I ended up leaving and now I am here. I was not even remotely attracted to him. In the movies I used to watch the guys could honestly look exactly like him and it would do it for me. I'm so grossed out right now. The thought of that guy giving me a bj is really gross to me. It always has been. I think I tricked myself into thinking I liked dudes. I think about any guy and it grosses me out.

The thoughts that keep going over in my head over and over again is that I don't think I ever was attracted to guys. I only said I was bi to get my friends off of my back. How am I going to tell all my friends and my parents I'm not bi? I still think transgender women are beautiful so what does that mean? I'm so tired of having these thoughts go around and around my head. I just want to get some answers for myself and I was wondering if you guys could observe my story and give me your thoughts. All of the people I've talked to since now have been toxic for things like this and I've never really had a clear view of what is actually going on. This might seem silly to some of you. I honestly do not care if I am bi. I just don't know what I am! I like women, and women with penises. That's just women. The thing that is bothering the most is the fact that I will have to go and explain to everyone that I am not bi. All of my friends are going to be so confused. How do you un-comeout? I know the process of coming out is a very real thing in peoples lives that is life defining. I am not trying to take away from you guys. If you are one of those people PM me and I can talk to you about it if you need to talk to someone. I am just so upset right now because I know I told people something about me that might not be true because I wanted to jump the gun and get answers.

EDIT: I am still in the process and did cut out some of those toxic friends. I am also staying away from porn for awhile. It isn't good for me I don't think.",30Jul2018,1
191,"Just a quick note: Self centered does not equal selfish.

Have you ever encountered someone who is a conversational bulldozer, who loves center stage, always has a long winded story for every situation, and never stops filling dead air with just about anything to talk about? Well, that's me. And I don't like it. 

I think it might have something to do with the fact that I was raised an only child. There's obviously my anxiety about silence in general thrown in there. Plus, I'm a performer, a soloist, and a drama queen. 

But I need to stop these behaviors. Recently, there was a social situation where my spouse invited me along for emotional support. But instead of playing a support role, I took on the liberty of being the tank. I, on complete accident, made it all about me again. And this was a particularly fragile environment that was not specifically sculpted for me, but I took charge anyway. 

We talked about it when we got home, and I see all of the different places where I did or said the wrong thing, and how a group of people need silence to feel comfortable coming out of their shell. But with an active, most of the time one sided, conversation taking place, it caused my spouse, and more than likely the other attendants, to keep quiet more than they would have if I had just kept my own mouth shut. 

Please, I want to get better, but I don't know where to start. Googling ""How to stop being a bulldozer in conversations"" just pulled up results about how to *deal with other people bulldozing* instead of helping me learn how to stay on the side lines, instead of center stage. If anyone has any pointers, tips, or tricks, I would appreciate them greatly. I just want to keep myself from ruining social experience after social experience. 

P.S. Also, I suck at picking up on subtle hints, clues, and non direct suggestions. That would have helped this specific situation as well.

201,"I don't post often, so sorry for the kinda ranty nature of this. Post's also a bit long, so Tl;DR at the bottom.

So, a bit of context; as of now, I'm just about to begin my junior year of high school. I've always done fairly well academically, but throughout my life I've struggled with depression as social anxiety. A few years back (around 6th grade-ish) I entered my schools choir program, which really turned my life around. I gained a fair amount of self-respect, I felt a lot more comfortable in social situations, stuff like that. Singing became one of the few things in my life that I could really say I was good at. 

However, as the end of my high school years gets closer and closer, I'm starting to realize more and more that I have absolutely no fucking clue what to do. While singing makes me really happy, it's also (as far as I've gathered) a really unsafe career choice. Furthermore, the arts-y collages I've been keeping my eye on (aka. Oberlin and Vanderbilt) have tuition fees upwards of 60,000$, which I frankly can't afford. So, I'm trying to make a choice. Go for a potentially cheaper, much safer college/career, or go for a career that will make me happy, but can also land me in the 'starving artist' archetype. 

Sorry for the rant. Any advice is appreciated.

205,"I have known my roommate “best friend” for 3 years now, since being a freshman in College. Our junior year, she asked me to move in with her to her parents nice condo near our school for a great price. We have had great memories, and I have appreciated this offer for a long time. The issue we have been having has mostly to do with her mean and rude personality, she seems to be bossy, and too assertive, knowing that I am not the type of person who likes conformation or upsetting anybody. I feel very powerless when she starts to raise her voice at me. 

I share a bedroom with another friend and she has her own bedroom, our bedroom gets pretty hot and makes it hard to breath and sleep comfortably so we like putting the temperature at 68, even 69 F wasn’t the coolest option, but every morning we would wake up hot and sweaty and check the temp and see that she puts it at 72-73 F after this whole system of just putting it on the temp and doing this annoying back to back thing we started making a rule. She suggested it to be 70 during the day and 72 at night, I told her that 70 will be so hot to wake up to and told her 69 would be the best option. So the compromise was we will keep it at 71 throughout the night and when she wakes up for work she will put it at 69 throughout the day. No matter how hot I got I would never turn the ac down because I respected the rule and I didn’t want to upset her. But yesterday she did not change it, she broke the rule,  kept it at 70-73 throughout the day and I couldn’t take it so I put it down to 69 before it got to night time and it stayed that way. When I got up to change it, she yelled at me and was like “I can’t take it I’m cold and...” and basically just had a attitude. I explained to her that it’s not fair that me and my roommate follow the rules but she can just do whatever she wants, and she was like “I don’t care I’m cold” so I just didn’t want to make it bigger deal than it is so I just put it back.

207,"Hi Reddit. I have for a month or two or probably more....I don't know how much time has gone though. But I have been considering to message this old friend of mine who also bullied me. For quite a while his facebook has appeared offline and non existent, but out of the blue two weeks ago, his facebook appeared again, like it was never gone.

Some background story. I and my friend (Let's call him M) grew up together and went to the same school. At around third grade, we started seeing each other more, playing video games, and playing in our garden, along with my younger sister. (This is back in the late 90's early 00's. Both of us are born in the year 1990.) We almost saw each other every day, played in the school yard, often worked in groups when we were in school, and so. He was my best friend. Around the 6th grade, he started to bully me, which increased over the years. In the 7th grade our class was merged with another class from a different school in the same town. (We lived in the middle of nowhere in Denmark.) In the 8th grade, four more pupils came from a third school. The new pupils meant that they joined in on bullying me, making M popular among the new classmates. I told my teachers through years that he was bullying me. They said that they'd solve it, but nothing.....I do suspect it may have something to do with M's mom being a teacher at our school. The bullying left me with no to little trust in other people, making me having no friends and leaving me with suicidal thoughts.

After the 9th grade, I started what I probably think would be equal to an American high school. (Age 15-19 or so. The Danish high school usually takes 3 years to complete.) During the summer before I started, he messaged me over MSN, telling me that he also was going to the same high school as me. I changed my status on MSN, from something cheerful, to something depressive, soon after he asked me why I changed my status, and I replied with something like.....""Ah, it's nothing."" I had a huge fear that I would end up in a class with him, but when I started, he was no where to be found. He did start the year after, but he never did try to get in contact with me at that time, except for just one time. For once I went to one of the parties that was held at my high school, since it would be the last one I could attend before my graduation. I really never went to any parties that was held at the high school....Why should I, when I really had no friends? But for once, I thought.....Might aswell, last one afterall... So after a couple of drinks with some of my classmates, M comes over to me. I start to panic, heart racing, fear of what the fuck will happen now... M sits down, and actually starts talking....About old days and memories we shared. I don't remember his exact words or how he said it, but it was something like that he didn't know what he had done to me, but he was sorry for whatever it was. At that point, I couldn't forgive him, and the way he said it, made me kind of angry at him....How could he say sorry for bullying me through so many years, and act like he didn't know what he had done? This was in 2008 and was the last time I had anything to do with him...

So, let's go back to now, 2018, 10 years later. I am living in Copenhagen with my boyfriend for 2 years, studying English, maths and visual arts in order to teach these subjects to children from 1st to 6th grade. This has given me a lot of knowledge regarding children and given me an insight as to what happened back in my childhood. When M started to bully me, it was around the time his parents got a divorce and his mother was suffering from some kind of eating disorder. I remember visiting them one time in the summer, and she was outside getting a tan while wearing a bikini. I kind of feel bad for making the comparison, but she was skin and bones in a bikini. I've also been told, that at some point around or after high school, M started to do drugs for some time....But as far as I've been told, has been clean for a lot of years. (This is what I've been told, sometime ago. I am not entirely sure how true it is.) I don't know exactly what M is doing today, but it's probably either law or fishing.

I kind of want to get in touch with him again, and maybe become friends with him again.....But, I don't know how he'll react. I don't know if he hopes for something similiar, or he prefers to be left alone.

I don't know how to start a conversation up with him, and would kind of like some advice. I would also really love to hear from peopl who has been bullied and especially from people who has bullied others. Please help.

TL;DR: Best friend started to bully me. Now ten years after, I would like to get in touch with him.",30Jul2018,1
208,"I knew she didn't like me that way, I knew she only saw me as a really good, supportive friend. I'm the absolute moron that let myself get too attached and fall really hard for her within 3 years of being her good friend (I'm a 25M). I honestly grew to like her to a point that I can't even express it in words.

I just knew the way I was obsessing over our friendship and always being so nice, caring, loving, &amp; always there for her was not healthy for me at all. I was using the friendship as a way to escape and fool myself into seriously believing a woman could actually, potentially, like me that much back. But I knew all along I was deceiving myself. 

She was mostly nice when I just told her, and we agreed to lessen the frequency of contact and seeing each other (still attempting to be friends). However she did say two things that crushed me. One was that she said this is common for her, a decent amount of her male friends have fallen for her (which I already knew), but it just stung anyways - like as if what I was saying to her meant nothing - just another notch in her belt of guys liking her. 

The other thing she said, and I think I know it was just a joke because she was laughing but nonetheless, was that she should just become a lesbian to avoid this situation altogether. That.... that crushed me because it spoke volumes of what I learned about her through being her friend. The thought that she is totally fine with flirting with random handsome guys and being with them, but she finds me, who's been there for her unequivocally, so unappealing in a romantic/sexual sense.... It's a pain that's slowly killing me inside. I know me being ""nice &amp; good"" to her does not in any sense equate to her being attractive to me. I know that's a terrible way to think, that I deserve the ""reward"" for my loyalty. But nonetheless, that's what I felt, and its so painful having that demolished. 

I just want to not feel so shitty &amp; embarrassed with myself, and hopelessly affectionate, anymore. Any advice on how I can start moving on would be so helpful and so appreciated. Thank you so much.

209,"not really the typical question here and maybe there's another board for it but im trying it anyway. 

my usual style is generally extreme, on the gothy metal side. im just not buying a whole new outfit for this. will i get told to literally go home and come back if i put on an all black (nice imo?) shirt and all black skinnies and black feminine combat boots (flat/no heels)? everything on the net says dress pants, dress shirt, nice flats. those are the most casual things i have. well, i do have a black collared polo but its a work shirt and i think that would look so weird. how about my hair being a weird shade of pink split dyed with black? 
no, i don't really care if im chosen or not, i will go light on the makeup. basically i don't want to get caught up in total discrimination but i don't want to inconvenience myself more than this already is either. 
surely they deal with people with dyed hair and piercings without the ideal outfit regularly?

I should precise that it didn't seem that they even met irl. I know what I did was wrong. But I can't un learn what I did. My dad is a very loving and caring man. He's always been sweet with my mom.

215,"Just FWI I’m using mobile and I may have bad grammar since I’m doing this as fast as I can. Feel free to ask questions if there’s any holes or you think I was shallow and need more info on.


So my mom (F/39) has been dating a guy (M/29?) for a quite a few months. He’s a really cool guy, plays video games and talks a LOT (sometimes a good thing) but gives good advice. I (M/17) liked him, he seemed like a normal and cool guy. Well recently these past two months, my mom has been talking to around 4 guys and her boyfriend has been getting sad about it because he knows and is too afraid to confront her about since she’d probably yell at him and such and defend herself pretending that she isn’t or whatever. I don’t wanna get in her relationship fiascle but he KEEPS bringing me into it. He keeps asking me what guys come over when I’m here if he’s not here, what guys she talks about, where she’s going whenever she leaves, why she’s taking 5 extra minutes when she goes for a quick grocery run and so on. It’s sort of getting out of hand. But whenever my mom and me are alone she tells me he’s stalking her and low key follows her around town and that he’s tried to break into our house a few times via unscrewing one of the doors’ doorknob. She says he’s weird and that he constantly stalks her... I didn’t believe her though, I acted like I did but I didn’t. He just seems way too nice of a guy and whenever him and ME are alone, he says that he doesn’t stalk her and he never would. I was on his side cause he was, “sad she’s talking to other guys and wants a good relationship” blah blah blah you get the gist. I wanted her stop so he could be happy too so I was on his side and provided info as in where she went when she leaves or what guy came over when she invites them sometimes. I wanted to help a brother out.

So a few days ago my best bud stayed the night over at my place and I was in my room playing video games (Far Cry Primal for those wondering) and my friend told me he was going to bed and went downstairs to sleep on the couch. Around 10 minutes after he left my room he called me panicking. He said he caught my moms boyfriend trying to get behind the couch to hide. My friend said that my moms boyfriend said he was “just messing it’s all cool bro. Don’t tell Eli and his mom I was here” and left the house. Weird, but I saw it as innocent playing around. I told my friend to calm down, just stay in my little brothers room and sleep there (they weren’t home for the weekend.)
Fast forward to this morning at 6:30 AM to my mom telling me to get downstairs and use my flashlight and check behind the couch cause she saw the curtains move. In my head I KNEW he was behind there. So I go over and turn on my phones flashlight. I look over and I see his knee under the curtain behind the couch. I pretended I didn’t see him though because instead of mom screaming and being scared I waged her to think everything was alright, and once she left for work he’d come out and tell me what the fuck he was doing and why. I tell her I’m tired and I go upstairs to go to bed, but a minute later my mom is screaming my name over and over so I race and fall down the stairs and lo and behold, when I arrived at the first floor there he was. She checked behind the couch again and saw him so he got out from behind there and was looking at me all embarrassed and she was fuming. She told him to leave the house and told me to get her phone so she can call the cops. As I’m doing so my moms boyfriend calls me and he says “I’m going home, Bravo Texas Charlie,” and hangs up. I was confused but was pretty sure he meant he was going to hide outside and wait until she left for work. I hang up on him cause that’s fucking weird and I’m in a panicky state and I give my mom her phone. I haven’t told her about the incident with my friend, nor the phone call because... I don’t know what to do. I’m home alone right now and this morning a window in our living room was unlocked leaving me to believe he broke into our house that way. I’m pretty worried he’s going to break into the house again or while I’m still here and I don’t know what I’m going to do if he calls or asks me to let him in the house again since he thinks I’m on his side(which I’m not) but I have plans to go somewhere today.. any suggestions on what I should do? Please and thank you.",30Jul2018,2

The opportunity came up to apply for said role a few weeks ago however it was in a completely different location to me, over 4 hours away in a car to be exact. nevertheless, this was what i wanted, so i applied not thinking much of it, thinking that i'd at least be able to get experience from the interview to what i needed to prep for when i apply for real in a couple of years. To that end i got invited for an interview, and it went fantastic, i only had 2 days to prepare competencies which i was completely unprepared for so wasn't expecting much however it was a steep learning curve. 2 weeks went by and today i just had a phone call congratulating me on getting the job - Fantastic! Or is it? I'm really very happy with my Girlfriend and we recently discussed moving out together because she also had just landed a new job. However like i said this is where i'm currently located.

219,"Hi, so, the other day I visited my parents and in the street I met the son of my parents' neigbours who is like 10-15 years older than me and with whom I never had a relationship deeper than the ""Hi, how are you?"" ""Fine, thanks, you?"" ""Good. Bye""""Bye"".

The other day played as usual, with Hi, how are you,bye, nothing exceptional. But a couple of hours later I received a message on FB by him telling me that he wanted to share that he refers to himself as a She. (when I met her had male clothes and general looks, and also appers like that on her fb page..) 

I'm glad she felt comfortable to tell me this, but the truth is this is so random I don't know what to do with this info and I don't want to be rude...We never had any conversation before and for the last couple of days we've been writing small talk messages, about summer holidays,weather and work. 

Her answers are sometimes so out of character in comparison to the image of him I had in my head that feels like a hacker is trolling me through his account. But again, I've never talked so much to him/her before so who knows...

225,"I won’t make this long...about 3 weeks ago, I started texting this girl on Instagram, whom I had never met in my life, judging from her profile I thought she was really attractive. I knew she lived in my city, but again, I never met her. We started texting that night till about 2AM, I don’t do that often with girls, but the few times I have, I’ve ended up in some kind of relationship with them. The next morning, a Friday, I was getting ready for work, we had been texting a little bit that morning. She mentioned she had a meeting in the city around the same time work ended for me. She asked if I wanted to meet up after, which sorta took me by surprise but of course, I said sure. We met up, went to the park and had food. Now, I realized right then and there that I had a crush on this girl, but despite that, I felt completely normal and cool around her. After a couple hours of walking, I walked her to the train and that was that. After that I couldn’t stop saying her name To myself, let alone think about her. We started texting again for a couple days after that, just shooting the shit really, and I would kinda try to flirt in a playful way and I felt like she was going along with it too. We made plans to meet up a week after we last saw each other, so about 2 weeks ago, we went out for food and a movie. Dinner was great, I don’t even eat Indian food but I said, fuck it I’ll try it for her. We were looking into each other’s eyes and all that shit, laughing at each other’s jokes, just a good time. We went to the movies and it was a scary one, so towards the end I was able to move my hand sorta to where hers was, and she grabbed it, interlocked fingers and everything, in my head i was going nuts. The movie finished up around midnight so we walked to a nearby park and sat in an empty fountain and just talked about life till about 2am and held hands a little more, great night. The next morning, we were texting again. I was sitting at my desk at work and we were texting back and forth. I brought up a museum she was talking about the night and mentioned how we should go “as a date”. She said yes. I then thought to myself, I got this in the fucking bag. I check my phone 15 minutes later and I see a text from her saying, “I know I’m loveable, I wasn’t trying to lead you on, don’t get the wrong idea. A lot of guys get attached to me and I don’t want to get with every guy that thinks I’m pretty”. Dude I banged my head on my desk so hard that my boss came by asking if something fell from my shelf. At that point, I just replied to her, “I’m not trying to be friends”, and just left it at that. 

I’m still thinking about it a couple weeks after. It’s not often that I have big crushes, and just the thought of this girl made me giddy as hell. How can I just sorta try to get my mind at this. I want to go back and tell her that I don’t like her just because she’s pretty, it’s because she’s funny, creative, and she’s great and she’s sweet and she’s into movies just like me, and shit like that, and that I actually mean it.

226," So this is a challenge I have faced for a while now and I could really use some help dealing with it. Some background about me: I'm in my late 20s (M), I'd say I am average looking, physically fit, have had a decent amount of female attention in my life: dated 3 girls seriously and a couple more casually.

Since as far as I can remember, I was said to have had girl-like traits. When I was young, I brushed it off as a part of my brother's list of things he said to irritate me. In high school, good friends of mine would tease me as 'gay'. I was annoyed by it for sure, but I didn't really have a clue that it was based on the fact that I had effeminate traits. Also, I thought I had mostly masculine traits; I have never really questioned my sexuality as such.

Only about 3-4 months ago, a female friend of mine blurted out that she thought I was gay when she met me but heard that was actively dating and hence was convinced otherwise. That really shook me up. Worse, everything now added up: that I was teased as being gay was based on what they saw rather than random. A girl I work with said 'if I was a girl, I'd be really pretty'. I don't really have any feminine interests/hobbies, but it seems like this view is based purely on my body language.

I hate to admit it, but this bothers me. Even though I know I am strongly (and exclusively) attracted to women, being called 'effeminate' bothers me. I already have some self esteem issues and this knowledge doesn't really help the cause. I looked up this sub and it looks like most of the effeminate guys here are comfortable with it. How do I make sense of this? Especially when I have lived more than 25 years of my life without even realizing that I had these effeminate traits?

There were a few key events that have resulted in a good bit of change: I got an IUD, I started a CICO “diet”, and I started taking Wellbutrin in response to suspected weight loss difficulties. 


I’m not sure that the medication is to blame in its entirety, but I have had a lot of trouble sleeping at night due to moments that I can only describe as being terrified to my core. My heart starts to pound and I become extremely jumpy and uneasy. I’ll worry that there’s an intruder, that I’m going to die in my sleep — I’ll start to feel like I can’t breathe, or that some scary paranormal event will happen. In the moments I do fall asleep, I have nightmares where I feel like I’m paralyzed in bed. All of this makes me feel like I’m crazy. My boyfriend works overnight, so I am alone, which *does* contribute to me getting scared, but I’ve slept alone before and it’s never been an issue. More than that, I don’t consider myself to be easily upset, which, of course, puts more emphasis on how off I feel. I am perfectly okay during the day. 


Is it time to call the doctor? Would what’s happening be considered a panic attack? I’m not really sure how to handle it and I’m worried I’m putting too much on my boyfriend— he came home early last night after I texted that I was having a really hard time— instead of taking steps to fix the problem.

230,"So. In a week I'm 14. I currently weigh 75 kilograms, and I want to lose weight. I want to get to around 60-65 kilograms. The reasons that I weigh so much are: I tend to keep eating after I finished a meal, for example after lunch I'll grab a bag of chips and finish it, and if I get a snack I kind of, you know, most of the time pick something that's unhealthy. Another reason is that I have always been a sturdy kid, I just weighed more at birth, I guess some people call it ""chubby"".

 I do bike to school everyday, 16 kilometres in total, that includes going to school and going home. I also fenced for 8 years until 4 months ago, though I miss it and might want to start fencing again.

I told her I don’t do it for money and I’m not experienced enough, but she insisted I did great work and her clients would be overjoyed, so here I am.

I’m currently on a job and I can tell the client is not happy with the quality of my work.  She is inspecting every centimeter and pointing out minor flaws I can barely detect.  I could rip out all my work and start over and I still don’t think she’d be satisfied.  If it were my own client I could be frank with her and admit I’m just an amateur and charge her accordingly.

Anyway today I’m supposed to finish this job including fixing everything the client points out.  I have a feeling this could be a never-ending situation and frankly I’d rather drop off the face of the earth than slave any longer on this job.

How do I graciously tell the client “This is the best I can do?”

How do I go about charging my aquaintance for the work?  If she pays me by the hour as usual it will cost a fortune as I’ve toiled way too long trying to perfect this job, for an undesirable outcome.

For what it’s worth the quality of work on this job would have been more than adequate for anyone else I’ve ever done this for.",30Jul2018,1

234,"Sorry, it's a long one.
Bit of background first, I (21F student) run a community garden which is being redeveloped after neglect. We're in connection with a charity which employs a gardener/ manager to be on site on Fridays, with this consistency  volunteers come regularly.

Now recently, 2 fridays ago, a new volunteer (50+M) turned up, was a good worker and was very keen to help out. He'd boast of volunteering elsewhere and knowing lots of people in the community. 

On the following Monday, I visited alone to potter about, when I go to leave this Man (let's call him S) was at the locked gate (I have one of the only keys), clearing weeds and rubbish unpromted. I said hello to S and thanked him.    The next day he was waiting for me and so I was obliged to let him in and I instructed him to do a couple of odd jobs. S was very chatty but gave off a very weird vibe. I didn't go until that Friday when the volunteer session would be supervised by the gardener. 
 S hinted to another volunteer that he'd been 'helping' during the week by climbing over the fences and weeding. 
Then I went down this morning to pot up ready for winter veg to find destruction. Planting ripped up, pots emptied of plants (looks like misguided weeding, with no knowledge) but a new raised bed built and soil shifted, (continuing our work unsupervised). 

This must be the work of S which was more destructive than helpful. He is dillusional to think he's helping by breaking in and possibly has mental health issues..... Then I found THREE separate piles of human faeces! As well as some overalls and other clothes. 

I've notified the gardener but my main question is...

How can we deal with this man? 


TLDR: New garden volunteer creepy, starts breaking in and 'weeding' by ripping things up. This morning I found human shit in with my tomatoes. What do we do?

Me and my girlfriend live in an apartment in a 3000 population town in Texas. She just started going to school to be a nurse. I do a lot of side work construction for my dad, but we don't work well together.  I have dealt with addiction for years and have been a year and 3 months sober,  but through the time of my addiction,  I burnt many bridges in the small town, so I don't have much trust around here. I really want to better myself, right now I have a house that is paid for in this town, it is a fixer upper and has taken a lot of time and effort. I constantly feel depressed and unmotivated, I struggle throughout the day because I get all these feelings and don't know what to do,  I support my girlfriends nursing 100 percent, but like I said,  I really want to better myself too.  I grew up with an intense passion and hard driven personality, i wear my heart on my sleeve, I'm a very emotional guy, so it's hard for me to feel like a failure for not being able to meet the standards I keep setting for myself! And to be honest,  I don't even know what they are! I just know in my heart I want better for me and my kids, I don't make much money, we just get by. But with 2 kids,  a girlfriend currently in school who also works, I don't know what to do! I don't know where to begin,  I'm scared of being a laborer in this small town forever,  and doing just enough.  I don't know much about college or trade schools,  but id love to increase my value or do something with my life.  But if someone asked me what I like to do, I don't know.. i never have, I like to cook I guess, I like to create things, but that's all I know.

at the beginning of our relationship it was amazing, we were so in love and enjoyed each other’s company so much. but recently things have turned a little sour and i don’t feel like he appreciates me. 

i love him so much but it hurts me when he doesn’t say thank you for taking him to dinner, or picking him up from places so he doesn’t have to wait for the bus etc..., every time i bring this up he goes really defensive and says things like ‘well why am i not enough’, ‘sorry i’m not perfect’ and it makes me feel bad and it feels like we go deeper into the problem rather than it being solved. 

this is my first proper relationship, so i don’t know if i’ve spent 21 years idealising relationships on television and am now subconsciously unhappy with what i have or if feeling unappreciated is a genuine problem. 

if anyone has any idea of how i can try and get through to him i would be very thankful.

241,"Need advice!

I met a guy a year ago, and we have slowly built a meaningful friendship. We are both very rational, but I have grown romantic feelings for him and I believe he feels the same. 

**He recently mentioned he is going to move across the country, from LA to NH (where his family is from), and I was wondering how I can prevent this from happening.** I literally told him that I don't want him to leave- I need him here. His response was that he's open to possibilities and nothing is final yet.

**He is a couple years younger than me, but we are both in our early 30s. Here is some backstory:**

**1.** He came to LA for his high-school sweetheart, but they broke up a couple years ago and he never felt LA was home. **He was a pro skier who was on track for serious success, but got burned out a few years back and dropped out of it. Since then, he's had a ""hard re-entry"" into the ""real"" world.** I used to ski competitively, so I am also involved/aware with it still. 

**2.** **He is thinking moving back to NH will allow him to get back into skiing**\- he wants to mentor and write for magazines/online publications and create content for videos. He has all of those skills, but just doesnt feel he can do that in LA because of his lack of connections and distance from his main hubs. 

**3.** I don't believe in soulmates, but we are so similar, but so different in the right ways. **We bring out the best in each other** and can talk for hours on end. We have both hinted at something more serious, and I feel if we ever formally started a relationship, it would be with the goal of marriage. This is very important to both of us.

**4. He has a degree in business, but had trouble finding work.** He's currently working at a skate shop making a living wage, but it's still not significant with the high cost of living in LA. His dream is to be a writer and also mentor children - work with schools or churches to keep kids with rough backgrounds focused on their goals and give them the right support they need to do so. **He's a star human being**, but like all empaths, sometimes the world chews you up and spits you out. I am definitely more cold/aloof than he is... or resilient. 

**5.** **I am a paralegal and make almost 6 figures**, so money is not an issue for me. I'm not one of those types who ""keeps tallies"", and neither is he, but I recognize that we are at different stages of professional success in our lives.

**6.** **I offered to have him take an extra bedroom in my apartment**, but if we are seriously going to live together, I would rather it be on our own terms, and not due to extenuating circumstances. 

**7. I have a daughter who is 9**, but the child's father is remarried and involved. In fact, he and his wife handle much of the grunt-work. At this stage, I am more of a weekend parent because of the unpredictability with my work schedule. When my ex's career was first starting out when our daughter was born, I did the same for him- so he is happy to take more responsibility now because he understands it's best for our daughters future. I only mention this because it's not like I can just ""up and go"" anywhere. (The guy I am interested in from a blended family, so this is not terribly foreign for him)

**8.** He doesn't like the people in LA, but I think he just hasn't found the right groups yet. **I pleaded with him to consider staying in LA for 6 more months**, but to make some drastic changes towards his goals here. Then, if he feels the same, I can accept him leaving.

**9.** **He is a very motivated person who just ran into some brick walls**. Super smart, dedicated, future focused, healthy lifestyle, and usually pretty determined to better himself, so I am surprised to hear he's so beaten down lately. I want to offer him whatever support he needs, without creating too much dependancy. If he lives with me, I am on with footing the bill while he hones in on his goals, but It's very important that he maintains is independence and we both have some level of autonomy. We both value freedom and hate being dependent on others. 

**So that's the backstory in a nutshell**. Any advice appreciated, and **I guess the main question I have is ""How can I tell this person I want to have a future with them and support them without totally freaking us both out and rushing into something because of extenuating circumstances?""**

Thanks a bunch.

242,"I'll try and keep this brief. But it's a long story. 

* Husband's friend (who, is also my friend) starts dating a girl in 2014. Girl becomes one of my closest friends.
* Me and husband get engaged, and both girl and guy stand up in our wedding. 
* Guy and Girl get engaged shortly after that, we are also asked to stand up. 
* Guy and Girl find out they may be moving out of the country, move wedding up six months to accommodate this. 
* Shortly after they marry, unbeknownst to us guy and girl have problems - guy has an addiction (sexual) and is seeking help.Both are going to marriage counseling. (Note - we do not know everything) 
* In June, guy is thrown out of house by girl  and stays with us for two weeks. Girl takes guy back in after two weeks and they leave for vacation together. 
* Girl meanwhile is tracking guy on her phone - while living with us, she is asking us to check on him for certain things. Which, husband and I are uncomfortable with. 
* Things seem to be okay, but she decides she wants a full disclosure - meaning he has to tell her everything about his addiction as he has lied in the past and has done some things that are shady. 
* Guy agrees, but forgets (his words) a certain detail. She goes through his phone and finds said detail after full disclosure. 
* Girl asks for divorce. Packs her stuff - leaves for her hometown to figure out what she wants
* She texts me and husband the evening before asking us to check on him as she isn't in a place to communicate with him as she is worried about his mental health, again - not something I'm really okay with. Husband responds on behalf of both of us - telling her he spoke to him earlier, and he isn't doing well. They text back and forth
* I wait a day to gather my thoughts prior to texting her back. While I am texting girl, she tells me everything - is obvious a mess and is telling me she is going to speak to a lawyer and move in with a friend. I listen, and this news devastates me. 
* Meanwhile, I'm also texting him and the suicide hotline as I'm worried for his mental health.

247,"I'm 19 and have 26 years old brother. I told him of my goals of singing career, writing career or youtube career. He says I will never be either. To his defense, I have never really show any interest of either and I'm only talking about it. I'm lazy slob (no question here) but recently realized that I have to do something to pursue dreams and I've recently started to read which would help me to write well. I have never really had any passion so I decided to try either writing or music or maybe even acting and I'll see which I'll like the most.

Back to my brother. He says I will never sing, because I have no talent for it even tough I'm telling him that singing can be learned because literally everyone on the internet says that singing is learned and that talent isn't needed. But he insists that it's bullcrap and points at 5-year old singers in TV competitions who sing opera who definitely didn't have enough time and education to learn that. Even though he knows literally nothing about singing, he never showed any interest in it, never failed at school chore or anything. He has literally no credentials to tell me I will never able to sing.

When it comes to YouTube, he says that my content (I'd do mostly educational content, or educainment) would not be popular because people are mostly uninterested in this. When I point at Vsauce, he says that I'm not extroverted enough. Which is kinda true, but this varies. Among people I'm mostly quiet but sometimes, when I relax, I'm very open.

The writing thing? He says the same. No talent blah blah blah.

He completely ignores scientific facts that say that talent is overrated (book title btw) and importance of practice. He works as a programmer because he was luckily admitted to such high school and has bachelor degree from related field. He doesn't say anything but I'd guess that he choose computer-related high school field because he used to be big computer player who was even neglecting education at elementary school, so he even considered an alternative of attending a woodcraft school because of bad results. Again, when it comes to talent he believes that he has talent for programming and that most people can be programmers, as if his degree had no relevance whatsoever.

So now. Am I just blinded by my impossible dreams so much that I can't appreciate his help, or is he just an asshole?

To put it into perspective, he has never really been an ideal brother. When I was kid, was never very above beating me or yelling at me when I did a mistake, instead of explaining to me that I did a mistake, because I was a kid and didn't know I did a mistake. This mostly dissipated but he still can find some time to treat me like shit, when he needs to refresh his bad mood, like clean my dishes (yes I'm a bit spoiled, but that's more up to my parents), while threatening me and obviously not giving a damn about the dishes because he doesn't cleaning it very often either and just wants to refresh and/or feel superior. He was never very protective of me when I was bullied for example and the best thing he ever did to sometimes help me, he just told me that I should do something to the bully, not giving a shit about it or something like that, but he obviously didn't really care that I'm psychologically unable to help myself with it and that no-one could help me. He has amazing ability to put blame on me when there is some mild miscommunication in family where I possibly have some blame but not all of it. Such when I don't call anyone to ask what I should do, when the other one can call too or vice versa. This petty misscommunications (There are better examples but can't exactly recall one). I'll come back little bit to the talent part. My big inspiration for not giving up dream is Lindsey Stirling. If you don't know her, she is a violinist who plays violin and also dances at the same time. My brother considers her overrated. She's inspiring because when she competed in America's Got Talent, judges told her that when she both plays and dances at the same time, she sounds like bunch of rats being strangled and that she won't succeed with this. She however didn't give her dream up and now she has youtube channel with over 10M subscribers (twice as much as America's Got Talent), sells out venues all over the world and she indeed plays and at the same time dances like crazy and it sounds almost perfect, as if she was barely moving. Still into this day she has lot of fans she loves to teach that no-one should let anyone but him/herself to defy him/her. When I told my brother about this, he disregarded it and said that she is talented (strong word for him, since he believed she is overrated and now all of a sudden she's talented. Sounds alibistic to me). Quite strange, since 5-year old singer can sing beautifully from birth or whatever but 23-year old violinist/dancer can sound terribly yet after a lot of practice she sounds almost flawlessly. In this case I don't get what's the purpose of the talent. Pure alibism.

So what, do I oversee his goodness and my ignorance of my inabilities and arrogance, or is he genuine asshole?",30Jul2018,1
248,"So, a few days ago my brother and I were home alone for about 24 hours and we were meant to make sure the dogs got fed.

In the morning, we had a family conversation and my parents decided that video games were the problem, for no reason whatsoever, and they decided my brother and I were only allowed to play during a short window at night, 8pm-12am. This was really frustrating to me, because I didn't see an issue with how things were before. I'm 15, working a part time job, and a lot of my free time was spent playing video games. I was angry because I don't like my main hobby being restricted to one small time at night, because it  makes it feel like it's an unhealthy habit I should break, rather than a healthy way to interact with peers who aren't always on in that window of time. It also makes me feel like I'm losing even the right to choose what I want to enjoy. I can't even enjoy my time playing when I know I have to get off at an exact micromanaged time.

249,"Hey guys looking for some financial/car/life advice here. 

For the past 15 months I've been leasing a 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback LX trim. At the time of signing I really needed a car and buying one want the best option. I have a 3 year 36,000 mile lease (12,000 mi/yr). I currently stand at 19,500 miles. Obviously this is a problem as at most I should have 15,000 miles by now. Now while yes, I do understand that typically some months I could do less and eventually even out, this is not the case. Less than 1 year after leasing the car I finished college and got a job where my commute is 80 miles round trip 5 days a week. Doing the math that's 400/week, 1,600/month MINIMUM. Crunching more numbers I stand to hit 36,000 sometime around June 2019 likely sooner as I drive to more than just work. My lease ends April 2020. Big issue. At $0.15/mile over 36,000 miles, I would pay **at least** $2500-3000 at turn in. These numbers are solely me driving to work and back nothing more. It's just not feasible, nor does it make sense to me to keep driving the car, as much as I love it.

So, I have considered a few options:

1) My father does have a spare car (total sh\*\*box, everything in the car has broken at least once) for me to borrow. The issue is that for me to save enough miles I'd do basically a year of the lease not even driving the car. I'd prefer not to pay for a car I wouldn't even be driving. May as well pay the over-mileage at that point.

2) Buy a P.O.S. beater car. This still puts me in the paying for a car I'm not using position, However I want my next car to be manual (WRX STI) so this would give me a good chance to learn and practice. To be a good option said car would have to be less than $2500-3000 I'd spend in over-mileage.

3) Try to get out of the lease early. Honestly, feels like my best option however, most dealers wont take my lease unless they value it above the payoff amount creating positive equity, or at the very lease it breaks even (e.g. Payoff- 17,000, their value- 17,000). In this case I'd either walk away from the car nothing owed and get into a new one or, come out with some spare cash to put towards my new car.

4) Carpool to work. Would be a great option however, I don't know anyone at my job who lives close to me AND works the same schedule (each of our contracts here require different working hours, as well I like to go to the gym after work too). Plus, this puts me back at not using the car as much and still paying for it.

If anyone would like to weigh in on one of these options or even provide another one I am not seeing it would be greatly appreciated. Looking back I wish I had just bought a car and suffered through making higher payments until I got this job, but obviously this job wasn't known about back then so here we are.

I’m stuck in a vicious cycle: no motivation = not working productively = not making money = struggling to pay off loans = anxiety /stress sets in = even less motivation = doing less work, and repeat. 

Last year I lost my mentor to illness, and I never quite found another like her and it's really thrown me off, as she pushed me and inspired me to be better. Nowadays, I struggle to focus on one project and constantly shift gears on what I’m working on (right now I’m balancing SIX of them just hoping one will ‘pay off’). I also have the constant desire to move - in 2018 I’ve spent countless hours researching the logistics of moving to Canada, Luxembourg, Japan, Spain, Sweden, and the USA. 

To make it better, I’m in loads of financial debt right now (somewhere over the 20K mark - not including all of the money borrowed from my in laws). This is beginning to weigh down on me so heavily that I’ve started grinding my teeth in my sleep, fuck! Because I work and live with my best friend and my spouse, I have noticed over time that when I have work + money concerns, they both start freaking out about the future and it sends everyone in a downward spiral together, so I’ve decided it’s best not to constantly vent to either of them. No parents to confide in either, alas that’s why I’m here.

252,"Our neighbors are assholes. We bought our house 4 years ago, and started having trouble from the beginning. They harass our dogs, then call the cops when they bark. We took care of the barking situation (we keep our barking dog inside while we’re gone). In the last couple years they’ve thrown fireworks over the fence as well as brownies (luckily I got to them before my dogs did). 

The tipping point was when our neighbor came over yesterday to cuss out my husband. We were having a bbq with our family and she just stormed over calling him an asshole. It took us a second to realize she was even directing her cussing toward us because we hadn’t done anything. She started accusing him of going into their yard and cutting the vines on the fence. She would not shut up long enough to let us talk it out. We asked her to stop cussing in front of the kids, which made her cuss when more. She eventually left and went back inside her house. 

Here’s the real story: All we have separating our back yard from theirs is a chain link fence no taller than 5 feet. There are vines growing wild on the fence and into our yard. Our sprinklers stopped working, and the vines were covering one of them, so my husband cut some of the vines in OUR backyard so he could find and fix our sprinkler. 


The roots are on OUR side of the fence. They cause a huge mess and the grapes that grow on them are poisonous to dogs. We have a legal right to cut down ALL the vines, which we plan on doing this week. I’ve had anxiety over this since it happened because I have a feeling they’re going to retaliate in some way, and we don’t have security cameras yet. 

Our next step is to put up a new fence so we have some privacy and peace of mind, but with my husband healing from surgery, it may not get done this year. 

I just need some advice on how to handle this type of situation. We’ve never had neighbors act like this. They never just come talk to us politely if there’s an “issue”. In my opinion, we’re good neighbors. We’re never noisy, we keep the house clean, we’ve taken care of the dog barking when we were asked (not by them but by animal control), and we generally just keep to ourselves. I’m so confused as to why they hate us so much.

so, we hung out. the studying was just an excuse for hanging out really, we only studied for like 10 minutes and then we hung out, grabbed a coffee and smoked (her ideas) we then parted ways and she said it was up to me to hang out again next time since she had asked me the first time

now that was a month ago. i asked her a few times but kept getting the ""im busy"" thing so i decided to give up and stopped asking. a few weeks went by and out of the blue she texts me asking when were gonna hang out so we finally set a day were both free and then on the morning of, she cant hang out, but shes sorry about being flighty and wanted to know if i could hang out the next day

which i couldnt, and now cant for like another week, due to work and school.

258,"Hello guys, I have thought about posting this for awhile now and I finally decided I should. 


I’ve had this regret/problem since I have stepped away from sending pictures of myself. When I was 13-15 maybe, I had this life online I guess you could call it, I wasn’t popular by any means but I would use Kik. I would use it to meet new people and just talk but some or most of them turned sexual. We would exchange pictures and videos. Some would have my face in them some would not. The thing is I do not remember how many I have sent of myself or who exactly has them. It was a bunch of random people. I regret everything so bad and I wish I can take it all back. I completely stopped doing this and I have a problem with sending nudes now. I would like to have a relationship with this person before things turn in that direction. 

I feel so ashamed and embarrassed, I hope that no one sees them or they aren’t somewhere on the internet but truly I know that’s a lie. Luckily I haven’t seen any thing of mine, but it just haunts me. I feel like no one will ever date me or marry me because of the huge mistakes I have made in my life.

I feel like I need to tell them (guys) before we start to be more than just friends? Is there any way I can know for a fact if there are any pictures of me?  Should I talk to my family about this? What honestly could I do about this problem? Any advice would be appreciated greatly. Thank you.

I recently graduated from penn state with an IT degree. When i went to college i did not know what i wanted to do and long story short i somehow fell into IT. well, i have zero passion for IT. I find myself applying for jobs I dont want, and when i get a phone call about the job i just ignore it. 
Are there jobs out there that are not in the IT field but still require a college education?
Are there jobs in the IT industry where I wont have to sit behind a computer all day? (probably not)
Also, being the recent graduate i am, the only jobs that are giving my looks are help desk support. I find it very annoying/frustrating that i went to college for 4 years and everybody is telling me that i basically HAVE to start my IT career in a help desk support role.

Since the beginning of March 2018, there has been a rancid smell polluting the hallways of this office building. Long story short, we found out that this smell was coming from the basement of the building. The owner of the building is dating a woman who is making Bone Broth in a kitchen downstairs. She simmers the bone broth for 24 hours during the weekend and through Monday to Friday business hours. She then sells this Bone Broth to people as a diet plan or something.

The smell of the bone broth lingers for days and it is honestly unbearable. The smell has yet to seep its way onto our floor, but walking into the building through the hallways is next to impossible. We have to plug our noses or hold our breath to make it to our floor, and somebody has come close to vomiting from the smell. We contacted the owner of the building and told him about the smell and how it was bothering our staff and clients. He made no effort to put a stop to his s/o making this horrendous soup.

I want to take it upon myself to resolve this issue. I was thinking of calling our local health unit to perform an inspection of her operations. I honestly don’t know if she has the right to do this just because she’s dating the owner of the building. Not too sure if she even has a business license.

&amp;nbsp;

For the longest time I have day dreamed about what I'd say to him if I ran into him.

271,"Backstory: My wife and I are in our late 20's and both work making almost the same amount of money. We live off 1 paycheck and have a great savings balance with no outstanding debt that we couldn't pay off immediately. I hired on at my company in 2015 because it was a great position that enabled me to go to school part time and do homework at work. The pay and benefits were great but in the end it was all to facilitate me finishing my Bachelor's degree. During school I planned to use my VA Disability and GI Bill Housing Stipend to pay for anything I need and my wife would take over the bills.

I made it no secret to my mangers and co workers that I would be quitting at a certain point to attend school full time because my degree requires classes that are only offered mid-day. My degree also requires that I do an summer internship. I've done great here, gotten promotions and raises almost every year for 3 years all while maintain a 4.0 in school. This job has been great to me and my family. For the last six months I pushed hard for a position in the afternoon that allowed me to go to school during the day but I always got the brush off. So I decided to move on with my options.

During a Spring career fair at my school I was offered a co-op position with a local company. Essentially a year round part time internship. I'd go to school MWF and work Tues/Thurs. They stated (in my contract) that I could work around my school schedule and work whatever hours I wanted. The pay was decent for an internship (18/hr). I'm not terribly concerned with the pay because I get VA disability and my GI Bill pays a housing stipend based on the number of hours I take. This was great because it gives me industry experience for the last two years of my degree and doesn't change my income level too terrible much. We coordinated a start date to coincide with the Fall semester that way I could keep making my current salary for as long as possible.

Now that I've put in my two weeks....and burned all my vacation time.....my manager's manager wants to offer me a position that would ""allow me to keep going to school full time"". It will likely come with a pay raise also which complicates matters for me.

I'm concerned that if I renege on this job offer it will hurt my reputation in the prospective industry.

TL:dr

Accepted a year round internship while I attend school full time. After submitting my two weeks my employer wants to open a new position in the afternoon to keep me. Do I stay and make more money while attending school or just move on to my internship and get industry related experience?",30Jul2018,3

277,"Hi all,

Sorry, this is long.

I have two brothers and we've always been pretty close. I have a lot of respect for them both and have always been supportive of their choices and helped out when I was asked or if they need it.  Our parents divorced after being married for 35 years and my dad basically went off the grid completely for three years. We didn't know where he was.  My mom was a mess for awhile after he left her so we've had quite a few years of stress and trying to re-build a relationship with our dad who isn't a good communicator and now has a new wife.

But the issue is with my older bother. I just feel a little lost. Obviously, I don't think it is my place but the women he has been dating for the past 15 years of his life have been a succession of one women after the next who have extreme levels of needs...unemployment, drug or alcohol addiction, married women, women with 4 or more children, etc.  He also goes back to the same woman multiple times and goes through multiple break up and make up cycles with them.  It seems my brother has an affliction for drama. He has a great job. Very active in sports still. He is a nice looking man that keeps himself in shape. It's a real head scratcher.

The last 6 months have been so full of drama that it has begun affected our family. He was in an on again/off again relationship with a women who had four kids with three different men.  We accepted his choice but also let him know it might be a difficult situation. He broke up with her a few times, went back, and when she found out he was dating someone else (who was married!) she ended up badly keying his car resulting in $9,000.00 worth of damage. It was the worst I have ever seen. Refused to take her to court or press charges. Again, that's on him. But she was stalking him, calling him 200 times a day, and then befriended this new person my brother was dating to cause issues. My brother swore he was in love with this last women who is married, has a successful business with her husband, and also four children. He claims she told him she was leaving her husband. Her husband found out and he hasn't heard from her in a month and won't return his calls or texts.

This was the first time that the drama was so overwhelming he had to go to therapy. I was happy he was seeing a therapist!!! But, alas, I have spoken to soon. He has now gotten back together with a girl who he sugar-daddied for three years, giving her a place to live and funding whatever lifestyle she had. She clearly has a thing for rich men (not that my brother is!) and is now in her 30s, still unemployed, and roped him back in.  But he's so embarrassed to be dating her, just like the last time, he stops all contact with us pretty much! He won't bring her around my parents, my partner and I or my brother and his girlfriend. So he ends up going into hiding as there are so few people around that respect her.

There are so many women in the world and yet it's just the same thing over and over again. And I worry about him. I know he's a grown man and he's going to do what he wants. But he's turning 40 in a few months and he's still at the same level he was 15 years ago. He just never moves forward. Is there anything I can do or advice I Can give him?

I’m taking biology honors next year in 9th grade, so naturally I got the bio textbook we’re gonna use. The textbook had one other owner before me (fairly recently), but otherwise was in pretty good condition. I flipped through the textbook, and it seemed that the previous owner left a couple loose leaf pages around the textbook, some with science notes.

These moments stung and hurt in the moment, yet months later I am still dwelling on them. I am probably feeling most sad about them because I think that these people are right about my character, but that cannot be true because I have such a strong support group of friends and people who positively reassure me (ex. people who were grateful for my help/guidance in college). So...how do I let this negative energy go once and for all? 

I am constantly trying to be a better person and be more mindful of what I say and do, but I am a human after all.

292,"So, in the past 4 years, I've been through a number of jobs. I've had at least one main job, for 9-12 months, then I just feel like the job isn't the right place for me, or to be more honest, I just get flat-out tired of the job and the bullshit that comes with it, and leave. I graduated college at 22 and let's just label any job before that as transitional. Something I was only meant to have for a while. 

After college, I immediately picked up a job in a factory for the summer, while I looked for other work. The job paid $13.50 and they had a rigorous time and attendance system and a stupid train right outside the work that always held cars up, so a lot of people that worked there couldn't get past the first 3 months. I, was proud, to make it past the 3 months, even if I was rushing through the building to be  there. I was the only one in my rather large hiring class to make it past the time and attendance system, most of the others, either couldn't keep up with attendance policy and got fired, or they left the job and went back to whatever they were doing. At any rate, after the 3 months I was offered a full time job and a pay raise with nice benefits, so I took it, but then the factory suddenly reached a stand-still so they had to temporarily lay me off and offered me unemployment. Unemployment checks weren't much so I nixed that idea. Plus, it just didn't feel like where Jesus wanted me, you know? I had to drive 30 minutes to get there and I worked in a freezer which left my nose running, etc. I didn't have many friends there and I was living with my mom and her boyfriend who urged me to move out constantly.

 I ended up leaving that job to work in my field, which frankly this new job was a bunch of bull shit. I made $12.00 an hr and also worked at  a fast food restaurant. I worked with children with behavioral problems that lived in a group home. My boss was, to put it lightly, was kind of crazy, along with my other co-worker. We tended to be the only three working there on that side of the building and my co-worker had mental health issues and was working there because he used to be in a group home himself. In a weird sense, I actually liked both of those people but I hated them at the same time. It seemed like they both had good hearts, and good intentions, but would do crazy stuff and clearly had their own problems. My co-worker really wanted my boss to like him so he would often almost try to set me up in a trap to rat me out-which sounds crazy and made up but is completely true- he (my coworker) was really sad though because she (my boss) kept acting demeaning towards him and putting him down, even though he was clearly trying his best. I think part of the problem is that we would have people sub in from the other side of the building. The people from the other side of the building were, in my opinion, more professional college kids, who were more attractive and there for better reasons, so it seemed my boss greatly favored these people than me and my coworker, who not necessarily unattractive, did kind of have a chip on his shoulder because he was from a more hazy background with mental health issues- that he was often somewhat vocal about. ( I literally saw him crying about it once to one of the other guys who only worked there part time) He really seemed to want to prove to her that he was a capable coworker and worthy of her respect. (She wouldn't want to put him in charge of anything and when he would inquire about being a supervisor--she'd be like you're just not there yet. blah blah blah.) To be honest, though I did kind of relate to this guy because it was obvious that she favored the people from the other side and as time went on it seemed to be just for superficial reasons-- the people from the other side were like the ""cool kids"" from high school and me and Derek (let's call him) were not. In hindsight, I probably should've been this guys best friend. Which I tried to do, but to no avail. If I would ever relent to him even the most menial frustrations with my job-- my boss, the lady, was a very super assertive lady who as mentioned before had a good heart but did like to get very bossy because that's what she felt was right. She'd yell at people to go home immediately and any bad thing she didn't like about you she'd say to your face and in front of everyone. YOU SEEM LIKE A DRUNK she yelled to someone one time. is just an example of how she was. She chain smoked like a villain, and not surprisingly, to me, at least, had an extremely passive and shy husband. She would bark orders to her own boss. Who would listen! Her boss, who was in charge of decorating the building came in with pillows and this lady shouted, NO THOSE WON'T WORK. and picked some of them up and chucked them in a closet. Her boss, a very sweet short lady, just let it happen. I really actually didn't hate this person though, but sometimes I would mention this craziness to my co-worker Derek, because like who wouldn't?! I literally made a comment on my first day, stating something I kid you not-- incredibly mild to Derek after he inquired, ""So.... how do you like it so far?"",  Me: ""Oh, well, I only work 32 hrs, I thought I worked 40, oh well."" ""Also, our boss, Bettey (name changed) seems kind of assertive."" Derek: ""Oh yeah, it's like that here."" I went into work the next morning and Derek had told Bettey that I complained about the work schedule and about her as a person saying something mean. Bettey approached me, ""IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WORK SCHEDULE CONTACT ME--NOT DEREK"" Literally, I didn't even say anything and I wasn't complaining to Derek-- I was just answering his question. Trying to get to know a guy that I saw as a possible future friend--but even still not saying much because I generally was just grateful for the job. Nope. Friendship, not happening. He continued to do this throughout the job where he would ask me questions and then try to rat me out to my boss. I think she did see through his antics but at the same time, wasn't taking kindly to me assuming I talked shit. So I hated all of this, and did I mention my other fast food job? Yep. I was an opener at my other job and talked to all my coworkers who were like 1 year younger than me for the most part-- but one of them became my roommate along with 2 other 19 year olds and a 26 year old. So I, a 22 year old, lived with a 21 year old, two 19 year olds and a 26 year old. They were mostly Hispanic but not from Mexico just of Hispanic decent-- and what did they want to do? Party. They drank every single night, had there college friends over often and were always partying. I felt a little awkward because I had just sort of left that stage of my life. I was 22 and some of their friends were 18, but eventually I just sort of joined them because honestly it feels so uncomfortable hiding in your room while people are partying right outside your door.  Also, I couldn't get proper sleep when I wanted to because they were so loud. So I got drunk with them every night, which was flat out wrong, but I did feel really uncomfortable hiding in my room and I wanted desperately to find an escape from my job. It was clear they thought I was somewhat lame because I don't really like rap and like you know those Marilyn Monroe gangster tee-shirts. My roommate had a huge framed Marilyn Monroe in his room. I tried to play for them like Vampire Weekend or something, which I was really into at the time, but they just made fun of me. This sort of had a negative impact on my other job, the drinking anyway, where Bettey would notice my obvious hang over. Turns out, using booze to solve your work problems only makes them worse. Anyway, I worked with this other lady from the other side, Barb, a born-again Christian with a past, who was also married to a pastor, that I didn't hate but didn't like that much either, that never let her kids read Harry Potter, ""because it was evil"" talked about Derek to me once stating, ""yeah, he's always trying to get the boss to like him so he tries to find anything to tell on other people about... that's why I don't talk to him."" I guess he had been trying to reach out to her a lot on her side of the building and she eventually told Bettey about that and Derek got in trouble. Signs were posted: When you work, YOU WORK ON YOUR SIDE OF THE BUILDING, NO WANDERING OVER TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE. Derek was crushed. I sort of hated Barb, the born-again Christian though, but I also felt for her at the same time. The reason I hated Barb, is because she herself was also very vapid and annoying. Why?  Because of this other dude, Bill. Bill had another job, but used to work in the group home and loved working there so much that he'd come back sometimes to pick up shifts on occasion, because like I said, on my side of the building (the building was split into two halves) the main full-time employees were just me and Derek and Bettey would encourage him , Bill,to pick up shifts. |""Please Bill we need you!"" Even offering incentives. The shitty part? Bill is a scumbag! A literal scumbag! He'd scream at the kids, get really demeaning and controlling and had all but a totally fucked up nature to him. Everything from him oozed shit weasel! I even saw him at my other fast food job with his fiancé and he was screaming at her in an equally messed up way. But all of this went to the way side. Why? Because he was hot. Bill was pretty hot and worked as a registered nurse. He was easily the shittiest person but Barb would open up her doors to Bill. Bill! Please come visit! She'd then gloat and glee about how great he was, when in reality he was pretty much locking these kids in there rooms when he worked there. To me, ""Oh Buzzkillingtinn, isn't Bill just great?"" NO! I thought! He locks kids in their rooms and threatens to not feed them! He's fucked up! She only liked him because he was hot. It was stupid. Look, Harry-Potter-hating 45-year-old born-again-Christian, Bill is shitty. At this time I felt really bad for Derek because he felt like shit because the obvious LITERAL signs were up everywhere demeaning him for even talking to Barb, when it was clear that Bill was 5x worse but Barb didn't give a fuck about that simply because Bill was hot. Who knows? If I tried to talk to Barb she'd probably put signs up about me too. Too bad, I wasn't a hot 28 year old, then I could've literally stabbed someone and everything would've been cool. Ok. Too much, but still! This job stunk like shit! I only continued to work there for a little while longer, before I put in my two weeks notice to work at a bar. I only finished about a week before leaving though, and never turned in my key to the building. I had been in contact with one of my friends whose parent was a lawyer because literally one of the kids was denied food once because of some stupid reason. Oh did I also mention Bettey would write on the whiteboard how to fudge our notes so that they would be accepted by the state. We had to write notes every day about what we did to the government and Bettey literally wrote on the whiteboard how to write our notes-instead of what actually happened. She would review them and change them herself, as well, before they were submitted to state. Honestly, I think her intentions were good like in her mind she thought, well this is what's best for them and state just doesn't understand. But in reality she had gotten out of control and was not treating these kids how ANYONE should be treated. She just did NOT understand the kids perspective and that she was being a total bitch. Not that I wasn't a shitbag myself. I needed the fucking money and that's the main reason I was there hoping the place would be more wholesome and something I liked. Ultimately, I did succumb to her dumb rules, and was a part of the problem myself. Eventually I realized the only real solution to any of this was to leave. So I worked at a much more sound, ethical place. A bar. I gave up on trying to pursue anything legally, because I was messed up myself, and I lost the key. In my mind, it was a mutual understanding between me and Bettey, I was fucked up and lost the key. You made up write these shitty non-true government statements. Neither of us were going after each other and me leaving was left at that. As for Derek, I hope he found some girlfriend or something and a better job and doesn't like Bettey and Bill ruin his life.

293,"Recently, it feels like I'm having trouble dealing with people; more specifically, friends who live far away.  I might say that I'm having MORE trouble, since I'm not sure these are necessarily brand new issues.  To be specific, my anger escalates pretty quickly when debating topics with them, and often times these debates are started because I'm playing the counterpoint in a discussion.  I don't know if I'm just being contrarian for its own sake, but it happens too often to be a coincidence.

For some background, I moved away to a new city a few years, and have kept in touch with a group of friends where I used to live.  I didn't know anyone here, and I guess I braced myself for the transition by preparing to be alone, mentally.  While we've still managed to maintain contact during this time, the distance certainly hasn't helped with the friendships.  And my acceptance to be in isolation has more than likely contributed to that as well.

Initially, it felt like they weren't too happy that I was leaving.  There was definitely [a bit of] peer pressure to abandon the new city/new life experiment and go back to how things were.  Maybe this lack of support played a role into the deterioration of the relationships, I'm not sure to be honest.  As it stands now, it does feel like I'm just someone who might be lost to the ether.  Life moves forward, I get that.

As much as I have been building walls this whole time, it's still important to me try to retain/repair these relationships, if possible.  I'm just not sure how to not immediately jump to contradict, or let anger dictate my next words/action.  I feel like I'm always trying to speak the truth [however harsh sometimes it may be], but I wonder if my version of the truth isn't necessarily someone else's.  I'm a prideful person, and this might be at the core of it.  I'm becoming more worried that a part of me is getting numb to always being in conflict, and is ready for more isolation.

So /r/Advice, I'm wondering what, if any, steps I can take to start correcting the escalation?  What are your experiences with conflict in friendships [especially long distance ones], and how you maintain those?

Thanks.",30Jul2018,0
294,"My ex girlfriend and I have been split for over a year. We've both dated other people and we both felt like we were in a place where we could be friends. She came over to my place under the premise of needing help with a job interview. I used to work at this place so she said she wanted my insight. I was happy to do this. She brought beer and I made dinner and we practiced as intended. We both got pretty drunk and she ended up staying over. She touched me and made sexual advances and I responded, which I do regret. We didn't have full blown sex but her hands did go in my pants. I never pressured her to do any of these things and they were actually initiated by her. We didn't even kiss. It was more just fondling . She texted me the next day said we shouldn't hang out and she told her girlfriend that I took advantage of her in a drunken state. I'm in complete disbelief and I feel like she's accusing me of sexually assaulting her. We both were intoxicated and this scares me, because these implications are very serious and I've never been accused of something like this in my life.

295,"29 yo Architect living in Tirana, AL (EU).

Sadly, lately I've come te the conclusion that it's near to impossible to make a good living in my country (no real perspective):
-no perspective in here and now real way to change it.
-real estate prices are astronomically high considering the salaries
-healthcare is basically inexistent (they literally let people die due to state hospitals not having equipment or pharmaceuticals)
-poverty is everywhere
-And since basically every politician is corrupted, nothing really works.
I am aware that utopias dont exist and these are issues that every country has, but not at this scale or proportions.

Anyhow, I worked for 6 years now and managed to make about 10k$ in private savings ( I know its not much, but considering my familly issues and financial problems we had, its not that bad).
Lately I started a very good job in an important construction company , in the hopes that my perspective would change, but still I cant stand this place ( I dont want to seem edgy but Im really fed up).

It would mean a lot to me any advice, or any clue where to start to apply for jobs/career/masters or anything in my in my field of work, abroad, so I could start with a little more perspective on life.

To give some background, I'm a high school junior. I have two best friends, one I'm dating (A) and the other is my roommate (B). I've been roommates with B for two years now, and I've been dating A for 1 and a half years now. They started fighting around the time I started dating A.

I love them both and spending time with either is always a treat. Inside jokes, deep talks late at night, genuine happiness. However, when they are in the same room, the atmosphere is always awkward and tense. This would be fine if we didn't all go to the same school, where I have to choose between them on a daily basis. ""Should I eat lunch with A or B? Should I walk home with B or A?""

When I choose one over the other, the other is hurt because neither have any other friends besides me so if I choose one, the other is alone.

Breaking up with A isn't an option for me. A makes me so happy, and I could not see myself breaking their heart just to appease B.

Distancing myself from B isn't an option either because they're my roommate, for one, and I still love being with them when it's only us.

306,"Title says it all.

I work for a small company (less than 200 hundred employees) in the IT Department. We're sort of a jack of all trades setup due to lack of numbers.

There are only two of us and our boss. My coworker, ""Tim"" is a pretty smart and talented IT guy. His knowledge, skill and experience far exceeds mine, and he seems to know the job fairly well. Where he falters however, is his work ethic, and it shows in our ticket reports.

Now, I'm not a stickler for numbers despite the fact that I meticulously document any serious issues that come my way. Tim on the other hand doesn't seem to be that way.

He started two weeks before I did, but my numbers are extraordinarily higher than his. He's always turning to me and asking ""Hey, have you reached out to [user] about their [thing] yet? I'm kinda busy at the moment.""

9 months into our employment at this company, and the scoreboard shows me ahead by an enormous amount.

Me: 1,139
Tim: 612

We're doing the exact same work. Give or take a few issues that are exclusive to tech. (I handle the Exchange Server stuff, while he does our phone system and laptops)

Now, if the numbers weren't so far apart it wouldn't be much of an issue. But frankly, I can't find any explanation as to why I'm kicking his ass so badly other than the obvious: I'm doing more work than he is.

He's the golden boy with the boss, and they seem to always have little impromptu meetings and discussions without me involved at all. Granted, they are closer in age. (Boss is 59, Tim is in his late 40's. I just turned 30)

Throughout our relationship we have always made a pretty consistent effort to be transparent with each other because we both agree that that is an especially important part of a romantic bond. 

My entire life I was raised Catholic and had been pretty involved with the church throughout my childhood. Recently, however, after much contemplation I realized that I am in fact an atheist. The problem lies in the fact that my girlfriend is not. I would normally have no problem expressing this to her, but her and her entire family are relatively religious. They are not the kind of people to shove Christianity down others’ throats, but they still place a lot of importance in their religious beliefs. 

My girlfriend has a lot of respect for her parents and what they have taught her about religion and when the inevitable conversations of future marriage plans come up between us, she always mentions that she wants to get married by way of a Christian ceremony and raise our children to follow her denomination of Christianity. I do not necessarily have a problem with this, but I feel like if I mention to her that I do not believe in God anymore, she will feel like an essential understanding between us will be missing and will want to break up with me. 

I feel morally obliged to tell her so that I do not have to keep anything from her, but at the same time I don’t think she necessarily NEEDS to know either.

319,"So, I met a totally awesome guy on okcupid and we started messaging on kik. He's a med student, so sometimes it would be a few days between replies, which is no big deal. We went on a date, had awesome sex, and talked about the fact that he's planning on getting a hotel room near me for a few weeks since he has to attend a seminar in my area (he lives in the main city, I'm in a suburb). Anyways, it took a few days after the date to message me back because he was super busy, but now it's been over a week since he's said anything. I know his phone has been giving him problems, so do I send an email to each of the two possible schools he could be at with his name and picture, basically saying that we had a ton of fun, he seemed really into me, and I know he's been having phone problems, so if you could pass along my email address, that would be great. 

If he's decided he's not interested, that's fine and I won't go crazy stalker or anything, but because of his spotty replies in the past, I really can't tell if he's ghosting me or something came up. If he's not interested, I'd really like him to delete my nudes (I was an idiot), and just basically say that he decided he doesn't want to go out again. What should I do? ",30Jul2018,2

324,"I need advice involving my dog, Tigger.

I'll try to not make this too long, but basically I had to move in with my parents for financial reasons and my brother agreed to watch my dog for me because my parents already have two dogs and my dog would most likely clash with one of them. Also, he has severe separation anxiety so he tends to tear things up. (He was abused as a puppy). I just spent all my savings on putting him through a two week training class(which he is still currently in), but basically my brother doesn't want to watch him anymore. I'm completely at a loss for what to do. Everybody in my family has dogs and even though he's going through training there's still a good chance he may be weird with other dogs in a home environment. (He's fine at the vet, dog parks, he's even doing fantastic at the training place right now) I don't want to give up my dog. I love him way too much. He's gotten me through a lot of tough times and helps me with my anxiety and depression, but I don't know what to do. I'm broke right now until my next paycheck and I can start saving again, but I don't make that much so it'll take some time. I've looked up animal shelters around me to see if they could possibly hold him for me while I obviously pay for his food and vet care and go see him on the weekends.

We've been great friends for just as long, and then we dated for a year and I got really walled-off because the status change made me worried of stepping out of line with her. So the relationship died and she called it off because we wanted to go back to friends. But I'm pretty sure I can't. I've even tried asking others out but only because they remind me of her. Biggest problem is I'm pretty sure it's only me who's still affected by the whole thing. The way it ended left room to reunite. My biggest worry is someone else could fill the gap.

It doesn't help one of us is working through college and I'm just working at my job. On one hand, I tend to think maybe I need to use the worry to motivate myself to work toward the whole back-together thing, but on the other hand, I don't want to work toward something that could already be disappearing. I mean, it's not like I know if she's found someone else, and it's none of my business after a year and a half. And we're still friends. I really just want to know how to deal with the uncertainty.

329,"When I was 15, a friend and I went trick-or-treating on Halloween. We thought it was our last chance to get free candy before we were too old.

While we were out, these two older teens asked us if we were on something. I tried to play it cool with them and just shrugged them off like nah we aren’t, but they followed us.

I told my friend we needed to go back to my house ASAP because these dudes were acting weird. Then I saw this house had their porch light on, and I thought we could ask for help if they answered. Nobody did.

At this point I told him we needed to go home. He agreed. We walked towards my house. I turned around to check our tail, but all I saw was a fist in my face.

It was like a slow motion horror movie. I was so surprised by the punch, and seeing my tooth fly out of my mouth. I ran away; Leaving my friend behind, thinking he had ran with me. 

I banged on my door, blood pouring out my mouth, and my friend came not too long after thankfully. After that my parents called the police and I went to the ER for a medical evaluation. I seemed to be fine, except for my missing tooth we couldn’t find, but obviously I was really shooken up.

I went back to school after taking a day off. I should mention I went to an ‘urban’ school, where white people were the minority. Never bothered me, but being around black males intimidated me much more than before in a sense that I couldn’t remember who attacked me.

It took a while to train myself to get over the obvious prejudice of being nervous around black males, and the trauma of going through it every day as people asked what happened to my tooth.

A lot of people comforted me, which was more than I expected. I never said it then, but I really appreciated that most people were kind and offered their help in anyway they could. I hated going to the police station trying to identify the attackers.

I couldn’t remember them at all, other than they were bigger than me and black. I never saw a therapist, which is probably stupid, but my parents didn’t make me and I felt comfortable dealing with it like I dealt with most trauma in my life: keeping it inside.

All I know is now that I’m a lot older, I look back at that night and wonder if I should’ve gotten help. I struggled for years after that with depression and anxiety. Even today I have a lot of problems trusting strangers and being what I call a normal person. I mainly feel numb and prefer to stay at home in my cave away from everybody. 

I never considered PTSD before because I belittled my trauma, told myself it wasn’t that bad I could have been killed or shot. However, recently I started questioning if that was wrong of me. I don’t want to feel this way anymore: lethargic, unmotivated, unsociable, in general discomfort. I feel like something is holding me back and I have no control over it.

I’m making an appointment for a psychologist, but I thought sharing this story might help.

TL;DR: Got jumped, lost my tooth, and now I still deal with the trauma. Keep to myself and have difficulty bonding with people.",30Jul2018,1
330,"My spouse and I's anniversary was last night, and we went to a concert to celebrate. 

We decided to bring a fairly small ""special"" brownie. I took a very, very small amount. It wasn't my first rodeo with edibles so I felt okay. 

Out of nowhere I started to feel *awful*. Extreme cotton mouth, flat-out disoriented, and I was shaking/convulsing. My husband got security to help me out of the crowd, and we sat down. Once I was out of the crowd I felt a little better (I believe I was just too hot and claustrophobic along with the high), but felt very nauseous so I excused myself to the bathroom. 

I don't exactly know how long I was gone, probably about 7-10 minutes. I was puking my guts out. Suddenly there's banging, flashlights, and screaming outside my door. So, mid-puking, I crack it open to find my husband, three or four emt's/security people, and some random concerned people. All watching me puke my fucking guts out. 

I was and still am humiliated. Emt's checked me and confirmed that I was just sick from the brownie, that puking would probably help me feel better, and to just eat/drink lots of water. I am already back to (mostly) normal. 

But just...I feel petty but I am angry at my husband. I said, flat out, ""I'm gonna throw up. I'm okay but I'm gonna puke"". He could have knocked on his own to see what was up. Instead he humiliated me by causing a huge scene. Hell, the emt's laughed at me for all of the fuss over a brownie. I've lost what should be a really special day because I'll always associate it with being sick and humiliated. 

I tried voicing this to him and he just says ""well SORRY I called for help, sorry I was so worried, I still had a good night.""

I am not trying to push any blame on him. I ate the brownies, I did something stupid. I am more upset with how he handled it and how this has ruined a very special day and left me humiliated. 

Am I right to be upset? How to I get over it?

Tl;dr Ate some bad edibles on my anniversary, got sick, husband made a scene and I'm really upset.

336,"so, I'm going to try to keep this short...(I didn't, I'm sorry)

I met my best friend 3 years ago at the beginning of our first year of university. We had been joined at the hip ever since, so we decided it would be a great idea to live together for our 4th year of university. We signed a lease in April for a 2 bedroom apartment.

Fast forward to now, her parents are ""insisting"" she move out of the apartment and find someone else to take over her lease. The reason for this being that after a night out, I hit her in the back of the head with a glass bottle. I don't remember this happening because I was blackout. She had to get staples and I'm not sure how severe the cut is (she was driving a few hours later, didn't mention being concussed).

I know what I did wasn't not only a terrible thing to do but also illegal, I'm not making any excuses - it was a shit thing to do to someone whose supposed to be your best friend and I know I fucked up. 

I spent all of last week being really depressed over what happened, this week I feel as though I've made peace with the situation. I know I have a lot of things to work through as a person in order to become a better one.

So last week I sent an apology text to my friend which she appreciated and told me she was happy I reached out and that she knows had alcohol not been part of the equation, that I never would have hit her. She then added how her parents wanted her to find someone to take over the lease. I responded by saying I was sorry I wrecked everything and that if she too didn't want to live with me anymore (not just her parents) to tell me and that I would understand. I know that was a dumb thing to ask, like of course she doesn't want to live with me, but idk I just said it and didn't think very far ahead before doing so...

She hasn't responded yet, and I just logged on facebook to see that she has posted ads for the lease take over. So my question is...should I have been the one to offer to move out? Before answering, please consider: her and I have bonded over partying - drinking, drugs, everything (blackouts are common, getting fucked up was a big part of our friendship), the apartment was a bit over her budget and she stressed about it a lot, and lastly - there is a part of me that just doesn't care if she never speaks to me again over this. I know I fucked up, I know that drinking isn't an excuse for what I did and that this whole situation is literally on me, but for some reason I just want the apartment. In my gut I feel I should just let her sort this out. I know this may make the possibility of becoming friends again more unlikely; but sometimes I think ""is that so bad?""  We wouldn't drink together anymore because of what happened, and there was so much more to our friendship than partying, but I almost feel like its best if we both go our separate ways for good, at least for a while, because I really do think we had a toxic friendship. I also think that the fact that I feel this way at all shows that maybe I care more about having a friend that who the person is whose actually filling that role - and most of all it shows that my friend deserves a lot better out of a best friend.

The reasons why I'm apprehensive to just stay in the apartment is because I don't want to lose all my friends, but these are the same friends who I developed my drinking and drug problem around, the people I do it with, people I skip class with, people I fail classes with - I just feel like if I take this apartment, I can focus on me, and my friends can focus on themselves.",30Jul2018,3
338,"Throwaway account because I'm nervous someone in my family will see this and be mad at me. 

Background: I'm 22, been with my guy since sophomore year in high school (he's also 22), we're 1.5 years from being done with college. 

When I started college I got a dorm, and after that year his parents invited me to live with them in their house, that's where I've been living since. My parents were divorced when I was 3, didn't see my dad for a long time, then ended up seeing my dad twice a week from 12-18 years old. Never really cared for him, I can't get past the rude shit he did to my mom. I really only talk to him on the holidays and birthdays. My step dad is nice enough, but a typical grumpy guy who likes to fish and work and that's it. He likes me, I like him, he always includes me in family events but it was NEVER that ""dad-daughter bond."" 

Ever since I started living with my boyfriends family (dad, mom, him and his two brothers) I just CLICKED with his dad. He is the nicest, most intelligent, caring, thoughtful, funny, generous guy ever. (Besides my boyfriend ;) he took me to all the big state/summer fairs in my state (my family doesn't like them so I never really went to any) sooo many cool concerts like kiss, u2, Depeche Mode (people I've never listened to before but now I love!) we go on walks with the dogs down by the beach, he always gets me ice cream when we do, and remembers chocolate is my favorite!! he asks me to go out for dinner or to go out and just chat and get drinks. He genuinely cares when he asks me how schools going. Listen to this, I was actually about to put college on hold after my first year because I had to pay off my dorm bill before signing up for new classes...I told him briefly when we were out that I planned to get a second job so I could go back to school asap...and three days later he calls me down into the garage and tells me we're going down to my school to pay off that bill so I can sign up for classes. I told him I couldn't accept bc I didn't know when I could pay him back, and he insisted for 10 minutes about how much potential I have and so many thoughtful things. Im still in shock about that and it's been 2.5 years since. This man is the reason I'm almost done with college, he feeds me, buys me clothes, presents for Christmas and my birthday, calls me on the way home from work to see what I'm up to and what I want for dinner...everything that my dad/stepdad didn't really do. He goes around telling people I'm the daughter he never had. We CLICK. He's the dad I've ALWAYS wanted. He does those typical protective dad things that make my heart just so happy. I could write a book on how fatherly and kind he's been to me. 

My problem: I'm going to marry his son once we're done with college, and I want him to walk me down the aisle. It would mean a LOT to me, and it would mean a lot to him because he never had daughters. I know he would say yes in a heartbeat if I asked him. I ideally would like my dad and step dad at the wedding, I don't hate them, I just don't have any desire to have them walk me down. My dad is probably assuming he'll walk me down the aisle, he did for my older sister and she thinks the same of him as I do. And if he doesn't, I'm assuming my step dad will think he's next in line. And no offense to either but I just don't want that. I have many younger sisters, my real dad and step dad have other daughters they can walk down the aisle. 

How do I navigate this? Their feelings will be hurt to see me walk down the isle with my FIL, and that's not my intention. I just want to do what I feel makes me the happiest inside. Should I have a small destination wedding, where my dad/step dad isn't present so I could walk down the aisle with my FIL? Then have a reception at home and celebrate with them? Or should I say screw it and just do this locally even though it will probably make these two people upset. What would you do?? ",30Jul2018,8

I tried using condoms 100% but sometimes of course, it doesnt happen. The last person (call him X) i had sex with (2 month or so before i returned back home), we raw dogged it and spent a full week traveling together. Before coming back home, I was planning on having an STD test, but I got round to it too late, and the last appointment available would maybe make me miss my plane. I contacted the last person I had sex with and they told me they got checked up when they got back and was cleaned. I figured that would mean I was clean since I hadn't had any sex after them. I come back to my S/O, assuring them I was clean. However, they start feeling some burning sensation when they pees. I, worried, contact X again, asking them if they were SURE they was clean. Says yes. I asked for a picture of the test results, but they confess they hasn't actually done them but already booked an appointment to take test in two days. 

I don't know what to do. I feel horrible lying to my S/O. I'm in a position right now where I can't take a test result and I would do anything to take that last appointment or just have told my S/O right away that I didn't get the chance to take a test..

On top of that, I'm afraid that I'm never going to find someone. I've never been in a serious relationship and not many guys seem interested in me and the only guys that do only want to hook up with me.

350,"To give you guys some info I'm 24 and just got my first Manager position at a Wireless Store that sells verizon/att/tmobile. I've been a salesman for 2 years and the year before I worked at a liquor store, I quickly moved through salesmen ranks until I was the highest paid sales rep then moved to another company as manager, then out if no where all of a sudden.... I dont care. I really dont care about bettering myself, working hard, or coaching my employees. My lack of motivation has even leaked into my relationship and I have a very wonderful girlfriend, I care about her more than the world and I'm a very lucky guy. EVEN KNOWING ALL THAT I still cant find a reason to get out of bed, I smoke more weed than ever (still only after work), I've been trying to work out but it's very spotty, I used to be in great shape then I started eating bad and not exercising and alot of times I dont even have then energy to have sex or go out I just want to sleep and do nothing as soon as I get home. I'm now seeing that some friends of mine, are good friends, but bad influences....but it seems I cant get my priorities straight. Really, to sum all this up my buddy at my old job said it best he told me something along the lines of ""you get really good at something then once you're good enough to get by you give up"" and it really stuck with me because it's TRUE.

351,"   Before I start I should state that I’m a virgin and have never been in a relationship before. I also have anxiety, depression and get panic attacks. I’m going to college in the fall.
   
   I (M18) have been working at a local grocery store for about two months - it’s okay for my first job. After I completed my training I met one of my managers let’s call her Lucy (F18). Immediately I was attracted to her and after a few shifts working together - some flirting, teasing, joking, semi-sexual innuendo and banter between the two of us - we have become somewhat friends.

   One day when we were driving to a local subway to pick up lunch for us and a few co-workers she mentioned that her sister had a huge crush on me. I wasn’t too concerned so I said alright I already knew and moved on. Fast forward one day she and a guy came into work, I got jealous and decided to ask out her sister to watch fireworks - the date went fine.

   Later on immediately after a terrible second date me (I don’t have a license) Lucy her sister and this other guy (she was hooking up with) hung out for awhile, I couldn’t keep my eyes off her and she caught me staring a few times, I also openly flirted in front of my date. 

   The next day we (me, Lucy and her sister) hung out for awhile, we did some vaping, vandalism and drove around for awhile - I was way too honest with Lucy when she asked me some personal questions and lied about other things to make me seem better. 

   Anyway, after about another week the sister wants to be friends because she likes some other guy; which makes me feel relieved - Lucy seemed really happy when I asked her sister out so I felt I had to be in a relationship, also I was a bit crushed that she was so excited.

   I’ve been trying to fill up my schedule; gym, hanging out with friends, reading, meditation, and was thinking about MMA (I’m a somewhat skinny kid and If I and Lucy ever got together I’d want to be able to defend myself and her) and possibly some kind of musical instrument.

   Tldr; I really like this girl but she’s way out of my league and there’s not a chance she’d ever go out with me. How do I try and move on from her?

That time they were nice enough to leave a note, but I didn't care because headphones were so cheap. But these are freaking Beats headphones. Nothing I would ever buy for myself because they run like what? $100/$200?

353,"TLDR: Friend wants to move into apartment with fiance and I, a month ago I said maybe, but now I want to say no due to differences in lifestyles. I don't know if I'm being logical/rational, or if I'm just nitpicking reasons for her not to move in. Anxiety is making it hard and I don't wanna be a shitty person.

So I have this friend (well she looks up to me more so) and she has been having a difficult home life. She asked me to move into my apartment with my fiance and I. Everyone who knows me knows that I would ALWAYS help a friend out. HOWEVER, I feel like by letting her move in, it would shake everything in my life in a negative way.

I just feel like due to her age, there is a BIG maturity difference. That is one of the larger issues. She flips through tinder a lot, and is with a different guy almost every week (which isn't a problem as it's her life). I feel like this would impact my life because I'm not comfortable with having random guys in my apartment at random times due to previously being sexually assaulted, and to be frank, I don't want someone she doesn't even really know in my apartment. Who knows if they would steal, or do anything... 

She's also has issues with holding a job, as she changes jobs quite frequently, and I've seen her have problem with her bills. I don't want to be depending on her for rent, and then not have it paid, and be fucked over.

 I also have a dog, and she was kinda mean to her when she came to visit, which is a huge red flag to me as my dog in my eyes takes priority over my friend's wants/needs. Because I work, She'd be spending a lot of time with my dog, and I don't like that. It's like how can I trust someone who doesn't even have her shit together to take care of my fur baby?

  
The one time I had her over, she cranked her music every time she drove into the drive way, and she kept us up until 3 am waiting on her to come home (she didn't have a key). I would not want her coming in at 3 am if she were to live in my apartment, but I feel like I'd have little control over that. Also it would REALLY bug my neighbours, and would risk  me being kicked out.

Thing is, if she pays rent, she's a tenant, and I have little control, if she doesn't, she's a guest, and I have a tiny bit of control, but no rent, or help with utilities.... She's not respectful as a guest, so why would she be respectful as a tenant?  Being a tenant also  put her as an equal to my fiance and I , and gives us little control in the little home we've built.

Another big deal breaker is my fiance CANNOT and I mean CANNOT stand her. He thinks she's annoying, heedless, and disrespectful.

I thought about making rules in regards to visitors, loudness,  my dog,  the apartment, rent, cleanliness, etc. I think if I placed rules, it would feel less like  her place, and more like a boarding home, which might cause rifts in the friendship.  


I know these are all cons and I'm sounding really pessimistic, but my anxiety disorder causes me to fear the worst in every situation. Despite my anxiety, I tried to weigh the MAJOR pro's and cons  and here is what I have:  


Pro: She could help with rent, She could help around the house, She could provide transportation other than the bus, She could help with my pet, I would have someone in the house when my Fiance was at work. I'd be helping a friend.  


Cons: She's younger, Her perception on things are different, she's loud, she doesn't understand boundaries, she might cause a problem with my relationship, she's not very clean, she is in the promiscuous stage of life, I'd lose privacy, and she is flip-floppy with jobs.  


I just don't know what to do at this point, as I feel like saying no would be completely unsympathetic of me, but I really don't think it would be a wise move. Then again, I don't know if this is just my anxiety, or if I'm being reasonable in my thought process.   


If I say yes, so I implement rules, if so what? If I say no, how do I go about it without seeming like a bitch, or making it seem like I don't like her, because that's really not the case? When we go out, we have a good time,  but I just don't know how I'd manage having her as a resident in my home for an unbeknownst amount of time.",30Jul2018,21

356,"The title may sound dramatic, but it’s true. I’ll try to explain everything quickly. 

*Background:*
26. Currently working full time, and I’m in school at night full time. 

*Situation:*
3 years ago, I took a job that paid decently, was full time, and had great benefits. First year everything was ok. Then everything went to shit. 

I work in a small office of a major well-known company with 4-5 employees in it at any given time.  In the past two years, Ive had 5 different managers, and 4 cases of other employee turnover.  As far as regional upper management goes (my managers boss), we’ve had 3 different people in two years. I am the only original person left from when I started 3 years ago. 

Long story short, I’ve been screwed, ate up, bent over, and spit out. For a year and a half straight I was the only person tasked to do my job which involved dealing with a massive load of clients (150-200+ transactions a day). To put that into perspective, Offices equivalent to mine have 2-3 people doing the job at a given time. 

The manager turnover has really affected me as well. One quarter, we have a manager who does things one way, the next quarter, another manger who does things a different way. On top of that, the manager I have now is never in the office because she’s covering another managers office. 

Now I’m not the smartest guy is the world, but I feel like I could literally do everyone’s job (including upper management) better than they are doing, and I’m the lowest guy on the totem pole. It’s like everything they are doing is so ass-backwards, I wonder how they even got to their positions in the first place. 

I’ve often wondered if I’m the issue and not the job, but even my manager said she knows I’ve gotten completely screwed and she will do what she can to help, which seems like just all-talk because nothing has changed. Clients that come in all ask why am I the only one doing any work. I’ll have a line of people waiting to be dealt with and the 3 other people in my office will just be sitting around chatting. It drives me up a fucking wall. 

I’ve tried applying for different positions within the company (the pay and benefits are great, so it’s hard to give up), but found no success. 

Throughout all this stress, I’ve had a mental breakdown, seemingly developed IBS due to stress (that’s what my doctor says), and have been put on anti anxiety medication to use sparingly. They’ve hired a 20 hour part timer to help, but that person is in the office 3 days a week, so I’m still alone 2 days each week, and I get killed. 

Im sure being in school full time adds to my stress, but this job is 95-98% of it.  Im on summer vacation from school, and I still wake up every morning dreading the day and I sit in the parking lot saying “fuck this job” in my head for a good 15 seconds before I get out and go in.  I find myself talking about dreading Monday right when I get out at Friday at 5:00pm (my girlfriend noticed this, I didn’t even realize). 

I can’t do it anymore. 

I’ve applied to jobs, and have an interview coming up, but it’s gonna be hard to get off to go to the interview because I’ve taken off a lot recently because of my health problems that developed from the stress of this shitty ass fucking job. 

It feels like I’m stuck here. 

I guess I could just put my two weeks in and just quit, but I’m scared of being jobless, because I know finding a job isn’t certain. I have some money saved up (maybe 2-3 months worth of expenses?), and I could always just take an early distribution from my 401k when I quit, but then there goes all my retirement savings. I’m also not much of a quitter, and I’m pretty scared of the unknown. 

I just don’t know what to do. Has anybody else been in this situation? How did you handle it/what did you do? I’m at my wits end and haven’t been truly happy in forever.

359,"I'm not scared of him, and I am very open about personal things with him. I just can't bring myself to initiate conversations I need to have with him. 

For instance, I need to talk to him now about my driving lessons, but I just can't go out there and do it. Soon he is just going to go to bed and then I'll have to text him about it, and then he'll get annoyed because I texted him again. He also thinks I don't do these things because I'm lazy and I don't want to, he won't believe that I actually get worried about it. It's honestly a gamble talking to him, I've got 3 potential outcomes: 1. He'll be normal 2. He'll make me feel bad or guilty 3. He'll shut me down because he disagrees. I don't want to take the risk every time. 

He keeps making me feel bad by saying that he knows I stay in my room all the time because I don't like him or my sister, but in reality it's because I feel relaxed, happy and sane in there. I get socially exhausted even with family and I already share a bedroom with my sister, and I live in a small flat with no garden or anywhere private to go. I have 'friends' who I could meet with but we just aren't the same people with the same interests or humour. I feel so out of touch with them when we're together. I've got people at college who I get on much better with and who are more like me, but I'm still working on developing those friendships to the point that I'm part of their group.

361,"So a little bit of background,sorry if it’s long.

I live with my best friend in a two bed apartment. I went away with my girlfriend on a holiday to America and came back to see some of my stuff had been missing. we contacted my roommate who didn’t know where it was so we found out there was a party and phoned some of the people who were there. They got the idea that we thought we were accusing them of stealing. This didn’t go down so well with my roommate and his girlfriend and they were quite offended that we would think our/his friends would steal. We apologised and admitted we took the wrong course of action. After the argument, his girlfriend blocked her on every social media and wants nothing to do with her anymore. This resulted in my girlfriend being kicked out and having to sleep on her friends sofa.

Me and my girlfriend only have a 6 weeks left with each other, as her visa runs out meaning she’ll get deported from the country. She’s also pretty much homeless at the moment as she was going to move in with me, which has now changed. I told my roommate if she can stay over longer until she’s gone but he’s only allowing two days for her to come over in the flat. Me and my girlfriend have tried this for the past few weeks and it’s difficult as you can imagine. It’s put a strain on our relationship and I’m scared of even going in my own flat. 

I feel like I should stand my ground and have her over more. I told him that we’ll stay out of each other’s way so he feels more comfortable.

* We haven't put a label on what we're doing
* He's complimented me on my body/called me hot
* He also calls me funny, smart, considerate &amp; sweet
* He does also text alot of other girls, but I know some of them are his friends from high school
* The first time we met up, he brought me to his place. I met his older sister, and she cooked us dinner. He even let me wear his sweatpants b/c I was just saying that my jeans were uncomfortable
* He asks all the time to hang out
* Wants me to meet his baby cousin
* The first time we met up, he didn't go all the way with me, it was just foreplay and making out, even despite my attempts to go all the way (aka, telling him I wanna f\*ck)
* I've seen him flirt/be super nice to other girls/friends of his
* I've known him for 2 years....he had a girlfriend of 1 year from 2016-2017. During that time he hit me up for a number of months (just messaging), but was very friendly &amp; flirty...kind of a red flag
* We've both been single for 6+ months and things escalated to the point where we became more than friends

I lost my virginity to him. Which I don't regret. I was ready even if he wasn't the best person. And he was super kind to me. I later realized he was super manipulative and got me to cut off almost all my friends that were not mutual friends. Like, if I had to hang up the phone to go out somewhere, he would say ""wow you're going to hang up on the one person that wants to talk to you"".

When I broke up with him, he cried and threw things the whole day.

We had an incident that same day where I wouldn't necessarily call it sexual assault, but anyone I've told agrees that it was very fucked up. Lots of crying.

I've tried very hard to be friends because I have to spend a lot of time with him in this program. And while he was upset, he threatened to ruin both of our careers by calling one of the administrative people. He would barely give me the time of day, but that didn't stop me from being nice. I just talked to him a lot less (maybe once a month thru snapchat with a meme or something).

Now that I've broken up with the guy I've left him for, he's contacting me more. And I am uncomfortable. Back when I was trying to be friends, I hadn't realized how much he had fucked with my head.

However, I feel like I need to do constant damage control to keep him from ruining my future or making my life hell when the school year starts up.

Over July I have applied to several jobs. I was using a offiical website that that this Nationwide organisation uses to recruit into their jobs. I am currently employed by this organisation but want a career change so I am applying outside of this office, to other Trusts/sites in the city.. They sit underneath their own different Chief Executives.

I checked my email today (it is Monday) and realised that on Friday morning I was invited to interview (having to respond that very afternoon). The interviews were today. Even if I did see the email on Friday morning, I would not have been able to make arrangements in time for the Monday. I'm a bit gutted as it was a good job and career move for me.

I'm just wondering if it would be appropriate to respond to this invitation, apologising for the oversight?

I have also  been on the recuriting end of things in my current job and its not in our corporate culture to give applicants such little notice as we understand that they have to make arrangements and book time off etc. In the same situation, we also invited indiviuals to a interview, a few didn't respond but one applicant actually did get in touch and apologise as something important had come up that day. She had a strong application and if we didn't already recruit someone else into that role, we would have took it in good faith and would have invited her down on another date for an interview.

I don't know if this line of thought is common though or is contacting recruiters in this situation a no-no?",30Jul2018,1
368,"I'm 16 for the record. Please don't let that devalue my argument.

A few months ago I managed to convince my parents to let me get a snake - specifically a corn snake. They said I'd be able to get it around July - August (i.e. now)

About a month in my mum started trying to convince me to not get the snake and to let them buy me a PC as reward for my final exams. I was on the fence and suggested I'd probably go for the PC but was undecided.

It was my birthday a few days ago and I got a lot of money from my relatives, and so today I asked my parents if I could order the supplies, only to be met with ""no, I've changed my mind"".

This is after several months of me planning on the supplies, talking to breeders, making forum posts etc (even some on Reddit which you can see from my profile).

I tried asking why and my mum just started saying ""I don't want a snake in the house, I don't have to justify myself"". I tried to ask why and just got shouted at. My dad kind of sided with me but the *second* my mum resisted he switched sides and said ""you're obsessing over this, you don't really want one*.

I explained everything, and they said ""you're going to college soon you won't have time to look after it"". I pointed out that I'm living at home when I'm at college and the maintenance of the reptiles (I already have a gecko) won't be time consuming as I only have to feed it every week - fortnight depending on its size along with misting, which doesn't take any time.

When I debunked that, they basically started saying ""we don't have to have a reason"" which I agree with, except I've already been promised being able to get the damn snake.

I get that they're in charge but it's unfair for them to go back on such a huge promise and not only completely refuse to listen to my argument but to go as far as to make personal digs at me being ""ungrateful"" despite that I'm paying for the snake and it's maintenance myself.

But it all changed because of my parents, they are naturally very aggressive and negative ( even my dad has one of those tattoos that symbolize EVIL ). 

Growing with them made me more manly, but not in a good way, i have no feelings towards them, if they die, i would NOT cry.

388,"In case this is helpful in any way, I live in Duval County, Florida. 

There's a man who lives nearby and as far as I can tell, he doesn't live with anyone else except his two pit bulls. These two dogs fit every negative stereotype there is about the pit bull breed. They're vicious monsters who growl and bark at everything that moves, and they kill anything they can get near that's smaller or weaker than them. And for some reason, their owner lets them run wild. They're constantly coming onto my property and terrorizing me and my chickens, and I have to yell at and throw things at them to make them leave.

The previous owner warned me about the dogs when I was moving in, and told me that she was pretty sure the dogs had killed her cocker spaniel. I went over to the man's house to warn him that there would be trouble if his dogs were on my land, but he brushed me off.

I was trying to avoid doing anything drastic, like calling the sheriff's office or hurting them, so I've just been yelling and throwing things until now. But a week ago, I found two of my chickens dead in my yard, covered in blood and bite marks with their feathers all over the place. I looked around some more and found one of the dogs chasing one of the chickens. I screamed at the dog, and it ran away. I inspected my chicken and there were no bite marks, so I led her back to the coop.

I called the sheriff and they sent a deputy. I told them about how there were aggressive dogs and they killed two of my chickens and were constantly on my land. He asked if I had seen, with my own eyes, a dog kill one of my chickens. I said no, but I saw them chasing them around the yard. He said that's not enough for them to do anything. I showed him the dead chickens and he said that he couldn't do anything because a fox or something could have done it, since I didn't actually witness them killing the chickens.

Yesterday, I found another dead chicken. I called the sheriff and the deputy just said the same thing. I want something to be done about these mutts killing my chickens without standing by and watching them rip apart one of my hens just so I can get enough proof for these people to do something. Do I have any options? Hopefully ones that don't involve me shooting a dog?

396,"I'm 19 years old. I've never lost anyone close to me in my life. 

In about November, we got the news that my Nanny (grandma) had lung cancer. I'm not sure what stage, or any other information other than that. I've had a history of ""mental distress"" and theyve tried letting me down lightly for a lot of the news. 

I work 30-40 hours a week as an assisstant manager of a fast food restaurant, and am a student. As a result, from November-May I didn't get to visit her often. My family kept planning visits while I was working, no matter how many times i asked them to coordinate with me so I could come for the last few family BBQs and such. Other times, I was too tired. I convinced myself there'd be more time. 

I didn't realize how sick she was getting. On Saturday, she was begging me, my father, and my granddad to stop the pain. On Sunday she only managed to say one phrase to me and my sisters that I'll never forget,""You three take care of each other. I'll see you in heaven. I'll be thinking of you every day."" 

I used to go over at least once per week to help them with their household chores. I'd weed and water their garden, design it, plant the flowers, lay the mulch. I'd organize their spice cupboard, and wash the windows of their sunroom. I'd vacuum the stairs, and dust all of the shelves they couldn't bend to reach. 

I feel like I wasted the last time I could've had with her. I feel like my family made me miss out on seeing her, and conversing with her those last few times. I've told her what I wanted to say today, but she couldn't respond. I could only hope she could hear me. I don't know what to do without her. She was always so proud of me, and made me want to succeed. I don't know what to do. She is still alive, and no one will tell me how long she has left. I asked my older sister, and she said she definitely only has a few days.  I'm not stupid, i can hear that her lungs are filled with fluids. I feel like I am going to forget to tell her something I wish I told her. I feel like I'll be full of regrets. She never saw me get married, my high school wouldn't give me an extra graduation ticket so she could attend, I've never done anything special that she could see. I hope she isn't scared, and I hope she really is happy with what she's been able to see me do. I hope she knows how much I love her. I hope she hears me talking to her still. 

I want to kill myself. I don't understand how to cope with this. I don't have time for therapy. I can't afford to book time off of work with school. I don't know what to do.

405,"Tl;dr: My school sees the symptoms for ADD but just sais I'm depressed and because of this the hospital won't try to help me right away.

So a couple months ago I was in a bad position and had a very bad mood all the time. Not depression, just depressed for a little while. I told one of my mentors this during that time since a specific subject in school was giving me a lot of stress, she allowed me to skip it.

My parents sent me to a professional psychologist working for an independant clinic during this because there's a very long waiting line to get mental help at the normal hospital. 
I talked to the psychologist a few times and she concluded I might have ADD, I later did a test with her and she thinks I definetly do. But since it's an independant clinic she can't give prescriptions for medicine. I can only get that through the goverments hospital. 

Allthough it's a long queue to get help there she thought I could pass the line if I somehow could prove these symptoms occur in multiple enviroments. For that my school has to acknowledge the symptoms. So my parents arranged a meeting with the school so we could talk about it. My school then said they won't support this since they think everything is due to me being depressed. I told them I wasn't depressed and haven't been sad for months. They didnt care and also didn't care about the fact that a lot of people with ADHD or ADD get secondary mental issues like ODD, depression and anxiety. 

Now I won't get help for a lot more time because the hospital just thinks I just have depression and since I've been talking to another psychologist, help through the hospital isnt necessary.

My psychologist is luckily trying to get me help sooner by talking with the hospital but we're not sure if it will work. If my school just acknowledged the symptoms that they've seen but are saying is just because im sad I would be able to get help sooner and hopefully I'd be able to fix my grades so I can go to university incase I want to.

406,"My wife and I are wanting to travel and I am Native American so my tribe gives $20k for down-payments and $5k for closing cost. We do not have to pay property tax either if we go with our tribe. It’s a loan that you have to agree to keep the home for AT LEAST 10 years, if you decide to sell it you have to pay back the loan but prorated depending on how long you kept the home, etc. 

I currently am employed and have been for 2 years and with the loan you have to be employed. My wife is contract so it will only be based off of my income which is great because a year ago we made too much and did not qualify for the loan. Now we qualify and could buy! 

We are both in our 20s and want to travel.... we both have freelanced before and want to travel while working freelance which is totally something we could do. But I want BOTH with our opportunity on the Native American loan AND owning a property in general. 

My wife is not on the same page about buying a home. My idea was, we buy the home and IF we decide to travel for months on end....we Airbnb out our cute home.

408,"I’m 19 years old, since I was about 15, I had been on Effexor VR for anxiety and depression, it was mostly for depression back then. It worked super well except for the fact that it made me tired constantly, It was extremely hard for me to wake up and I had super weird dreams, but in terms of my anxiety and depression it did really well. Over time it also made me start gaining weight that’s extremely hard to lose. Well a few months ago I strongly felt like I didn’t need them anymore, So I weaned myself off of them. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The past few weeks I haven’t been able to leave my house without having anxiety attacks, I also have asthma so the anxiety compliments them VERY well. I can’t breathe, I get dizzy, my chest is tight, I shake, I get the sudden urge to go to the restroom. About a week ago I went to my doctor and asked for a new anxiety medication, she prescribed me Celexa 20mg, she said it was her go to and that there weren’t many side effects, I was so excited to finally get help for my anxiety. I took this medication for 2 days and all I can say is that shit was evil for me. I was nauseous, my anxiety was 100 times worse than it already was. I had terrible thoughts of suicide even though I don’t want to die at all. I was seeing things. Loud noises made me terrified. I was a complete wreck. Needless to say I stopped taking it immediately. 

I can’t even go to work without getting anxiety attacks at least every single hour. I don’t even have to be thinking about it and they happen anyway. I have either called in or left early nearly every single day I’ve been scheduled to work for the past week. I can’t leave the house without getting one, I have an appointment on Wednesday to get on an anxiety medication, whether that’s the one I was on for 4 years or a new one. The thing is I’m terrified of having side effects like I did with Celexa. I still live with my dad and he won’t let the doctors give me Xanax for my anxiety until the new medication kicks in because they generally take around 6 weeks to start fully working. My moms side of the family is full of pill poppers, including my mom. He says if I want to have Xanax prescribed to me I can get the hell out of his house and go live with my mom. I plan on moving in with my boyfriend once I get a full time job though.

411,"My good friend of over 2 years has been asking for a lot lately, and it’s starting to bother me greatly. She is in the middle of moving and has decided to go travel for two months. This entire month has been a mess. She had her ex boyfriend break in and trash and break everything in her condo to sabotage it selling. I cleaned the whole entire condo, cleaning blood and broken glass for hours while she sat in a distraught state. I didn’t mind helping with this as it was random and uncontrollable, but it’s caused a lot of problems resulting in her asking me for more favours.

Now that her place is finally sold, we have been moving stuff out and into a storage unit for weeks and packing. Many times I’ve cancelled with others to help her. Today she asked me to help again. I told her I couldn’t and to ask another friend or family member, but she kept trying to book the moving truck around the time I’d be done what I needed to do. I ended up cancelling an appointment because there was no way around not helping her no matter what I said. I planned to meet her at 1 to help. She texted me at 3 telling me how she just woke up. I put my day on hold and planned my day around helping her. Luckily, I got a later appointment, but she still expects to crash at my apartment tonight. I really don’t want her to. 

She has always been somewhat of a selfish but good person. I would also consider her a very lost person and somehow trouble seems to find her or vice versa. Lately, everything has been about her and no consideration for me. I realized today how little I’ve been focusing on myself since the whole month has been chaos. I have no problem helping friends, but she is asking for too much and every time she asks me another favour, I feel extremely agitated. 

I am also in a sticky situation as it is: she is going to travel for a bit, she asked me to hold onto her couch and bed (I needed both a new couch and a bed but kept putting it off). So we came to the decision so that she doesn’t have to pay for a much larger storage locker to store the two items, I’d hold onto them until she gets back, then buy a new bed and couch. She isn’t leaving until September, but expects to crash here a lot, and I feel like because it’s her bed and couch, she is obligated to stay here. But this is also a favour to her because she didn’t want to pay for extra storage. On top of that, she is just assuming I am going to watch her dog for her while she’s away. She never really asked me and is just assuming. 

How can I go about telling her she’s asking for too much in a polite way?

TLDR: friend is asking me for too many favours after some troubling events that happened in her life. I don’t mind helping, but I am helping so much that I haven’t had a moment hardly to focus on myself and she is making everything about her. ",30Jul2018,3
412,"*** Background 1 starts - I (male 24) in my early childhood(then age 13-14) was a receiver, year later a witness (only), to sexual act done by one of my cousin-1 (male 12-13) to me and another cousin-2 (male 12-13). Cousin-1 was a strong &amp; popular personality in whole family tree, everyone mostly ceded to his demands/desires. We all 3 moved on never talked about it again, we are all changed by now and are not gay. Background 1 ends***

Why I tell this reality is because this is where it all started. During few years after this I had committed many acts that qualify as se_ual harassment, to my other cousins (- 3,4,5) over the course of age 17 to age 19. Cousin-3 male, older; cousin-4,5 female, older; when they were all sleeping; on different-different occasions. Cousin-3,4 woke up instantly, I pretended to be sleeping as they called me out and I hoped they say nothing more, and they did not. Both act like nothing happened till date. Cousin-3 did not wake up or appeared to not wake up ( I think only because she had no response to such act and was dumbfounded in a wrong way)  and I went a bit further (gr0ping in sleep) on 2 occasions. Yeah as I said in title, a monster. She also acts like nothing happened till date.

I learned in college (age 20) to put myself in the shoes of the receivers/victims of my actions and the whole world changed for me. I changed from I did not care about those acts to wtf did I do? I ever since am in a prison of my past, wanting to confess and ease the pain, regret, guilt I have been living with for last 4 years. I regret it every night before I go to sleep remembering some of these actions.

Help me figure out how do I move past this? If I confess and disrupt there lives, especially cousin-3's life, it's another life long regret for me. I don't know how do I say to her - I regret touching you in your sleep without your knowledge, or worse made you feel powerless on that two occasions if she was awake. I can't fully imaging how ashamed one feels when confronted with their inability to do anything about it.

If I don't confess, the guilt is consuming me day by day. I worry if it goes like this what will be next in my life, - nothing but emptiness and loneliness. I can't expect anyone to accept me as partner after knowing this. And I can't be keeping this from a possible one, as now I know the art of going in the victim's shoes.

***Background 2 starts - How I learned to put myself in my victim's shoes- I developed a physical defect at age 20, due to my own actions and was a victim of myself. Upon a lot of reading novels like Siddhartha, The Alchemist, The old man and the Sea, etc., lots of thinking and never ending bit*hing about ""why me"" I realized that it's my own fault. I also realized that we pay for our mistakes in this same life and answer to ""why me"" is "" because I can handle it"". Books and teachings in college were my eye opener. Background 2 ends***

Currently I am unemployed, this year(2k18) graduated from best college of my country. I consider myself to be changed and a decent human being en route to ""Nirvana"", what I aspired to become since I was 20 after I learned about putting myself in others' shoes, but I still have same regrets, guilt, pain every night. I see my cousin-3 almost everyday, acting normal around me and it kills me inside that what if she is hurt badly. Now I don't know what to do and need advice. Also can I expect any superficially wise or not girl to accept me with my past in this world?

413,"My neighbor went to France for almost 3 weeks and I took care of her extensive garden and lawn (everything but mowing) during this time (she also gave me the keys to her house and asked me to check up on it from time to time, which I did). I usually spent about 1.5 hours a day there almost every day she was gone completing the tasks I was asked to do. I did a very thorough job and admittedly the lawn looked great. She even told me this herself and was very appreciative. 

Today I went to pick up the payment. She had an envelope with my name on it and money already in it and asked me if $85 was okay. I was a little taken aback and wasn’t really sure what to say so I just took it and thanked her, which I realize might have been a mistake. I am a very shy person and don’t like confrontation but now I’m wondering if I should say something.

I am not a greedy person and I was happy to do a sweet old woman a favor. It’s just that I’m a bit low on cash (broke college student here who wasn’t able to get a job this summer - only form of income has been sporadic babysitting) and was counting on this. I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of a bit. Am I wrong in feeling this way? Were my expectations too high? If not, should I contact her/what should I say?

414,"I'm going to go in as much detail as possible just so I can get as good advice as possible.

My friend is female and 17. She recently joined a rugby team which she's wanted to do for a while, which I'm really glad about. She got in contact with the coach and he's been a very nice person, meeting up with her, me and another friend, offering her transport to and from training, offering her mental health support (she has depression and an eating disorder, he is a trained psychologist), and today even buying her and my other friend boots as a welcoming gift. This is fantastic and I want to be happy about it, but part of me also feels that there has to be something more to that. She and her friend are the only members that are under the age of 18 and from my understanding the team is meant to be very closeknit with the other members even going to the pub as a group once a week, and when asked about it he said that he'd always wanted kids so supporting them was his own way of kinda making up for that.

Idk, I want to have confidence that he really is just a nice person but at the same time a man going on 30 doing all this for a 17 year old he's known for less than a month has me slightly concerned. I'd rather not bring it up with them but I can't help being worried. Am I right to be?",30Jul2018,0
415,"He doesn’t fit any criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder, but as a child he was misdiagnosed with it. Now, at age 26, he discovered he’s actually on the autism spectrum.

Recently, he has been making a lot of comments about how he’s a sociopath, a terrible person, and how he’s constantly thinking bad things. For an example, he thinks only healthy people without genetic problems should be allowed to have children. He also said he’d rather see a human body on the road than an animal. He only expressed these thoughts when our mutual friend pressed him about his claim that he’s “worse than anyone else.”

I don’t always agree with his opinions, but he is a very intelligent person who works in addiction recovery and cares deeply for his friends. He likes to help people and animals in need. He’s charitable and funny, and I just wish I could help him or that he could get help from a therapist for these self-deprecating thoughts.

He doesn’t commit crimes or hurt other people, so I just can’t believe he’s a sociopath. He does have Bipolar Disorder and anxiety, however.

Any advice? Should I just show him the official criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder so he realizes that’s not him at all?",30Jul2018,1

For example, I was enrolled in the course ""Learning How to Learn"", which you can find [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). After a few sessions of learning new stuff, I started to feel that I should stop learning from that course because of questions like: ""What if I can't exercise for some reason (according to the course, exercise is good for the brain)? What if I don't have the means to execute deliberate practice (like access to a notebook for recalling information)?"" I don't know why I do this to myself honestly.

428,"Background: F27, father died very recently. Have been trying to focus on taking care of my mom (just as the literally 1000 people have told me to do); I’m single so I’m taking care of myself and shortly after my dad died my friends in my town withdrew from me.  I’ve tried to reconnect but to no avail; they never ask how I’m doing or initiate spending time with me.  

I’m working in a truly dead end job that pains me to work in, but I’m in debt (20k student loans and 9k car) and have to pay the bills, so I can’t afford to take a lighter, less pay-type job.  I’m also very overweight and struggling to lose- Ive been so depressed lately that going to work feels like a marathon, let alone going to the gym or taking time to cook for myself properly.  Im not gaining so at least there is that. 

I thought about moving home; (I currently live 3 hours away in a small city that I’m desperate to leave) to work for a while and save some money so I could feel a little more financially secure. But my mom lives in a rural town and jobs are incredibly scarce- I’ve been looking for months. 

In the meantime I work, go home, eat, and go to bed.  Thats about my whole life.  I try to do things I enjoy (I’m a big bookworm so I’m reading a lot more than I have in the past few years which is nice).  Overall I feel like I want to take my life in my hands and make moves in the right direction, but I don’t even know what the right direction is.  I have thought about getting a second job but I’m afraid of burning out quickly.  

I just don’t know where to turn to help or advice- I’ve tried talking to my mom but she was never in my situation when she was my age; didn’t have financial worries, or dealings with grief, was happily married, etc- living a totally different life than me. She has voiced that she struggles to understand. 

I’m actively seeing a therapist (6 monthly sessions in) but Im not sure if that’s really helping me or not. I usually just vent for an hour and then leave. 

None of my friends are living through what I am right now, and it makes me feel even more alone that they are at least succeeding in one area of life. I want to be happy for my friends but it’s hard to be happy period.

If anyone has been through the ringer and can offer up advice on how to get out of the grind and start living life, I’m listening!

My boyfriend broke up with me three months ago and since then everything has been going downhill. The person who I thought was my closest friend (even though she treated me horribly in the past) had shouted at me and told me it’s all my fault he broke up with me. My other close friend just stopped responding to me if I sent anything regarding my ex. Other friends didn’t want to get involved.

I had a month long vacay with family... That helped but I just got backed. Played a few games on League of Legends with my friends but they just shouted at me on how I made them lose the game. Weird, they’re not usually like that. My ex keeps playing with the girl that bullied me last year so it hurts and I see them together online all the time.

It all hurts. My friends screaming at me when I do something wrong, my ex suddenly all over the girl was bullied me after breaking up with me, my closest friend leaving me. And it all started when he broke up with me. It feels like a curse.

I was thinking of just ghosting everyone. Maybe then they will learn to miss me. Maybe then they will wonder what happened to me. Because they only treat me nice when I’m happy instead of sad. And I’m not very good at socializing so I can’t make new friends easily. Even if they seem bad... I’d rather have company than be lonely you know?

Where I am at now though, is trying to figure out my next step. I really love this girl. But its been 8 months.

I give her all my love and affection, as I am single. I give my time and everything to her. But I want exclusivity.

I'm excited for classes, excited to attend school with one of my best friends, but what I'm not excited about is living on campus, not anymore anyways.

I am a very insecure person, so having a tucked-away space of privacy is very important to me, well the only rooms available to me were rooms shared between two people. I was extremely nervous about finding a roommate who I could get along well with, thinking if I could be friends with my roommate things would be easier. Well cue finding her on our matching portal. She seems really cool, has similar interests to me, people I know who know her say she's a total sweetheart. We message and agree to exchange facebooks, she adds me, I message her and it's been a month and I haven't heard anything from her.

Turns out in high school, she dated a guy I used to be friends with (but with all the girlfriends he had I couldn't keep track) well her ex had a crush on me that he even later lied to people at school, and told them we were dating, it even lost me a few friendships.

I leave it on the chair beside me and take off the shoes to give to the cashier who takes it to the till and I follow him. I pay for these trainers and walk out the store ready to go home until I tap my pocket and realise oh, I forgot my phone. Turn around, go back into the shop and look at the chair and it's gone and I go into complete meltdown mode.

So, what I've already done: Spoken with the guys at the store who have my email address if anything happens, rang my phone a few times and they answered the second time although they didnt say anything, they just left it in their pocket and then cut me off, I had spoken to the shopping centre customer helpdesk who didn't have any phone brought to them (This is the Bullring in Birmingham, England by the way) and then finally I went to EE and asked them to stop that SIM from working and ended up getting a shiny new S9+ which I am still waiting for this SIM to register since 2pm.

451,"I'm going to try this again, in more of a question and less of a rant. 

Okay so for the first time in my life 2 years ago, I asked a girl out for the first time. She barely murmured a no, and I was still kinda proud that I was able to muster up courage and ask a cute girl out! I wanted to keep doing this, however I knew I had to do it better and not be as awkward about it. 

To do this, I first focused on getting myself better looking by wearing better clothes, getting a decent haircut, brushing my teeth and bathing (I already do this stuff though so), I also started occasionally working out. I'm not ripped, but I'm in-shape. 

Not only that, I focused on my social skills and tried to improve on that. I used to be a very socially awkward person but now I can say while I'm still not perfect (and I don't think I ever will be), I'm helluva lot better. I always have something to say, I'm not socially anxious anymore, I got some more friends now. 

I asked a lot more girls out, **A LOT,** and I kept trying some more. I asked girls that I thought were cute, hot, some I enjoyed talking to (and thought they enjoyed talking to me), I tried just directly asking them out, I tried becoming friends at first, I tried just starting a quick chat, I tried the ""studying,"" route, I can safely say I tried every way on the book to ask a girl out. I also tried lowering my standards, and even they say no! I also tried Bumble/Tinder/PoF/etc. 

So, after about 100+ rejections and not even 1 single yes in my life, after years of trying to improve on myself, I am putting this in a pause for probably a very long time. I don't know what else is wrong with me! It's even odd that my friends that are girls say to me that I am, 'boyfriend material,' which at this point I now assume they say this so that they just say something nice to me. I am a very nice person, I am never creepy or wierd, I don't say anything inappropriate, it's gotta be that I'm ugly physically and it's just nothing that I can do? 

I don't know what else to do, I am officially stuck and tbh I'm really just on the verge of giving up and stopping this. I can guarantee that if you bring up a new way of doing this, I probably had done it. So, can anyone tell me that I was born with a burden and it's absolutely worthless to improve on??",30Jul2018,0

I understand that when you send someone wishes on their birthday, you're not entitled to any response, however we were really close. It makes sense they didn't thank the few who only offered a short ""hbd"" but mine was slightly longer. Some other people who they're not even as close to as they are to me offered a greeting the same length as mine yet still received responses, which still baffles me. 

Further context:

- I posted ""Happy birthday *insert nickname which is our inside joke* with an emoji we both really like and all they did was respond with the react laughing emoji, while the rest of the majority got reacted with a like and a thoughtful thank you message

-We  used to hang out at school all the time and are seen as ""the best friend duo"", but outside of that in reality we rarely see each other on breaks because we live quite far from each other 

-Our birthdays are almost on the same day and 2 months back which was when we last saw each other, they brought up the possibility of going to another city together to celebrate, and I said I'd probably be busy with work not to get their hopes up, and therefore had never promised anything to begin with, and they replied with being okay with it and finding alternate plans with other friends

-My birthday is coming up soon and I have a feeling they might be furious with me not inviting them to do something even though they never initiated something to be begin with

-We keep in touch through sending each other memes yet neither of us asked each other to hang out this summer

-They've been mad at me before because I barely texted them the previous break and my excuse was that I was that I was busy (This is a friend that I don't want to get too close to for personal reasons, but we share the same friend group at school and I really don't want to be slightly ignored or ostracized when school stars again as they are the leader of this group)

I just want advice on what this situation seems like for anyone who's read up to this point. Any advice appreciated. Thanks.",30Jul2018,1
453,"Long story short, my mom and i don't get along and she's constantly telling me to move out. I'm 20. I can't really ask her for help so instead i am turning to strangers on the internet.

I need some serious help/advice about how to do this.

So basically I have two options: I could move a couple states away to go live with my friend at college (we've known each other for years), where rent is about $275 a month before utilities. Or I could find my own place around here for about $600 a month including utilities.

Money wise, living with my friend is the smarter option, but I would be a 4 hour drive away from everything else i know. On the up side, it's a college town where i'm likely to make new friends, and i'd be living with my best friend so that would be pretty cool. Living in my own place would mean more privacy, I'd live close to home, but it'd be double the money.

Which do you think is smarter?

**And the most important questions:** What are the basic things i need to move out to an apartment, like credit wise, job wise, money wise? How do i even go about establishing credit? What is the soonest you think i could establish credit to move out? Is there anything else I need to know?",30Jul2018,2
454,"I'll try to put my finger through my hand, but I'm having trouble focusing on this and trying mentally in some way to get it to see if it'll go through my hand. It ends up just being me jabbing my hand with my finger with some of my attention directed elsewhere while I'm stuck in my head. I feel like I need someone to snap me out of it. When you've spent time at a computer for a while, enter a flow state easily, and silently self-psychoanalyze and pay attention to the introverted world throughout the day, it's very difficult to truly practice a reality check and not just jab my finger against my hand.

I intend to have several things incorporated into every day life eventually: Lucid dreaming, solar plexus meditation, various meditations as needed, making minimally processed meals (most of it's done once a week; the microwaving is done when I'm hungry, but it can take a bit longer), cold showers, self-awareness, good posture, brushing my teeth, setting things up for tomorrow, and exercise (a 2 mile run every other day or push-ups and jumping jacks 5-10 minutes a day). I'm having trouble figuring out how, though.

Any advice?",30Jul2018,1

457,"Hi everyone,

I'm just sick and tired of my life right now. I find myself unable to socialise with everyone but a select minority of people. I just yearn to feel that raw bond between another human being. But how can I? Some say the answer is to just expose yourself but I've been going out with friends every 2-3 days and my social skills have not improved. Whenever I open my mouth, I stutter and often have to repeat myself.

I just need answers. What the fuck can I do to break down these mental walls and make my Autism a thing of the past? Am I just doomed to be a socially awkward outcast for the rest of my life?

This is having so many implications in my life: I'm sexually frustrated from being a virgin, I'm lonely from a lack of human contact and I don't have a job because I'm worried about communicating with people.

TLDR: Frustrated and confused with my autism and want to know what I can do about it.",30Jul2018,6

461,"The main problem is that my only sexual fantasies are ones containing the paraphilia. I am not very sexually aroused by thoughts of intercourse (the thoughts just lead to ones with said paraphilia). I don’t believe that the source of arousal is a danger to others and my judgment is intact enough to know that it probably isn’t a very good idea to fulfill the fantasy.

My questions is what I should be doing to be aroused by healthy things. Should I try to completely eliminate the fantasy? If so how? Is it possible to just have less of a fixation on the paraphernalia but still entertain thoughts relating to it? I do enjoy the fantasies, but I question if I am thinking clearly.

Looking online the main suggestion I found was to watch less porn and/or not masturbate, but trying that for
 ~2 weeks didn’t seem to help. If anything I just felt more sexually frustrated

I would like to avoid seeing a therapist mainly out of embarrassment but let me know if this is something that I should get professional help for.

462,"So me and my girlfriend are moving down to the countryside to live with her family, we are currently renting but they have a very large ant and offered for us to live there to save money. 

Iv been a few times and love it, the place is perfect and her family actually feel like a family. I'm not from the best of areas, my mum and dad broke up a few years ago now and my mum came off worse, she has my 2 sisters to look after (now 17 and 18) whilst having a job to pay the bills and rent for her house.

She does struggle with money so i help her out when i can. I feel she also has some emotional problems too if im being honest. 

Bottom line is i feel like i don't deserve to move and be happy, to be included in another family when mine is so broken and apart. I really don't know what to do. One of the reasons i want to move down is so i can actually help her move money wise. Ill have disposable income what i can send to her so shes not struggling.

463,"My dad currently lives in an apartment on his own. He doesn’t have a job and hasn’t had one since 2010 when he moved in with my grandma to take care of my grandma. Grandma died in 2016 and he sold the house but my sister controls his finances because he has a gambling problem. She pays his rent for him and gives him a monthly stipend for food and such. 

My sister called me today kind of freaking out because she had just spoken to dad and he seemed really disoriented. He went to the office at his apartment complex to pay rent and was expecting to pay $50 instead of the $900 for some reason. (Not sure why he went to the office at all since my sister always pays rent online and he tends to stay inside all day drinking.) she said he was panicking on the phone and breathing heavy. Other times in conversation he brings up old conversations as if they happened the other day. It’s difficult to explain, but it seems like he’s losing his mind. 

I never had a good relationship with him, nor did my sister. Neither of us are able to take him in to live with us. I’m curious to know what our options are for him. He still has money from selling the house, but it won’t last forever. I don’t mean to seem callous, but our relationship is very complicated and he’s been a great source of stress in my life. He’s made a series of very poor choices to get to where he is today, but he is still my dad. I don’t want to get too into the emotional side of things, but I would appreciate some other perspective and advice on what we can do to provide him the care he will need possibly sooner rather than later.

Will a employer hire me if I seek full time but request Monday to come in later (or earlier) and Wednesday to be off or work through the night? I heard some places won’t hire students because of the schedule, but is that some law or is it based on the preference on the employer?

467,"TLDR; I've been trying to help my friend get out of depression and out of a path that is almost certain to leave her miserable in the long term, but recently nothing has been working due to her culture/family expectations. I need advice on how to help her if anyone has anything.

Long story; Before I begin this post I want to apologize for it's length. It's a lot but I believe it is necessary to explain the situation in order for you, the reader, to have everything you need to know before posting advice, if you wish to do so. Here we go:

I have a friend from the Middle East (F. 21) who I met in university last fall in one of our classes. For the first 6 months of our friendship we got pretty close and (to my surprise) I became her confidant within the first 3 months of our friendship.

I was surprised for two reasons; the first being we had only known each other from class and did not see each other outside of lecture due to her strict schedule. The second reason I was surprised was that she told me that she had never truly expressed herself to anyone, not even to her other friend whom she had known for much longer. 

She told me that she hates her career path but is forced into doing so due to her culture and family expectations. She is forced to suppress her emotions on a daily basis and is to be seen and not heard. Not only is she suffering, but her brother (30) is depressed as well (for unrelated reasons). She told me she is suicidal and thinks about killing herself everyday, but does not due to her culture and religion. Knowing it would difficult for her, I asked her if she could try to talk to her family about what she told me, to which (unsurprisingly) she said it wouldn't make a difference. I asked her if she could try to pursue a career she wanted to do but she said at this point there isn't anything she could do as her family wouldn't support the decision. Out of hope (and some desperation) I suggested that she should attempt to do what she wants, regardless of what her culture/family wants of her; because she isn't going to be happy if she continues down the path she is heading, so at least try something else, even if it means possibly alienating yourself from your own culture/family. Of course, she said that was out of the option. Knowing there was not much else I could say in the moment, I told her that I am there for her and I will lend a listening ear to her when she needs it.

Yet as time went on, I started to notice a change in her behavior. She started to stay after school longer to spend time with myself and her other friends (despite this going against her family's desires). She started to look into joining clubs at school (much to her family's disapproval). Before going off into spring break, she asked me if we could go to the beach together since we wouldn't see each other until spring break was over (which was huge since, according to her, her culture doesn't allow for women and men to be together alone unless they are married). She told me there was someone who she liked, and despite him being an American (another no-no), she wanted to tell him her feelings for him after she found the courage to do so. At the end of our beach hangout, she gave me a hug (which is also against her culture, to have a unmarried man and woman hug in public) before leaving. I thought to myself that maybe what I said had gotten to her; she was doing what she wanted regardless of what was expected from her. She was so happy during this time and I was happy for her.

Unfortunately, her family found out what she was doing, in particular her mom. I don't know the extent to what was said, but I know her mom was extremely upset with her and told her she could continue doing what she was doing, but she would be very disappointed with her. She stopped looking into clubs, stopped staying out later at school (unless she absolutely needed help with her studying), she suppressed her feelings for the person she liked, and saw me less often in exchange for other Middle Eastern classmates/friends (while simultaneously telling me how much she doesn't like them and feels uncomfortable around them). She was visibility less happy and when we talked she once more told me how much she hates her life. That was at the end of school, which was in early June.

Now it's gotten to the point were she is lying to herself and contradicting what she has previously said. She's telling me her life isn't that bad, that her culture isn't as bad as it seems, and that she is okay with everything despite her saying otherwise in the past. Her brother has sunken deeper into depression to the point were he might take his own life. I told her she and her family needs to help him in anyway, but she is actively saying that he is okay and doesn't want to do anything (moments from saying he isn't okay and she is worried for his well being). I've told her she also needs to go to therapy with her family. While she says she would like that, she doesn't believe it is possible, in particular for her brother and mom. I've tried to help her like in the past, but now she isn't even attempting make any change.

I am sure there isn't anything I can do, but if anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it. So far, what progress was made has been lost. I really care for my friend, but at the same time I don't know what to do anymore.",30Jul2018,0
468,"Ok so I've known this guy for almost two years, we're both juniors in college now. Met him in a freshman course that he struggled with a lot and I didn't. He asked me back then to hang out / help him study and I always said no. 

All in all he's a nice guy, but I never wanted to be anything than casual acquaintances with him I guess, idk. Like I didn't mind talking with him in class, but outside? Not interested. We've run into each other a few times in the dining halls and talked about classes and life and stuff, and they've been good conversations but that's where I want to draw the line. We were on the same residence hall floor, were in the same group chat, and thus he has my number.

He's texted me a few times asking ""How are you doing?"", ""Are you doing anything?"", ""No? Do you want to hang out / see a movie?"" and each time I've declined. I don't want to and I've told him just that. Earlier this year - we don't live in the same hall anymore - he started just texting me ""hi / hey"". I replied at first, kept it simple and boring. I stopped about three times after he started doing this, but he just keeps on texting me. A month will go by and I'll think he's finally given up, but nope then out of the blue he'll text me again. 

Two months ago he started messaging me on Facebook. I ignored him. Then two weeks ago he messaged me on FB again, and being stupid I thought I'd give him some mercy and reply. This is how that went:

G: Hi

Me: hey what's up?

G: Not too much how have you been?

Me: Pretty good, my summers been going well

G: Nice, I miss you haha

And I never replied. Last Thursday he texted me ""hey"" and just texted me the same thing again two hours ago. I'm so done with this but I don't even know what to text him to just get him to leave me alone.

Please just tell me what to text him. Thanks.",30Jul2018,0

478,"**Im very sorry in advance for the length of this post**

So a few months back I had a massive argument with my closest friend for the following reasons:

I had apparently been talking behind their back

I had been ""ignoring"" them for months

And I had been an ass to their bf

there is more but i dont want to take alot of time up

So to deconstruct what they said I know that I wasn't talking behind their back because I used to really enjoy their company and loved talking to them etc all that sappy stuff

I couldn't have been ignoring them because they never messaged on fb messenger and I tried to talk to them in school the day before it all happened and they never replied or looked at me, but I just took that as me being quiet

And the bf thing I don't want to sound childish but he did use alot of the personal things that i've went through just to hurt me so in my opinion I had every right to say he this that blah blah but never anything personal because i'm not like that.

But what does really annoy me is that I used to talk to them every day and we used to talk from the start to the end of the day never being tired of each others company just the normal friendly stuff but then when she got her bf who at the time was a friend of mine she began ditching not just me but everyone she knew, started talking behind everyones backs and started believing everything her bf said as if it was biblism but anyway back on topic

Her bf said for months that I had been talking behind their backs because they went on holiday or whatever which I hadn't because blah blah, but what really got to me is that they didn't message me asking if I had or even said anything at all when I asked what was said but when I asked who said it I got the reply ""I wasn't told"" which I knew it was lies then she had been told but i dont know if im overreacting to this **but main point now**

A week ago or something she messaged me asking if we could make amends and it ended quite personally on both sides but tbh I do miss their friendship because they did help me through alot but at the same time the bf is still in their life and I know that i'd never be proper friends because he'd just keep saying that i'm doing whatever.

But anyway I've probably held your time for more than a suitable amount im very sorry for anyone who has read this and thinks im stupid or something but it does really hurt me and I dont really speak my mind out often hence why this post is kind of awkward but im very thankful for anyone who replies with advice or even reads this and thinks that im not the worst person in the world.",30Jul2018,2
479,"Hi everyone! First post on here, and sorry it’s a long one.
Writing because I’m conflicted on how to react to my friend’s anger towards me.
I am f/24 and my friend is m/25. We’ve been working at the same company for 2 years now. Since it might be relevant, said friend is not interested in women.
Background info -
Friend and I share cultural background which is uncommon is mostly white company. We bonded over music and language, especially during happy hours. We became closer during a time when there were many happy hours and many other co-workers were also friendly. It was a grand ol time. We were constantly hanging out after work and before long i met his parents and he learned more about my family life. During this time I was also going through my mother’s illness and subsequent passing away. I’m not the most social person, but with alcohol and a constant desire to distract myself from my current situation, it worked. 
About a year later, we reached peak friendship when he invited me to travel to his home country with him  and his parents. As co-workers this wasn’t the best move for the bosses, but I wanted to just escape for a bit. The trip had its great moments, but also some realizations were made. First off, I got annoyed that he didn’t plan things in advance. If it weren’t for me, we wouldn’t have had any Airbnb addresses and since he used all his data in the first two days, my phone data was what we all relied on. Also, we unfortunately had several flights delayed and he displayed such anger and impatience, it stressed me out entirely. We got home bc I purchased last minute tickets. The airline was supposed to refund us for the original tix and he kept asking me to check, but never repaid me for the emergency tix. I decided not to ask him to repay me since he angrily said in the airport that he’d have to get a second job to pay for a $700 ticket.
As you can tell, I’m passive. I keep cool and I’m patient. I feel like I’ve already gone through the worse thing in my life, that I don’t let these things, like delayed flights bother me. I had savings to cover the costs. But as they say, you really get to know someone when you travel with them and when you see them angry.
Once we returned, a few things changed. I entered into a relationship and started a year-long thesis project for my degree, which kept me very busy. It also became much more apparent that he wasn’t getting good reviews at work. Basically, we’re at the same position but I started a year earlier. I’ve gotten very good reviews and am liked by my bosses. I also have been respected more by them for continuing to work during my mother’s illness and also while attending school. As such, my peers have been compared to me, and in their eyes my performance has been a lot better than my friend’s. All of which they told him during his review. This made me very uncomfortable, but he seemed to take it ok at first...like asking me what he should do to be better. I gave him advice but things haven’t gotten better. If anything, the management have lost their patience with him after 2 years for not being able to pick up programs as fast as others and for making the same mistakes. There are certain co workers who have treated him unfairly like not asking him to take tasks on, or excluding them entirely from meetings or lunches. I know this started alienating him, and I listened to him while he complained it might be racism or just a dislike of him. I started hinting that he should look for a different job. I said although I enjoy having a close friend at work, I’d prefer to see him happy. 
Meanwhile, I worked on my thesis project which consumed me. At first, I asked him for advice but I began to feel like he was trying to input too much of his ideas and expectations so I retreated. If there’s anything I regret, it was right then and there that I should’ve told him he was intimidating me with his opinions and expectations. He also made several comments about how he didn’t like my university’s ways of doing things.
About a month before thesis finals, I noticed he would stop talking to me entirely. I had also stopped eating lunch with him as I was completely busy with thesis at all times of day. Finally I asked him to lunch and he told me that he was hurt I was being cold to him and that he felt alone at the company since people didn’t like him. I truly did feel bad that time and apologized but also explained that I’m not an overly outgoing person . I literally walk into work and try to avoid greeting anyone. Yes I have some social anxiety.
All was well until he started ignoring me again a week later. He asked me to talk after work and was like “I think you know what this is about.” I literally had no clue except maybe I pissed him off by not saying hi. Turn outs! He thought I had stolen his thesis project from school and used it on mine and that’s why I hadn’t been talking to him lately! This is after I had finally sent him an image of my design. Supposedly they looked similar....I had never looked at his. I was so surprised but relieved to know I had done nothing wrong. We were able to get over that...but things haven’t felt the same. For someone to make that accusation, they must really not trust me. And I saw it as a fault of my own.
Anyway, I invited him to my graduation...things were going okay. He mentioned again that I gone “cold on him” for not saying hi at work. Tried to make an effort to eat more lunches with him.
But it’s started to feel like a lot of effort. I’ve been paranoid that he’ll get mad at me again. I’ve complained to friends more. Ive been wondering how much our friendship might be better if I didn’t see him everyday and there was this pressure to be friendly.
And then today, he got PISSED at me. Very mad, within 30 mins of walking into the office. I had turned around in my seat to talk to my manager about what work I could do (this is something I have to do everyday bc we’ve been low at work). It turned into a discussion and the other coworkers who sit nearby joined in. Tasks were divided. I check my instant chat and he’s asking me what work is there to do from “my little meeting.” I try to ignore that comment and suggest the tasks could be divided and to ask the manager. He then accuses me of not including him in the meeting. I said it wasn’t my meeting. He basically implies that since we’re friends I should go out of my way to include him, since he isn’t automatically included partly bc the managers forgets/doesn’t like him. I admit that I could’ve done that, and that yes I would’ve  if it was a formal meeting. He accuses of me of not caring, of doing this times before, and of having bad communication skills.
I almost admit to the latter but I stop myself. I don’t need to degrade myself when In fact, by all accounts I’m a great employee. At this point, I’m angry and just don’t respond to him.
I could very well apologize but here’s the thing - I really do just think he expects too much from me. He expected me to prioritize our friendship during my thesis by giving him more attention and “warmth” and he expects me to stand up for him as an employee all the time. Typing this out has made me realize how much stress this friendship has been giving me. And now this week we’re not even gonna be given space since I see him everyday. Any advice for a work friendship that may have gotten too deep?

480,"…and now I want out

I’ve always wanted to get out of Kingman, but this recent display of ignorance was the last straw. I’m sick and tired of being surrounded by slack-jawed morons. This town is everything it was portrayed as in the [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJlZyFxp88). It’s a safe haven for the worst that our society has to offer. After living here most of my life, I really need to move before I waste away more of my best years in this dump. The question is how? 

I work a dead-end job, and have a few thousand saved up in the bank. I also have a pretty general associate degree, but I stopped pursuing school thereafter because I still can’t figure out what I want to do with my life. 

I just know that I want to get away from this miserable place while I’m still young. Small towns can be a trap. I’ve seen so many of my peers leave, only to come crawling back. What can I do to make sure I don’t suffer the same fate? 

I don’t really have any transferable skills or talents, or even passions for that matter. I prefer not to be a burden on some of my family members who live in other parts of the country/world. I will be totally alone when I venture out of this town. I have lived a sheltered life, and consequently feel younger than my age. The last thing I want to do is sit here and continue watching the world pass me by.

How do I even begin planning appropriately for such a big life change? ",30Jul2018,1
