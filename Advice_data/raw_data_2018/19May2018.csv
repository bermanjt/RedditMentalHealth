0,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety pretty much my whole teenage life. It started when I lost my uncle to suicide in 8th grade. I acted out a lot in middle school through freshman year, and I had a lot of really terrible friendships and really amazing friendships that were more harm than good, I soon discovered. I've had ups and downs with many of my friends and when I was 17, one of my close friends killed himself that greatly impacted my personality and life. (I'm 18 now and I feel a lot better about myself.)

There are three specific friends that my parents say are no good for me, and there have been times where, indeed, they have been particularly awful towards me. I went through periods where I stopped speaking to them for a few months, and felt guilty for doing so (even though in the long run, my mental health had gotten increasingly better. My parents noticed a difference as well.) I went back to being friends with them. They would either make subtle jabs at me self-esteem or just be unbelievably negative for no reason, greatly impacting my mood and in return impacting my family's mood as well.

All three of them are anti-recovery, (""Don't go to therapy, all therapists are evil!"" ""Don't talk to your parents about things, they'll only make things worse!"" ""Medication is for weak people!"" etc.) get into really bad situations and are very clear that they hate my parents and I should do everything possible to get away from them. My parents aren't perfect, but I love them dearly. I wouldn't be the person I am today without them.

What I need advice about is whether or not I should cut ties with them completely again, or just slowly distance myself. Although they say and do these negative things, they are really amazing people underneath the hatred and bigoted things they say. Looking past the bad, I see so much good... But I'm scared of letting them get to me as they have done many times before.",19May2018,5
1,"Is it normal to fear your parents? To be fair all adults scare me, but my parents scare me the most, i avoid talking to them as much as possible to avoid anything bad happening, i dont even think i have a reason why, the werent overly physical with me as a child and such, but im still afraid to even be in the same room as them.",19May2018,1
2,"I graduated from college 2 weeks ago and is working full time now. Now I am staying near workplace, which is a small town. All my friends and family members are far away. Though the townspeople are all nice and polite, I feel so lonely. Feel like I am missing something important. 

My guess is it is a girl.

Is it a girlfriend? I feel jealous and extremely sad when I see or hear 'dating/relationship' related stuff. I often feel attracted to pretty girls, but never had the courage to ask them out except twice \(first one rejected me and second one had a boyfriend\). But, I am ready to wait for the right one.

Is it a friend who is a girl? I feel so happy and energetic \(but also slightly anxious\) when I talk to my roommates or other cute girls in town. I feel like hanging out with them, but it never happens. After admitting that I am a shy guy who have trouble socializing with girls, my roommates have been nice to me. But I feel like I still hasn't completely gotten into their friendship circle.",19May2018,2

4,"Hey guys, this is my first ever reddit post, hopefully doing it in the right sub. TLDR in the end of the post. 

So the thing is - I live quite far away from my family and only visit them once in 1-2 years. Right now i am visiting then again. 

Unfortunately, my grandparents are very old and have had some problems with health this year so while I hope for the best and really hope I’ll see them again, I also decided that it may be my last chance to do something together with them. 

And one such thing that we have wanted to do for a while now is to record an interview-like video so that they could tell us more about their life and we could pass it on as memory to further generations.

And while I do have some general ideas and questions to ask - where they originally from, their work, how they moved here (they moved from Ural to Siberia in Russia), our other ancestors, life advice, etc. But I was wondering - what would you ask your grandparents in such interview? Maybe someone got interesting question they could share? Id greatly appreciate that! 
I really want to make this film very special.

6,"I want to preface this by saying that I am currently finishing my last semester at community college for awhile before joining a program to become a medical assistant for the next 15 months.

I work a part time job around 10-15 hours a week and would be working even more so if it wasn't for my current classes taking up 2 of the 4 days I should have with my client. The job I work for is for a caregiving company where I am only paid minimum wage with very little room for growth or expansion. Basically a flyover job until I secure myself out of moving from my current state.

This coming week is the last week of my classes and thus finals. I need to be studying this weekend with a paper due on Sunday for a history class and a group project that wants to meet up.

During this last weekend I politely told one of my office managers I wouldn't be able to fill in any on-call shifts due to needing to focus on my studies. I told them I didn't want to be disturbed. They told me alright.

Yesterday after work I was at the gym when the planning person at my office calls me saying she has a potential client for me to take on and she needs me this weekend. She even told me about how she knew I didn't want to be bothered this weekend but continued to gush on and on about how wonderful this prospective client is and how she's 'such a dear'. Since I'm in the middle of my workout and already need to step aside to take this annoying phone call, I begrudgingly agree.

Now the last true day of studying that I have for this week is ate up from almost an entire day shift. On top of that, the client lives 30 minutes away from me. The planning person had even mentioned that 'its easy to get there from where you live'. I don't exactly appreciate the false lead-in to this as I only found out the exact address of this possible client today. 

I guess this could lapse into a further disappointment that I am an on-call employee. There are apparently five of us and even as on-call it is not my full obligation to accept every shift that has been thrown at me. I've accepted 12 hours shifts without hesitation and was even coaxed into a shift very similar with a client they claimed was sweet and kind. That shift turned out to be not only almost an hour away but the client was further revealed to be one of the more difficult people to work with. 

Another such incident was a weekend I took no shifts due to a personal issue that was going on in my life. Note that five other people are also available, once against, and during Monday of the next week I was called by one of the management and scolded that I had agreed to do on-calls. Even though there is no obligation for me to be doing so.

I feel like I am jumping through hoops for a company that is taking advantage of my resources. I do not get reimbursed for the gas that I use for my own vehicle and have been called to shifts as in little as 10 minutes before they begin. I'm paid at a wage as someone does in my state that works at the McDonald's counter (no shade to anyone that works fastfood) for being both a caregiver, providers, and housekeeper in one. I'm stuck on how to feel at this point. ",19May2018,1

9,"I need help figuring out how to help my mom and set her up in a safe a stable environment. She is mentally and physically stable but due to how her hand of cards played out she is stuck. 

She's about 40 yrs old and lives with me a 22yr old son and also a 6 yr old daughter. My father isn't in the picture anymore as of last year and so far she's been skating along with help from the state and myself.

She's applied at places around the house but hasn't had much luck. Firstly, she doesn't have a stable phone, she has an Obama phone with limited minutes so if someone was to call and she's out of minutes then she could've missed out on an interview. Also not many places seem willing to work around the schedule she needs to put my sister on the bus and then to get her off and take care of her for the rest of the day.

I work between 35-45 hours every week and I try to provide as much as I can for her but I also spend some on myself. Ive had my own apartment before but due to a series of unfortunate events I ended up moving back on with her and my dad and sister. Since then we've moved a couple times and my dad, the sole revenue of money, isn't around anymore. Nor does he pay child support or help out in anyway.

We don't know what to do anymore, she can't get a job, hasn't really made a career for herself because she was a housewife. I keep telling her to try with more applications but she is do discouraged at this point. I don't know how to help anymore. I'm going to buy her phone unlimited minutes and hope that someone will be willing to hire her.

Now, at age 29, I feel confident that I want to pursue writing as a career and I am ready to attempt to get published. I majored in english: creative writing in college the first time around, plus I have done writing workshops and NaNoWriMo two years. I have accomplished a lot and I feel confident in my writing, but I have also reached my limits of knowledge when it comes to publishing. I have written two full novels, but I am having a hard time editing them. I have tried connecting locally but it is a challenge.

My mom has offered to pay for my education if I choose to go back, but it seems silly to go back just for editing help...but not really, right? I go round and round with this. I tell myself that with the same money I could easily hire someone to edit my work and then put the rest into self-publishing or something, but how? I don’t know what I’m doing! I just have good stories. So, then I think about how much other good stuff I will learn while at school, plus the people I will meet. Sometimes it seems like an obvious choice, that school would develop me as a person and help me move forward regardless. But, wow, what a commitment! I feel so much more ready and focused this time, but college classes are expensive and time consuming. See? Round and round.

15,"So I've been considering getting my tubes tied for about 12 years now (basically since I learned it was an option) and now that I'm almost 25 and have had over a decade to think about it i feel like I'm ready to go through with it. 

Recently I found out that a tubal ligation procedure could be very affordable or even free for me with my insurance, so I'm hoping to go ahead with it soon. But my issue is my family and friends. My family is quite traditional in a sense where they think not wanting kids makes me a selfish person, and an embarrassment. I'm also worried about what my friends might think. A lot of them are very conservative in that aspect as well.

Has anyone else here had the procedure done at a young age and with no kids? (or men who have had a  vasectomy?) Do you have any advice for dealing with outside judgment from family and friends regarding your decision?

17,"tl;dr down below

To start off i hit this guy(C) up by making my friends bf get his snap for me. I only wanted to be fwb with him. From sc I got his number

Well turns out C had a gf at the time and I laid off of him. After that I got back together with my ex and that’s when C broke up with his gf and hit me back up to where I declined. 

Fast forward a couple months me and my ex broke up again and desperate me decides to talk to C. It was going good I guess but C decided to be really difficult about where to meet up and whether or not he wanted to have sex. He made up stupid lies and tried to make it seem like he was a player but I know how a real player is. 

So i decide not to talk to him and decide on wanting a real relationship. C and I stopped talking but then started again(idk why) and he made an emphasis on how he likes to be friends before he dates someone. Fair enough right? 

Wrong. We would talk but he would say sexual comments randomly, then when i called him out on it or flirt back he would say something about were “just friends.” Then I pushed him to say if we were talking or not, even after he admitted he had a crush on me. So i thought he wanted something serious and took that approach. Eventually I got frustrated because the “player” in him appeared again (ie. saying he went to his “hoes” place one day). There I went off on him and cut it off. This was back in march

Fast forward to now, he hit me up out of nowhere saying he wanted to “check on me.” He started ranting about classes but then asked me about my dating life. Obviously I told him I’ve been talking to other people, and he asked why it ended and said “they could have been the one”. 

After that, today I sent him a snap on accident and he replied super super fast. This whole time I think i’ve had a bit of a crush on him and find myself wanting to talk to him again. I know he’s terrible for me and really dumb, but part of me sees his soft side he showed for a little bit &amp; I believe he’s just doing the player thing so I think he’s this bad ass dude(my friends bf did the exact same thing, except he had actual girls to flaunt). So what should I do?

21,"I'm a 27 year old woman and sometimes my dad touches me inappropriately, but in context it seems like the touching could be accidental. We live in different states so I'm only around him maybe 3 or 4 times per year, but he always ends up accidentally touching my butt or breasts when I'm with him. Here are a few examples of what he does:

-There have been a few times where I went to sit down on the couch and he suddenly slides his hand under where I'm sitting so I end up sitting on his hand

-If I hug him, he often slides his arms under mine, so that when we stop hugging and he draws back his arms, he grazes the sides of my breasts with his hands

-If we're in a crowded place, he stands behind me and presses up against my butt

I've confronted him about these things, and he always says I'm overreacting and it was just an accident. Once when his hand kept inching closer to my butt while we were sitting on the couch together I said something like, ""Watch where you hand is, it's getting close to my butt,"" and he got angry and yelled, ""What's wrong with you, you really think I want to touch your butt?!"" I want to think it's an accident and he's just not paying attention to where his body is in space, but I just don't know, I've never had this issue with anyone but him, everyone except him stays far enough away from me that they don't accidentally touch me when they move.

I would also like to include some childhood stuff just in case it's relevant:

I remember we used to play a ""game"" where he would make me touch my tongue to his tongue. Not like French kissing, just touching tongue tips without touching lips. I hated it, it kind of reminded me of licking a 9V battery, but he seemed to think it was funny and he'd make me do it if I wanted to get ice cream or go to the park or whatever. At some point when I was 5 or 6, my mom said that I was getting too old to do that with him, and so then he'd only do it when she wasn't around, up until I was maybe 12-13 years old. I've never told anyone this except my therapist, and she thinks it's weird and said her dad never did that with her, but she's only one person so I wonder if maybe other people did this with their dads? Also, for some reason I feel like I know what his penis looks like, but I don't know if I maybe just walked in on him in the bathroom or something because I don't remember him forcing me to touch him or showing me his penis. I have a lot of blanks in my childhood and I don't remember much of it, but I also remember that when he'd tickle me it was always directly over my breasts, and it hurt because it felt more like pinching/grabbing than tickling. 

Sorry this turned into a long post. I'm just confused and not sure what to do, or what to call what he does (i.e., accident or harassment/abuse). I'm in college and he's the only one I have to cosign my student loans, and he helps me with bills and other random expenses when I need it. Without his financial support, I wouldn't be able to live out of state and would likely have to move back in with him. It's just so hard to figure out what he's thinking/trying to do because I feel like if he was really trying to molest me, he would have escalated things by now. He also tends to do most of the accidental touching in public. We went to a birdwatching event over the weekend and he didn't touch me at all in the car on the drive to the event or at the hotel we stayed at, but when we were at the park he grazed my butt/breasts probably 10 times. It was really crowded where we were birdwatching, but no one else touched me like that. 

Anyway, I'm rambling at this point, but do you guys/gals think this touching could be an accident, or do you think he's doing it on purpose?",19May2018,2

I can't find another school near by that I could continue at that offers a bachelors in hospitality. 
     Another choice that's been brought up is finance. With the finance program, I can transfer to a near by place that is fairly cheap and pursue a bachelors. 
     My main question is, should I go for the bachelors or another associates?... I could enjoy banking, but I know I'd love to manage a hotel. I'd love to go into hospitality but I don't know if I can do anything with just an associates with it.

23,"Straight to the point: I’ve always been terrified of failing French class. I’ve been surrounded by french my whole life, but with an english family, I never properly learned it. So of course, french class is pretty difficult considering they expect us to be able to speak it fluently (hardly anyone can because the language education system is so bad).

We read a book in class for a few months and then did a test on the whole book. I thought I did pretty damn well. 55%. Nevermind.

We also watch this TV show in which the people speak french very fluently, use slang and speak really fast. I have no idea what’s going on in the show and I fail every test on it. 

On the other hand, I did get a 90% on my spelling test (sentences). 

I have a really strong english accent and I know that if I speak in class I’ll be judged by everyone else, so I keep quiet. Bad for my grades, again. I also can’t properly form simple sentences because my vocabulary is absolute crap and a dictionary is my best friend.

I’m going in at lunch to do bonus marks things for the interaction and reading grades. That is, if I even do well. 

Every year, the only thing I worry about is passing is French. And I worry every single day at every hour for a month after school is over till we get our grades. I get high 80s and 90s in everything else. French? Low 60s. So, I’m panicking over passing french this year just as I do every single year at this time. Any advice? Exams start next class.

25,"     My first semester was a train wreck in it's own right; I dropped a class I thought I was going to fail (though it turns out basically everyone was getting low scores and I actually would've made it to a  C at least), and then got a D in the class I thought I was going to be able to pass. My other two classes I got an A and  B in and it saved my gpa. This semester I actually started out fine. I did what I needed to do and I was actually doing pretty well and then it kind of just stopped almost two months in. It's not like I spent a ton of time hanging out or whatever either, I just end up going to the library or wherever the hell I'm studying and I just sit there and can't do anything. So I stay up late to finish and now I'm tired and can't do anything. Switching spots only worked for a day pretty much and thats it. I thought about dropping another class again, but it would put me in the part-time student range instead of full time, so I couldn't drop it. The two easier classes I was taking I got a C- and an F in and my two more difficult classes I'm probably getting another C and a D which lands me at a wonderful GPA of 1.7, 0.3 points away from keeping financial aid. If I take 2 classes instead of one at cc for this summer I think I an raise my GPA in time, but I have no idea if it would work at all.

28,"My boyfriend and I have hit a huge rough patch due to an accumulation of small, petty \(and fixable\) issues. Of course, we are talking through them and making progress day by day but we are not yet ready to fully make up. What IS NOT helping us make up is that I'll act or say irrational things due to anger, desperation and overall just sadness. I hate that we're in this situation and I've become impatient. It's foolish of me to want to rush something as delicate as the feelings of another, as well as my own feelings. 

The main issue involving my impulsive behaviors is during texting when we're apart. We usually are civil during conversations and talk throughout the day, but sometimes we have small disagreements and they turn into something WAY bigger than they should be due to both of us just escalating it. However, I've noticed that I am the one who does the most escalating because I start ending many texts that are full of anger and overall just terrible things. I don't tell him anything threatening or abusive, but I just start to tell him how angry and upset I am that we're in this situation and that I'm trying my best. Both he and I are feeling the consequences of my actions because each outburst I have obviously puts us farther from fully making up and he's one of those 'sorry doesn't mean anything' people. He feels as if apologies are meaningless because it's too late to take back words or actions. So to him, each time I say sorry becomes less and less important because I always apologize and promise to not get to upset, but I never keep that promise and its hard!

I don't get violent or say anything absolutely terrible that could ruin everything, but I just get too caught up in my feelings, you know? This only happens when I'm with him because of our current situation. I'm a very emotional person and he isn't, so it upsets him when I begin to rant about the same things and even get teary eyed. He says I do it a lot and he doesn't like seeing me cry, it upsets him a lot.

29,"Half of this post is one long vent so bear with me.      

   
 For context, my mother left me when I was a teenager and friend's family took me in, so I'm probably tolerant to a fault of the way friend is.   
   
    
   
Friend finished high school and sat around doing basically nothing but smoking weed. Their parents are disabled and cannot work, and ultimately could not keep friend around the house. Getting friend to learn to drive, get a job, or pay rent was like pulling teeth, so they kicked friend out.  
   
   
Where I used to live is a bad place to start work if you don't have a car, so friend could definitely no longer get a good start. She contacted me, and since has been at my apartment with me and my husband.   
       
   
   
***Problem #1**husband and I were leaning vegetarian, but friend complains about a lack of meat, complains about a lack of junkfood, lack of sweet drinks, etc. She told her parents we were chronically starving and they sent her $20...which she spent and ate in like two days**   
   
   
**2.**She still does not know how to drive. I paid for her driver's ed three months ago and she still isn't finished. Still relies on my husband for rides and gets huffy when he's late to pick her up/drop her off. Doubly annoying because husband and I work at night and sleep during the day, and friend's hours of availability cut into our sleep.
   
    
**3.** Friend is agender and pansexual, and insists that sometimes she feels masculine and would prefer male pronouns over female. That said, she has yet in these three months to make such a request, and forces us to refer to her as agender, even when making really general statements. Friend has started dating another pansexual agender (bio female) who prefers they/them pronouns, and prefers to be called friend's ""boyfriend."" Neither has any kind of dysphoria, both are 100% comfortable with their biologically female genitalia, and yet they are boyfriend/girlfriend. I guess it shouldn't make a difference to me, but it definitely feels like she's just trying to be different.  
   
   
**4.** Friend has a history of depression and insists she has been diagnosed with ""extreme depression,"" ""severe anxiety,"" social anxiety, etc. Also, after having known her for seven years, suddenly she was sexually abused as a child, and frankly, the way she told me was very...unconvincing. It was in the middle of a long list of her dark past and it had about as much weight as ""I went to the grocery store yesterday."" Every person she has dated (5 people) turned out to be someone who allegedly sexually abused her. She also claims her disabled (MS, frequent seizures, no use of one side of his body) father physically abused her....I used to live with them, and as far as I could tell, she was just a brat tbh.  
   
   
**5.** Speaking of seizures, friend suddenly after all this time has seizures on the regular. Apparently. I've never been witness to one, but she says she has 3-5 a week, mostly in her sleep. Any questions about her ""seizures"" reveals apparently they just result in her spacing out? And maybe twitching. Once or twice she's done this in front of me to no response from me, and spent the next ten minutes trying to goad some sort of response out of me (""What's up OP? Why are you looking at me like that? What's wrong? Did something happen?""). She also thinks she has a compromised immune system (she doesn't), and just in general complains about a lot of things that she's either faked or exaggerated.  
    
    
**6.** I have a cat with occasional urinary issues and was upfront about this with friend when she moved in. I've bought her a waterproof topper for her mattress, and have outfitted my (decently sized) closet to be a space for my cat when these issues recur and I cannot be there to watch him. I'm not really even comfortable leaving him there while I sleep, but several times I have come home unexpectedly and found that friend has done one of two things; keep him locked up for no reason, or lock him out of my room so that he won't pee on my bed but does not give him breaks to use the litterbox, which ultimately results in him urinating or stooling in the living room. My cat is a living creature, and a particularly loving and needy one at that.  
   
    
   
There's really so much more but I've already said so much...  
   
    
   
Ethically, I can't kick her out right now, as she has no family willing to take her in and she has no significant money in a high rent area. She recently got a job and is working on paying me back (she at least pays me so there's that), and I'm hoping soon she'll save up money....and then we'll see. I know a lot of people will tell me to just kick her out, but I don't wanna throw a 18 year old on the streets because she irritates me. What can I do to ""push"" her? I don't care about offending her or making her mad at me tbh",19May2018,1

33,"Hello, I'm 28 and a guy looking for some advice.

So about 4 months ago I left a very toxic abusive relationship. But I don't know how to move on from it.

I really loved her, and we were together for over 7 years. We had a house and basically working on a life together...

However, she was incredibly controlling. She had full control of my cell phone. She would not let me see my parents or brother and I couldn't have any female friends or anything. She would also spend out money until we had our credit cards maxed out, basically. And I recently found out she had been cheating on me for two years as well.

I poured my heart and soul into it, and she basically would tell me off for having anxiety issues that prevented me from keeping retail jobs. She was incredibly disgusted by my desire to return to school, which I recently have.

But my real question is how to get past this? I know what her user names are online, and I'm obsessed with looking for a post or something with some sort of remorse, but nothing ever comes up of the sort. I know I shouldn't look but I do hoping for some sort of remorse or feel bad, but I just can't find it and it's driving me crazy.

I also struggle with online dating or just trying to date in general. My confidence, my self esteem is gone. I don't seem to be able to make conversation or even just small talk. I constantly worry about letting someone get close to me again...

But the loneliness is killing me. How do you get past such a relationship and move on?",19May2018,1

39,"I’m very worried about my friend. She’s been studying abroad in Japan for the last six months. She got very distracted by clubs in Japan. She’d go out every night and drink until she couldn’t anymore. She ended up in the hospital on a few occasions. She also started hanging out with people she believed were in the yakuza. Four months in she was raped.  A few weeks later she stopped replying to my text messages, but I’d see her on social media (Instagram ,tumblr) she’d post photos of herself in clubs, well dressed. Which is very unlike her. Eventually I found out she hadn’t been talking to her boyfriend either and he was super worried about her. He said for awhile she would hit him up for money but then nothing. He only has a Facebook account so he had no idea if she was alive until I told him. He still continues to send her money even though she hasn’t been talking to him at all. It’s late May so by now I thought she’d be coming home. I think the semester ended in April. 

Two days ago she finally replied to me. She told me she wasn’t ready to come home and that she couldn’t have friends right now. She said her recovery was a solo mission. She told me she’d even cut off her therapist and that she’d been off her meds for “Days, weeks, I can’t remember.” She told me that me and her bf were strong and that we would survive without her. She said the only reason she was even talking to me was cause she was drunk. She also said a lot of other troubling things like, “I want to die alone on an island.”  
I told her she can’t recover on her own and that she needed her friends, family and therapist but she said “I do this alone or lose everything.”  
She said she’d only been posting online as a secret way of saying “I’m alive”, but she doesn’t want to answer questions about the last few weeks. She stopped replying because she said it was “too deep” of a conversation for her. Since then she hasn’t been posting online. 

I’m very worried about her and I’m not sure what to do. I’m thinking I can reach out to her family but I’m not sure if that would help since her family didn’t support her decision to go to Japan and blamed her for her rape. She still hasn’t reached out to her boyfriend. 

I want to help but I don’t know how. ",19May2018,9

My ""Plan A"" is sticking it out until I finish up school and get a job In the field im going to study for, but I may not last that long and will have to resort to a ""Plan B"".
In the event that I do decide to leave, I am sure I could get a similar job fairly quickly (previous team leads and managers have given me nothing but praise) BUT, im not so sure any new place would approve an entire week after only 2 months. This vacation took a lot of coordinating and I am unsure how long it would be before we get another chance.
Aside from that, I would need to switch my current hours to morning shift because classes would be in the evening. SO...
Plan B is the following:
Stick it out and give my notice 2 weeks before the trip and have another job lined up to start the week after the trip (with morning shift). That way I could leave a stressful workplace, go on a family trip, and begin my education in the field I want. I realize there are many things that can go wrong but this is what my brain came up with.

49,"Hello everyone,

so let me give you a bit of a background about me.

 I was circumcised at the age of 6. 

I had the top of my clitoris cut off and my clitoral hood sewn together. 

As you probably can guess, this has affected me physically and mentally. 

Mentally, I feel like less of a woman because I'm missing an essential part of my body. Physically, I can't orgasm. 

The good news is I found a doctor who performs ""Clitoroplasties"" in the United States. Yay :\)

Here is link:

 [https://marcibowers.com/procedure/](https://marcibowers.com/procedure/)

She basically cuts through the old scars and pulls out a small part of your internal clitoris to hopefully bring back sensation. I really want to get this surgery, but the hard part is saving up money to get it. I'm currently 23 years old and I'm funding myself through college so money is tight. I can't rely on my parents, or family to help me. I come from a single mother household and I pretty much help pay for bills and whatnot. 

The surgery, flight, and hotel would probably come out to cost around 2,500 to 3,000 Dollars. \(I live in Texas, and Dr. Bowers is in California\). 

A friend of mine suggested starting a Go Fund me. I've never tried to publicly raise money before. 

Would it be worth it for me to go online and start a Go Fund me?

Would people actually donate to a stranger? If so how should I go about this?

Any advice would be appreciated.",19May2018,7

Being grilled on why I never go out and do things with people or try to find a relationship tonight really pissed me off.

I'm not currently suicidal, but it hurts that I've let my life get to this.

He left me abruptly. He didn't give me a lot of information at the time. I was completely confused and heartbroken beyond belief. He was evasive in his reasons for breaking it off, gave me a lot of generic lines.. but I don't think I fit into the white picket fence future he had planned out for himself. That we was maybe embarassed I didn't fit into his lifestyle.

I hated him. For years. While of course being willing to take him back at a moment's notice. We kept some sort of distant friendship. Whenever we would see each other we would inevitably sleep together against our better judgement even if one or both of us were in a relationship.

We are still in touch. We are more friendly now than we have been since we first met. We are both in long term relationships. We live in different parts of the country. But the desire is still there. I still want him and love him.

64,"Hi everyone,

It's been about six months since our little boy died of an aggressive stage 4 high risk neuroblastoma.

We were able to let him go quietly, and without pain. We were with him from the day he was born, until the day he left us. We sat beside him when he died, holding his hands. Saying we loved him. He just went to sleep. We did everything afterwards too. Arranged his funeral, made the remembrance cards,...

Then my SO and I said we would take time to process all of this. Travel to a far away place. Finish what needed to be done in our house.

Then, three weeks after our boy's death, we found out my SO was pregnant. To soon. We haven't even started grieving properly.

And now... Now I feel this immense pressure on our relationship. I don't want it. It's driving me away. I can't look my SO straight in the eyes anymore. All I can see is that bump. I wanted to have some time to get our lives sorted. Everything just went out of the window. In a few months, we'll be caring for a helpless little human, again. No time to recharge. It' s a high risk pregnancy. Weekly checkups again. Another high dose of stress. I can't cope anymore. 

That's only part of the story. During this time, I've met someone else. By accident. We developed feelings for each other. We broke it off, mainly because I don't want to leave my SO behind. It wouldn't be right. But on the other hand I really miss the other person. We had a lot in common, were having great conversations. It was so nice to feel normal for once. But it's hitting me hard. I haven't been all right these last few weeks, and I feel like I'm on the edge of breaking down. It's 5AM as I type this. Yet another sleepless night. I'm trying to do the right thing because I'm supposed to, but it's eating me alive.  I'm seeing a therapist. He asked me if my decision to stay was rational or emotional. I said it was more rational than emotional. That baby deserves every chance. But I can' t shake the feeling that I'm once more setting aside all my needs and my happiness for someone else.

However, at the start of this year she slowly started drifting away, but proceeded to exclude me from parties, events, didn't make time for me, etc.

Now, my mental health leading up to the start of senior year was deteriorating \(anxiety and depression, both diagnosed by my psychologist\) so this exclusion from her AND our friend group really affected me. I fell into a really dark time in my life and experienced suicidal thoughts, but never actually attempted. To top it all off, she was accepted into my dream university and enrolled into my dream major \(I was accepted on a conditional offer so I sorta resented her more for that \- even though it wasn't necessarily her doing\).

Fast forward to this January; she reached out to me via text and briefly apologized for ""hurting me"". I thanked her in response and asked if she wanted to go out for lunch sometime and catch up, to which she never responded. However, last Saturday at Prom, she, for the first time in months, came up to me and asked ""Can we be friends again? Can we talk over lunch?"" Which leads us to my predicament now \- I've agreed to have lunch with her tomorrow.

I'm a much more confident person than I was at the start of this year, and my mental health has greatly improved. I'm not really looking at this heart\-to\-heart as a way to be friends again, but more so as closure for me. I'm nervous to finally talk to someone who once was so close to me and then backstabbed me, which really led me down a dark mental path that tarnished the first half of my senior year of high school.

Any advice on how to approach this conversation with her? I don't want to be mean or guilt\-trip her but I also want her to understand her actions severely affected me this year.

TLDR; best friend ostracized me this year, basically cut me off from her life and our friend group. she tells me she wants to have lunch tomorrow \(which I've agreed to\) and I'm nervous to talk to someone who hurt me greatly.",19May2018,2
69,"Hi reddit, today a girl that I know told me that she liked me. Unfortunately, I don’t but even if I would I honestly think she’s not too pretty in my opinion and that would affect my reputation with my friends and my social circle. I know this is superficial but what should I do?",19May2018,1
70,"Well as the title implies i got broken up with like 2 weeks ago and i used a dating app to try and meet another girl to talk to as friends for a while then maybe turn into a relationship. Well I’m basically finding myself falling for this new girl and i don’t know if it’s because i just really like her as a person or if she’s filling the whole that my ex left in my heart. It has given me anxiety because I’m afraid of this girl being a tool that i use to get over my breakup, which me as a person feels scummy for using people. This girl is completely different from my ex too. But basically i don’t know what to do. Any advice? ",19May2018,1
71," Hey guys I don't really know how to explain this so I'm just going to let it all out. Many years ago I was with the girl of my dreams who I loved so insanely much. Everything was going great we were like highschool sweet hearts or wtv but then I had to go away for uni and stuff just started breaking down. I know this probably sounds like every other story but I just I don't know I can't get over it and it sucks. It's been about 8 years or so and we both met other people had other relationships etc. I'm even currently in one now but I just can't feel the connection I felt back then and I don't understand why? Why am I hung up on this girl from so long ago? I tried my best to fix things the first couple of years but I could never get her back and I went insane. Last year I felt like it was behind me I knew I still had feelings but thought I could just cope with it and move on. I met someone and we hit it off pretty well but like I said I just don't feel the connection like I did with the ex. The other day she messaged me asking to meet up since we were back in the same country and ofc without even thinking I accepted (which my current gf wasn't too happy with which is understandable) we met up recently and just talked and shared stories of our lives and other SOs we've had but the whole time I just felt uncomfortable because I knew I didn't want to hear about her SOs but I also know that its perfectly normal and that Iv had SOs so I shouldn't judge. I dunno I can't shake the feeling that if she was interested to get back I'd leave my current gf in a heartbeat to get back with her and that's just fucked up because my current gf has done nothing wrong :/ I'm sorry if this is a disorganised mess I just want to let it out. I went through abit of a depressions when things first ended and I kinda just basically lived for 2 years doing absolutely fuckall just basically eating enough to keep myself alive and I really don't want to go through that again but I feel like I'm going to start slowly slipping back into it. I know she doesn't want to reconnect that way but I feel like it's something Iv wanted for so long that I don't know how to be normal and accept its not going to happen.
I feel like a jackass, I can't even post this on my actual account even tho I don't know anyone personally because I feel ashamed of my feelings. This probably makes no sense and I don't know what I'm looking for in this post I just kinda wanted someone to know how I'm feeling I guess. 

Tldr I guess: I'm fucked up emotionally ",19May2018,1

74,"Hey,
From NY. My friend claimed to need to go to the hospital. We called the ambulance because he seemed like he needed it and we thought that was the right thing to do. After a pretty severe panic attack, he claimed that he didn’t need the ambulance anymore because his panic attack was over. He was, however passing a kidney stone. But because this wasn’t his first time passing one he decided he would just pass it here. We gave him some ibuprofen and he got to it; then called the police again to tell them we didn’t need it. They told us they had already been dispatched but they’d try to stop them. They never showed up, but will the address be billed for emergency services or anything.

76,"     A little over 2 months ago, my girlfriend, let's call her Adalie, made the tough decision to breakup even though she didn't want us to.  She was going through a lot at at the moment and felt like she had lost herself and this was her last option.  This had been both of our first serious relationship, and ended up lasting a bit over a year.  We were each other's first for a lot of things, which kind of makes things a lot harder for both of us to get over memories and the whole breakup.  Adalie and I had lost ourselves during our relationship and ended up losing a lot of confidence in ourselves, and this probably lead to the breakup.  
     The night we broke up, she called me while visiting her family in another state.  She had called wanting to talk about things, but she had the idea of breaking up on her mind the whole time.  She didn't want to, but I kept on telling her that if that is what she thinks is the best option for her to continue with her life and be happy with herself again then that is the choice she should probably make.  I wasn't exactly that heartbroken that night, but the day after I was a mess.  I woke up in a sweat at about 4 in the morning crying and unable to sleep due to heart palpitations.  All I wanted was to hear her voice again and here her say that she wanted for us to get back together.  By the time I did hear her again, that day, I was in for a surprise.  She didn't want to get back together, but did seem to be doing better than I was.  I was still devastated, but I was a lot calmer after hearing her voice. We said our goodbyes and stopped talking as much.  
     Time passed on and I still had feelings for her and the she still had feelings for me, but that caused me to have false hope.  I kept talking to her in hopes that we would fall back in love and start dating eachother again, but she didn't want to go back on what she had said.  Eventually she messaged me asking if we could talk late at night, because she had taken medicine that made her scared or something, so she wanted to hear my voice and have someone to talk to.  I called her and we talked while I played games and told her about how I wanted to play the game with her.  The next day, she had told me that she was starting to have a crush on me again, and this made my world light up, temporarily.  A week later, we end up calling cuz she wanted help with coding homework and I offered to help her.  We end up talking about how if we ever were to get back together that we would have to be long distance again, since we live about 3 hours away, until we are out of college or if we move into the same college.  She took it as an ultimatum and ended up getting her hopes crushed I guess.  She stopped talking to me as much and gave up on us ever getting back together.  
     A few days later, and its my birthday.  I sit there anxious hoping that I would get a birthday message from her saying something about still caring or liking me.  I waited and waited for hours checking my phone constantly.  I was heartbroken by the time it hit 6:00PM  and I didn't hear anything from her.  I ended up throwing a fit and ended up trying to burn an old Polaroid I took of her, I failed badly at that cuz I was crying too much.  People showed up for the birthday dinner, soon after.  My friend's little brother, that I treat like a younger brother, ended up saying cheers and how much he appreciated me being in his life, which caused me to start crying a bit.  My mood was dropped and i lost my appetite.  I ended up eating almost nothing and decided to just clean the kitchen and do all the dishes instead of spending time with others.  People saw that I looked down and talked to me about how to deal with this whole breakup thing.  They told me that there are other people out there and that I deserve better, but all I could think about was how much I still loved Adalie and how much I liked about her.  I decide that i should take a break from talking to her. 
   That break ended up lasting only a few days, because I ended up sending her 2 letters about why I think the breakup occurred and how i think I could fix those mistakes in the future.  We end up talking later that weekend and I ended up finding out that she ""developed a crush for somebody"" and that she ""moved on"".  This broke my heart and I realized that I should really spend some time to move on, and I end up starting another break that lasted for about a month. The break ended shortly after I decided to get rid of everything that she gifted me and even my most prized stuffed animal ""Sir Tommy Toad"", she named it that even though I bought it when I was 6 (I'm 19 now).  When we started talking again I apologized for how desperate I acted at the start of the breakup and tried to talk to her normally.  That lasted shortly.  2-3 days later she said that we shouldn't talk for a while since ""it's still awkward and a bit painful still"".  I told her to take her time and that I don't really expect to ever hear from her since she doesn't talk to her exes at all; even though she had previously told me that she doesn't want to kick me out of her life.  
    Since then, I've been doing better, only crying in quiet corners of my school library from day to day.  Although that stopped about a week ago.  This week however, I've been waking up having dreams about her every night, which drags my mood down every morning.  I ended up ditching 2 classes this week because I didn't really feel up to taking them.  
     I don't know what to do anymore.  I still like things about her, but I've been through the whole moving on thing and even ended up trying to talk to other girls.  She's also in one of my discord chats, so I accidentally get glimpses of what she's up to, and she hasn't been acting like she usually does.  She hasn't played games like she used to and she is barely online.  She acts like she has already moved on, but I know her and I can't help but feel like this is still affecting her and that she acts tough cuz she has always wanted me to move on and find someone else. She always felt like I ""belonged with someone better"", which I heavily disagreed with.  I don't know what to do anymore to try and move forward in my life, and hence why I'm turning to a bunch of strangers on a website.  I just want to have people to talk to and hear what they have for advice on what I should do.",19May2018,1
77,"So, I recently started hanging out with a friend (16M) and I instantly fell in love with him when I met him, we've been hanging out for the past week and a half and I think I'm ready to ask him about a realtionship.

I'm not for sure what his sexuality is, but I told him ""So idk if I'm getting the wrong vibe from you, but im interested in you and want to get to know you better"" he responded with ""i feel it b and same""

Two days ago he made a comment out loud saying ""Stop being quiet before I come over there and kiss you"" and I nervously laughed and gave him a smile (im a naturally awkward and quiet person, more so when stoned)

I need advice on what to do in a really shitty situation. My father has abused and hit me all my life. I don't mean abused in the sexual sense, I mean that he has called me names, ridiculed me, belittled me, and hit me for almost all of my life. When I was younger, he would slap me and push me and pull my hair while he yelled at me. When I started to get older he kept doing it. There was a period where he stopped for a while, but then he started doing it again. He has hit me to the floor, knocked my glasses off, shoved me into walls and tables, and punched me before. The worst time he ever did something to me was last summer, the Summer of 2017. I had a drink mix called Gfuel on my table. The table was a part of my setup for my Xbox and PC. He came upstairs, with no reason whatsoever and saw the Gfuel. He got extremely angry when he saw it, storming into the room and flipping the table that had my setup on it over. He then proceeded to hit me while I was in the chair, throw me out of the chair, slap me while I was on the ground, and then he took a switchblade that I had on the table, opened it, and held it to my throat, asking me if I knew it was dangerous and could kill someone, and telling me he could kill me right there. The only thing that stopped him from doing that was himself, not anybody else. The other night, I got drunk, because some shit has gone on recently with a girl that really messed me up. He called me upstairs(im now living at my grandmas house, he is too because he's in recovery from cancer and surgery) and he hears me on FaceTime, so he gets mad. He starts getting really pissed off and then tells me to go get my iPad. I go and get my iPad and while I was down there, I put the bottle away. He hears the clinking, according to him, and then gets angry at the top of the stairs. He then proceeds to slap me so hard that my entire body gets moved over, three times in a row. Mind you, I wasn't drunk drunk, just tipsy. So there wasn't any misconception about how hard he hit me or how many times. Today, the morning after this happened, I called DCFS when I got home, and I spoke to the CPS lady on the phone. I told her everything and she said they're opening an investigation into it. Did I make a mistake? Should I have called them? Or told the lady?",19May2018,3

This means I have urges of wanting to be in a girls body and have boobs, a vagina, etc. and be able to wear girly underwear, skirts, dresses, etc. This urge is so hard to defeat because of the obsession i have towards it. The thing is I want to be able to go my days being normal and just being a regular dude you know. But some days i just put down whatever work im doing, call out sick from work, skip class, whatever i have to do to dedicate my day to focusing on my urges of being a woman.

81,"Disclaimer:Everything I am about to explain, I am going to be vague as hell, specifically to prevent witch\-hunting. I will do my best to explain what the problem is, asking if anyone could help me solve it, though, to be quite honest, I should have prevented, avoided, and therefore, resolved this issue before it ever got this far, and I mean a \*long\* time ago. Anyone asking for specific details would have to ask in person, and even then, you would have to know a little more than I explain here. The problem I describe, anyone involved, and my placement in it, just remember the following: This is my doing, no one else. Anyone who web searches my name, laugh it off as much as you want, I am still looking for advice, even if the answer is plain and simple and I am just a bumbling idiot. If this thread gets removed, I will try 1 other subreddit. If it gets shot down there, too, then I will have to start searching elsewhere. Sooner or later, I will have to find out a working solution to the problem.

I know how depressing this is going to sound. This is going to be a long read. Let's get it on.

The problem, simply put, is my inability to be competitive, in any way, shape, or form. Plenty have asked me about this, shortly turning on me because they did not agree, in whatever way. ...I do not blame them at all. The issue at hand is simply being unable to stand up to anyone or anything, no matter how much time I put into whatever the task in question happens to be. As I had explained, time and time again, it does not matter how much time I put into it. It does not matter how hard I try. It does not matter what angle I attempt to tackle from. Heck, it does not even matter what the scouter says about my power level. I constantly anger people, as a result. At the same time, some tend to wonder why I spend most of my time out of sight, if not all of it. They are capable of everything, I am not. How strange, they can help themselves, but I cannot. This is basically the opposite of Batman, as even \*he\* can help himself out of every situation, though as of late, they seem to make it seem otherwise. This is less about what I am trying to do, because I could name a bunch, more that everyone is capable of making something of it, while I cannot make \*anything\* of it. First, we should get some facts out of the way. ...Well, what \*I\* believe to be factual, anyway.

I have to obtain enough information to do what I need to do, though even \*this\* does not prevent me from failing to do what I am supposed to do in the first place.

Okay, time for an FAQ.

Q: This sounds like you are being ignorant.

A: Ignorant. Uncaring. Unwilling to listen, unwilling to change. I could try, 100 different ways, to prove you wrong, but it would never work, would it? Well, I would be lying by claiming otherwise, so you are absolutely right. Granted, that will not stop me from trying.

Q: You could just...give up...and DO SOMETHING ELSE!

A: See, this is where the problem lies. I am trying to rise above being a filthy casual, a joke, meaningless and useless. I am trying to succeed. ...Trying. Just the problem, right? Trying, not succeeding, only trying and failing miserably. Not getting things done the first time is what \*landed\* me here.

Q: You know, you should focus less on making mistakes. No, really, it would not hurt to actually try your hardest.

A: I \*am\*. The problem is that, again, I am incapable. I simply do not have the capacity everyone else has, only 1/2. I only do things 1/2\-correct. I am trying to find a solution to this, something to compensate for my inability to be the same as everyone else.

Q: Maybe ask for help! Maybe get out there and make a name for yourself! Maybe stop hiding like you said, a minute ago!

A: I \*did\*, I failed, and I cannot. I asked around a little. Hell, I \*still\* ask around. I usually give proof to get more information, proof that I am not playing around. They always tell me I am not trying, or that I am not trying hard enough. They said \*I\* am the only one capable of solving this problem. I am incapable of proving that. Also, the \*last\* thing I want to do is get heavily involved in \*any\* community, since I am poisonous. Explaining this got a few more to turn on me, too, so if you believe you will not, I can explain that in person, though it \*will\* be depressing and it \*will\* drag on. Not out here.

Q: If you give me a video as an example, how am I supposed to believe you are not playing around, or that you are actually trying? There's no point in going the distance for information if you're not even going to \*use\* it properly, like everyone else! Get the hell \*out\* of here!

A: What do you think I am trying to solve? There is some important detail, something that everyone is spelling out to me, that I still cannot see. I have to find a way to prove I am trying. The problem is that they think I am the same as them, when I am \*not\*. They think I am just as capable as they are, that I could stand among them if I try hard enough. The problem is that I am \*not\* the same as them, I have tried, I am \*still\* trying, and I am not succeeding. This is a matter of them having talent I do not, the talent that separates me, a filthy casual, from them, legitimate competitors.

Q: Okay, first, you are not trying hard enough, so save the BS. Second, you are \*just\* as capable as they are, so quit your whining and get lost. Third, drop the ""talent"" thing, this has nothing to do with talent, everything to do with you not giving it your all like everyone else. Fourth, if I have to hear you say ""filthy casual"" one more f\*\*\*ing time...

A: I get that a lot. No matter how much content I throw out there, in an attempt to be competitive, I am still a joke. The information I obtain from individuals, in discreet, and I am \*still\* not making it work? They have \*every\* reason to think I have given up, every reason to just leave me be. If I were as capable as \*they\* were, I would have gotten it right the \*first\* time, and just by watching, not scrounging around for information. Even worse, I do not quite understand some of the information I come across, which \*also\* sounds like BS, so I do not blame you \*at all\*. If this was not a matter of talent, I would have succeeded, not found myself asking for advice \*here\*...or \*anywhere\*. \*That\*, alone, makes me a filthy casual.

Q: Awww, does the wittle baby want his bottle? How about I PUT IT WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE!

A: I get that a lot, too. That is why I do my best to stick to the main objectives. The problem is that, even avoiding the meta\-details, that is exactly what it comes down to, and I have just the screenshots for that, if you want in.

Q: ...You know what? I think it's time we straightened this up. You say you cannot do jack s\*\*\*, but you are still trying. You hide around, asking people individually for details. You get the details, you record videos, they still think you're not trying, so you basically aren't even helping yourself. You separate yourself from everyone to avoid being ""poisonous"", and all you could say for yourself is some redundant s\*\*\* like ""I don't have the talent."" Experiment 145 complete. Congratulations, you're an anti\-social introvert with a depressive attitude on life! Trust issues are to the max, and you're too lazy to break out of it. NEEEEEEEEEEXT!

A: Yeah, I get that, too, and since I cannot prove you wrong, you are absolutely correct. The problem is that I am trying to fight such facts. This is not about by social standing, disabilities, if any, or what I can or cannot do, though clearly, I am incapable of anything beyond sea level casual, if not 50000 leagues lower. I just want to prove I am capable of a little more, even if just 1/2. The problem is no one else but me. I am sure the details I am missing are somewhere out there. I have to keep trying. I just have to gain enough information to stop myself from ramming my head into a brick wall. I get the information I need, I should be able to do what everyone else can, even if by 1/2.

Q: You know, I'm havi\-\-\- I'm having a \*very\* tough time believing you, or \*any\* BS projectile spewing out of your a\*\*. You say you haven't given up, but in actuality, you haven't tried anything worth s\*\*\*! You \*clearly\* don't give a damn, you are \*wasting\* everyone's time, I \*completely\* understand why you don't fit in anywhere or with anyone! You don't put in the effort. No, NO!!!! Don't feed me anymore crap! LALALALAAAAA, you're just looking for some place to cry, LALALALAAAAA! Look, you wanna know what that detail is? The detail is YOU!!! Get the hell out of my sight, go sweep the streets in Pittsburgh, for all I care! I don't care about whatever results you make in 5 seconds, it ain't worth nothin'! You wanna belong so badly, TRY!!!! Be a \*real\* person! ...Or, better yet, get the hell out of my sight and go live your life before you throw it all away trying to be meaningful to a colony of ants more productive than you could \*ever\* make yourself sound! Goodbye!

A: ...and this is just the problem, is it not? This is why I have to keep trying, why I have to, as any would put it, waste time on the issue. If I could not be anywhere near competitive on even a molecular level, how could I \*ever\* expect to survive anywhere else, doing any \*thing\* else? This is why I am trying to find out what the problem is. Time and time again, they keep telling me the problem is me, and that, therefore, the \*solution\* is me. Have I ever been able to prove that? No. They keep telling me to stop trying to prove anyone wrong and do my own thing, to go look for hobbies. I \*have\* hobbies, but I also have a very tough time thinking about much else than my inability to compete, much less belong to more than a freezer full of meat. I may prove myself useful, from time to time, but I doubt even Jigsaw could torture me enough into either sticking to being a filthy casual or being as competitive as anyone else. \(#LordMoldybutt\) I am \*trying\* to help myself, but I sure as \*hell\* itself am not succeeding. I have to find out what those details are, and sooner than I would rot and melt into the ground while the planet continues to spin. This is far less about a glorified sob story, more about what I could \*possibly\* be missing which would help me finally stand among the best, and hopefully surpass them and maintain it. In the end, there is less meaning in me being a Jack of All Trades and a master of none, even less in trying to belong somewhere besides at home base, and \*far\* less about attempting to impress anyone, because I have to be able to do a little more than be buried beneath the guy who does tutorials, non\-existent to the guy at the top. I have to be capable of not only being able to teach, which is an \*entirely\* different story, but also being completely correct, as most teachers and professors often are. How could I possibly look into \*any\* of that when I am incapable of being competitive? I am not even \*discussing\* how I want to make my own ends meet, \*that\* is how huge \*I\* find this problem to be. You think I am just a joke? I do not blame you. Walk away from me? Leave me to die? No one stopping you. The only things I could offer in return would be serverawful arbitrary. All I am looking for is a solution, quite possibly a solution I have been overlooking. I want to say the solution is what everyone had spelled out before this point, but there is no way in hell I could make it work, which is why I am here. It would only be the same thing, it would only be back to square 1.

82,"My boyfriend is signed in on my wickr on his phone and he’s been receiving sex messages from this guy that claims I gave it to him in February. I didn’t and if I had I would of told him because I always feel super guilty when I don’t tell him the 100% truth. 

My wickr name is really basic and I tried telling him that someone might have just put it as a scammer or something, but he’s still suspicious. I don’t know how to make him believe me. 

We’ve been together three years and have lived together for most of that time also. I feel like he should know when I’m telling the truth or not, but I don’t know. He says I’m getting really defensive about the situation and I am because I don’t want something I didn’t do to ruin what we have.

83,"A little bit of background: I'm a Christian, this guy was an atheist when I met him. I'm excluding a lot of personal details, but long story short is that I started discussing worldview with him. I tried to strike a balance between advocating for my own beliefs and being open to the idea that I could be wrong. I now have a very different view of Christianity than when the conversation started, but I am still a Christian. Meanwhile he's drifting closer to agnosticism and theism, but it feels like he deeply holds something against Christianity which I don't understand. So instead he's getting into Buddhism. It's funny, because he actually said that I was basically a kind of moral teacher for him, and that's what inspired him to get into Buddhism, when at most 25&amp;#37; of my personal philosophy is inspired by Buddhism. I've spent months talking about how Jesus changes my life, and yet he thinks the best way to achieve morals like mine is to go for Buddhism. It confuses me and makes me wonder why he's so resistant to Christianity, as he has been presented with some pretty good historical evidence for Christianity, and almost became a Christian already because of it. 

That was kind of my free therapy for the week, lol. Onto the main issue I'm dealing with: I want to be happy for him and the peace he says he's achieving through Buddhism, but I quite literally get this sinking feeling and pit in my stomach whenever he talks about it. I don't want the feeling, and it's not due to a mental illness, I assure you. I think it's because I don't see him being rational about it. He applies extremely rigorous philosophical standards when it comes to Christianity, but if I try to engage him on Buddhism or meditation, he uses spiritual/feely, or specious reasons to justify it. I have tried to just present facts and objective reasoning to caution him to at least *slow down* with the eastern stuff, but he does not engage with me on an objective level, and it feels like he's actually started to try to hide his interest in Buddhism from me. Earlier this year, he expressed a strong fear of hallucinating due to a bad trip, and when I presented factual evidence \(trust me that I have some good, factual reasons\) that an intense meditation retreat could very likely cause hallucinations, it did not even make him pause to reconsider. He responded with spiritual language \(""True reality is spiritual reality""\) and tried to justify hallucinations from meditation with reasons that did not sound like his nomal rational self. I would have expected him to at least be slightly nervous, or to find reasons why meditation *doesn't* generally cause hallucinations, but he nope, he immediately went straight to justifying hallucinations from meditation, despite his intense fear of hallucinating?

He says this Buddhism is bringing him peace, clarity, and tranquility. We all have spiritual needs, I get it, so I have tried very hard to respect that and not dissuade him from Buddhism or meditation as a whole. Heck, I meditate and read Buddhist philosophy sometimes. But I still have a hard time feeling happy for him, and I really want to be happy for him. It just doesn't feel rational and it doesn't feel right, and I can't really explain why. Call me religously intolerant and close\-minded, I don't care. I know I've done everything I can to be open\-minded and I just want to be happy for him, so I'm happy to hear any advice you might have.",19May2018,1

86,"Recently I’ve noticed something, I’m not sure what to make of it. Since I was young I’ve had a very harsh childhood. I’ve always had to take care of myself. My childhood was taken away from me by my parents. I developed extreme depression and social anxiety and selective mutism. I physically mentally and emotionally shut down for 10 years. It’s been 1 year since the depression and social anxiety ended and I’m way better. I’m 19 btw. 

Before, when I tried to talk about it I would burst out in tears within seconds and my words wouldn’t come out, not how I would mean them to anyway. 

A few days ago I tried to talk about it with my grandma and at first it was going really good but then as I got more in depth into it my voice started to crack but then it went to normal once I paused. I kept going and I could feel my throat closing up but I kept going and then I just couldn’t keep going and quickly walked to my room and i burst out in tears. 

The strange thing I noticed? Well I’ve talked about it so many times with complete strangers and this never happens. It’s only when people who were there when it happened (my dad was there when I was telling grandma) 

So by this happening only when people who caused it would lead me to believe I’m not over it but then I’m not like this with strangers.. and for a long time I thought I was over it..

96,"I don't really check Reddit often, so I don't really know how this works, but I guess I'll get straight into it.

So I've been friends with this person for around 6 years now?(I'm 17, and so is my friend btw haha) It may have been longer, but that's not too important. 

She's basically the first friend I ever really got and she's been hanging out almost everyday with me, so we got really close and I know a lot of her problems. She suffers from anxiety I believe and I'm not sure if her mom abuses her. When she gets an exam she studies her ass off to make sure to get more than 80 because or else her mom will slap her. Once she cried because she got a 74 too. She told her mom that she might want to go in printing and then her mom started talking about ""that's what happens when you hang out with stupid people"" and to go for something with a high degree like a doctor. Her mom also somehow convinced her that hitting your child is legal in Canada?She doesn't get fed that much since nobody in her family knows how to cook.Last year she fainted from lack of protein at school too, but I didn't see anything change in her lunches.

I USED to occasionnaly give her my lunches because she really likes them, but now I exchange her lunches for mine because I feel like I need to do something to better her health. Once I had a period where I couldn't sleep much because I kept stressing about her situation, and ended up bruising my eye because I kept rubbing it to dry my tears. She's quite childish, so she gets mad against me easily. She orders me around a lot too, for doing simple things like buying chips at the vending machine, putting her lunchbox back in her locker,etc. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people asking for help on things they can do themselves, but for some reason, I end up doing her tasks. She's also a neat freak, so whenever a table had a crumb we'd need to change tables, if I made a mess I'd have to clean it up, if a bug flies above her food she gets disgusted and ends up not wanting to eat. She's extremely picky about her food. She never eats the part of the sandwiches where there's no meat, she hates chewy meat, she doesn't like many fruits(doesn't help that she's allergic to many of them) and tends to remove the veggies off the meals I give her. When I try to make her eat it for her health, she starts whining and making some weird hissing noise. It really angers me too, because I grew up with my parents always telling me to never waste food, be grateful for what we have. Sometimes she'd crave for some cappuccino or some other food randomly and start getting moody because we can't procure it. Whenever she wants to ask something to a teacher, I have to go with her, or else she ends up not doing it at all. She's still afraid of walking on her own, or basically doing anything on her own, so whenever she wants to skip school or go somewhere, she tries to drag me with her. Of course I try to keep my cool, but sometimes I can't help but explode and I start kinda bullying her for a few minutes. Afterwards I feel extremely guilty of course, but to her, fights are like it never happened so I feel kind of...mad? That she doesn't feel like it was anything important. I'd feel much better if she was also mad at me.

These days I've  been wanting to end my friendship with her.
I'm her only close friend so I feel as though, if I end my friendship with her, something terrible will happen, but I feel like this relationship is hurting me. She often says that if I died before. She shares a lot of hobbies and interests with me, we got the same type of humor,etc. 

I'd really like to know how to make this relationship better.",19May2018,1

I was talking to my partner, someone ive been with for a few years and hopefully plan to marry. 

They know the problems ive had with birth control. (Depression to the point of thoughts of suicide, 50\+ weight gain, migraines, acne, mood swings, copper sensitivity, increased appetite only to switch and then have no appetite whatsoever. )

I told them I didnt want to be on BC forever, and asked if he would be willing to get a Vasectomy. (Just a suggestion/possible path we could take in the future);

He said no; Absolutely not.

 seeing as I would probably have to take birth control of some form until I hit menopause (which could be around 50) and this is just what 3 years has done to me, it’s scary. And in my opinion unfair. We both benefit from sex. And I’m taking the brunt of all of the negative side effects. 

Am i wrong for being upset? Ive only been on birth control for 3 years and my body and emotions have fluctuated so heavily, and that plus potentially having children someday and the stress that my body will be under. 

Is it unfair to him that I even got upset at all? I feel that the most upsetting part was him shutting the idea down entirely without even saying he would consider my side. I dont know. All i know is that my body wasnt made for birth control.",19May2018,2
105,"Let me start off by saying I’m 14 yrs old and my sister was sent to foster care because of what I’m about to get in to. The court is involved as well as cps. I’m able to get into foster care but I’m hesitant. If you just want to know what he did without long explanations I made a short summary below.

SHORT SUMMARY.
My father has sexually assaulted me. He kissed me several times putting his tongue in my mouth, touched my buttocks with the intention of having sex, slapped my buttocks, and did other things like pulling my underwear up to see it. I told my mom but she doesn’t want to kick him out even though my sister left to foster care because of him. I’m thinking about leaving to foster care but I don’t know if it will turn out okay. I love my pets, I love my mom (dispite what she’s doing), I’m nervous about what will happen when I’m out of the system, and lastly what if foster care is worse then the situation I’m in now? I’m really considering leaving but these things are holding me back. Advice would be appreciated. Thank you. I’ll update if I can.

Edit: I’m going to repost this to different communities so I can get quicker answers. Sorry if you happen to see this more then once.

Below are details to my situation. They are quite long though. And they are listed in chronological order.
 
The beginning.
It all started when I was 5 to 7 years old. My biological father inappropriately kissed me. It wasn’t even a kiss. He.. made out with me. I was uncomfortable. I don’t know why I didn’t tell my mom or say “stop.” But I just kinda backed up and away from him. This happened twice and I just thought “well this is what parents do.”

The worst thing that he ever did.
I always used to sleep in my parents bedroom because I was afraid of the dark. (I slept in their bed until I was 11. I know that’s awhile) almost every other day they would have sex where I was around them. That was a poor choice in my opinion. I believe that’s what caused me to begin understanding what sex was even when I was 3-4. In my parents defense they did try many times to take me out of the bedroom when I was sleeping there but I was so afraid of the dark I would go back. I never brought it up to them that I could hear them. So when I was 7 to 8 I was sleeping unlike  usual I was sleeping between my parents. My father was drunk. In his words he “thought I was Mom.” I woke up to him slowly placing his hand down from my lower back to my buttocks. This was the most traumatic. Because I don’t know if his penis touched me or not. It was unusually smooth compared to the texture of a hand. I was so scared..I realized if I didn’t act he might continue further. He was behind me so I ended up kicking him of me multiple times with a lot of force. I also made a complaining/angry sound. (Like the one you hear from a kid who doesn’t get the toy they want but they don’t actually scream.) he then took whatever it was out from my underwear/pants. This is what caused me to be extremely uncomfortable kissing, hugging, and sitting around him for years to come. The next morning he said “*my name* I’m sorry I-uhh thought you were Mom. I was- drunk.” My Mom was present. She either heard me kick and complain or he told her. (I don’t know if he downplayed it or not.)

He continued.
Yes I understand that parents/family from other countries do other things like for ex a mom telling her older daughter “you look so sexy in that dress!” (Or lightly) “the boys are gonna be all over you!” or (in some cases) hit each others butts?? (That is just weird I don’t know why. Kind of like how coaches dismiss their team.) anyway I was never introduced/seen this in my family. Until.. one day. (Bear in mind I didn’t know the difference between leggings and tights when I was 10-11. Stupid I know. But these particular tights were very thick winter tights for cold days with dresses. So they actually covered a lot more then you’d expect.) one day I decided to wear just these tights around the house. When I came to get dinner nobody minded. Until my slightly drunk father saw me.. jokingly he made a disappointed sound like “ehh!” And slapped my buttocks. I was taken aback by this. I literally hissed and yelled at him “HEY!” With an angry expression. This definitely means a hard no. He backed off and ignored it.

Lastly this year.
My sister is in foster care because she said my dad used to kiss her inappropriately. But she left mostly because of my parents alcoholism. I read the accusations. I wanted to believe “my dad was just joking around and he didn’t know I wasn’t Mom” I lied to myself so much that I believed it. Till now.
A few months ago he did it again. Not as bad but this just made me realized. This is fucked up. What happened was not a joke or mistake. He did this on purpose. One day DURNING HIS COURTCASE AGAINST MY SISTER. I was behind my mom sitting on the couch watching tv. He walked up behind me and lifted my underwear up to see it. I was shocked. I quickly turned around and shot him an angry look. I walked around to sit on the closest couch beside my mom.

My mom isn’t ignorant to all this..
On April 19 this year I told my mom. This was 2 weeks after he looked at my underwear. I told her everything. I cried a lot. And I was worried she would not believe me. She did. She was super supportive. I trusted her... and not a day later I realized she still wants to be with him.. I brought it up one day in the car. “What are we gonna do now? I don’t want him to pick me up. He makes me super uncomfortable.” My mom said “I’ll tell him to leave you alone. It’s going to take time!” I said “But Mom  it’s hard to do. I feel like I’m betraying *insert my sisters name* for not doing anything..” my mom then said “ *insert my name*! It’s going to take awhile!.. you can move out when you 18.” I took a while to get it out. “What do you mean 18.. I can’t wait that long. I can’t stay like this! I told you because I don’t want to go to fostercare!” My Mom: “WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO. I HAVE A JOB. YOUR FATHER HAS EVERYTHING UNDER HIS NAME.” Me: “HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE? I CAN’T WAIT ANY LONGER. I FEEL UNSAFE AROUND HIM. HE DROVE AWAY *my sister* AND *my brother* DO YOU CARE?” My mom “then what.. WHAT DO WE DO. If they know he’s going to jail!” Me “then I won’t say anything! Why can’t you just tell him to move out! We can’t just have him here!” My mom “HE WILL BECOME HOMELESS.” Me “YOU’RE ASKING ME TO WAIT 4 YEARS TO BECOME COMFORTABLE? I FEEL LIKE YOU DONT CARE. CAN JUST GO TO FOSTER CARE AND WAIT UNTIL HE MOVES OUT AND EVERYTHING IS SOLVED.” My Mom “then what are you supposed to tell cps huh?” Me “Mom.. I can’t wait anymore I don’t think it can last two more weeks.” My mom “okay. I’ll tell him to move out on Sunday. OKAY. Don’t push me! I only learned yesterday!” It didn’t happen.. then a week later she told my dad and we all ‘talked’. He denied everything. He pitied himself. He mocked me jokingly.

My mom now is on his side. Here’s her excuses.
I talked to my mom 1 week ago. She convinced me that “when you leave foster care at 18 then what? They [refering to my sisters foster parents] won’t help you! Their job IS DONE.” I’m scared that when I leave I won’t know what to do. She also said “he said it was a mistake. He comes from a different country.” I told her “parents don’t do that. No country EVER treats their kids this way” my mom also said “It happened a long time ago. You may remember it differently.” I said “I remember it clearly. I always told myself it was normal but it’s not.” My Mom “Why didn’t you tell him no?” Me “I didn’t say no because my actions clearly showed that his actions made me unhappy.”

What’s going on now?
I’m still with my parents. My dad hasn’t left. I try bringing it up but my mom either changes the subject constantly, gets irritated and defends my dad, or shakes her head and leaves. The only change is that I try to avoid my dad as much as possible and respond to him only if I feel like there’s no other choice. I also keep my responses short. He tries to interact with me even though I only respond coldly. But I feel it’s important to say the only things keeping me back from leaving is my pets (they are my family I love them.), my mom (I love my mom. When I’m around her she feels like how a parent should be like. Loving, caring, funny, supportive, etc. I really up til this point feel like she has been what a parent should be.), my future (I feel like when I’m out of foster care. There’s nobody who’s gonna support me.), the people (will the people be better or worse), school and friends, (my friends treat me like family. They are just amazing human beings with big hearts.), my other family (great people. especially my grandfather who I just met. My grandma.. she’s a wonderful person. My other grandmother is also amazing.)",19May2018,22

I'm tired, every social experience is come to zero, i don't have time for my friends, or a relationship. Just work and work. I got some issues with my lungs, my left lung collapsed , 25% of it. I'm okay, but not feel well, i got something like PTSD. Nothing is like it was before the hospital, i feel like i am an empty vessel that half dead half alive.  After the hospital, i decided take changes in my life, but this few week destroyed it, doctors said i am able to work, i work but i can't stand that much now, i'm only capable of 5-6 hours in my workplace after that i feel i'm out of controll, i feel i can't breath.

I want to be like i was before, but it feels like it never going to happen. I want change, i decided if i get up, i will help others in medical services. My only hope is that .

After i was out of service, i felt that i lost everything, my purposes, etc. What to do? Have you ever been in this situation? When you felt like you are destroyed, burned out?

If my boyfriend says he’s going to get home at 6, and he doesn’t get home till 6:30 I flip the fuck out.

I don’t think they’re cheating, just, I just anticipate their arrival and when it’s delayed I get scared that I don’t know when I’ll see them again.

It’s like, not knowing when I’m going to speak to them scares me.

And because of this, if I say, live with my boyfriend I can’t sleep if he’s out of the house. I literally can’t.

I think I have abandonment issues, but to the extreme as I get self-harmy. I don’t want to control anyone, I just can’t handle the feeling of not knowing when I can see this person I care about.

112,"Alright so I need some advice on what to do because I’m currently in a very difficult situation. I’m going to give a little back story first so you can try to understand the situation first then you can help with some advice.

In sophomore year of High school I met this girl in math class(I’m currently a junior in college). She sat next to me and as soon as we stared talking we seemed to hit it off. We almost instantly became best friends, texting almost every day and hanging out whenever possible. It only took me a couple months to realize that I had feelings for her. At first it was just a tiny little crush and I thought I’d get over it. Boy was I wrong. As a couple years passed by and the more we would talk/hang out, I came to realization that damn I might be in love with this girl. During this time she dated a few people, each lasting no longer than a few months, but of course I started to get upset like damn why not me. 

So long story short, I’ve pretty much been in love for about 3 years (I think she may know but I’m not 100% sure.) My problem is, I feel like nothing will ever happen, but the more I hang out with her and talk to her, the feelings will get stronger just never go away. I cherish our friendship dearly and I don’t think I can just stop being friends with her. Do you suggest that I maybe talk to her? Maybe just take some time off from not seeing her to see if these feelings go away? Or am I just pathetic and I should just man up and give up?

113,"Hey,

me and my girlfriend planned a trip to Austria. We are checked in to the flight and a few hotels are already payed for.

But for a variety of reasons I'm really stressed about this flight.

It's a good company and two good modern airports.

I've flown before usually with no problem. But I just feel so stressed. The last flight I've been on I was sure was gonna crash just because it was a small airline I read some bad things about. This time I took a good airlines as a compromise.

I'm stressed because of other unrelated things and maybe it's forming itself like this. It's also the last flight I've been on which to me was a pretty scary experience. And the fact that I'm in Israel and the country is on brink of a war. Also I wasnt sure I want to spend this money right now but my girlfriend convinced me. We fought yesterday and that sucks too. 

I'm not religious whatsoever but I just keep seeing ""signs"". Like mentions of flight crashes everywhere. I told myself that if today I see that something is off in ANY kind of way I'm not making this flight. Well the news say they closed some lanes in the airport. And A just plane crashed in the other side of the world!

I really don't know what to make on it. Of course the changes that anything will happen are slim but I'm going to be stressed the whole flight and the whole trip until the flight back.

If I'm not showing I'm throwing a maximum of 1000$. 

Am I overreacting? Would it be insane to drop this whole trip because of those reasons? ",19May2018,1
114,"So, I work at a company that has 2 main campuses and several smaller sites spread out over a decent part of the county. Seriously, the place is huge.  My supervisor is part of the volunteer fire department that supports any incidents at our company. He is the Incident Commander at our site and he seems to enjoy it.  You still have your main job, but if there is an emergency you automatically report to the Chief and not your management for the duration of the situation. There is a lot of training but they really take care of the volunteer fire fighters. You get all the gear: suit, oxygen tank, helmet, jacket, emergency radio for both fire and security, and access to all buildings regardless of security level. This company and their fire department have such an amazing history and I want to be a part of it. I grew up around this company considering my whole family has 28-30 years there. There’s nothing I wanted more than to work here. I’m a coordinator at their distribution center. Now that I’ve become comfortable in my job, I want more. I want to be able to help a coworker that may be in need. Or help another department that has an emergency. But my fiancé will not give her blessings to me being a volunteer firefighter. The number of emergencies is low, but it does happen. The crew is a great group of very dedicated people and there has never been a fatality that I’ve heard of. How can I bring this up to her to try and win her blessing? I know she’s worried about what could happen, but I really want to do this and I feel like it would be a great growth opportunity. But, I also don’t want to put stress on our relationship by doing it without her acceptance.

115,"Every friday night for 12 years, my dad, some high school friends and I have played video games together. We started playing overwatch and were having a great time until my cousin joined us. He plays selfishly (in a heavily team based game) and wants everyone to pick around what he wants to play or else he gets pouty.  That video game night is, for me the one time I get to throw all my cares right out the window and just have fun, but when he is there, I have to either talk everyone else into working around him, or try to tell him how to help the team better, after which he makes changes and goes silent, pouty, and complains he doesn’t feel like he is doing anything, and isn’t having fun.

He’s basically a toxic whiny kid who wants it his way or else he will make it miserable for everyone else.

Should I talk to him personally, leave the group, or maybe talk to the group as a whole? Up to this point I have made excuses that I won’t play sometimes because “I’m too stressed out” or “I’m not in the mood”, but it emotionally feels wrong.

If I choose to just not care as much about winning or losing, then I get to the end of the night feeling like I didn’t accomplish anything or have any fun. I can have fun even with losing, but having a team member whining about how a loss wasn’t his fault when it obviously was a huge obvious factor, and being forced to work around him for “high-school-drama-esque” reasons, is exhausting.

I’m starting back to college at a bigger university this fall and I have no idea how I’m going to pay for it unless I take out a student loan which I have no idea how to apply for. I’m almost 23 and I’m finally looking for my first job but no one wants to hire me. I’ve always been afraid of getting a job but I recently had a break up that left me heart broken and the fear, all of the advancements I’ve taken and the rush that comes with it is the only thing that’s managed to distract me from it and how lonely I’ve been feeling. My mother and grandmother raised me by themselves and they’re incompetent and bad role models. Every time I tell them I’m unhappy or try to move forward with my life they make themselves obstacles, acting out taking my sadness personally and ultimately leaving me to comfort them. They won’t help me or themselves. What few “friends” I have ignore me and when I bother getting a response it’s one word replies and it makes me feel embarrassed and ashamed for bothering to try and start a conversation. I know that life is a labor and that life is suffering but I’m tired. I’m tired of worrying about money, I’m tired of feeling lonely, I’m tired of being more responsible than my mother and grandmother but not having the financial control over my own self to do anything about it or to have them respect a word I say as a man.

120,"I don’t know if I have OCD or something else, but I overthinking to many things, it gets to the point where it’s films and video games, to making sure a shopping cart doesn’t drift off, my favorite things a child where films and video games but as I have grown older, 21 now, ever since I graduated, I started overthinking things too much, please hear me out, my favorite genre of movies has always been superhero films, and Played spider man games on ps2 and for Xbox was always call of duty, soccer is my favorite sport, so as these were my favorite hobbies, movies started to die down for me in 2012, as last movie I was excited for was the dark knight, and last time I played a video game was in 2011-12 but then I stopped because my Xbox broke and then video games stopped for me, so the only thing left was just soccer, and watching my favorite team fc barcelona, but last year in July I stopped playing soccer because I got sick and tire of people bossing me around, telling me what to do, and would get in to arguments, so I just stopped playing soccer, and in October of last year I stopped watching fc barcelona, because my favorite  player messi who Argentine was playing against Ecuador in a crucial match for qualifying for the World Cup, and it’s obvious the referee favored him so he can make to the World Cup, so FIFA doesn’t lose millions of dollars, and that disappointed  me a lot because he was the reason I watched soccer. So my point is that I’ve tried getting into watching superhero movies again but they just work for me at all anymore, I get very sleepy when I’m either home or at the theatre, and I think it’s mainly because they’re not my type of superhero movies like the original spider man movies which I love dearly and also Christopher Nolan’s Batman films, so since those films aren’t being made anymore and with that same type of tone and they’re my two favorite superheroes I don’t enjoy that genre anymore, so I’m trying to watch other types of films which I have always have but I’m trying to be more open minded, I coincidentally stopped playing video games in 2012 right when the last good call of duty came out, I’ve tried looking into other video games and also the new call of duty games but they are just horrible other games that have played don’t catch my attention, so I’m passed playing video games already, I tried playing soccer again, but the same thing keeps happening when I go play a pick up game at the park. It’s really hard for me to keep myself busy and do something fun, I have a license but no car, I only have one friend, who doesn’t drive because he doesn’t have a license, so I’m trying to figure out ways to distract myself with the limited amount of resources I have, I pretty much get off work and go home and just use my phone all day long, and on my days off I just stay at home all day and use my phone, I’ve gone to Barnes and nobles countless times to find a book that interest me but non have caught my attention, I was going to read spider man comics but the stories got spoiled because I saw what happens, same thing trying to read Batman and Superman, all because I was trying to find the correct order in which to read them, I ran into spoilers.

121,"My boyfriend did really well on his tests, and I couldn't be more proud of him. 

However, later the same day he told me, I was ranting about traits that annoy me, such as cockiness. He then teased that he knew I didn't like him, and that he was cocky because he shared his scores with everyone in his contacts. Once I got upset (I'll explain why below), he claimed that he was kidding, and that he hadn't actually done that.

I was pretty hurt, and not just because that IS obnoxiously cocky. 

My last relationship was really toxic. He cheated on me, and when we weren't together in person, he always texted me shit he only sent to other people, and that really fucked with me. 

Fast forward to me waking up at 2 am and apologizing on snapchat for getting upset. I see our streak is about to end, so I decide to log into his account, since he had given me his information to keep the streak when he didn't have a phone for a bit.

I go to send myself a picture of my ceiling and leave him a nice message, when I see that he really did send his scores to everyone. He even sent it to my ex best friend, who I've admitted to being jealous of sometimes. He swore he didn't have a thing for her, and even claimed that he actively disliked her. 

I feel really hurt and torn. We've been together for five months, and we've never had a problem like this. He's so supportive, sweet, understanding, funny. He makes me really happy.  Through every bout of insecurity brought on by my baggage from my last relationship, he swore that he would never lie to me, even if it was hard to tell me the truth, even if it would hurt to hear it. 

I've never felt this way about anyone, but I'm not willing to be lied to, I'm not having another relationship like my last one. I don't know if I'm making a bigger deal outta this than I should, or of this is a red flag. I mean, he was really worried about those tests and he absolutely killed it. He should be proud, I just wish he hadn't lied. I don't know if I can trust him anymore, even though I really want to. I don't wanna leave him, but I don't know what to do.",19May2018,1

And the regular ones, or those what i would like to be read are no. Its a free boost but its not what i want. Those contents are 5-10 min readable ones. I thought i can get views by SEO but people dont really search for specific terms. Or go change banners but the results are bad.  Im considering this:

Maybe i shift to youtube. Just a static image and i read the script or blog post what i wrote. Simple, but you dont have to read. I see on myself that i listen to youtube while i do my chores, work, or just do something. I can just listen even an hour podcast and i dont have to focus on reading. All content what i listen to is just one or two dudes talks. No gameplay, no high budget camerawork. They just talk.

I love reading but i make content to others, not to me. My goal is not money, i want to be heard and my opinion to be shared.  I know youtube is garbage, but i really considering to give up the written content because its just a hobby but consumes a lot of time with mixed results.

151,"Hi

My mother is Japanese, my father Indian, we currently live in Australia. Previously, we lived in India and we moved to Australia 7 years ago.

My Grandmother (From father's side) came with us and for the past 7 years, my mother has essentially been forced to take care of her.

Note: I don't think she isn't meant to take care of her anything as its the right thing to do, more details below.

The thing is, the last 7 years have been absolute hell for her;
She gets constantly berated by Grandmother, and my father just tells her to ignore it.

She hasn't met her own parents in 7+ years, whilst my dad goes every year back to India with my grandmother for vacation.

She has to wake up ridiculously early in the morning (usually 5), and sometimes during the middle of the night because my grandmother cannot get out of bed, go to the toilet etc.

She started working casual jobs just so she could get away from my grandmother, and has to spend money out of her own pocket to pay for my grandmother's nappies.

This is on top of doing everythign for 3 kids. my father does absolutely 0% of the household work.

Indian 'culture'  according to my aunt is that the son takes care of the mother when she gets old, but the way the situation is, my dad does bloody nothing in comparison to my mother, and doesn't even work 1% of the work she does.

My dad has two sisters, and being from a well off family (grandmother was a member of parliament), we definitely have caretakers back in India since that was how she was being taken cared of when I lived there 7+ years ago.

My aunt and father stressed for permanent residency in Australia, which failed and resulted in a medical visa for my grandmother (10 year period). This process was very expensive, my mom talks about how everything in our savings was used to aquire permanent residency, and how she was saving it up for our inversity costs etc.

I'm not too knowledgeable in this area so this is the best I can give.

As of writing this, I just had a fight with my dad who is ignorant to how my Mom feels. I know that my grandmother is my dad's mother, but the tension and cycle of hate thats building in our family makes me sick.
He doesn't want to send my grandmother back to India, and my mom is getting increasingly more depressed.

Honestly, I just want to send grandmother back to India where there are perfect resources there to take care of her, but my dad just won't budge.

How can I convince him, and what can I do to help my mom?

Sorry for the long post

154,"Hi, I’m new to this subreddit so not too sure how it works, but wanted to get some advice before I google it and convince myself it’s a bigger thing that it is.


I’m still quite young, but I’ve had a lot of issues with friends and relationships over the past few years because I’ll act brashly or say something without really thinking. So for example, my then boyfriend told me something fairly funny about his finances and how he’d messed up, so I told one of our close friends because it was funny, not realising that he didn’t want people to know and it didn’t even occur to me to not say it.


This also happens with getting with people I know I shouldn’t, or drinking too much, or exposing people’s secrets that I don’t realise are supposed to be secret.


So I don’t know what to do, I need to change this and I don’t know how. It is one of the only reasons people have broken up with me for and a big factor with friends I’ve fallen out with.


 Is it something that counselling would help? Or could it be a symptom of something like ADHD? Or is it just a personality trait that I can’t change?

166,"i have eight days till school is out. yet, feels like an entire fucking semester. i’m fourteen-freshman, and i’m not really complaining about schoolwork since i know it’s just gonna get worse, but my friends. to explain what has happened so far, here’s a copy and paste from my last post that no one really cared about-

hey. i need some help. i'm fourteen-male, and i expected my freshman year to be normal like my older brother and sisters have told me. a bit rough, but also quite fun. but, the things that i am experiencing i think might be out of the norm. here's the rundown.

up until freshman year, my life was quite normal. i had only one friend named peterkin, but he was usually made fun of for being overweight. couldn't do anything about it, really. in freshman year, i started to make friends with the more well-known/""popular"" (not in cliche high school movies type popular, but you get it) group, and peterkin was quite upset about that considering they bully him quite often. now that i think about it, i shouldn't even be near those fuckers. anyway, i have bulimia and i've lost twenty pounds over the last few months. i don't look like a human skeleton, but skinny enough for people to ask. i've gotten caught vomiting in school before by a guy in his junior year, who gives me the creeps. most people in this school who are older than the freshmen aren't particularly fond of the freshmen, and always ask of this person is a freshman or not before dismissing them if they are. they usually find us immature. i don't blame them, haha. so, when this junior, lets call him douglas, asked me if i was a freshman, i just responded with 'i'm a ralph.' (which is my name, if you haven't noticed my username.) he apparently liked my answer, and basically kept me and his fucking pet for the rest of the year. well in reality, we dated, but it felt like i was his pet. some people told me he seemed abusive, by the way one time in a party he lit a lighter and burned my arm slightly and tried to light, what i think is a cigarette with it. it was incredibly painful. he'd beat me up sometimes, but i guess i deserve it. anyway, back to the point the i was friends with the more well known crowd. the alpha male of this large group, lets call him jack, always seemed to be quite rude to everyone except me. i figured out why he did this, it was because he wanted me to stay  the group just because i had attractive hair. he knew i would leave if he treated me badly. we once fought when he beat up some kid named daniel, and i told him that he was lucky that none of the people he was hurt physically or verbally have committed suicide. who knew, a month after the same kid, daniel, kills himself. jack blames it on himself, and is still popular but yet alot more quiet than usual. i also blamed it on jack until i found out from douglas that doug actually was texting daniel for a while, actually sending him texts such as ""you should die."" ""if you want to die, just do it already."" and shit like that. he did this because he wanted me out of jack's clique, hoping i would think it's jack. he spilled the beans when he saw me crying on the ground. oh, and, forgot to mention about doug, he probably sexually assualts me on the daily, by the way he fucking touches me when i go to his house or when he go to the forest together. he always has to tell me, 'oh come on, i'm not gonna kill ya' just to keep me still. the only time sexual assault/rape/date rape has really affected me was at prom, when a sophomore girl i didnt even know that well date raped me. it was traumatic. my freshman year is close to being over, and im just scared sophomore year is just gonna get worse. 

more happened in the last week.
i got raped again by my boyfriend.
it was terrible.
jack ghosted me; peterkin committed suicide.
my school went on lockdown because of a potential shooter; luckily turns out to be some creepy dude who left after half an hour.

So here is my situation: 

Me and brother \(I am 20, he is 17\) have a pretty normal relationship \(both males\). We talk about videogames and anime and we laugh together about memes, sometimes we talk about politics and stuff like that but nothing deeper than this.

Yesterday he showed me a post he made on a League of Legends Sub\-Reddit and I saw on his account that he posted something to r/sad . That made me suspicious.

So I kind of stalked his account \(yes I know not a good thing to do\) and looked up the posts and comments he made on r/sad. And I was shocked.

He recently changed schools and I know that he has issues finding new friends and that he lost all his old friends, it's a tough time for a teenager. He mostly stays in his room on his computer and plays video\-games. He doesn't go out much and doesn't interact with my parents either. His posts on r/sad include comments like ""I don't want to live any more but I don't want to kill myself."" and ""Every Morning I hope I just get hit by a car or have a heart attack."".

I was shocked at how serious it got with him. He's a shy guy, an introvert so he doesn't come out of his shell often.

My question now is. What am I supposed to do? I feel really helpless since it is my duty as a big brother to  care for my little brother. I know that depression is a serious matter but i just don't know what to do. Every time I ask him if he wants to go out with me he declines, when I ask if he wants to play video\-games with me he declines. I want to be good friend to him in a time where he has none / few.

Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!

177,"I have Aspergers and I was diagnosed at the age of 2. I can talk and live independently but I been struggling, not minor, it's major. I keep getting negative words and actions about me. Despite most people with autism has mental delay, I did before but until I was 10 years old that I have a mental age of a 13 and then when I was 16, my mental increase to age of 20. I feel like autism is both a curse and a bless. Some people have different point of view.

Enough of that summary and here are my daily struggles. Stigma: Oh dear god when to begin. Stigma is one of the worstest punch to people, whenever they are reglious, different race, gender, if your straight or not or have a disability/mental illness. It's a daily issue. It comes just around the corner, whenever it's on in the internet media, school, shopping centre or even at a simple park, it will attack you. It's like a plague spreading wrong information to society and there is no cure just like no cure for a rare disease. There are stigmas like they are a brat, or they need to be in a mental hospital or even spreading stupid myth she like vaccines causing autism. It offends me. Speaking of the they need to be in a mental hospital. I heard that at high school on time and went up to them and said, ""How would you feel if you have autism and heard that disgusting and revolting words."", most of them laugh and tease me for having empathy. I wish we can spread words to cure stigmas.

Struggle With Social Cues: I struggle simple social cues like when to stop talking when others want turn, not to change topic quickly, small talk or even joining in. I end up either offending their personal space or they think I'm an idiot. I end up wanting to stay in my room and avoid parties or visiting to prevent annoying them. I know it's sounds stupid of me but I try to learn through therapies, talk to my two best friends or think about it in my mind. It also causes me to grow social anxiety. Though I'm confident to present a speech or sing in public, I'm not confortable with talking in general I trying hard. My social skills mainly ends up making friendship fall apart. It's because of me. Thankfully I have two best friends that I have for 3 years now.

Bullies: It's even worse, they put you down like a dog catcher caught the dog in a net. They say horrible stuff like your ugly, your boring, your an idiot or even to tell me to not to live. It's not cool. It's my main reason why I got mild depression! Some even push me and shoved me but the worst type of bullying is backstabbing. Bakcstabbers are like a dagger cut you deeply through pain, regret and sorrow. They prentend to be nice and they manipulate you to help them but when you ask for help in return, they don't. They think they can get away cause they think I'm dumb but I'm not for one, I been though that stuff, two my IQ is 132 and three, my best friends knows about them. I feel bad to others who are bullied too. I feel your pain and don't say autism has lack of empathy, it's false.

Family Issues: Family suppose to make you feel love, welcome and happy and we do most of the tie feel happy and loved but sometimes we get into agruements, day and night. Me and my younger sister fights the most. My younger sister has Aspergers and ADHD. She swears, punches me and hates me a lot more than our parents. I tried telling them to get her help by the doctor, they like use theapries will help but it's not. I do love my sister though. My dad gets angry all the time cause he stress from losing a job and I try spend time with him but he's 'busy' but it just hanging out with friends. We argue but my dad loves me. My mum is the best and my older sister too. They understand me but I understand them when their energy is drain due to arguements, work and other stuff. I try helping but they don't need my help. Recently my older sister got a boyfriend, I was jealous but I was proud of her. I research about love with autism and turns out only 11&amp;#37; of autistic people have a husband or wife! I was worried. I did want a future, I want a house, a job, a husband and kids of my own but my mum said, ""Patience my love."" It's hard. I seee many people in love, and all of them are NT. Then again it can happen but I will find out very soon into the future.

Finally Mental Illnesses: It doesn't mix well with autism like as if you put random ingredients and result bad food but expect your mind. I have anxiety and depression and it's bad. I feel moody, down a lot, cry often and worried about stuff like plane trip, test, missing out an event, etc. It slime a bunch of shackles are in my body and I can't enjoy the fun I once had but they are some things that make me happy but it's a daily struggle. I want to be happy. I got depression for two reasons for one I loss my nanna from cancer and two, worried about the future. It's hard to break free. I'm not thinking of ending my life but I feel like my moviation and purpose is useless and pointless but I will find out someday, maybe today or next week.

I need advice on helping my struggles and make myself a happy person.

180,"My ex girlfriend and I dated for three years. It was long distance, we lived about 1,000 miles apart. We met maybe 4-5 times per year, at most. It became a sexual relationship early on.  At no point in time was a rape committed. There was no point at which one person didn't consent, however sexual activities continued. 3 months after we broke up, and over half a year after we had since we last had physical contact with one another, she came to the realization that I raped her...but I didn't. From my perspective, what it seems like is that she felt pressured to do sexual things with me over the course of our relationship, and so I raped her in general, even when we were not physically together, and not in any specific instance. But that's not what rape is. I wouldn't know her perspective entirely because she refuses to talk anymore, so I don't try to contact her. 

It's been months since we've communicated, but I still think about it all the time. And I feel terrible, I feel guilty that I contributed to her thinking that about me and that her life has been made worse because of me. 

I don't even know if it's worth saying this because anyone reading this couldn't know me very well but I don't try to be intimidating or pressuring to anyone ever. I'm a pretty shy and introverted fellah. I don't see myself as a rapist. 

But regardless of if I raped her or not, to her it doesn't matter. In her reality I did. And that's why I feel terrible about it. It's also something I've never talked to anyone about. 

I hope making this post doesn't bite me in the butt for some reason or another. ",19May2018,209

182,"I don't know what to do. I've been in a really depressive mood for the last week and today I finally started feeling a lot better. This is usual for me I usually go through pretty weird periods of being depressed and antisocial to okay and social.

I lost a lot of my friends here recently through drama and people picking sides but I thought with this one friend I wouldn't lose them that easily. Well I guess all it takes is for them to make up with everyone else and then for me to get a bit depressed.

Like I said I was feeling really good today, work up early did some work, went gym, clean our kitchen. And I was just making some lunch and my friend walks in, I said hey and they fully ignore me and say theyre going to find this other person I fell out with but they made up again. I also sent a couple of messages earlier of just general stuff and they just ignore it. So now obviously I know they they've fully given up on me and I'm just some housemate to them.

Yeah sure I've been upset with them recently like excluding me out of things, not even asking if I'm okay and that sort of shit but whatever. It's just clear to me now I was just their therapist to talk to when they had fallen out with everyone else.

Do I leave it? Accept that we're just housemates now. Or should I message them telling them why I'm upset with them, thing is I already messaged earlier in the week saying I've just been generally depressed and it's not aimed at anyone, which is partially true, there was no real reason for me to be as upset as i was but still.

184,"He’s 22, I’m 24F. He’s a lovely human in so many ways. I absolutely want to make it work with this man. I unfortunately just have a hard time being “on his page” with understanding why he does the things the does. I’m a very mellowed out person, but he’s often off the walls. He’s tried numerous medications as a child and teenager but hated them all. 

1. He sings all the time (there’s never silence, unless he’s drawing, thank god for drawing)
2. responding in conversations without thinking it through (not rude, just often doesn’t have context to the conversation, assuming that he’s only picking up on random words here and there as is mind is moving so quick)
3. he talks a mile a minute for a very extended period of time with topics constantly being changed
4. A lot of what I say is not actually heard
5. When there is silence, he takes it as something is wrong

The list goes on. Basically most ADHD characteristics he falls into. I often sense as well that his friends get annoyed at him because he’s always yelling and singing and can never have silence. He’s absolutely not aggressive and it’s all him just having fun, but it can be a lot to handle. How can I understand him more? I don’t want to push him away, but more so understand how someone with ADHD would like to be treated in these situations. He’s very good with taking honesty. ",19May2018,31

I feel like, actually its not even a feeling anymore, I KNOW that this has like effected all areas of my life. 

My family doesn't know so i guess maybe its not that bad? but my friends definitely know and can tell i am obsessed with sex.

The moment this hit me was today, me and one of my friends were talking about a formation of a country and she was like it was probably through a lot of royal weddings (we weren't talking about the british royal wedding btw) and just without thinking i was like ""oooo thats sexy"" and my friend replied ""not everything is about sex"" 

and it hit me hard. Im looking back and i have really sexualised like everything.

And like i dont want this to be my identity anymore, i don't want to be ""that guy who is obsessed with sex"" 

I know there is a community in NoFap that might help, i tried it once (not because of this, i just thought i might try) and i think the longest i got was 2 weeks. I don't really like the community, like im not against what they do but they create this stigma against masturbating and they don't seem really scientific. I don't want to talk bad about anyone or offend anyone but i feel like its kind of similar to a cult. Like everyone's just blindly following a path. 

I feel like what i need is not to remove sex/sexual thoughts/porn from my life but to come to peace with it. Like it sounds weird? but i feel like i have to accept it? like sex is part of me and its part of human nature and we shouldn't reject it.

190,"So the question is, if you have a friend who is cheating on their husband or boyfriend (or gf or wife) and they do this often not just once and with different partners, should you stop being their friend because of this shady behavior? Or is it their business and has nothing to do with the friendship?

I have gotten mixed responses from friends and was curious what you guys would think. I always seem to make new friends with girls and we get close and I find out they are serial cheaters and it bugs me that my friend has such a bad moral compass. I think of it like if they’re willing to do that to their lover, what would they do to me? These friends usually end up being selfish.

I have some friends who say I’m wrong and I shouldn’t care because it’s not my business and as long as they don’t put me in the middle of it (my friend does not) it shouldn’t be an issue.

I scared my girlfriend and she thought I was mad at her. I was slightly mad because we had promised each other to tell one another when we had issues we needed to resolve, and not turn to self harm or similar outlets.
 She was scared of how I would react because I had a distant look in my eyes, her words not mine. I got high to try and cope but that just made my nerves worse. Final exams are coming up and this was the last thing I wanted to worry about.
 And then, I get a text from my friend. He has people after him because of a big mistake he made. Hes telling me that there's no way out, and he's going to kill himself. He told me how much of a good friend I was, as if saying farewell. I haven't heard back from him and I can't get in touch. My girlfriend has yet to text me this morning.

Luckily nothing serious happened but the plastic fumes left a bad odor in the apartment and to make it leave i cleaned everything, but in the act of wiping the walls, the smoke stains became more evident and the white paint on 2 walls got noticeably ruined im some points.
In a month i will leave the place, and i'm not sure if i should:
1) Say nothing, as the staff probably won't check the apartment and will notice the damage only when the next client will tell them. They will know long term tough.
2) Say the truth, but they will know the room has been filled with smoke and may ask me to pay for a full sanitization. Even if the smoke odor left they could still charge me for a full repainting, and also i'd prefer not to share that a serious incident happened, also because i may want to return to the structure in the future;
3) Admit the damage but ascribe it to another cause, something less invasive and less dangerous than a sudden fire. The problem is the smoke is a bit noticeable and the stained walls are one in a room and one in the bathroom, how could that be explained realistically?
4) Repaint the walls myself... But I'm pretty tired of trying self fix and seeing things getting worse...
5) Call a professional painter but it would be evident two walls have been repainted and also i'm not sure i can do that without being spotted by the owners.

2. No internet in studies or reading books - I really really like to learn stuff, even though I have my life centered towards finance I know about black holes and string theory and what not. I grasp whatever I feel amazing quite quickly. But now a days I just don't like doing that. Sit and stare at my mobile or a wall. 

My interest in novels was great too, I once read 15 books in a month. My proudest accomplishment. But now a days u can't even finish one book
 
3. Spend way too much time on social media - I am constantly posting something on Reddit or share memes on Facebook. 

4. No relationship - I can't seem to find a girl for relationship. I am too afraid that I will make her sad. 

5. Money issues - My parents used to earn quite nice but since my seventh grade they are not. Seeing this I stopped asking for stuff. Started to wear cheap clothes, borrowing video games consoles from my friends. 

6. Lying - Since my life is dull, I constantly like to my parents and friends so they think everything is normal. I know it's stupid but helps me to make stuff up and imagine how my life would be.

7. Suicidal thoughts - For a month, I am having thoughts about how should I kill my self, will any one care if I die? 

8. Urge to cry - when I am alone I start to cry for no reason

9. Over thinking - I over think mostly all the situation. Why are my friends not replying? Are they angry? And more

205,".I've recently realized I have daddy issues. My father has been, for the most part, in my life. He's always been with my family and has always provided for the family but emotionally, at least to me he's a stranger.


Lately I've become aware of how I feel when he's around. When my mother and I are watching tv and having fun my happy and care free attitude dissapeared the second i hear the door unlock because I know he's home now. He's gone most of the day at work or hanging out with friends usually so i dont know how to feel about this. When he is home it's as if we're roommates who are forced to deal with each other. He'll walk in, we'll hi to one another and won't interact again unless we need something from one another. My mother is away on a retreat and I'm counting the days till she returns.


Now I'm seeing my daddy issues play out in my romantic life. My first girlfriend was with me though it was clear she didn't actually like me. My second girlfriend was long distance to the point we only saw each other once in six months. Third, emotionally distant. Current, emotionally unavailable. I've begun to doubt the validity of my emotions when im with her.


I've brought up my feeling toward our relationship with my father and it's never gone well. ""If you want to know things about him then you have to ask, if you want me to take you places then you have to tell me, if you don't appreciate all the I do for you then I can take them away""


With My little brother I'm doing my best to be better but it can be hard balancing being a good older sibling, having my own adult social, and not falling prey to the mindset ""I turned out him so he probably will too. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

208,"Long story short I still need to take some credits next semester, my university allows for students who have a few remaining classes to walk with their class/school if they appealed it a while ago (I didn’t know there was a deadline until this week). 

I emailed my university two separate times explaining that my grandfather passed away two years ago and my grandmother has started to go down the wrong path and is always in and out of the hospital and didn’t get a response. She always talks about seeing my walk across the stage (as I’m the last in my family to do so). I’m afraid that she won’t be in good enough health to see me do it next year. I don’t want that guilt that her “dying” wish in a sense won’t be granted because of formalities. 

They land in 3 hours from the airport and my graduation is in 7 hours. My friend who appealed to walk early was sent a piece of paper via PDF that everyone else gets. You are supposed to print it out and hand it to the reader, who reads your name. There is no order, you just walk with the people in your major.

209,"I need help, I’v completely fallen for this girl who is one of my best friends sister. She so beautiful and sweet and caring. I think about her all the time. The big problem is she gives me mixed signals and leads me on but I don’t know if it’s on purpose or not. The other night she sat on my lap while kinda crying over something and told me to kiss her (on the cheek) and hold her, she kissed me back on the neck and nuzzled me but then she never even said goodbye when she walked past me to leave the bar where we were at. It’s hard especially while drunk to understand where she’s coming from. I’m so nervous even considering asking her out, not because she’s my best mates sister (I feel like he’d be cool with it), but because she’s a year older than me and naturally inside i think the world of her. I feel like she deserves the best and that she wouldn’t even consider me that way which honest to god crushes me.

211,"Looking for some help online cos this sub is somehow the first thing i thought of when faced with what just happened, and created an account cos im honestly sad and ashamed. So my relationship with my father had always been shaky for the past 5 or so years, and I'm just a kid in college so that is quite significant. We have always quarreled, about things that would very much always be related to my education. He would always perceive me as having a lack of effort towards studying, preparing for major exams coming up, while I saw him as incredibly overbearing, controlling. Upon reading this you might think oh its just another typical conflict about parents caring about their kid and worrying like they should be. Truthfully I am not extremely studious. It developed to the point my father would almost always scream at me whenever he saw me on the phone back from work \(I did understand he likely felt i was skiving while he worked hard at work, so i made it a point to stop\), he would strongly object to any extra\-curriculum activity i did outside of academics, and he'd literally scream and rant non\-stop whenever im not studying like he thinks i should be at my desk. I honestly believe i can and should put in more effort for my exams, and show him that i do care \(which i definitely do, we're all asian\), but things never let up or improved, rather it got worse to the point that it has probably finally erupted today. I don't for one moment pin all the fault on him, as I do feel i could have done better on my part by putting in the effort.

Happened very much like the usual when he ranted at me for not doing my work and studying for upcoming tests. I was on my phone, semi\-doing work as it had been rather late towards the night already. He went into his room, and 5 mins later my mom called me in and warned me that i should stop wasting my damn time. I said i was working on my stuff \(should have kept quiet in hindsight\) and my father just jumped at me and repeatedly hit me. Now im a dude, and a couple of slaps are just fine for educating a child, but today i felt it was out of hand and shouted at him to stop. Shouted multiple times to stop, and when he did not let up I grabbed his wrists to stop the punches and slaps. I swear, i swear to god i had NO intention whatsoever to hurt him, I was completely defensive, I do NOT for the love of god want to hurt my parents EVER. In the scuffle my dad got a minor scratch on the face. Everytime i told him to stop he'd tell me to shut up, and threaten me to say another word, and i so i did, i held back, kept my mouth shut, and appeased him. Afterwards he screamed at my mother other stuff which I can say with absolute certainty is fucking unreasonable and rude. 

I'm here today because i feel that my relationship with my father is completely broken. He told me after what had just happened that he hated me, that i was wasting his effort and money because i was not working hard studying. I am here well knowing that I should, and i will put in more effort to try to make him happy and not stress, but I feel that there is some part of the conflict that I am not at fault of. When i held him back and told him to stop while he continued, it was really the breaking point for me, and i thought ""fuck me, hes fucking crazy"". Father has always had anger issues, completely loses his mind when hes angry, not only at me. I honestly do not think if i should bother with repairing the relationship. He is the kind that would never, ever admit he is wrong, and expects me as a son to bow down whenever we argue. I do, just like i did today, to appease him and for the love of god hope that neither of us gets hurt, and this complete lack of reason and connection in my opinion is what i feel will never let us be okay again. After he told me that he hated me, that he really did, Im quickly losing all hope and emotion for a him. He has been distant and cold from me for years, and in my opinion is incredibly petty. He'll probably never let up, and i cant recall the last time i had fun with my father.  After his unreasonable rant, ridiculous punching episode, threatening to hit me more if i didnt shut up, and telling me he hated me, I'm very much on the verge of saying that back. I don't know, I really hope you all can make me see something I could not before.",19May2018,1

214,"Im 30/m and my girlfriend 21/f left me two weeks ago. She was unhappy sexually b/c I'm not old enough for her. She kept it to herself for 2 years thinking she could change the way she feels about me.  When she was a child/teen she was abused sexually by older men and now that is all she is attracted to. She did not expect to fall in love with me when we started dating. I wanted to get married someday. NEVER felt this way about anyone before.
Now she is gone. She told me that maybe we could try again but that she would need to make a big change in her life and isn't sure that it would ever happen. Seems like she doesnt want anything to do with me and she said its because it would be to hard for her and me to be in my life. 
I am going crazy dealing with this. Eating sleeping and getting work done are very difficult. I try to not call her or text her but I usually cave and do it at least once a day. I go by her work and new place to see if shes there at night when I can't sleep. Im really fucked up.
I am 2 years sober as well which makes this harder. I cant run from the pain i get to feel everything. I think about killing myself.

So in January I met a lady through mutual friends and we’ve been dating for about 3-4 months. A few weeks in I had asked what she was looking for in a relationship and she mentioned she wasn’t looking for anything serious, just casual for now. I more or less felt the same way so that’s what I told her, but part of me thinks maybe I felt/thought that at the time because I was tired of feeling lonely?

The thing is I do want to eventually find a special someone, a best friend that I can also be intimate with, and I’m not really getting %100 of that from this girl (as a friend of mine put it - I can’t *geek out* with her).

She’s a cool person, don’t get me wrong, but we’re kinda into different things. She’s a really hard worker who’s into history, culture, and a movie buff and I’m a laid back geek who’s into tech, games, and cartoons. We obviously enjoy each others company (we’re close in age so we share a lot of nostalgia) but part of me feels the novelty is going to eventually wear off.

Anyways, I’ve been meaning to talk to her about how I feel but lately she’s been having it rough. She got in a wreck a few weeks ago and last week she lost a close friend of hers, so now I’m scared to bring up the subject and possibly cause more distress to her.

1) Am I being to greedy for wanting someone that I can at least game with?

2) When is it appropriate to share how I feel?",19May2018,1

227,"Tl;dr: I found my brother's reddit when visiting my parents and it is extremely concerning. I have no idea where any of this is coming from and I don't know how to handle the situation.

Here's the full story: I'm 25/M and am visiting my family \(mom, dad, and little brother\) this weekend. My brother is about to turn 17 and from the outside he seems like a normal, well\-adjusted kid, but after everything I've found apparently he isn't. 

When I arrived last night the plan was that our whole family would go out to dinner right away so that we could all catch up. However, when I got there my brother was up in his room and my parents informed me that he wouldn't be joining us. I thought this was a little strange but I just assumed that he wasn't feeling well, and we went to dinner without even seeing my brother once.

Dinner went well, except when I brought up my brother my parents became very uncomfortable and immediately changed the topic. Clearly something was off but I didn't want to push the issue. We went back to my parents house, where I'll be staying for the weekend, but when I went to check on my brother, he wasn't in his room and it smelled strongly of pot smoke. This is when I grew very concerned because this is very out of character for him. And, regardless, why would any teenager be smoking alone on a Friday night? Isn't that alone a red flag?

I didn't want to rat my brother out immediately but I decided to dig around to see what was going on. My brother's computer was on so I braced myself to see what he was up to, but what I found was definitely not what I was expecting. Apparently he's been using this Reddit account as a sort of online diary and... just wow. I don't want to give the account name in case he sees this post, but here are some of the highlights from his post history:

**I just tried to hang myself \-** *""I decided that everyone at school is right to hate me and I might as well just fucking die.... People at school have made it clear they don't want me around so imma grant them their wish.""*

**My parents are mad at me because I won a writing competition \-** *""I was already planning on killing myself in a few days so I figured that someone should know my pain, and I ended up writing this story about how my parents never accepted me... \[My mom\] handed me a letter from the school and said ""you better not embarrass me"" and walked away.""* \(the letter said that he won first place\)

**I'm unacceptable \-**  *""For too long I have indulged my Same Sex Attraction and it has done nothing but bring shame to me and my family. It makes me sick to think that I've wasted so many years on filth and I pretended I was proud of it.""*

I don't know what to think. First of all nobody made me aware of any of this and all of it has happened within the last year. I feel awful that he's been dealing with so much and I haven't been aware of any of it.  I didn't even realize he was gay! Second of all I know my parents are a little crazy but from what he's written it seems like they've gone bat\-shit insane? Or is he just making all of this up???

229,"Hey guys,

I recently got my first part-time job, and the daily schedule I have for weekdays is really making my life go down hill fast.
On regular weekdays I go to school from from approximately 8:30am-4pm. I get home at 4:15pm, eat dinner, and head out to work at 5 because my part-time is more than a half an hour away on bad traffic days. I then work from 6-10pm at a theater in ticket sales where I stand the entire time, and then I get home at 10:30pm. Only then do I have time for my studies and piano practice (I use a keyboard with headphones so it doesn't bother anyone). My workplace really wants me to work the max hours every week for minors, which would be the 6-10 everyday. All the entry level local jobs in my area have either been snatched up, or rejected me.

I don't get enough sleep, I'm always exhausted, and I can barely do my homework. I go to a very competitive school, and I fear if I continue on the track I'm currently on my grades will suffer really hard. Along with that, I have no personal time that doesn't cut right into my sleeping time aside from a few hours on Saturday. I start summer in early June, which I think would make things easier, but I have a strong sense that they will make me work max hours for non-school times. Plus, I have really important finals coming up in the end of May, and I can't imagine how I could ever manage studying for that as I currently am. I have serious problems with depression, and this is only making it worse every time I get home from work. I don't know if I should quit, ask for less hours, wait for the summer, suck it up and stop whining, or do something else.

Feel free to ask clarifying questions, this is my first time really posting on Reddit.
Thanks in advance",19May2018,2
230,"Hi,

I have to write this down and share it with people because I don't know what to do. I just found out, who's the person trying to ruin my life and I don't know if I should revenge, ignore, confront her.. Let me say right away, that going to the police won't help anything since I already tried asking for their help.

So I have to apologize right away forthe long post but I have to give you the background story. Two years ago an unknown person started to do fake email, Facebook, dating website accounts of me with photoshoped photos of me (nudes etc). I didn't care at first but this person started to contact my coworkers, my boss and the HR department, my family. It was extremely annoying to explain to everybody what's happening and this person wouldn't stop to also write me threats all the time. After reporting to the police, hiring a PI, a hacker with no results I just decided to ignore it, delete all my information online and also move and change my job. It eventually stopped and I've been trying to forget about it becaise it seems like a teenage movie.

Yestrday I got on my Fb a friend request from a girl from my hometown, that I haven't spoken with since I was 12. After some days I accepted it to be cordial and also because she's a friend of a friend. She started to write me right away that somebody wrote to her with my name but ""weird pics"". I asked for screenshots but then she changed her story that she just saw a profile with my pics. She sent me a link of it, which is obviously a scam (it says facebook login but it's actually encserv.com) and kept telling me to check it. I just replie thanks and she kept saying ""check it"" / ""try to delete it cause it already has likes"". So it must be her 100%.

Why does she want to ruin my life? Tbh I don't know. I keep thinking about it.. I was always nice to her but I did hang out with a girl, that I remember was bullying everybody (including me) - I mean, who even remembers the elementary school drama, right??

I have no idea how to deal with this, especially because I live in another country now so it's not like I can go knock on her door. I could play her game and do the same to her but I don't want to be that kind of person. At the same time I want her to learn a lesson. Should I hire a hacker again to try to find solid proof it was her and sue her?? Or just let it go?

Any of your input will be much appreciated. I already feel a bit lighter now that I wrote everything down..

Thanks reddit :)",19May2018,21

As senior year comes to an end, we are both moving on to different but nearby colleges, which I don't expect to be an issue. She has expressed a good deal of interest in joining a sorority, which makes me a little uneasy.

I struggle with anxiety a bit and so of course this sends my mind into all sorts of worries. I'm worried a sorority will make her more promiscuous, or she'll have too much to drink and end up with someone else in bed, or that she'll be sexually assaulted, or brutal hazing, etc. The last one is less of a concern since that's becoming less common I think. I suppose I'm afraid of letting go because I've always been by her side, and I won't be able to do that when she's away. I'm afraid that me not being there will result in something bad happening.

242,"Hey Reddit,

I am in my late 30s. I never had much of a social life nor a relationship. I never had a lot of friends and I still don't. A lot of this is the result of how I was raised. I basically spent all my life with my head buried in the books and school. It's only when I turned 31 that I ""woke up"". By then I had no social skills. I was no longer in school, it became harder for me to make friends. At this age, it's also harder to find an SO (no success so far). Pretty much every one I meet are already in a relationship, have already traveled the world with their partner, and done basically everything I ever wanted. 

I wish I could reset life, but that's not an option. So, I try to go out and try new activities, attend events, etc. The problem is that I can't do these to enjoy the activity itself, but rather as a distraction to keep myself occupied, or as a means to try and make new friends, or to find a girl friend. And it hasn't been working out too well. 

So, it's becoming extremely difficult to continue. I don't know how to control my emotions and simply focus on the activity or the event itself. 

Another example, most of the events I get invited to are thrown by people that are in relationships. They have done a lot of cool things in their life with their SO, have a large social network, etc. They're basically living my dream. Instead of being able to enjoy their warmth, I can't stop thinking about how much I want a life like that and how it will mot likely never happen for me. Because of this, I declined some of my recent invitiations and started isolating myself again. 

How do I control my feelings, my desires, and stop it from alienating my self from others?

249,"I'm ready to die now lol. Ever since I was a kid I always humped the bed to you know,  I never could do it the regular way. Well, today I was in my dorm and my roommate went to lunch hall for breakfast and I went to town. Nothing wrong with that, was a nice morning, I felt refreshed an decided I deserve to treat myself. Only thing wrong I FORGOT TO LOCK THE DAMN DOOR. Usually I have 7 seconds to get my shit together between hearing the key in the door, twist, and opening to fake like I'm sleep and toss my phone under my pillow you know leg up face into pillow, the perfect plan. Worked for years but todayyy not so much. Roommate walked right in as I'm thrusting it into my mattress bad bitches on my Instagram account clear as day totally caught. Deer in the headlights. Only good thing was I was facing the wall and didn't have to make eye contact lol. I didn't even say anything. Just got up got dressed went to lunch hall and ate some breakfast by myself and mulled over how bad this day started off. Lol. 


I need some reassurance this is normal! What would you do in this situation. Me and my roommate still talk i think it's just me over thinking about the akwardness idk if most guys hump the mattress I have a GF he's met her and all but still. AKWARD. any feedback would be appreciated thanks y'all. It's been playing all day in my mind ",19May2018,8

251,"So I met my boyfriend 2 years ago, I liked to drink and party as well so that's what we would do up until he started selling drugs and getting drunk constantly, started saying horrible things while drunk, destroyed my moms basement, etc. I decided to leave him as I didnt want that kind of lifestyle and to be around drugs. 5 months later he got a job and we got back together, still drinking. Things were good at first until he started getting more aggressive. He was arrested for apparently throwing me around outside a 7/11, we were both blacked out dont remember anything. He also resisted arrest and hit a police officer. Basically after that he would get really drunk and say horrible mean things to me and push me around, throw my stuff around. I try tell him the next day he gets angry and tells at me. Jump to now, I've got control on my drinking, I'm going to college, im seeing mental health to better myself and he still drinks every couple days and is mean to me, very mean. The things he says are horrible and hurt my self esteem.. he had a knife in his hand last night and threatened to hurt him self if I leave. I'm only 20, hes 26.. this isn't the life I want for myself and I'm tired of having to take responsibility in the relationship, and I'm tired of getting treated so poorly. I'm afraid one day he will get violent again, even though it's just pushing I hate it and his drinking is driving me crazy. How do I leave someone so dependent on me? He says all hes gonna do is drink his life away, or he'd have nothing without me if I leave him and I have too big of a heart to let someone else hurt... please help me. ",19May2018,2
253,"I currently work nights in retail. I recently went back to school. My current job is not related to my field at all, but I need it to survive. I have been here about two years. I have been offered a volunteer opportunity for the summer that gives me experience in my field. The issue I am running into is the training for the volunteer opportunity is two days out of the week at night and they both go an hour into my shift.

I told my manager and he asked how late I would be. I explained no more than an hour and a half. (My work has a 3 week advancement policy in order to request a day off, I only found out about this whole thing a few days before). He said he would not let that be excused at all. He said my best bet would be to call out sick if I even had the hours. I only have two sick hours. I don't know how to handle this. I am a little dumbfounded because he let me show up that late before and it was excused. I don't know why he's having a change of heart.

I am tempted to call the volunteer place and ask if they can let me leave early or come in early. But I know there will be other people training so I don't know if that's an option. I have also contemplated being marked up potentially twice at work. But I do not know what else I can do. One of my co-workers saod to go to a dofferent manager, but i dont know if that would work. I feel like mine will still find out and might get upset with me. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",19May2018,1
254,"So, about five days ago now my friend and I got into a fight because of a misunderstanding. Tempers flared and we both probably regret what we said. 

I told him flat out that if he was done with me, to please remove me from your life. I care about him and if being around me is ruining his quality of life, I want him to do it. 

Here’s the kicker though, he hasn’t blocked or unfollowed me from any of the social medias we frequent. I’ve been trying to get ahold of him to talk about what happened but he’s been ignoring me. 

What can I do? I don’t want to lose him but I also don’t want to be the one to remove him from my life because I don’t want to give up. I’ve been trying to give him space but seeing him acting like nothing even happened is hurting me. 

Thanks in advance, I didn’t add too many details as to not make either of us bad. 

tl;dr: my friend and I had a horrible fight but he hasn’t removed me from his life, he’s just ignoring me. Help? ",19May2018,1

i felt so in love with her and ive thought we're very compatible. we're very open to each other, even her mom knows me. (we even talk about dirty stuff n shit). last year, we had a talk, and she told me she cant see herself dating me. it devastated me and made me feel empty and got me crying like a bitch for 3 days. i stopped talking to her, but i ended up talking to her again after 5 months cause i cant stop myself. we talk almost everyday, there was this time her mom got mad at me for something(october), and told her to not talk to me, but we secretly kept talking.

on her birthday (just last week), i talked to her mom, and she told me she's forgiving me (she didnt know we've been talking for the last 6/7 months). we talk everyday until last friday. my anxiety's kicking now and i'm feeling hopeless. i feel like talking to her is just masking my worries and anxieties about her, making me feel like its all good when its not. what should i do?

She used to be really uncomfortable with me following and doing the same thing with girls who I know as friends and nothing else, but now she doesn’t seem to care and she just does this like it’s whatever.

It used to make her really sad and uncomfortable when I did it and now I don’t know how to bring it up without seeming weird. A majority of these guys have the same intention and they have made it all clear yet she continues to have them connected via social media.

This was very weird to me, as I had no idea how he would've known that. Fast forward to today, I saw a weird lucky blinking under our computer. It was some sort of connector to the computer with the brand name Blink on it. After looking this up and finding out that it is a security cameras company, I immediately started looking for the camera. Long story short, I found one under the TV in the living room where my sister had her boyfriend over. I covered it with a sticky note.

I am very freaked out, he had not told us anything about this camera. I don't know how to confront him or what to do. He is gone until tomorrow night.

259,"I have a friend who I skype chat with regularly who suffers from depressive feelings. She feels worthless, like she's not going anywhere in life, and tells me she has few friends outside of the internet. I'm in a similar predicament (minus the depressive thoughts) and try to relate to her but it doesn't usually help. The best I can do is usually participate in things with her online - skype calls, roleplaying, video games, etc - to take her mind off things. Recently she's talking about suicidal thoughts, and the only thing that's holding her back is how her mother would feel if she were gone. I urged her to call Suicide Prevention but she's too afraid of getting Baker Enacted (She lives in Florida. From what I understand you can basically be forcefully taken to a mental hospital for a period of 72 hours and have treatment forced upon you.). I've offered to do stuff with her online like usual but she isn't responding well to it and constantly reassuring her and talking with her doesn't seem to be helping her - some days she'll feel just fine, some day's she's beyond my ability to help. 

I feel so limp and helpless and like a shitty friend. I wish I could drive across the country just to be there for her but I can't and I can't do much just over skype either. Is there any way I can help her at this point? ",19May2018,3
260,"Sorry you’re in for a long post! 

So my friends and I were trying to get tickets to Drake’s concert off Kijiji. We’re a group of 4 high school friends with the other 3 being extremely close since they live near each other and myself living in a different city for school I see them mostly during summer.

So one of them 3 found 4 tickets for us to go see the concert and was communicating with the seller while keeping us in the loop. The seller sent us a written statement as to what she’s giving us as proof . So after us taking the risk and going ahead with this deal.  I suggested to my buddy to only send money for two tickets, have the seller transfer 2 tickets then do the same for the other 2. He went ahead with doing so.

So since I owed him my share I sent the my money to  friend. Fast forward to him sending the seller money for 2 tickets and she goes MIA scamming us taking the money.  

Now I demanded that since we paid 250 for 2 tickets, us 4 split the cost equally which is only fair.  But now my friends are all arguing with me saying it’s my fault that I sent the money and I should be the one taking the 125 hit (price of one ticket). While the other friend of ours is okay with I’m not and I demanded to split the cost and take the hit equally . But now they refuse to send me 62.5$ (half of one ticket)

She’s also 19, and we’ve agreed to try and hang out at least once a week. I’m very excited, but I’m also nervous because whenever I hang out with people, I get really strong anxiety about how I look. I’m not fond of my face for one, but even bigger than that, I’m not fond of my body. I’m about 5’8, and weigh about 260lbs. She’s still a lot shorter than me, so I’m not worried about height, but I always feel so self conscious about the proportions of my body.

262,"I’ve never really felt like i had a place to belong or a real best friend. For the record, i’m still in high school technically but i graduate tomorrow.

Whenever i found a decent circle of friends, i always felt like the odd one out and was never invited to bigger gatherings and events, even though i went through hoops to make all of them feel included.

This pattern of people not reciprocating in relationships has followed me through practically everyone i’ve associated with. I seem to make “acquaintance” sort of friendships pretty easily because i’m not totally socially inept, but i cannot ever seem to deepen my relationships.

For example, 6 people i’ve tried to hang out with lately have mostly said “maybe” or “ill let you know” which 99% mean no. This goes on for weeks at a time. For me to plan out anything with anybody i have to do it weeks in advance to have a chance of getting anything done and they usually flake. On this note, for example, is this girl who i’ve been somewhat friends with for a little while. I asked her to go to a concert with my and two other mutual friends and she said sure. A couple days ago i asked if she was excited and she told me she’s going with her friends.. which really made me upset because i like her but it made me feel like she wanted nothing to do with me.

People who i get close with describe me as a funny, nice, and outgoing person, which i would assume are good qualities.

What am i doing wrong? Why can’t i sustain relationships? Why doesn’t anybody want to be around me? Is it just high school or am i doomed to be lonely all the time.


If it makes a difference, i was diagnosed with unipolar depressive disorder 2 years ago but i am very reserved with my feelings and do not express really any emotion unless i know them very well. Can my lack of emotionality make me less palatable?

It's been extremely hard and frustrating and I've cried myself to sleep more nights than not. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind it was the right thing to do I'm just finding it hard to adjust to things now. I have this numb feeling like im stuck in a dream i cant wake from. I have had some medical problems too which i don't think are being made any easier with everything that is happening...

264,"I've been on a fixed term contract for this past spring. Before that, I was working on an internship at the same company the past fall and based on that they asked me to come back. We already had an oral agreement that the contract would be continued after summer and we already have a date agreed on about when I'll continue in August. The contract itself hasn't been made yet.

I've been working two jobs the whole spring and it's taken its toll on me. I was forced to because when they asked me to work for this company, I already had a fixed term contract for weekends as a side job for the same spring. Days off are scarce but I needed the money and experience this job provides me with. I've been pretty stressed out. I do realize that this is my problem and not the company's.

It all culminated last Wednesday when I really wasn't feeling good. I was in a terrible mood the whole day. I didn't yell at anyone or anything, but I expressed my bad mood in an instance that probably raised some eyebrows by giving my coworker a passive-aggressive response and leaving the scene.

The next day, I apologized to my supervisor who was present when it happened. She said that I am forgiven on everyone's behalf. She said that everyone has those days, but expressed disappointment that I was not able to contain my mood better, which was fair. She also said that everyone noticed I was in a bad mood and that's bad news when you're working at customer service, which I am. I didn't lash out on customers or anything, but I probably wasn't as cheerful and polite as I usually am. But nonetheless, she said that I'm forgiven for this. After that everyone has been acting quite normal, including my supervisor and I did my best to maintain a good disposition on Thursday and be extra nice to my coworkers and customers to show everyone I am putting in effort to correct my mistake. My supervisor also went out of her way to chat with me and I read it as a ""we're cool, don't worry about it"". But I was shaken by her words.

In my mind, the fact that everyone noticed my bad mood has somehow translated to everyone gossiping about it behind my back. I was on vacation on Friday, and I'm afraid they agreed then that my contract won't be renewed because of this and they'll hire someone else for next fall.

This thought has plagued my whole weekend. I keep having anxiety attacks, visualizing in my mind how I'll go to work on Monday, my boss will ask to talk to me and he'll tell me that my contract won't be renewed. I've been crying, feeling like an utter failure because this was my first job in my own field and I just went and acted so immature. I have about a week left before my current contract ends and I'm determined to put in effort to do an outstanding job, but I'm not sure if it's enough to save me.

I am extremely hard on myself and beat myself up over mistakes. In a way, I'm giving myself this weekend to wallow in it so that I can return to work on Monday at my best and having put this behind me, whatever the outcome will be. Does my fear sound silly to you or am I right to be worried?

267,"My roommate Ashley quit their job in April without another one lined up, so she didn’t have her portion of rent all month. I went out of town and while I was out I had some drama pop up and used my portion of rent to fix it. My friend and fourth roommate Anna literally skipped town with her portion of rent. The last roommate Beth held onto hers. 
In May, Ashley gives me her portion finally and I make a partial payment with her and Beth’s portion (our balance was $2200, I paid $516). The landlord accepts but they insist I come back with another payment of at least $900 to keep them from filing for eviction. 

I still have been unable to come up with my part and I now have to cover for Anna. I thought I would be able to come home, bust ass at work and make more money, but my car broke down and my job cut my hours and basically everything crashed at once. Meanwhile, once again Beth has given me her full portion and Ashley gave me her part but she’s $100 short. 

I’ve secured a better job that pays every week and I’ve been desperately paying down my personal bills and trying to catch up on rent, but I still need to buy food and take Uber to or from work (public transit doesn’t run all day and I don’t know anyone with a car and it’s a pretty long walk from my house).

Basically, if I give everything I have on Monday it’ll probably be $800-890 max. I need at least $100 to survive the week so now I’m down to $700-790. I plan on letting the office know this is all I can do and I’ll be back AGAIN next week with another (smaller) payment but I don’t know if they’ll accept it. And if they don’t and they file eviction, Ashley will be a) fucked because her name is the only one on the lease and b) blindsided because she knows we’re behind but she thought I paid rent in full or close to it for April even though I did explain earlier that I didn’t have my part. At the time, I think she was just in a mood and said she didn’t care, they can take her security deposit, etc but I think now she does actually care and wants to leave on good standing. Our lease ends June 31st.

TLDR: We’re two months late on rent because 3/4s of us didn’t have our rent. 1/4 got it together but the other half (including me) didn’t and now I need to either convince the landlord to give us time to pay down our balance or let my roommate know we probably have to move soon...",19May2018,1

But still, it seems like people are not drawn to me. It's not that they avoid me, it's just that I feel that they perhaps think I'm awkward, dull or uninteresting. I suck at telling stories and I'm often nervous in social situations which makes be stutter sometimes and my tone of voice is all over the place.

Therefore I have no real friends except maybe my coworkers, but I rarely hang out with them outside of work. I have difficulties forming connections with other people.

 So before he started stalking me, he wasn’t as noticeable until he tried to harm me (idk what he was trying to do, but he started mumbling something and ran after me, I freaked out and ran away).

Now this guy randomly scares and stalks me on purpose.
He would pop out of nowhere on my way back home and follow me.

 He’s stalking my family members too. When I get home, he’ll look at my window for about an hour and wait till I open them (because I always open my windows when I get home).

He would use the door phone and call me on purpose in the middle of the night just to check if someone’s home. 

He’s scared of crowds of people and would follow me when no one’s around. He knows where I live, he lives in my neighborhood but I have no idea exactly where.
He’s super unpredictable.

The worse thing is that I’m fucking afraid. I’m afraid of being alone now because I know that this freak might break in my house and try to kill me . I have no evidence against him so that’s why the police won’t take action and if they know that’s he’s mentally ill, they won’t charge him. They can take him to the mental asylum, which is full of people like that, keep him there and after short period of time let him go and he will return and things will get so much worse.

274,"Hi everyone. So I am a 16 year old guy and I was wondering how would I go about getting a summer job. I have had 2 other work experiences (as part of school work so I have never had a job where I was paid), the first one was just the worst. The staff were so mean to me and I thought it was my fault and that it was normal for stuff like that to happen until I told my friends and teachers, They told me that I need to leave that work placement. 2nd one was amazing though, I finish that job in a few days.

I live in a small town and I have written down about 20 places I could ask for work in. I have made a CV aswell. My question really is:

Is it appropriate to ask a staff member of any shop ""Hey, could I maybe leave my CV here?"" even if there is no sign on the door requesting additional staff?

I'm 23 and I live in a large city in the west.  I went to University full time for 4 years(2 different schools) and spent the last 2 years of that also working full time with a large company.  I had a hard time managing both school and work, so I elected to take some time off school and take a promotion with the my company, which entailed me moving about 14 hours away. I'm making about 50,000 per year right now.  However, I am getting really burned out on the job and despite moving to a city that I've enjoyed traveling to in the past, I am tired of the work and very lonely. There are real possibilities for me for further promotion but I am not too excited by the prospect of the job or the responsibilities, at this location or any other.  The people I work with don't like their jobs either and I feel like I'm knowingly trapping myself. If I were to take the promotion,  I will have reached the end of my career trajectory without my degree I think. Financially, I would likely be making 60,000-70,000 in the next position. I have no debt other than about 25,000 in student loans and I am single. I have about 1.5 years of school left (full time) with my current degree plan in communications(of which I have no interest other than having a degree.)

I like taking care of/helping people in one capacity or another. That's what initially drew me to the place I am now, but I feel hamstrung by my upper management to accomplish that goal. I would be interested in going to nursing school, but I would need to quit and move back home to do that, as well as basically restart my education. I wouldn't call nursing my dream, per se, but it seems more fulfilling to me and the pay would be comparable to what is ahead of me on my current path.

Hi, I'm Kile, a pessimistic, introverted, ugly loner. For the past several years I've been in this odd state where I don't know where to go with my life. I have no particular set of skills apart from the fact that I like cars, detailing cars, and working on cars (which I have very little knowledge of but the internet is a wonderful place to learn). For the past 2 years since I graduated HS, I've been a loner. I've dated a few girls which happened to be long distance relationships that haven't worked and I am no longer on speaking terms with them. I have no friends, and by that I mean the only person close to being a friend is my cousin, B, who I occasionally play CoD with but I feel like he only invites me to play because 1. I can dominate in 90% of the games we play and 2. He probably understands that I don't have friends or people to talk to so he feels bad. 

Outside of home I am a very shy and quiet person, I work as an auto detailer, make shitty pay ($10/hr 40 hour weeks), own a decently shitty car, and that's it.

24/f - We have been together 8 years , married 2. 

Our bedroom life is beyond destroyed, we are working around it but it's at a place where it will never be even slightly the same as what it was. 

I have no hobbies and no friends but I have a very very over active imagination, to the point I can stare at a wall and create a full original series inside my head.

 Work was boring, I was on night shift, I decided to write for the first time, putting my crazy imagination to use. One thing let to another and I was 11 months and  2 books into a very very successful 'wattpad' series. I'm talking millions of readers, constant emails and messages of fans. I loved it! I could only think about what to do next, it made me so so so happy! I finally had a hobby and f**k me , I was good at it. 

But .. now the time for where the question starts to make more sense. 

I had sex scenes. Let me make it clear, it was NOT an ""adults"" only book. I had these type of things in a  separate book that only adults could see. It made the character more ... Human... More .. understandable and it was only 1 or 2.

My husband found out. Read the two books and had melt down (never had an interest in them in the whole 11 months I was writing, but I did hide them from him, making sure he never asked) . He was jealous, said ""you're writing about a man you want and love, he is everything I'm not!"" 

Things got bad. I was about to leave, when we talked it out and worked out our other issues. I agreed to stop, it meant a lot to him. Our relationship is worth more than a story. 

But.. I miss it so much. It's been ...7 months? And I still have the itch to go behind his back and secretly type up some chapters. If he finds out he will be distraught and Im scared to think about what he might do. 

What do I do?

281,"I hired someone for a domestic/personal assistant. It’s a very basic job. I pay extremely well because I don’t want to do it myself first of all and I want someone that can just look at the list and follow it. Like move that chair sweep underneath move chair back. Empty those totes and put everything alike together, and tell me how many of each I have.  Bring in mail and put it in the mail basket labeled mail. I hired someone I really like. She is a very nice person. Throw anything in the refrigerator or cabinets that is expired, away. The main problem is no matter how many times I tell her I need to not be bothered, she forgets. Instead of putting the mail in the basket she brings it to me and with me to acknowledge it and thank her and sometime she wants me to open it so she can take the garbage to the garbage can. I cannot express how much she needs my involvement. For example do these to go together, me “yes they are both blue Masks size xl, those would go together“
She appears to be a normal person. She graduated from high school. She needs so much feedback and encouragement and praise it turns me into a very irritable boss. Here’s the rub, she’s extremely nice. She cannot hold down a job. She wants to work desperately. If she is mentally slower than other humans in her demographic, I wish I would’ve known that ahead of time. Now I’m paying her a premium rate because I assumed that she could do simple tasks without talking to me about it, or begging me to get up, leave what I’m doing, break my train of thought, and look at the shelf that she is proud of. I don’t think I have the heart to fire her. For that reason I’m starting to hate her and I both. Ive been mean to her. If you’re going to say flat out tell her to leave you alone… I’m a very straightforward person. That was in the advertisement, that was in the interview, that was clarified when I hired her, that was once again clarified on her first day of work and at least 20 times since then. Having conversation with her is very normal. She appears fairly normal. This sweet, single mother, that cannot find a job, is driving me over the edge of irritation. What am I going to do? Oh man. If she had let me know that there was a thinking issue, I would’ve probably still hired her. 
There’s a lot of good things about her. She would never steal from me. That’s an issue. She doesn’t do drugs and probably never will and isn’t around people that do drugs so I feel safe having her in my home. She will work hard. She very much wants to do a good job.
I dread everyone telling me to let her go. If I could afford to pay her to not come to work, I probably would.
I guess the main problem is I’m paying her $25 an hour, specifically to do basic crap that I don’t have time to do so I can be left alone to work. She can’t leave me alone.",19May2018,1

286,"So, where to start...my FSIL (21) has never liked me. She judged me based on a situation that I was in when I first started dating my BF (her older brother); I had a crazy ex-boyfriend who kept trying to make my life a living Hell because I caught him cheating on me with numerous women, including some of my female “friends.” That’s a story for a different time, though. Anyway, to get back on track...

When I first met BF’s family, I immediately took a liking and connected with my FMIL (a JYMIL) and I got along with my FFIL when it came to conversation topics like the weather and cars. However, FSIL was a completely different story; she acted like I didn’t even exist. I tried greeting her and introducing myself, but she made no effort to even look at me. While I was able to brush it off for a little while, I asked BF if I had said or done something to upset his sister; he told that she hated me, but that I had done nothing to cause that...okay? He offered no explanation after that.

From that point on, she kept telling him things that she didn’t like about me (things that she didn’t have any right to assume about me). She said that I would hurt him and that I was probably cheating on him. She said that I spent too much time with him in his room and not enough time in the living room whenever I was over at their house. She complained about me a lot from what I understand. 

She seemed to be judgmental, ignorant, arrogant, and that she thought herself above everyone else in this world. Basically, it looked like she thought that she was just SO perfect. The smug look on her face all of the darn time...plain irritating...

I kept trying to talk to her and interact with her because BF told me that she liked when people would try with her; it didn’t work. At least not in the way that I was led to believe that it would. FSIL told BF that she could be “civil” with me, but that was it (she still hated me). As time went on, I found out that her being civil with me meant that she was just going to ignore me. Great.

From that point on, I was ignored; however, I could feel the hate and dislike coming from her whenever I was around. I couldn’t even stand to be in her vicinity. I felt way too uncomfortable and kind upset around her. I would leave any room that she entered or I would actively avoid her whenever we would have t be around each other at family gatherings or whatever. This caused a rift between BF and I because he felt caught in the middle, not knowing what to do.

Months into this, I talk to my mom and ask her for advice on what to do about FSIL. She suggests writing a letter to FSIL and hand delivering it to her; I took her advice, but I had BF give it to her because I was too anxious to do it myself (severe social anxiety). Though, I worded the letter in a very civil and calm manner, even mentioning that I appreciated the few nice things that she did for me...she had a meltdown over it and claimed that I didn’t acknowledge anything and that she wasn’t a bad person (I never called her a bad person). BF comforter her and got upset with me instead. That was a fight that I never wanted to have, but I was not about to be told that this was all my fault. He even read the letter and told me that it was good BEFORE giving it to her. 

Anyway, things have cooled down since then, and FSIL has been acting a little bit better towards me, but know that she still dislikes me. How? BF tells me so...apparently, she just acts like she likes me when I’m around. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated on how to deal with this situation; I’ll respond to any comments on questions (I know that probably forgot quite a bit, writer’s block).

288,"Hi guys.

My partner and I moved into this complex less than a year ago with our then three-month-old daughter. The day we got the keys (as in, literally walking up to the step for the very first time after signing our lease,) I see the neighbor who shares the building with us (side-by-side duplex). I also see she has an official-looking person with a clipboard standing in the doorway, and as we walk up, she just says to us: ""By the way, I don't hit my kids, I only yell!""

No Hi, hello, my name is x nice to meet you... She has said two sentences to us in the months we've been here, and the first one was that. (The other was the night before Thanksgiving, my partner and I were cooking for the next day, and she yelled into our apartment for us to turn down our heat... which was not on.)

Now, I can understand yelling at your kids. I don't want to do that, but kids can be frustrating. However, I've repeatedly heard her calling her grand daughters who live with her (probably 12 or so years old) some *pretty disgusting things* (worthless cunts, bitches, useless, retarded, etc...)

I've called the cops on nights when I hear regular, sustained yelling, stomping and slamming. I've had times where someone seems to intentionally slam on the wall behind my daughter's pack-and-play. I don't do anything to instigate, because honestly she terrifies me and I don't want to escalate anything. If the yelling and noise is worse than a few isolated times during the day, I let my landlord know. So far she's on strike two. 

I have also called CPS back when it was really bad, and it seems to have died off a bit since then. However, just five minutes ago I hear her on the front step screaming at the kids (aged between 6 - 12) in the parking lot to ""STOP FUCKING SCREAMING"" ... Her self-awareness is baffling to me.

As I said, I'm pretty high-anxiety and non-confrontational. I have zero interest in talking to her whatsoever because she seems to have such blatant disregard for us. Is there something I can do? Do I just need to buck up and say something? If so, what the heck do I even say? I'm 99% sure she knows I'm the one who's called the cops on her in the past. ",19May2018,1

Soon applications will open for universties in my country and realising my opportunties are severly limited due to my grades saddens me greatly. I'll most likely be able to enter one of the 2nd tier universties, so by all means I'm probably about average. However, what saddens me is the fact that I, at a very young age \(I'm 19\), already feel I never quite lived up to my potential. I've always been told by my teachers and fellow students that I could with little effort graduate with straight A's, this was obviously not the case, seeing as my mindset is thoroughly flawed. I've resorted to a very half assed effort during all of my school years, which eventually became a sort of defense mechanicsm, that I could use if I wasn't the best at a school subject.

I really struggle to see how I can be able to change my mindset and actually give it my all, even if it should be mean I'm not the best. Also, my brother is currently studying abroad at Oxford, which could also be one of the reasons to why I do never give it my all, not even close to, that way I will never have to deal with not living up to my potential, as I could easily blame my work ethic to why I don't do as well as it is expected. I'm very sad and I feel hopeless seeing as I only just realised how significant this problem is for me and how it may already have defined what I'll be able to do with my life due to the lack of good grades... I've gotten straight A's in all of my exams, but yearly grades weight heavier in the calculation of my GPA in my country's school system.

They know which course is needed, which is more important for their career etc.

On top of the immature attitude towards my career, I'm a heavy top tier professional procrastinator. I'm so pathetic that even after creating a good study plan... Even after actually starting to study I can't concentrate for shit until before the night of my exam when the realization of how fucked I am actually hits me.

I (M/28) have considered myself to be a very fearful person in most matters of life. I have huge social anxiety, especially in places with many people and situations that put me on the spot, but can get quite comfortable and talk active in smaller groups. I also have minor/major depression episodes that come and go from time to time.

It sometimes seems like I am afraid of my own future, maybe because I can't see any good outcome. I am also very restrictive regarding my personal life, as I never invite anyone to my place because I fear ""I will be found out"". I have some acquaintances but very few I could call friends. There is not much going on in my personal life.

This year I made a resolution to accept new challenges and become braver. For example, I am accepting some public speaking to a large crowd (100+) opportunities in my job and preparing for it, which is something I always have been terrified of.

For this summer, I have reserved around 4/5 weeks of accumulated vacation time to dedicate full time to a specific experience/activity/skill that would challenge my core beliefs and could make me mentally stronger/braver.

Do you have any recommendation that would have the biggest impact in my life on the short and long term?

Now, for a bit of context, we'd made out some times before, and had a ONS earlier this year in which... well, honesty, I hadn't been amazing, and things were a bit awkward afterwards. So we make out a bit, get pretty into it, and she wants to get right away, leglocks and all, except lil' Johnson down there decided he's having none of it. Total unresponsiveness, not even a half chub. We do foreplay for a while, but as its clear that the sword of omens isn't getting any bigger tonight, she just says ""leave it"", gets her clothes back on and head downstairs to clean the mess of the party. So we clean it, she calls me a cab back home, and I do the ride of shame.

Now, I want to make a few things clear.

This was not whiskey dick. I had a few sips, but not even enough to make cheeks blush, and I've been going sober for unrelated reasons.

Its not lack of attractiveness, she's hot and those thighs and booty do make me crazy.

Its not bad eating habits or lack of exercise, made my New Years resolution to do better on those fronts and have been actually following it, and I had not been overweight or anything even before that.

And lastly, it had been at least two days since my last fap.

What it has been is a pretty big blow to self\-esteem, and I don't understand where it came from, what's going with myself. Have not been able to get it up since last night, also, not even non\-sexually like when it feels as if my bladder is going to burst. Except, while this is has been the most extreme, getting laid is once every blue moon and with this troubles getting hard have been more the norm than exception with hook ups. I'm in my very early 20s, this stuff is not supposed to happen outta nowhere, right?

I realize this may also come as a hit to the gal's self image and would like to reassure that it got nothing to do with her, but I frankly don't even know how to face her.

Like I said, I'm getting pretty self\-conscious and don't really understand wtfs wrong with me. Does anybody else have any experience with this, or help or any piece advice to spare for a brother?",19May2018,3
305,"I am literally the workhorse of the office.  If it wasn't for me then the dentist would not be able to come to work to do his job.  I previously worked with him in the Midwest and in 2014 he offered me a job opportunity long before he knew what state he would be starting his own practice.  In 2016, I moved across country away from my huge extended family and large group of friends and said goodbye to all I knew; the small town life.  
At first things were very overwhelming, I was the only assistant to him, another dentist and a hygeinist.  The practice was overwhelmingly filthy and unorganized due to the previous owner's hoarding and employee turn over rate.  It was a very successful office with a very large patient base.  It took months and months of hardwork and dedication but I have officially rid the office of the filth and disgust left behind from the previous owner.  I have organized,  disinfected and sterilized every inch of the office and I follow all OSHA guidelines only to be ridiculed and made fun of.   Anyways the point of the post ......
I ASKED FOR A RAISE AND WAS TOLD I NEEDED TO WRITE A LETTER AS TO WHY I DESERVE A RAISE. 
I immediately replied that it was a very odd request but I failed to mention just how offended the request left me feeling.  

We both know I deserve a raise and I really don't think it is necessary for me to write a letter.  I work 10 hour days that easily turn into 11, 22 hour days.  I still don't have the health insurance nor have I received the bonuses that he promised me before I made the move.  I have trained the other assistant to work at my level,  I launder the patient pillows and blanket on my own time with my own supplies, I drive my personal vehichle and use my own gas to run errands and gather groceries for the office,  I buy decorations for holidays and bring fun little things to keep at the practice, and if there is an issue I am to deal with it.  Please tell me how to approach this letter or how to tell my boss No and to give me the raise.",19May2018,19
306,"So there's a guy who is interested in me. He said he wants to talk and is being mysterious about it. I can tell he's gonna say he likes me or ask me out. He's a great guy, like really. I would be lucky to date him tbh. But here's the thing...

I'm still not over my ex (look at my profile and you can tell lol). I don't know why. It's been almost 9months  since we broke up. And my ex moved on fine. But I can't. I still picture my life with my ex. I see him in my future and think of what we did and how we did it and all those things. I can't picture anyone else. It doesn't feel right. 

This new guy, I don't even feel those feelings for him. I'm not sure what it is, like I said he really is great. I don't really know him as well as I would like to. We've only hung out three times and don't really talk often. 

I'm meeting to talk with him in a few days. And I know that I need to be honest with him. I know that. But I don't even know how to explain it. Cause I don't know why I'm not over my ex. No clue. And I feel horrible. I want to be friends with him, get to know him. And hey maybe over time I will have those feelings and be ready to date. I just don't think I'm ready for that now. But I feel silly saying that when it's BEEN 9 MONTHS. 

And I don't want him to think that it's him. You know? I don't want him to think he did something wrong. Or that he isn't cute or isn't nice or funny or whatever. I just feel horrible. Help :(",19May2018,1
307,"He moved his TV from his room down into the living room about a year ago, and ever since, that has been his habitat. Of course, he still ""uses"" his room to keep all of his stuff there....but he resides purely in the living room - watches TV there, eats there, naps there, and sleeps overnight there.

Aside from the fact that this is WRONG for financial reasons, it's also EXTREMELY irritating. He is the gossipy type, and he always rants to me about other roommates, and to other roommates about me. That's always been bad with him. But now that he is in the living room, he is situated in such a way that he can monitor EVERYBODY and their comings and goings. He can eavesdrop with crystal clear clarity on everybody's conversations. He goes so far as to keep track of WHAT TIME it was when so-and-so did such-and-such, down to the minute. He knows what time i wake up, when my alarm clock went off, when i had my shower etc.

Well, now that I've started dating somebody and would like to bring her over as a guest on occasion, I feel like I can't because: a) We obviously can't use the living room (a.k.a.... my roomate's ""space"") b) We have to walk up a long series of stairs to get to my room. Her and I both have anxiety. Why should it feel like we have eyes burning into the back of our heads the entire time we walk up there? It feels like we are infringing on his space by walking through the living room, and i just KNOW that he's keeping tabs on us. How can we ever get comfortable this way?

So, about a month ago, I notified my landlord - who doesn't live in the house with us - that I would like him to have a meeting with he three of us where I could express my concern. I did, and the roommate said he would move his TV back into his room and start living there again......but the only problem is that once the landlord left the house, the roommate was clearly annoyed and offended by this. He no longer talked to me, made eye contact with me, didn't respond when i asked him a question etc. Basically throwing a hissy fit. He started sleeping in the kitchen, because ""technically"" that wasn't the living room...so in his mind he was following the rules. But he did this to purposely annoy me. Because this made my anxiety even worse, I caved and told him he could move back into the living room. He did, and he immediately changed his attitude back into the jovial, cheerful type. Obviously, this annoyed me even more.

I've been trying to plead with my landlord to do something to rectify this issue through email and text, but of course he always drums up the excuse that he is ""busy"" and can't deal with this right now.....but of course he has no problem ""dealing"" with making the trip to the house on the first of every month when the cheques are nice and fresh.

I'm just so tired and exhausted from this. But I like where I live and don't want to move. After all, why should I just because this guy is being a jerk?

As you can probably already tell, I have anxiety...but I also have bouts of depression. If I want to come down the stairs in my pajamas to make a tea, or grab a snack, or invite somebody over for a little bit, why can't I do this without feeling like I have to answer to somebody? I come down the stairs into the living room and ""BAM""...he's right there in my face. He is there 24/7, 365 days per year..and the only time he seems to leave is to go outside to have a quick cigarette.

I feel helpless. I feel hopeless. It's gotten to the point where I don't even look up to make eye contact, because I just don't want to talk to him. I hate that I tried to have an honest meeting as a group to come to a solution, but yet all he had to do was be a big crybaby and he gets his way. He gets 2 rooms for the price of one, and I can't do anything without feeling like tabs are constantly being kept on my life. I know it probably sounds silly/paranoid to think this way, but I can't help it. I hate being put in this situation.

I feel like a prisoner....and like i'm slowly being driven insane.

Help me...please :(",19May2018,1

I've tried some online personality/career test, got some personality type called INFJ but I mean these online tests are just online and are not conducted by some psycholigsts who can confirm that this truly would be my personality type so i can't take these tests for real.

Sometimes I think how nice it would be if there'd exist a machine you could just walk through and after you've come to the other side you get a result that says what job/education you'd thrive in the most and you'd excel the best in.

just to give some background info I'm 23 and work fulltime with no college education. I will read a random college evening course this fall most likely but those courses are not any courses you can get jobs in after they're more for fun.

311,"So before I start I know how dumb this was. Trust me. 7 months ago I sold my husband's car because the transmission was failing and i was told by 2 unrelated mechanics that it was totaled considering the age, model, and the specific issue. Well shortly after that we had garaged the vehicle on insurance and then my husband lost his job. This resulted in us having to move across the state very quickly for a new job for him and that we needed to get rid of the car. While my husband was out of town I had to sell the car, pack our place up, and drive across Texas with 2 dogs. Now unfortunately I was so stressed I really didn't think much about the plate or documentation or even reporting the vehicle sold. No one told me I had to do this, not my parents, not my in laws who all knew I was selling the vehicle to a junk yard. Is it their responsibility? No. But it was my first time selling anything and as I said I was losing my mind with stress. Yes, I know that's so completely dumb and I'm not sure what came over me, I'm normally much more prepared. Well fast forward 7 months and nothing has resulted from selling the car, no weird bills or liability issues. I have tried to contact the junk yard I sold it to but they seem to only be interested in talking to you if you're selling something. I had informed my insurance company of the sell, so that is on record but no proof was ever requested. I work for my insurance company so I can see that there is in fact a record that I stated that I sold the vehicle. What do you think is the best route? Should I pursue the junk yard in an attempt for some sort of pursuit of proof of sale? Is there anything I can do without a proof of sale? I have no idea what became of the vehicle. Once again I can not stress enough that I am aware of how naive and dumb this was. But any advice pertaining to the situation would help. Many thanks in advance. ",19May2018,1
313,"First things first, I have an overall good relationship with my mom. I can talk to her pretty freely about any problems that are affecting me, and she loves me and cares for me deeply.  
About a year ago, I got in a real feud with my mom. Essentially, I sided with my father on a lot of issues when I heard the two arguing, despite the fact my mom was technically right (I can go into details if needed, but they shouldn’t really be necessary I don’t think).  
After a year in college and after hearing another argument between the two, I realized that I sided with my dad because my mom is extremely patronizing while she argues.  
Her arguments usually go like this:  
Step 1: explain what the other person is doing to upset her
Step 2: Imitate the other person, usually in a whiny voice, about what their argument “sounds” like or what they have been saying to upset her. 
Step 3: Keep cycling through accusatory behavior and imitation until the other person gives up. 
Step 4: Demand an apology from the other person (usually for “talking back” to her).  
How do I talk to her about this? The one thing I can’t talk freely about is stuff she does that affects me (usually, she just says “oh just wait until you’re older, it’ll make sense). Now that I’m significantly more independent and definitely not parented as much as last year (I’d say maybe a quarter as much? She really makes sure her kids can live on their own once they hit college), I’d like to talk to her about it but I don’t want to get in another massive argument like last year. Also, I’m staying home for the summer so I can’t just move out or something like that.

So, in the interim I hung out with her and got close to her only with the intention of being her friend. Time passes and a buddy of mine tells me that he has a crush on her too. He doesn't know I have a crush on her and I decide not to tell him. 

What was stupid of me was that I gave him advice to help him out even without revealing my feelings for her. In the end, she decided that she doesn't like him and throughout this time she was still with her boyfriend \(the advice I would give him is to wait until she's single and to not make a move yet in respect of her relationship\). After he and her talk about it, she reveals that she doesn't like him. He acknowledges that and things move on. 

After a period of time passes, he reveals to me that he still has feelings for her.

The only problem is that he knows that he has feelings for her. In the end of the day I am dating someone who i am interested in but am worried that my friendship may turn sour because I chose to help him rather than tell him the truth.

317,"Greetings fellow daters,

Let me start of by giving some background information. I come from an Indian background and grew up Canada. After graduating high school 8 years ago, I headed to India to pursue medical school. Throughout middle school and high school, my parents never allowed me to have a girlfriend because they wanted me to focus on my academics. When I began medical school, the same rule applied. I didn't argue because it really helped me score very good marks in medical school.

I am currently in Vancouver doing a residency program in pathology. I am earning a decent income (for now, once I finish residency and start working full time, I'll make a lot more) and live in an apartment. I should also mention that I'm an introvert. I've been playing the guitar since I was 9 so I'm very skilled at it. I also like to read and draw so there's no shortage of hobbies. My family is in Ontario so that leaves me with plenty of freedom and time to date. As I mentioned, I've never had a girlfriend. I'm also still a virgin because I'm not into casual sex of any kind (hooking up, FWB). What advice do you have for me? Will my lack of experience repel girls?

I had a cat sitter for 10 days. She is a very nice elderly lady at my work with a pet sitting side business. I’m a software engineer and she works as a security staff in the same building, so we don’t work closely. Anyway her task was to drop by my house (10 minutes from work) every day just to feed my two cats and pet them. I have self cleaning litter boxes and an auto feeder just in case, so really her job was just to pet the cats for a few minutes.

She charges $10 per day but I feel it’s too little. $100 for 10 days? Even though the job was easy it’s still a hassle. Previous cat sitting businesses I’ve used have been at least $20 per day. I want to pay her more but don’t want to offend her. If I add a $100 tip is that weird since it’s a 100% tip? What should I do?

It's been 5 days now and I still can't wrap my head around it. We hadn't fought in months, there were no signs of trouble, nor were we ever drifting apart in my opinion (we would see each other about 4-5 days per week and videochat often).

He gave me no reason other than that he had lost interest... in me, in our relationship... just...lost...interest. How could this be when there were no signs of this at all in our final 2 weekends together?

I want to know what I can do to convince him to give our relationship another try without scaring him off permanently. I feel like this break-up was just too one-sided and unfair. He begs to differ. He says it was a long time coming. Then why did he wait until after our anniversary? My heart hurts so much...it literally hurts.

I've tried begging him to change his mind. I've tried giving him his space. I just don't know what else to do. I keep telling myself that maybe it's closure that I need. But the more I think about it, the more I can't imagine my life without him. We used to plan for the future together. Our age gap never hindered our relationship. This is all just so sudden.

My fiance makes cheating accusations at me every so often and accuses me of flirting with some of my guy friends he hasn't met yet. H'es even gone to the extent of pretending to be me on my social media apps on my phone. I recently put a pass code on my phone so he cant do that anymore.
 
He also uses me for money pretty often to the point that my bank account might be shut down due to it being in high negatives.

My question is should i stay and keep trying to fix this relationship? I don't have a car or license, and no family or friends to move to in case if i do have to leave him. And my town has no homeless shelters.

333,In 2016 I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I am gay. I was at a party and this straight guy kept giving me cigarettes and alcohol all night. I had spoke to him about if he could ever do anything with a guy. He told me that he didn't know if he could do anything with a guy. Later that night he went into the bedroom and I followed behind him like three seconds later. I wanted a cigarette. I asked him for his cigarettes and he kind of pointed at his pants so I reached in to grab them. I saw that he had a boner so I thought this meant that he was into me. I started kissing his neck. He was mumbling and still moving his arms around. Then I laid in his arms and laid up against him. I started to give him a blowjob. All of the sudden he was like whose there. I got up confused and went and slept on the couch. He went into the room and had them lock the door. He told my cousin and her boyfriend to not say anything to anybody and that he wouldn't beat me up because I had mental problems. After all of this happened he still hung out with my cousin and even dated one of her good friends. I feel awful and I would never want to do anything to hurt anybody. It took me a long time to admit to myself that I did something wrong. I was confused and I didn't want to say I did something so awful. I have felt so much guilt this last year. Everyone tells me to go on but how do you go on when you have ruined someones life?  I was raped myself a few weeks before this happened and the idea of me causing someone so much pain is killing me. A part of me feels like I deserved to be rape and that it was karma for what I was going to do to him. People tell me I am a good person but I don't feel like one. I wanted to be a social worker and to help people but how can I help people after doing something so awful? How do I move on? How do I fix this mistake? Do I deserve to live? ,19May2018,2
334,"So I've been thinking about this for a while and I can't seem to get anyone in my life to give me a real opinion on it, so I'll try here.

I am a uni student and I started dating my current gf like the first month of freshman year (rising junior currently). She's great, kind and loving and fits all my emotional needs and she's my best friend.

Here's the hang up. She is my first real relationship, and I'm hers as well. I'm not the player type, and I'm looking for someone I want to spend my life with. She's definitely a contender, but the thing is I'm afraid I won't be content down the road not ever playing the field and only dating one girl seriously ever.

Another element is she wants to wait until marriage for sex for religious reasons, which is totally her prerogative, but it has been a fight every step of the way to get her to do things with me (i.e. not intercourse but everything else). We've been dating for almost 2 years now, and I feel like it shouldn't really be as hard to get her to try things with me as it is, as long as I respect that religious boundary that she has set. 

Now I know theoretically if we got married that would change, but how am I to know if we're sexually compatible if we never do it before marriage? I don't think that it's possible to have a thriving marriage with a dead bedroom. It could be that she actually loves sex, but it seems right now that it's very low on her priority list, where on mine it's pretty important. 

So really the dilemma is should I keep in this relationship and risk not playing the field in college where it's so easy to play, or do I break up with her and risk not finding anyone I love as much as her?

TLDR: I'm a college junior guy who has had a girlfriend since freshman year (my first long term gf) who meets my emotional needs but not all my physical ones. Is it a good idea to stay with the same person all throughout college or should I break it off and play the field a little?",19May2018,1

336,"Hello. So I’m pretty small. I’m hardcore too, everyone get surprised at my strength, I fought a boy who was threatening me over text and was really getting close to me, if I didn’t start it - it would get over for me and I’m knocked out. This was last year. And I’m so annoyed at this dispiriting, traumatising action called fighting. I need to fight to defend man. I’m like a lone wolf where sheep try to eat me but they can’t.

337,"I have someone who I had considered a close friend continue to text and sometimes call my husband. It’s usually every 5-6 months and pretty consistently. He’s the one who brought it to my attention but I kept putting it off and telling him he was crazy that she’s just being friendly. She hasn’t said anything completely inappropriate, but the theme is that she will text or call him to invite him out or to party with her (and her friends and sometimes her husband). She specifically only invites him and not me. Sometimes she invites him when she knows I’m not available (e.g. the week before my due date for my daughter she invited him to a beer festival and concert). She recently called him again and he pulled me into the room to listen, and she was inviting just him out to party with her and some of her other friends for the night (friends that I don’t know) which included strip clubs. Her speech was pressured and she sounded nervous. She kept trying to maintain conversation even though he was not being responsive then she was texting him the day of the event about if he was going to go with them and kept referring to him by his full name. The weird part is that when she texts me it’s not often and I hardly get a response from her within a few hours but she kept trying to go back and forth with him via text without delay and never once mentioned me. He decided that he is not going to answer her anymore, but I’m not sure if I should say something or just let it be, but this has been an issue for awhile now and it makes me want to avoid her but that would be awkward since we’ve known each other for so long and our families are close.

340,"Hey guys,

I'm really struggling to wrap my head around this foreign concept. I'll give you some backstory. I just need someone to help me better understand what the hell I've gotten myself into.

I met this guy on Tinder and initially I didn't even want to respond to his messages because I wasn't as interested in him as I thought I would be but then he asked me to go to a comedy show with him which I thought was really cool so I responded. I sadly had to decline because I had work early the next day but we ended up hanging out anyways. So I come to realize... I'm definitely interested. We get along so well and he's probably the coolest guy I've met on tinder. Trust me, I've met so many people off of it haha. We keep seeing/sleeping with each other over and over again, going out for lunches, dinners, etc. We're both very open with each other so I had told him about a guy I slept with in between times I slept with him and he didn't seem to care, almost seemed to encourage it, but then we went out to a bar with some of my friends, got drunk, came back to my place and he asked me not to hook up with anyone else. We wake up the next day and everything is all cool, he leaves and I go to work and a couple of days later I see him and we go out to the movies. It was a lot of fun, he had his arm wrapped around or somewhere on me through the whole movie, kind of like what COUPLES do. And that's when I started to over think everything. We do the same shit that couples do, ALL THE TIME. One weekend he slept over for 2 nights, cuddling, watching movies, drove me  to work, etc. So that night I couldn't help but ask him why he asked me to be exclusive even though he expressed that he didn't want commitment or a girlfriend. His answer was ""You can if you really want to, it's your body and I don't want to be controlling. But I'm not seeing anyone else and I would appreciate if you didn't either."" But it wasn't enough so I kept going and he brought up that he wants to travel some time this summer and doesn't know how long he will be gone for because it's something he has planned to do for a while. I also asked him to tell me if he catches feelings and that I'll tell him if I do. What does he want out of this? Did I just trick myself into a low key relationship? I'm confused? Every time I see him, he leaves and I have so many more questions to ask him but I don't want to be overwhelming. I don't know if I'm starting to like him or if this label is just driving me nuts.",19May2018,3
341,"I get really upset when I haven't heard from my partner, but I see them using social media. I want to know what is the rational way to feel about (being more consistent with social media than your partner) this issue. 

I deleted most my social media (Facebook and Instagram) and just have Snapchat and Reddit. So maybe I don't have the same understanding of someone who uses social media as much as my partner, who posts every few days if not every day. 

I'm upset now because they didn't acknowledge that I tried to call them early morning and didn't contact me in any way, but made the effort to post a few videos to Snapchat saying good morning. I was late for work and trying to pull through the day so I didn't even look at his snap til the end of the work day, and he had made it about 5 hours ago. 

He doesn't realize how special it makes me feel just to have him say ""good morning"" in a text to me, and how unimportant it makes me feel when the rest of the world gets more from him than I do. I feel like I'm usually the one reaching out and he just strings me along. Is it weird to want someone to think of you when the wake up? Because they are on my mind first thing.

Apart from our relationship-

-I have mental health issues.
So even though this situation is small and I realize that it's not very significant, what is-is what it can trigger. I begin a string of toxic thoughts.
 
* I am a nuisance to my partner
* I am unimportant

Which really goes deeper into thoughts of suicide because I'm so fucked and will always be stuck in this hell of a mind, overreacting to everything. Thinking about hurting myself mixed with suicide and trying to rationalize ""well you're upset so just let yourself calm down and these thoughts will go away"" and then remembering that even if you do not feel depressed or triggered, you WILL casually think about suicide.

Overall I think I'm highly unfit for a relationship but I'm really trying. We still haven't talked about it and I need some advice. I've been manipulated and gaslighted so much I can't tell when I have proper expectations or I'm being a nag.

343,"I hired someone for a domestic/personal assistant. It’s a very basic job. I pay well because I need to hand someone a list of basic tasks, and not have to supervise and or be involved. I set up to pay through PayPal friends and family. I literally have no time, interest, or energy for even more distractions than I already have. I was extremely clear about this. The title of my ad, “if you’re motivated by money instead of recognition, I’ve got a job for you.”
List example-hello, i’m very busy and cannot be disturbed. Work as long or as little as you would like to work today. Perhaps you see other things around here that need to tended to. I prefer if you address the list first. 
Mark off which you completed
Mark what time you arrived on the top of the note and what time you left right next to it. 
Take a pic and text the pic to me. If you need money urgently send me a text message and I will send it through PayPal within five minutes otherwise it will be paid within 24 hours. 
Domestic simple job, running errands, sorting things, moving trash can to the curb, move that chair sweep underneath move chair back. Empty those totes and put everything alike together, and note how many of each I have. Bring in mail and put it in the mail basket. Check the refrigerator and cabinets for anything expired, bag it up and put it in the trash can outside. 
Last week she went to the grocery store and forgot the refrigerated items. I mean, after she paid for them. Somewhere between checkout and the car she lost track of two bags of groceries. I called the store, they found them. I had to go pick them up. That cost me HOURS. I didn’t know and she didn’t know that the groceries were missing. I discovered them missing after I spent 20 minutes pulling espresso shots, I asked her “where is the almond milk”? By this time it’s been 2 ½ hours, so the manager that was there earlier wasn’t there, and the current manager went out to search the parking lot and found my groceries. He was even nice enough to replace them because it had been warm for too long. 
At least I wasn’t mean to her about it. 
She is a very nice person. 
The main problem is no matter how many times I tell her I cant have distractions, she forgets. Instead of putting the mail in the basket she brings it to me and stands over me to acknowledge it and thank her and sometimes she wants me to open it so she can take the garbage to the garbage can. 
If I make eye contact with her, I’m fucked. She wants a conversation about how well she cleaned a counter, what I’m working on, can she play music while she works, do I need any help in the office, can she bring me coffee. etc. 
This is gonna make me sound really bad, but the truth is I don’t want a conversation. I want to be left the fuck alone so I can work. Ive said that to her on a couple occasions. I cannot express how much she needs my involvement. For example: do these two go together? me “yes they are both blue Masks size xl, those would go together“
She appears to be an average person. She graduated from high school. She needs so much feedback and encouragement and praise it turns me into a very irritable boss. 
i’d say I’m not the first employer to be frustrated. Her work history shows, she is at a job for a few months and gets terminated or let go without any feedback. I checked her references. They were amazing. Every single employer had a weak reason why she no longer works for them. Assholes. 
She wants to work desperately. If she is mentally slower than other humans in her demographic, I wish I would’ve known that ahead of time. The kid that worked for me before, was still available to train her. To teach her the basic logical shit that I need done. He’s gone now. He went to Europe for three months, then starts college for his masters in another state. I hated to see him go. Maybe I’m spoiled. He worked here 20 to 30 hours a week for three years. He didn’t want to talk either lol. He just did what I asked and paid himself what he was owed. It was beautiful. 
Now I’m paying her a premium rate($30 hourly-in my area, that’s 3X normal pay rate)because I assumed that she could do simple tasks without talking to me about it, or even worse, begging me to get up, leave what I’m doing, break my train of thought, and look at the shelf that she is proud of.
I haven’t had the heart to fire her. For that reason I’m starting to hate her and I both. Ive been mean to her. That’s hard to admit. She started crying. Which made me want to cry, because I was trying to work. 
This sweet, single mother, that cannot keep a job. She is driving me over the edge of irritation. What am I going to do? Oh man. This can’t be a situation where she has too little life experience, she’s 30. 
For the record, I understand the value of follow-up and feedback in an employee employer relationship. I’m very good at encouragement. But I don’t want to do it when I am deep into a complicated issue.
There’s a lot of good things about her. She would never steal from me. That’s an issue when you hire someone to work in your home. She will work hard. She very much wants to do a good job.
I dread everyone telling me to let her go. If I could afford to pay her to NOT come to work, I probably would.
I asked her what was on her senior class schedule. I was hoping to glean some information from what classes she took in high school. That was the first time she didn’t wanna talk. Due to that defensive response, I assume someone treated her poorly because of a disability? Who knows.
I’ve hired and fired thousands of people in my life. This exact situation is far out of my comfort zone. She is childlike. 
At this point, my only choice is to tell her the job ended, thanks for the help, I won’t need her anymore? Then post the ad again, which she will no doubt see. 

Edit: yes I know I rambled.

347,"So this post seems very unlike my username but anyway

I've been in a relationship for over half a year now and I'm still not acquainted with my boyfriend's friends. He lives with them and friendship is very important to them so I tried to make an effort to get in with them. I made them brownies once which they liked a lot but didn't say to my face. I try to join conversations that they're in. But usually they ignore me. I thought maybe I wasn't making enough of an effort but my boyfriend did say it was pretty rude that they don't even greet me when they see me. Sometimes I greet them but again they just ignore me. My boyfriend also said it could be that they might just be awkward.

As of lately my boyfriend has been experiencing tension between his friends from living with them. He's been complaining about them for a few months now and talking very negatively about them and even saying that he doesn't want to hang out with them anymore. So I kind of stopped putting in as much effort with his friends since it sounded like they were treating him like shit.

Cut to a few days ago and he's hanging out with his friends like nothing happened, having a good time. He's now asked me to hang out with them all together tomorrow for the first time ever. I'm really conflicted because I don't have a good relationship with his friends. It's not necessarily bad but I do think that they're not that fond of me. I can talk to people really easily and usually don't feel awkward but they've been very challenging. I realize that this hangout is an opportunity for me to build the relationship with his friends, but I feel at a disadvantage since it seems like they don't like me already.

Any tips for making this go smoothly?
