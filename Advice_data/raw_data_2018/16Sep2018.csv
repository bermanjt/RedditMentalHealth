0,"Weird and somewhat ridiculous question, but I recently moved back in with my mother and little sister. They'd often complain about how bad I smelled, even though I haven't been sweating and have been sitting in air conditioning for most of the day. No ones ever mentioned this to me, even friends whove known me for  years, so now I feel really insecure, especially since I'm a clean freak who showers everyday, clean clothes etc. Should I just load up on the perfume?",16Sep2018,1
1,"Let me start out by saying that I am 15 (I know, “Aren’t you kind of young to be on Reddit?”) and that I love my mom just as much as everyone else, and this won’t change that.

Anywho, my mother who has been a wound care nurse for pretty much her whole life and has recently has started using essential oils. At first I thought she just liked the smell of the “rejuvinating” cense, but now she had been trying to get me to smell certain combinations for different sicknesses, or rubbing it on me for soreness. Two instances I can remember off the top of my head are when I woke up for school throwing up, where she handed me a soaked, cool we rag for my neck, which is normal, and then a small vile to smell for my sickness.

Another being when my back was super sore from sports, and she handed me an essential oil rubbing stick. It didn’t help.

I understand these are relatively mundane sicknesses or illnesses, however im afraid it will escalate. As of right now, she does completely support vaccination, but I’m afraid that will change. Would like the internet’s opinion on this subject.",16Sep2018,16

3,"Hello all, thanks for clicking. I’ll try to keep this as short as possible.  
 

When I was in high school, I was a good student: I was valedictorian, had excellent standardized test scores, was a good essay writer, played two varsity sports, student government, clubs, foreign language, et cetera. You all know the type. I was an eligible candidate for any university in the country (I live in the United States).  
 

My parents didn’t like the idea of my going far and forbade me from venturing a certain distance from home. I live in the Deep South, and the majority of the nation’s best universities fall outside of that range. I ended up going to a \*good\* but not \*great\* university, but I’m on scholarship, so I count my blessings even though it’s not a school I would have chosen to attend. My parents also didn’t like the idea of my studying anything impractical, so I spent my undergrad double-majoring in Marketing and Management with a concentration in entrepreneurship; I also minored in French, which was okay because it’s a minor. My school experience has been fine but not fantastic; I have to agree a bit with those who say that B-school is not as strenuous as it could be.  
 

Now I’m looking at grad school, and my parents have finally given me free rein on where to go (although not necessarily on what to study). The problem is that I’m not the exceptional student in college that I was in high school. I was pretty depressed for a while, and my grades are okay but nothing special (3.65 or so). I’ve had some internships, but again, nothing exceptional except for last summer, when I worked in Singapore. The company isn’t well-known, except in Japan. I haven’t had any major extracurriculars either. On the other hand, I did do a weeklong parliamentary simulation in Belgium, studied in Vienna for a semester and learned some German and a bit of Japanese to add to my French, so I do think I score well on the “international experience” front.  
 

I’ve always loved reading and writing, and I’ve written every day since my freshman year of college; to date, I’ve finished (but not published) two novels and have another four or five manuscripts lying about. The idea of being a novelist is really attractive to me—particularly considering its flexibility and independence—but it’s an uncertain lifestyle for sure.  
 

Basically, this is my dilemma: My parents think that I’m going to go to grad school for business. Firstly, most of the great schools won’t accept me for an MBA without years of work experience, so I’d probably have to go for an MiM or some other Masters. I would consider going to Europe if I got into an excellent school (like, say, the London Business School), but truthfully, I’m just not sure if it’s worth studying business as a grad student when I’ve done it for undergrad, particularly for a degree that’s not an MBA. Is the difference in material and subject matter so vast that it’s worth pursuing and paying for?   
 

Lately, I’ve been considering programs in both the U.S. and Europe for international affairs or literature/creative writing, but I’m nervous to tell my parents that because they might dislike it and/or refuse to pay. Probably they wouldn’t mind if, say, I got into Harvard or Oxford or something, but I’m not that kind of student anymore and that seems beyond my capabilities. Also, I have no real qualifications for literature/CW (I did get perfect standardized test scores on both Reading and English back in the day, but that was in high school and the schools won’t even see that) or International Affairs (except languages and some time abroad), so I feel like I won't be accepted to most places. I just don’t feel the motivation to go to B-school anymore, but I’ve never been a true gambler, and the idea of swapping that for a less-certain career as a novelist or something is a bit nerve-wracking even though I think I would prefer to study literature. No matter what I do in life, I feel certain that I’m going to continue writing, if that makes a difference, and I’d like to try to be published someday.  
 

Firstly, because I’ve already studied business as an undergrad, would it make a significant difference to study as a grad student (again, not in an MBA setting)? And secondly, is a Masters in Literature/Creative Writing/International Affairs somehow useless or not worth it? (IA would basically just complement my business education; I don’t really want to work in the field of IA myself.) I just don't know anybody in real life who has a good background to answer this, so I thought I'd ask here.

Sorry, this turned out longer than I meant it to be. Anyway, I’d sincerely appreciate any advice that you might have. (If I'm just being stupid, feel free to tell me, but please be nice.) Thank you for your time, and I wish you all a pleasant day :)",16Sep2018,1

6,"From an early age I remember my mother talking about the dangers of vaccinations and how a certain shot can cause autism etc etc you know the drill.

It was only at around age 16 that I realised this was nonsense. 

I haven't contracted any serious illnesses so far but over the last few years I have gotten the flu/common cold more frequently than normal. This is probably due to a poor diet (vegetarian) but aside from the lack of vaccinations I was raised in a far healthier environment than your average kid.

I brought the issue up to my mother at the time and she got very defensive. I asked her to research it but she started telling me that I think I know everything and that she had spoken to a doctor who told her nobody should need to be vaccinated.

I have 2 older siblings who have also never been vaccinated and they are both very healthy so my question is, Should I go ahead and get the vaccinations done myself now that I'm 18? 
And where can I find some good studies on the issue to show to my mother?",16Sep2018,123

Since about 6 months ago I've been receiving threats from Facebook users that immediately after messaging me disturbing videos of people being beheaded whit chainsaws and texts like: ""someone should do the same to you"" delete their profiles (meaning that I have no way whatsoever to report them or to try find any relevant information about them). Is not the I feel my life being particularly in danger because of this, but it surely is a pain in the ass to receive messages like this 2-3 times a week for no apparent reason, not to mention is creepy as fuck to think that someone will go all this trouble just to annoy or scare me.

very weird for this to continue after so much time. Any advice is welcome, thank you.",16Sep2018,4
9,"I’m using a throwaway and sorry for formatting because I’m on mobile.

So I am a first-year student in college this fall and I know I should be happy and grateful for everything I have going for me but I don’t know why I’m so sad all of the time. 

I was a hard working student in high school who was involved in only a couple of clubs and sports and volunteering. This all payed off for me because in addition to doing stuff, I ended up convincing a smaller liberal arts college that I deserved a full-tuition scholarship based off of merit. I am really grateful for this and I know it’s a really big deal. But I have never been far from home or my parents before and this college is 3 hours away from my home instead of the community college that is 20 minutes away that I would have commuted to. In addition, I was asked separately to play for the team there for the sport that I had played in high school and never thought I would get the opportunity. So not only do I get to continue the sport I love, I get to go to school basically for free besides room and board.

The people here are nice so it’s not a hostile environment but I’m losing interest in the sport and I am missing my family too much to enjoy the school. I have been here for a month and a half and I have only gotten a little bit better than I was the first week of being here. 

I’m not trying to use this as a moment to brag, I truly need help and all my parents say is that “It could be way worse” and they’re not wrong but still. I can’t figure out why I am always sad. I know other people have given up way more to be where I am and many others would give a limb to have what I do. I am grateful but I just can’t get over missing the comfort of home and my family. 

I feel selfish and I hate it but I have nowhere else to ask so please Reddit, give me guidance because I am super lucky to have what I do and I know I am supposed to enjoy it. Please don’t just tell me that it could be worse. ",16Sep2018,1

18,"  

Im  (21F) a college student that has been struggling my entire life about my weight and how I look in photos. Im 5’2” and around 155 pounds but I also suffer with large breasts that take over the entire top half of my torso. 

I was raised being constantly told I was beautiful; However, I have a double chin due to my genetics. No matter how much I weigh I have always had it. I’ve considered surgery and the new trend “coolsculpting” but those turn out to be very expensive ($1,500 a session and people say it takes two sessions for it to actually work). I’ve weighed the same weight ever since I was in high school. My family constantly asks if I’ve lost weight but I’ve just been wearing different clothes that aren’t as baggy as they were as I was growing up. 

When other people take photos of me I feel horrible. I have only had about one photo somebody else took that I truly liked. Recently my sister got married and my aunt was the photographer. She’s an amateur (it was a cheap rushed wedding so no professional photographer) and she showed me the photos she took. The one she took of me showed how disgusting my second chin really is. It was a side profile and my neck was as large as a frog. I went home and cried for hours about that. 

I know the diet industry is one of the biggest industries out there. I know that they prey upon insecurities of girls like me to sell their products and they create an image that is unattainable so that we can strive for it and spend more money in hopes of achieving it. I know these people I idolize on instagram with these incredible bodies were either born like that or they’re in their 30s and exercise constantly. I don’t have the time for constant exercise and my school tires me out enough already. 

Usually I can ignore how I feel about my body and sometimes I even find myself liking it but everything from the double chin to the loose skin and fold on my back to how big I feel in general always lingers in the back of my mind. I used to love taking selfies but now I find myself scared to whip out my phone except without excessive makeup because of how much I just kind of hate myself lately. 

The advice I’m asking for in the end I guess is should I really be worrying about this? Should I do something about this? What do I do? ",16Sep2018,0

We really found a few things we were both into and constantly talked. I have seen photos of her and while she isn't amazingly beautiful, she doesn't look to bad either. 

So fast forward one month and we are starting to get feelings for each other, I am still working on my license but have a car so I haven't been to her yet. One night while I'm working night shift she confesses to me that she has been sick for some while (which I had known). She tells me that it actually affected her brain and that causes her to not balance properly, she doesn't speak too well and you have to focus to understand what she is trying to say and she sometimes forgets thing, she has been classified as disabled. 

She told me she was afraid of mentioning it to me and said it would be okay if I did not want to continue, so I have thought about it these past days and I really don't see a future for us, the way I had been imagining her had been destroyed in my mind.

21,"I work at a gym as a front desk receptionist. My boss is a nice lady but she yells and screams at us when she is mad.. To make it worse, she has no attention span so she often gives contradicting orders. I recently had a situation that makes me feel like quitting

One night as I am closing a former employee walks in with his girlfriend who is a member of the gym. Member girlfriend says he is working on a contract training position with gym and is allowed to train her because the owner gave permission. I look him up in system and he is there with no notes or red dots to indicate he was banned so I allow them to do as they please..

The next workday, I mentioned that he came in to the owner and she got really mad at me. She screams at me that I should have called her, that she writes my checks not the members, and says that I need to listen. I tried to explain the story about what happened but she tells me that she does not care about what happened just that I did not tell her like I was supposed to. The other employees explain that this employee left on a bad note and that is why there was a visceral reaction. I feel guilty and stressed as hell.

The next work day, former employee and girlfriend walk in. They explain their situation again and I explain that the owner wanted me to contact them the next time they walked in. I call the owner and the owner speaks to the member, the member then hands me the phone and the owner begins yelling at me for not being welcoming enough and explains that they are in fact working on a contract trainer situation. The member and former employee give me the stink eye all night.

This is the second time an incident like this has occurred. I often find her screaming at me whenever I try to approach her. I try to ask if she got my corrected leave request form she screams at me. I ask when a treadmill is going to get fixed she screams at me. I am so stressed and I can not sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night and I can hear her screaming at me.

It payed my bills. My only issue with it was that it was a constant swing shift job. I have been wanting to go to school, and this job was not willing to work with me on getting onto a straight shift.

I had found another job with higher pay, and worked normal mon-fri office hours. I applied, got the job, and everything seemed perfect. I was going to be able to go to college!

I have about $750 a month in bills that I have been paying, and the fact that if I lose this job, means that I'll lose everything I've worked for for the past two years is killing me. I took this job so that I would have a schedule that would allow me to take college classes, and now just because I wanted to go further in life, I may lose everything.

My problem is that in my area it is already VERY hard to find work, and even harder to find a job that pays what my job does, and has the same Monday-fri hours that I do now.

It's like everything in life is telling me I'm a Fucking retard and I don't deserve shit. I have nobody who can help me. I'm completely in my own on this one.

34,"So here’s the deal. I’m 18 and i’ve gotten kicked out of home while in the first couple weeks at a community college in Northern Virginia. A good friend of mine that just moved up to New York for college a week ago called me to come up to New York and stay with him. I had just enough money for the train ride, and he already had payed a month of rent for a room (offered to let me stay for free until oct.2) So me being me, and making the craziest decisions, realizes “You know what? Fuck this. Fuck the shit I take from my family.” Now yes, this seems very rash and impulsive. Even if living with my mother and her husband was terrible, I should’ve called my dad and went back home to Hawaii. (Lived there for most of my life) I’m the type person to put myself in uncomfortable or hard situations, but always finds a way out. Hawaii was actually terrible, as everything I did there felt stagnant so I decided to move. I’ve actually only been here in New York (Long Island) for about 4-5 days now. I’ve had amazing conversations, and have made some connections already. Even started a $10 gym membership with my buddy, he’s started training me so I’m no longer a twig (feels great, forgot how much I enjoyed physical activity.) Here’s where shit gets rough: I only have about 60 dollars to my name right now. I’m getting about 1000 dollars from my class tuition refund, but that won’t process until the middle of this week. This money was going to cover my share of this month’s rent ($400), but unfortunately my roommate actually doesn’t have a lease (So he doesn’t have the right to a roommate or something.) I was unaware, but the landlord told us that I have until Monday or we both leave. Now my friend is all gung-ho about it and is set on moving out. We have each other’s backs for life and all that (been through some crazy ass shit together.. well still going through it), but I can’t do that to him since he’s already payed the first months rent, and probably won’t get his security deposit back. We offered the landlord an extra 200 for the remaining days of the month in desperation, so I could have a place to stay, but he said no. I’m actually going into work tomorrow at a food place (it’s really close), but if i don’t have a place to stay I don’t know how that’s gonna work out. My buddy’s mom has a colleague that would let us stay for 500 a month for 3 months in Queens as a favor to her (but again my friend already payed for this months rent, that’s a waste of money.) I came up with a few other ideas such as staying at a homeless shelter or in my friend’s car, but he’s 100% not gonna let me do that (and I appreciate the fuck out of the brother i’ve made.) I want to work full time and save up as much as I can until next year. Was pursuing English in community college, but i’m leaning towards going into Communications when I can afford community here (making connections is something i’ve always been good at.) Everyone I meet tells me I’m meant for great things, and that they wish they could have the confidence that I have. The truth is though i’ve always doubted myself, I’m just good at hiding it. I’ve taken control of my depression and have vowed to never attempt killing myself again, but an occasional doubting comes along. I now live with the “accept the things you can’t change, and have the courage to change the things you can” mentality. Any advice any of you could give me would be appreciated.

37,"Hi guys,

I work in retail (a cinema) and have to come up with a bit of a decision.

Basically, I worked for one cinema for about a year. Absolutely loved it. Made loads of friends and got on with everyone there. The cinema was a nice ten minute drive from my house. However I was a supervisor in the coffee shop and wanted progression. A job came up in a nearby cinema as a manager within the cinema side (not coffee).

 I got it and after a rough month or two I've settled in really well. Been signed off as a keyholder and can run the building single man. I've grown to really love the place and have spent the past 5 months there and am starting to do and perform really well in the job. Cons would be I drive an extra 30 minutes for it. So about a 45 minute drive every day.

A job has recently came up in my first cinema for the position I am currently in. There are about 4 or 5 other people in my position there and a few people have approached me asking me to go for it because it'd be nice to have me back.

I just feel like I'm really letting this new cinema down if I go for it. And imagine if I didn't get it?! How awkward would it be?

I really don't know what to do and I have no idea how to weigh my options. Has anyone experienced anything similar? ",16Sep2018,1

41,"So. I just transferred to a university about two weeks ago. My parents encouraged me to live at home to save money, so I never really looked into housing options. The only trouble is that the shortest commute by bus ends up taking two hours each way, and I already have a long day of studying and classes on campus. By the time I get home I'm burnt out and it's dark out and I have no time for homework. My counselor told me she's worried my commute will threaten to make me fall behind academically. 

A few friends of mine had another friend that was looking for another housemate. The commute would be 7 minutes from campus. I really love the feel of the place and the girls who live there. It felt really natural when I first considered moving in with them. 

However since I initially was going to be living at home when I submitted my fasfa form, I didn't receive any aid for housing. I sent in a request for a change in living-arrangement that will potentially qualify me for housing aid, however interest rates for a loan through the SELF Loan or Wells Fargo would be lower, so I decide to do that. My dad agreed to co-sign the loan with me, and said that he was positive it would get approved if he co-signed so it wouldn't be too risky to sign the house lease before everything was processed. I am supposed to go over tomorrow to sign the lease and today he told me that he only said he would because he didn't want me to screw up my finances by taking out a loan in my own name, but he doesn't want the responsibly of it hanging over his head for years. I would not be comfortable applying for a loan and signing the lease before I know if it gets approved if I did not have a co-signer. 

My relationship with my parents is getting increasingly strained and being at home is tense and anxiety-provoking for me. If it would be financially feasible to be a bit independent from them, I feel that would be good for me mentally and academically. However I understand that that is a huge privilege and that in life we often have to suck it up and muster through situations that aren't ideal because, well, we have to. 

Another part of this, though, is that after being yelled at by my father, I went over to my boyfriends as I didn't want to be in the house any longer and needed somewhere quiet to do my homework. I was visibly upset, so I told them what happened, and they right away offered to co-sign with me. In the past they have offered to be a ""backstop"" for me if I ever needed, even if my boyfriend and I broke up they say they want to help me. They assured me that the amount I would need to request isn't a scary amount to them and that they trust I will be responsible with the loan. They are so loving and supportive of me, I sometimes come over to their house even when my boyfriend is away at school, just to escape the tension of my own house. My mom feels jealous of the relationship I have with his family and would hate even the idea of me going over to work on homework when I don't want to be in our house. 

I have less than 24 hours to make a decision but I feel that if I can be assured that this isn't a monumentally idiotic decision, I want to do it. I am nervous about being in debt to my boyfriend's parents or that being too much to ask of them. I'm worried that, with tensions already high between me and my own parents, that me getting support from his parents will make them feel hurt and further make things tense between us. I feel if I stay just to not hurt their feelings I will grow resentful and depressed, but if I leave while they are feeling abandoned and animus toward me, I won't feel right either. I want to have a good relationship with them but I also feel like I need so badly to get the hell out of there.

So what do I do? Moving out and being able to be close to campus and focus on my academics feels like the most important thing to me right now. I feel like I need this. I don't have a lot of time to make a decision and I don't know if its the financially soundest choice for me, but say finances aside: do I leave and do so with the help of my boyfriends family? I know that would make my mom feel hurt and defensive. Do I stay and grow resentful toward them for making me feel held back? I also made a post with more of the financial info in r/personalfinance but I am also open to advice about this being stupid/sound financially. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I have no idea what to do. ",16Sep2018,0

Hello there,

I moved to Tennessee just over a year ago with my fiance (now husband). He has been exhibiting signs for a while now that he may need some mental health services but just will not agree to checking into getting some help. This past week he reached a boiling point and flipped out for seemingly no reason at all (usually how these things have been starting) and he informed me that he wanted a divorce. Since then, I have been absolutely miserable and looking to find a place I can afford on my own, which isn't much. I am between jobs (I start paid training for my new job on the 18th), have no other family and also have 2 small, well behaved dogs. I am looking for either a studio or 1 bedroom that is under $750 if possible. I am looking to move ASAP as his temper is becoming worrisome. I am physically safe and I do not think that he would hurt me but the emotional and psychological abuse is becoming too much to handle. If I hold on to every penny that I have to secure this new place to live, I also do not have any money to spare for groceries.

If anyone has any legitimate advice or resources on how to find decently priced rentals in my price range or for a grocery/food resource, I would greatly appreciate it. It is going to take a little while once I begin my new job before the paychecks start and I will need to have food to eat until I am settled and have things figured out.

Thank you so much for reading, I appreciate any response.",16Sep2018,1

49,"Hi! I'm in my third year in college (undergrad) studying a bachelor's that's not really my call but since I'm already more than halfway done I intend to finish it. That's relevant because last semester I lost my scholarship due to a failed course after several semesters struggling to keep my GPA on the required level. This resulted in having to cancel a year long exchange program I was going to go to (sorry if it's not clear, english isn't my first language). I'm a very extroverted person and find parties and social interaction as necessary to ""recharge"" my emotional batteries and before this semester I had a large, solid group of friends and could count on at least 1 friend that would go out with me if I was feeling like it. However, somehow the majority of that group left to study abroad at the same time (THIS SEMESTER) and I managed to lose a couple of [male] friends due to unsavory [sexual] attitudes and situations. So now, I'm left with 2 friends. One of them never goes out with anyone because she's in love and doesn't care about anything else and the other one doesn't really enjoy going out (which is ok) unless it's doing groceries or something. I made a couple of new friends but they're superficial. SO, I'm asking for advice on how to cope with this? I feel lonelier every day (or night) that I spend watching netflix or browsing ig, and it's specially hard on weekends when I used to always have a plan or at least someone to hang out with. Maybe, what is it that everyone does when they stay at home? Just watch TV? Or? :-( ",16Sep2018,2
50,"Hey, I'm currently studying to be a nurse and have gone to my clinical site twice this semester. I think I'm a failure already. I had one job to do and that was take vitals. I think I assessed the BP incorrectly and should have reported it to a nurse, it's only now that I realize this. Two days later. I'm so worried about it I can't stop thinking about that girl and I'm worried she's not okay and it's my fault for not reporting her BP. Who messes up vitals signs? Literally the easiest thing about being a nurse that I've been practicing for about 3 weeks already and I screwed up! I feel like I'm learning the material theoretically but can't apply it to real life at all! I feel like I'm too stupid to do such an important job. I'm never going to initiate anything in clinical ever again.

Earlier that same day, I had to help move a man who was completely immobile in his bed. The sight of him all curled up and so thin, unable to speak and barely able to even smile, made me start to tear up. He was so easy to pick up and move because of how skinny he was. The tears almost fell out when the one time he finally verbalized something was when he screamed out when he was injected with medicine. When I told my sister about what happened she said she hoped I wasn't looking at him with pity because that's the last thing he needs. I realized it's true, and I felt terrible for not controlling my emotions and facial expression. 

This was barely the tip of the iceberg, I'm scared I'll mess up on more serious things in the future since now I realize how incompetent I am applying what I learn in practice. I feel so dumb.

Her- I don’t have a ride, 😒 I don’t drive lol

Me-Oh..so...you’re not coming?

Her- I’m trying to come

Me-oh, I wish you would’ve just told me. I would’ve gladly came and picked you up? 

Me-How about I just come get you and we can grab something local?

20mins go by....

Me- If you don’t think you’re going to make it, can you just let me know? It’s been an hour already and I’m just sitting here waiting for you.

Why wouldn’t she tell me she doesn’t drive prior to her committing to be at my house at 7:30? Why wouldn’t she just ask me to pick her up? I truly felt like we had a connection and she seemed to think so too. I would never just blow someone off like that, so I’m just pretty hurt is all. If she’s even still interested, should I give her another chance? I know she talked about her anxiety so maybe that was a reason?

Hey all,

So this is a random post, but something that's been popping up a bit for me recently. Sometimes i'll be sitting and chatting with someone, and then suddenly they'll start to confess random stuff that they did to me. I don't really know how to respond sometimes. And especially when someone is in break-down crisis mode, i don't want to make them feel unheard/invalidated by agreeing with them lol. I also don't think that what they did is okay though, so i don't want to justify it either.

Example (these may or may not be true): ""I stole money from someone and now they are out to get me. I don't know what's wrong with me."" or ""I called my wife a whore. I'm a horrible person."" or ""I worked with children while using drugs. I'm a horrible person.""

Idk...does that make sense? Like none of those things are okay....but blame and pointing fingers isn't helpful when someone is feeling really remorseful about what they've done. But that being said....especially when someone KEEPS doing the same thing over and having the same response, then its like...hmm...maybe you need to change some things, ie: calling wife a whore various times over the span of a year, and feeling bad about it afterwards. Cause that's absolutely not okay...but i figure if I shame someone, it might shut them down even more and it won't be conducive to any real change.

Does that question make sense?

Anyways, please let me know what you guys think :)",16Sep2018,1

Steve and I have been best friends for about 10 years. We met in kindergarten, and we've been close for every year since. Steve introduced me to Randy maybe 1-2 years ago. Now, Randy was a senior at the time he and I met while me and Steve were freshmen. Randy met up with a girl in our grade and they got into a relationship. I later came to find out that the girl and Randy separated because Randy touched the girl sexually without consent. The girl eventually took it to court and got a restraining order on Randy. (Information received from the girl herself.)

Now, something about Randy doesn't sit well with me, and not just for the fact that he got handed a restraining order. It seems to me like he has something BIG to hide. Don't get me wrong, he's pretty damn funny and friendly, but he doesn't seem right.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to add is that my parents GREATLY dislike Randy. I told them about the restraining order, and they told me to cease all communication with Randy, which I already had done.

She's been super playful with me since we started talking in high school so complimenting her and actually being nice may seem weird and possibly might make her uncomfortable. I want to talk to her more or at least get her to warm up to me, but I'm worried that she's not interested and I'm just being annoying. Any tips on how to get her to open up or at least be more interesting? Is there a chance for me or should I leave her be and give up?",16Sep2018,1

70,"For some background: 

-one of my close friends is in marching band and she convinced me to step in to fill a hole (someone quit after they were written into the program) so I joined as a favor 
-I joined marching band late, about a month in, so I was already way behind everyone else (and still am) not to mention that I’ve never done it before so I never properly learned how to march 
-since I’m just filling a hole, I can’t really play my instrument, I’m just holding it and marching

I have a lot of friends in marching band which is why I joined in the first place but none of them are in my section. I always try to talk to my section but I just can’t make friends with any of them. They’re annoyed every time I make a mistake, to the point where they’re just plain rude to me at every practice. They were nice to me literally once when the director complemented me lmao. 

My grades have suffered tremendously. I feel stressed out and miserable all the time now because of band. Since I’m also doing forensics, debate, starting my own club, volunteering, and taking 5 APs it’s too much and honestly marching band is not a top priority of mine. It’s caused my physical health to suffer because I’m barely sleeping and I don’t have time for healthy dinners anymore. 

It’s also affected my mental health because 99.9% of the time at practice is spent with my section, not to mention I feel a lot of pressure to catch up by the first competition which is coming up (I only know half the show)

Some bad things about quitting would be 1. My section would hate me forever and I have classes with a lot of them 2. The director would hate me forever 3. I payed the money already would not get a refund 4. I bought a stupid hoodie because I was excited to join at first 5. My section has a thing like secret Santa’s and my quitting would mess up the pairs 6. There will be a hole in the show making it harder for the people around me 7. Idk I kind of liked the sunlight and exercise 8. I wanted to go on the big trip they take each year 

I’m so burned out though that I literally almost started crying at practice randomly one day. Idk how much more of it I can handle. My real friends in it will understand but the rest of the band will be mad",16Sep2018,14

75,"Hello Reddit. 

I've always had trouble socializing. I can remember when I was little I just didn't know all those unspoken rules everyone else seems to just get. I didn't know that I had to go and ask if I could play instead of waiting for others to come to me, people were mean to me and I didn't realize it, for a really long time I couldn't get sarcasm, and I just couldn't relate to people. All I've learned about socializing has been through books and my brother. Even know I struggle. I still don't know when others are mean to me,  I can't start conversations, and sometimes I don't know if people are joking or serious, among other things. 

I didn't really think much of these for a while. Sure, it was annoying and it hurt, but I thought everyone went through it. It wasn't until I remembered an autistic classmate I used to have that I allowed myself to think ""Could I be autistic?"" 

And suddenly so many of the behaviors I used to have made sense. The worst part is I still have most of these behaviors, I've just learned to squash them because according to my parents they made people think I was strange. 

I know that I cant know anything for sure unless I get an official diagnosis. Even if I'm not autistic it would be nice to get that out of the way, and to possibly figure out why socializing is so hard for me. Maybe even get a therapist to help me out. 

The problem is, I have no freaking idea how to tell my parents. They believe so much stigma. Last year in December I told them that socializing made me anxious. They got me a therapist but I only saw her for six months before my mom decided that if I didn't get ""fixed"" she would hit me with a spoon, because what was her ""therapist"" as a kid. Now I don't let myself be anxious around her. 

But it would be even worse if I told them I though that I could possibly have autism. First of all, they would blame it on me being on my phone, even though I've had these problems since before I even knew what the internet was. Second of all, they would say something about me not being ""retarded"" and that if I was autistic then I would flap my hands and make weird noises (which sucks because I actually used to spin and jump when I got excited until they told me to stop because it was annoying). I really want help because school is largely centered around socializing and even if I don't have autism it'd be nice to have someone help me with that, but I have no idea how to go about it. Reddit please help?

**TL;DR** I might be autistic, I've shown symptoms of it in the past, and I want to tell my parents so if I am I can get a therapist or social skills counselor. However my parents believe tons of stigma and could yell at me or do nothing about it. ",16Sep2018,5

77,"OK, this isn't a situation that's gonna work out well as the old nursery rhyme. I could surely use some advice though:

Family member living with me is trying to eat vegetarian, hi protein. Whereas I recently turned allergic to milk and milk products. So I gave up on vegetarian for me. I eat mostly almond or cashew or coconut milk based food. I'm very allergic to say, just the smell makes me sick to my stomach and soy cooking with ethnic herbs on high heat will made me literally ill. Peanut butter is another allergen. High fiber food causes abdominal pain.  (Yes, there is a disease process behind the long allergy list and fiber intolerance, I'll spare you the details.)

My question: I want my family member to feel at home, build muscle mass, and able to have choices besides rice eggs milk, cheese, breads and so on. Yet I literally can't stand the smell of cooking soy, the resultant migraine means I'm too ill to go to work and I'm out of absences.

Amy suggestions for food for my family member that won't have me vomiting from the smell? I've tried jamming a towel under the door to one room and staying there, while running a fan to the outdoors but I can still smell it. We don't have to eat together, I'm OK with my choices, but he feels his are over limited and I don't like making him unhappy.

79,"I (23f) really enjoy talking to this guy at work (22m). I've been here 3.5 months, but I haven't had too much exposure to him; only last week did I have a lot of one-on-one time with him. I wasn't particularly attracted to him at first, but I did really like his soft/caring tone of voice, his smiling personality and his humor.

Last Tuesday, when a group of 4 us at work were working in the evening at the store, but I was set to leave at 10, I REALLY didn't want to leave that day because he only started his shift at 7, and he was so fun thst I wanted to stay with him longer. When I stayed overtime, he asked, ""you're staying longer because you want to be with me?"" with a smile. He also said that if I stayed until the end of his shift, he will drive me home (which made me really excited!) However, being the shy girl, I was immediately shocked that he could even tell that I wanted to stay because of HIM, because I tried to pretend like I was having a good time with everybody. Also, the way he realized my feelings so fast showed that he's very perceptive about people's feelings.

Usually, my parents pick me up from work, but I really liked it when he drove me home so on Thursday, I purposely didn't call my parents for a ride. When I told him I'm going to take the bus, he said that he will use his break time (30 mins that he never takes anyways) and drive me home during his shift. He also kept asking me, ""why don't you ask your parents to pick you up?"" even after I gave him my excuse answer of ""they're tired and I don't want to bother them"", so I suspect that he doesn't believe my excuse. Also in this car ride he started biting his nails which I pointed it out and he stopped (but could this be a sign he likes me and was nervous?).

On Thurs he also told our colleagues (in front of me) about how I stayed 2 hours after my shift to stay WITH HIM (when technically it wasn't ONLY us; there were 2 other people with us). So it seems pretty clear that he knows I like him, but I think he wants a confirmation before making a move? Because he keeps asking why I don't call my parents as if he wants to know the REAL reason. We have fun conversations together, joke around a lot and smile, but I wonder if I'm not good enough (especially pretty enough for him, since there are more attractive girls at work).

I don't want it to be too obvious to him and my coworkers that I have romantic feelings for him, especially since I feel like the one who is trying TOO hard (staying 1 hour after work just to wait for him), but I also love being around him! I also worry about how he probably thinks I'm not pretty enough and this is what's preventing me from being even more bold. I am a shy girl so I don't even flirt. I try my best to pretend like I only see him as a friend, because I would feel more comfortable that way.

**Tl;dr: I stayed at work after I clocked out of my shift so I could spend more time with a male colleague. He might've caught onto my intentions because he keeps asking me why I'm staying longer and he doesn't seem to believe my excuses. Am I coming on too strong this way? (I don't want my coworkers to know I'm crushing because that would be so embarrassing) He ended up driving me home every shift that I work with him and I'm wondering if I should just tell him that he's fun and I like car rides from him. It seems like he wants a confirmation of my crush before making any moves or maybe he's not even interested. What should I do the next time I see him and what do you suspect he thinks about me?**",16Sep2018,1

I feel sick to my stomach if someone just pretends to punch me. I always thought it was because when I was younger my father would always get angry/violent with my behavior. They’re better now that I’m older but I remember once in school I said the word rape and had no clue what it meant. When I got home they beat me with a wooden spoon till it broke then used a metal one.

How can I overcome this fear? It’s almost like a crippling anxiety that’s permanently burned into my brain.

My roommate’s cat escaped yesterday and she didn’t seem too upset about it. My boyfriend and I spent hours looking for the cat and even helped make posters for the poor kitty. Not a tear was shed from either my roommate or her boyfriend. 

Flash forward to today, she texts me saying that one of her friends needs us to watch this adorable Doberman puppy for a few days. Of course I have no problem with helping, but now things seem a little fishy. My roommate did not go out once looking for her cat today and hasn’t really even mentioned the situation. Even weirder, when she brought the puppy in, she introduced it to her second cat saying they will “get along just fine”. 

Am I wrong to think she may have dumped her cat that doesn’t like dogs at a shelter just so she can get a dog? If one of my pets got lost, I personally would be a mess looking for my baby. The timing of everything just seems so off.

Do I keep to myself and just see if the cat shows up when I call the pound, shelters and such? Do I confront her about the situation and ask why she’s not concerned about him?",16Sep2018,1

About 3 months later, he stopped going out to see this person. He purchased a Zohar book and started to read it randomly throughout the day. Fast forward a couple years and now he’s not same person he was before. He doesn’t have any friends. He’s borderline passing in his studies. And his personality has changed.

He speaks to himself when other are around. He goes off on random tantrums and it scares all of us. Something that really brothers me is that he doesn’t have any emotion towards anything. I mean nothing. He laughs at the dinner table for no reason. He’ll just laugh to himself when it’s quiet and continue. The way he talks now brothers me. He talks with no energy.

84,"I recently started college and I’ve been hanging out with a friend of mine for a while. She’s a great person and she’s seen a lot of shit, and she has her fair share of horror stories about her parents. We’ll call her Jessie. Jessie is from my hometown and has plenty of experience smoking, but less so drinking and a dark history with sex. Recently, she’s been upping the party game and hanging out with some sketchy guys who seem to want one thing. Me and her roommate are both concerned that she’s pushing things to far because now that she’s finally free of her parents she can do whatever she wants. I’m not saying she’s wrong, but as someone who has seen people ruin their lives with drinking, I don’t want to see her do something she’ll regret just because she CAN. 

Tonight we were playing video games and she got really upset over a loss, complaining that we we’re tagging on her. So when one of her new “nice” friends offered to take her out, she left without so much as a word to us. Said nice friend was with us last night while we were partying and pulled some wild shit where he attempted to kiss her, while she was drinking, a DAY AFTER SHE MET HIM.

86,"Hello r/advice, I’ll attempt to keep this post short. 7 years ago, my father decided to make a drastic career change; he was the general manager of a reputed telecommunications company, but he decided to leave the company after facing conflicts with the newly appointed ceo. My father decided to continue working on his own company independently. In addition, he invested the majority of his savings into a project which did not yield any profits, and ended up alienating my mother from him to a minor extent. As those 7 years progressed, my family’s financial situation began to deteriorate progressively. My mother doesn’t work, which only exacerbated the issue. It is worth noting that my father used to earn a salary of roughly $150,000 per year in his previous job as general manager, and now he barely gets paid every month. My father’s income could vary from virtually nothing to $15,000 a month. At the moment, my family lives in another country, and my father remains in the country we used to reside in. My family had to move country since expenses were far too great for my father to cover, and so by moving, we reduce expenses significantly. We are a family of 3, excluding my parents. 

The fact that he is the only source of income for our family has a profound impact on our everyday lives. Besides having to minimize spending, my siblings and I have to hear my mother inform us on just how difficult the predicament my father has placed himself in. The other day, she was told by him that he had to send all his remaining money to her for my younger brother’s schooling, and he kept only $30 with him. This instance is one of many, and every one I hear just makes me feel guilty. He’s struggling to earn a sufficient amount of income for his own expenses and ours. It is also worth noting that me and my younger sister’s university tuition is paid for by another party. Prior to joining university, which was 2 years ago, he was capable of paying up to $30,000 for our school fees. At the moment, he can barely afford to pay for my brother’s schooling fees. 

Now, before you start accusing me of being condescending towards my father, I should mention that my father HAS the opportunity to find a similar job with an excellent salary in a nearby country. Furthermore, the presence of his sister, who is well established in that country will aid him immensely. He could begin living the life he once had. However, in spite of all of this, he outright REFUSES to leave his current country, and continue working on his own company, which has no viable long-term prospects. My father argues that he’s not familiar with the market in that country, but I believe he can easily understand the market within a short period of time since that country is in the same region as his current country. This region is the middle east, by the way. Although my father is talented and hardworking, he is no entrepreneur, and even more so, he is an egregious investor. 

His ego is preventing him from seeing the long term prospects, and it enrages me that his 20 year old son understands this more than he does. In addition to his shenanigans, he keeps my mother in the dark regarding his current career events. I am furious at the fact that I have allowed his ego to ruin our family’s financial situation, and his own situation even further. 

There also lies the possibility that my father would not be able to provide income for us, because he would be too sick to do so, or perhaps dead. My father is a heavy smoker, and I feel that at any day, I could be told that he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Moreover, the generous benefactor paying for my tuition fees could suddenly die, since he is rather old, and there’s the possibility that his sons choose to not pay for my sister’s and my own tuition fees. I am not being pessimistic, I am simply outlining realistic scenarios which could unfold. 

The bottom line is, I’m not sure what to do. I’m contemplating the idea of confronting my father and explaining to him that he’s treading towards bankruptcy, and to remind him of his responsibility to his family, without causing offense. I could talk to my aunt in private since she is aware of our plight, and discuss with her possibilities. I’m completely lost on what should be done, and I must take action as I am the eldest son, and thus I have some responsibility in the family. My mother’s attempts to convince my father to find a job as an employee have all but failed.

88,"So my boyfriend recently proposed to me. 

My family doesn’t really accept him because they are traditional Muslim and he’s European (non Muslim) with a tattoo sleeve. This makes me upset so much that I can’t even put it into words.

My fiancé is the sweetest man ever. He covers our dog’s ears when he curses. He covers me when I say I’m cold. He kisses me and hugs me infinite times a day. Our love is pure but deeper than that we are best friends. We are on the same page when it comes to future, career, kids and everything else.

My family doesn’t see that. They just see the tattoos and stereotype him based off of that. They don’t see that he’s an engineer. That he has a well paying job and that together we will build a wonderful and stable future. They just see that he’s not Muslim and they think he’s the worst thing to ever happen to me.

Every day they tell me that I’m too good for him, that I’m smarter than him, that he’s too socially awkward for me and that he hold me back. They say that propels opinions of me will change if they find out that this is the person I chose to marry. They say this isn’t the guy they “expected” me to be with. 

And it breaks my heart. Because I love my family and their approval means something to me,  but I am not willing to leave my future husband for their superficial reasons. They have yet to come up with a personality flaw or a valid reason for why they don’t accept him.

Today his family invited mine over to a barbecue and my mom and dad were completely stand-offish and didn’t sit with his family or make an effort to talk to anyone. Fiancé’s dad was going out of his way to bring them food and drinks and dessert and make conversation and they were giving him one word answers and acting like they were too good to speak to him.

Later when I got home they proceeded to tell me that they didn’t like how fiancés dad was tipsy and implied he has a drinking problem. A DRINKING PROBLEM?? Because he drank at a bbq on the weekend?


I’m just so, so mentally exhausted by this ordeal. I cry almost every night and my hair is falling out from all of the stress I feel.

Had a tight knit group of friends in high school and we were somewhat successful in keeping in touch the first year out of high school with everyone going away and such. I made effort here and there and slacked in some instances which I feel like I drove my friends away a bit. I didn't hang out with them as much as I wanted to during the summer, which I regret. At the same time I work weird hours at work (night shift at grocery store) so I would be too tired to hang out. 

I feel like college changed a lot of my friends after the first year and I really don't know who they are anymore and I don't connect with them as well as I did back in high school. They are all mostly into the sorority/fraternity party scene which isn't my scene at all. My one friend actually goes to university but chooses to commute and stays at home. So I can technically hang out with her whenever I want, but she has her own group of friends now. I was especially hurt because today was her bday and I wished her a happy birthday, which she said thanks and such. And tonight she posted on snapchat her partying with a group of friends I never really associated with and it made me feel like a shitty friend. Here I am, not away at university and I am close by her on her bday and not spending the day or celebrating it with her. I don't care for being excluded because I don't hang with those people and my social anxiety would get the best of me anyways. 

But the thing will all my friends is they have experienced more than me. Most have had 1 or a couple boyfriends and had the experiences of sex, heavy partying, etc. and I have had none of that. The only boyfriend I have had was in high school and that lasted a month. I am looking for a boyfriend but the circumstances I am in gives me no contact with guys around my age.

But deep down I am yearning for social interaction with people my age again and I want to start finding a boyfriend. 

I just feel like I am missing important milestones and I am not fully experiencing my late teens/early 20's and ""living it up"" so to speak. I am very focused on my future and career and school/work which obviously isn't a bad thing but I don't have time for social interaction or fun anymore and I do kind of miss that despite the anxiety I have towards it. I did learn that I can socialize with older people easier than people my age and I do enjoy talking to older people at work.

So I then decided I’d go to cosmetology school and I graduated from there in 2015. I worked as a hair stylist for a few years and made decent money. I met my now husband in 2015 through a mutual friend and he lived an hour away. Our schedules never matched up, and ultimately I decided to move to him. He’s a barber and had more clientele than I did. 
I decided instead of building a new clientele and testing for my cosmetology license in the new state, that I’d go back to college one more time and let it be something in the medical field so I can provide health insurance. 
I am now about to graduate this semester with an associates in science, health care professional degree. I just accepted a job offer at a hospital in my dream position with 100% covered benefits. It’s a very prestigious hospital and will look great on a resume. The pay is low, but the insurance itself is worth it for now.
I’d prefer to graduate with this degree, and focus on moving up within the company. My husband wants me to continue to get a bachelors. I found out that this is my last semester of financial aid, and I don’t want to be in academic debt when I could possibly make just as much with a few years of experience.

94,"I'm feeling really low. Nothing seems to be going quite right. I cant keep up with school. I have to put off grad school for at least a year. And I miss the man[20M] I love. Everything feels so incredibly wrong without him. 

I liked him the first time I met him, but I thought I wasnt good enough, so I just ignored it. But two years later, we got to be good friends. And I noticed him noticing me. Checking me out. Careful touches here and there. Going out of his way to be kind. We had a lot of mutual respect for each other. I fell for him harder than I thought was possible. He disrupted my entire life. I thought he was just shy. He was so hard to get close to - he doesn't let people in. I was too scared to say anything, to make a move. For the first time, my anxiety was screaming ""dont fuck this up"" instead of ""run the fuck away."" My mistake. I've never been in a relationship or been even remotely intimate. I'm fairly touch averse, especially when it comes to men, and I have a traumatic history that impacts the way I interact with people. I am seriously and actively trying to get better. But I couldn't overcome it soon enough. 

In July, he told me about this girl he had been seeing.... after they had already been dating for 2.5 months. He never even told me her name. And I was so incredibly hurt. I told him how I felt because I was so confused and upset. He apologized ""if he led me on,"" which doesn't really show any ownership of his actions. We spent so much time together. We went to the movies alone, leaned on each other. It didn't mean anything to him. He just thought we were close friends, especially because I'm 2 years older than him. Evidently, I'm so old, he couldn't ever fathom a relationship with me.

When I told him how I felt, he made a big deal about not losing me as a friend. He told my best friend he was having a hard time sleeping bc of everything and that I was really important to him. He told me that I was half the reason he hadn't transferred schools and that I was one of his closest friends. We didnt speak for a while. 

I thought I had found the love of my life. I sound absolutely crazy. 100% insane. But I've never felt this way about anyone. I've had crushes before. But it's never been like this. None of them were ever ""right."" I didn't have to date them to know that. I have never seen a future with any of them, never imagined what life could be like if we were together. And I saw the entirety of my future with him. And I don't have a right to those thoughts. I feel like the I'm insane, like some crazy, obsessed person. Everything hurts. My chest. My stomach. My limbs. My spirit. And I still cant concentrate on anything I need to do. I'm trying to cobble together some sort of path to follow, and it's not working. And now everything is a mess. Our friendship is rocky. We barely talk anymore. I dont know how to talk to him. I dont know what is okay and what isn't, if we are allowed to hang out. I want to be with him so badly, but I'm not the type of person to try to step in between him and his girlfriend. I respect that relationship, as I should. 

But seeing him hurts. Being away from him hurts. I really care about him. And I feel like I lost so much. For the first time in my life, I actually felt like I needed someone. And now I feel used. He thinks everything is okay. I can't tell him it isn't. What is the point? He is not responsible for my well-being. I made the mistake of falling in love with him. It's my fault I feel so strongly for him. It's my fault I didn't make my intentions clearer sooner. It's my fault for being confused by the things he said and did and apparently reading into things that didnt exist. So what is the point in upsetting him? In making things even harder? There is no scenario in which I feel better about the situation, no scenario in which I win. No scenario where he isnt made upset by what I have done or could do.

Nothing is okay. I'm a mess. And I don't know how to fix any of it. 

tl;dr I thought I had found the love of my life. He doesn't reciprocate. It's been 2 months. I am still a mess, and I don't know how to move on.",16Sep2018,1

97,"This past summer my professor asked me if I would like to help him with a research project he has been working on along with another professor at my university. At the time I was asked, I was elated and very excited to be offered such an opportunity because it loosely incorporates what I am interested in as an end goal for my career.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I notice myself losing interest quickly. At the time, I contributed this to me working full time since it was the summer, and I felt as if I didn't do anything other than go to work and occasionally work on what my professor had told me to do. I believed that once school started and I established a routine, things would turn around because I wouldn't feel as burnt out all the time.

As you may have guessed, my enjoyment of working on this project hasn't improved much. At times, I really do recognize how great of an opportunity this is (objectively speaking) and feel like I'm enjoying the work. But most of times I find myself stressing about completing what was asked of me in a timely manner and whether or not it's good enough. Additionally, there are other students working on this project that seem to be so much more dedicated and interested in it than I am, and it really shows in the work that they do (we have weekly meeting and frequently discuss topics via email). This just adds to the stress of it too because I feel as if I need to match or do better than the contributions they're making. 

Now, I also think an important part of this picture is that my mental health also isn't the greatest. I have been struggling with depression for a couple years now, and the stress definitely isn't helping it. I'm trying to think long-term though and not let my apathetic attitude sway me away from potential opportunities in the future. This is largely why I'm a complete basket case when trying to decide whether or not to stick it through or politely step down from this experience.",16Sep2018,1

101,Hi all. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm in a bit of a rock and a hard place. I work for local gov't where I live and deal a lot with the general public and the Jail system. Specifically inmate visitation. I was recently given a trainee to teach how to do the job I do. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this but this trainee in particular is a very new and very stressful thing I have had to deal with. Long story short he had a brain injury a while back and He's not as.... capable as other people are. I apologize if I sound like an ass wording it but I just don't know how else to put it. Management feel like I'm the best person for the job to train him but this is something that I feel is ***way*** out of my league. Multitasking and speed are a must doing this job and those are things that he lacks. Management wants me to just observe him as he does the job and correct any mistakes he makes as he goes. The problem is he makes a *lot* of mistakes and gets confused easily. I can't catch every single mistake he makes. When these mistakes get made the public tends to get angry and frustrated and rightly so. I've tried to make charts or plans to help him with how he works but I've been told that he already has charts and things to help him. I feel like I can't be a trainer for him and I also feel like this is something that should be handled by a specialist or my managers. I plan on talking with management about it tomorrow because I've been so stressed the past two days I've had to miss work because of it. I need some advice on how to proceed with this situation because I feel like I'll be stuck training him even if I tell them how I feel about the entire situation. ,16Sep2018,1

Im 22m, I met my ex when I was 19 she was 18. We worked together, thats how I met her. Lil background info on me I grow up in Sri Lanka, moved to canada with my family when I was 10. Been through lot of situations that people find disturbing such witnessing tsunami, war, sexual abuses (not by family the first time anyway). Came from poor/middle class (in between both) family so Parents were always working so not a lot family things that we did or even if we did it just end in me getting beaten cause I was dumb kid. But my parents are good people just tuff. I, like every kid in my situation i turned to cartoon and other heroes for example. So yes I have hero complex, trust issues and depression. 

Alright that's it for intro, for me to trust any one is a very hard thing and specially falling in love. I was happy for the first ever in my life that I would of done almost anything. After 2 years told she told me my family's is the main reason she wants to brake up with me and I understood how she felt my family is shit I'll be the first one to admit it but I can't leave my family that I know for 21years and taken care of me when I was sick and been through the same shit such as war and tsunami. But I can't lose the one person in this world I shared every thing with. But that's what happened she said she didn't love me anymore. So we broke up not in good way, I didn't loose my cool for the first time and just walked away and told her' I do love you and no matter what happens I always love you and I'll alwaysbe here'.

Im not perfect but I don't brake is my promise (hero complex) never have. I have no hope she'll ever talk to me or come back cause last time i seen her drive by me with someone so I'm positive that she found someone and I'm happy for her. 

Guess what I'm asking here is I don't want to forget her cause that's probably only memory of me being happy and don't regret any of it but how can fill this void in my heart. And stop thinking about her?

I'm not trying to bash him but more to understand and see if I do need to move on (tried to recently but was unsuccessful). 

To be fair, he has told me straight up that he didn't want a relationship because he wanted to keep his options open. When a guy says this, this basically means the girl is not good enough, right? Why else would you not want to commit to someone? 

The problem I have with this is that he'll say this and when I ask him if he has done stuff with other girls, he'll be honest but it tears me apart. I get jealous but I don't have the right to, and so I'll try to end things because we dont want the same things. But then he'll be all sentimental and tells me he misses me and then I forgive him and the cycle repeats. 

He knows what I want as well so if he doesn't want anything with it, why wouldn't he just end things with me? He'll be more successful finding someone else who wants NSA.

15F here, 5’1” and 110 pounds (50 kg). I love to run, and I go out running with my dog almost everyday (5-6 times/week). I also play two sports and walk to school everyday. 

My biggest problem is that I get out of breathe way too quickly, even if I’m jogging. Then, I get frustrated over how slow I am/how quickly I get out of breathe. I also can’t run for very long before I get extremely out of breathe (or I’m just lazy, I don’t know) and just walk. I use Nike+ Run Club to log my runs, and for example, when I was at the half mile mark, I felt the need to stop jogging and walk.

My average mile times lately have been 11-12 minutes. My best (which was 4 years ago) was a low 7-minute mile. I don’t know what happened, and I get very frustrated whenever I complete a mile over how slow it is compared to how I used to run. I also get frustrated because my friends run faster than me and they sometimes make snide comments about my slowness. 

Also, I physically NEED to be able to run the mile faster, because me being a slowpoke affects my grade! I take PE at school and according to their grade system, I need to run a 7-minute mile or faster for an A. 

I don’t know why I’m so out of shape even though I think I live a pretty active lifestyle. But an outside perspective is appreciated. Thank you. 

tldr; slow AF and want help on how to decrease mile time and increase stamina. ",16Sep2018,2
127,"I’ve been dating my girlfriend for over 8 months now, and don’t get me wrong, I’m so incredibly happy with our relationship right now. I’m not really scared that it’s going to end soon at all, I’m just really scared about what’s going to happen if we break up. 

I’m only a senior in high school, so I know if we do breakup I still have plenty of time to meet other people. I just don’t want to see other people, I want the relationship that I have now and nothing else. This girl has changed my life in such amazing ways and I’m so grateful for her. I’ve been friends with her for years and now that we’re dating I couldn’t be happier.

But, if we break up for whatever reason, I feel like I literally won’t be able to get over her. Dating or not, she’s played such a big role in my life and I can’t imagine dating anyone else but her.

She does however feel like once everything is sorted out, she would like to be back with me. She does not have answers for most of the questions I have about all of this like how long she thinks it will take, or if we'll even be together again at all. I really am not sure why she felt it necessary to put things on hold with me instead of letting me help, listen and comfort her, which I have done in the past.

129,"I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with giving up alcohol/not drinking at all? 

I am really struggling with depression at the moment and have realised with one or two drinks I can turn into a morose dickhead. It's a wonder anyone can put up with me. It makes me more depressed and comes out in the way I talk and treat other people. I honestly think it would be best for me to avoid alcohol entirely for at least a few years, or however long it takes to beat this depression.

How do you deal with people who pressure you to go on, just have one glass? Or if you abstain they immediately assume you must be an alcoholic? Do you say I just prefer not to?

141,"Looking for some insight on ""job hopping"", work and volunteer experience, and more...

I recently graduated this year with a behavioral/social science bachelors degree (hooray!). It's nice to be finally done with college and start a new chapter in life.

At the moment I'm taking it easy and working a part-time job, the same job I've had since even before starting college and that has made it possible to pay my tuition and bills. Sure, it's not really related to my degree, but I whole-heartedly enjoy it. 

Now, for the past couple weeks I've been passively looking around for job postings in my area that are related to my degree. (More out of curiosity than necessity.) But I recently came across an opening that REALLY piqued my interest. Full-time job, benefits, the whole 9 yards. I am very confident I'm qualified for the job, so I applied for it and now I'm set for an interview next week.

But...I'm feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place because I don't plan on living in this area for much longer. Maybe another year, year and a half at the most. In fact, I'm currently saving several thousands of dollars to go travel and engage in humanitarian volunteer work abroad for a year before I ""settle"" in a serious career back in my home country.

Basically I have two options and I don't know what to do! 

1.) Stay at current part-time job and save up money to go travelling abroad for a year. For the remaining amount of time here in town (a year and a half at the most) I would volunteer locally with several organizations to gain useful experience somewhat related to my degree so I have a pretty  good chance in finding a serious career after returning from travelling abroad. BUT risk being thought as lazy or not driven/ambitious by potential employers because it would be roughly 2 years or more before I start a serious career. 

2.)  Assuming I get the full-time job and I take it, I work for a year and a half at the most (because I truly DO NOT want to stay in this town for longer than 1.5 years), gain work experience that I'll neatly tuck in my  back pocket, and go travel abroad like I desire. BUT at the same time risk looking like a job hopper, a fool, or a flake for letting go of a such a great career for wanting to be a travelling ""humanitarian"" and become unemployable upon returning to my home country.

I want to travel abroad for a year. No questions about it. I will save up enough money for it, one way or another, and will be out of this town no later than a year and a half from now. 

But I don't want to be irresponsible either. I want to make sure I still gain useful work and/or volunteer experience in the meantime so I'm not totally unemployable upon returning from being a nomad. It's HOW I should go about it that worries me. 

TL;DR Should I rely completely on impressive volunteer experience but no work experience...or one years worth of work experience but it's only ONE years worth, with the probability of making me look like a job hopper.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!! Thanks guys!!

144," (First post here) So for about the past year, I’ve been trying to get this amazing, perfect girl. We text each other almost every day, much of it flirtatious. But the problem is, it doesn’t seem to me that she is really that into me. Even though we text a lot and flirt, I can’t get with her. It’s not a confidence issue, as I have asked her out twice, both times she said “I have a thing with someone else.” I also asked her to homecoming two years in a row now, the first time she said she already had plans with friends, and the second time she was going with someone else. Does any body have advice or am I wasting my time on her?",16Sep2018,1
145,"Alright, throwaway time.

Let me preface this by saying that I am not at any risk of harming others or myself. I just want to make it clear that I can think perfectly rationally and I would never do anything to hurt anyone.

So, when I was about 12 or 13 I realized I'm a sadist. I don't mean in a sexual BDSM way. People's suffering (and that of fictional characters) gives me an almost unexplanable pleasure. It's not just regular happiness, nor is it anything sexual. It's a deep satisfaction and an almost electrifying pleasurable physical/emotional feeling. Since I first discovered it, it has gotten more intense over time.

There are a few problems I've been having and I'll try my best to list them:

&amp;#x200B;

1. General feelings of guilt surrounding my sadistic tendencies.

Typically, I indulge in this sadism through fictional content. Movies, TV, writing, etc. However, even though it's purely fictional, after coming down from that euphoria, I'm left with an underlying guilt and disgust with myself. The entire idea of deriving pleasure from others' pain (even when it's only fictional) just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Feelings of ""withdrawal"" when I don't consume any sort of media that satisfies those desires.

Sometimes I can go for days or weeks without watching/reading any sort of sadistic content. Sometimes only one day. However, sooner or later, I'll start experiencing a sort of tightness in my chest, almost a feeling of anxiety, but not quite. It's like my breathing is restricted and I feel a general sense of restlessness. It gets worse the longer it goes on. It can be very unpleasant. Usually I'm able to sleep it off if I can't access the internet at the time, however, it returns the next day. The feelings are off and on throughout the day.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Enjoyment of the suffering of IRL people.

This is, I would say, probably one of the biggest problems I'm having. It absolutely abhors me that I feel this way. Something I should note is that the more fond I am of the person suffering, the more pleasure I get from it. This does not work out well for me because when my friends (online friends, I don't have any IRL friends) are going through tough times, I can't help feeling this absolute sensation of pleasure. I should also mention that only recently has my sadism worsened to the point that I feel this way toward close friends. In the past, the seriousness of the matter would always outweigh those feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm looking for a way to possibly reduce or ""cure"" this. It makes me feel like a horrible person a lot of times, even though I generally hold myself in pretty high regard. Any advice would be appreciated.",16Sep2018,3
146,"Ever since my girlfriend got back from vacation she has not been the same. It was like I switch was turned off and she doesn’t act the same way.

She has a history of anxiety and depression so I thought this was a big factor in all of this. The other night she told me she treated me the way I should have never been cheated.

She doesn’t talk to me when she has the opportunity. She leaves my snaps and my text for hours and doesn’t reply and when she does she doesn’t say anything back and sometimes ignites me questions. Every now and again she will turn off her location at random. Mine is always on and hers is most of the time but a few times this last week she has turned it off

She tells me she loves me and cares about me and misses me when I tell her most of the time but otherwise she seems very disconnected. It’s long distance so this is even harder to deal with and it’s stuff I just can’t ask out of the blue. It has to be done in person.

She told me last weekend she downloaded tinder to talk to one of her best friends cause he lives with her ex and he checks his phone. She went out of the way to put a photo on the profile. She could tell I was kind of agitated because if I had done that I would have been crucified. I never would so it seemed very fishy to me. She said she’d delete it.

Not long after that she told me and I found out she broke up with her previous BF the day she thought we were official. I was taken aback by this a lot cause basically she told me she’d never cheat and since we had went on a few dates that seemed like cheating to me in a way. So this has all raised my concerns.

She also recently told me that I couldn’t tag her in anything on facebook because her  coworkers complained and that it was unprofessional when her best friend still shares inappropriate stuff and she shares it herself. She also set my own Instagram to private cause her EX the one she broke up with was stalking me and messaging her how I post photos with her and she never does. Why let your ex have that much power?

2 nights ago she told me she doesn’t feel the same when I am not there with her. She says that she has been hiding her feelings because she gets sad when I am not there. This restored a lot of my faith but I still have not touched on the stuff with the EX fully because I want to do it in a healthy fashion.",16Sep2018,5

151,"I work two part time jobs. One at a store the other at a restaurant. 

I was originally hired at the restaurant to be a drink runner/ buss tables but they've been scheduling me as a food runner because they have been low staff lately. 

This job wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that they have multiple floors you have to climb with heavy trays of food. 

Going from working hours at the store straight to working at the restaurant (climbing up and down a couple flights of stairs with heavy trays for 6 hours straight) is starting to get to me. Plus having to deal with rude people yell at you for wrong orders and what not. I was originally hired to be only doing drink runs and working on one floor. I never applied at this place to be a food runner. 

That being said I finally had a break down. I've only been working at the restaurant for a couple weeks now and I'm physically exhausted.

Idk if I am being unreasonable for getting this upset and being this exhausted? Idk if it is unreasonable of me to ask a mananger if they can schedule me for what I was originally hired to be.

152,"Recently, I've felt like my grades in high school are not doing as well as they used to. I can pin the point at which this started taking place back to January of this year probably about a week after Winter Break. This was a time where I was going through puberty (I'm a very late bloomer) and was starting to try and get more and more popular at school. In January, I felt like I really needed a break from school. Before this, I had been getting the same grade every year since the start of middle school - I can't remember my grades before that - which was six A's and one B. So, I decided to fake being sick to miss school. It's actually very hard for me to get my parents to not make me go to school, and even when I threw up they would send me to school, so I started making fake vomit and splashing some in my sink about three times every day for a whole two weeks. My two week absence from school ended up earning me piles and piles of homework to do. I ended up never doing a bunch of these, and I always told my parents that I had no idea why my teacher's put in 0's for my grades. This led to me not doing other assignments that were assigned while I was at school, and I eventually ended up having at least one missing assignment in every class (five in English). I ended that year with one C, four B's, and two A's. 

Fast forward to now, where I have two D's after being in school for only about a month. I feel like a lot of my behavior has been due to the fact that almost all the friends I've made since middle school have been through band, and this year, I decided not to take band because I would have to wake up about an hour earlier than normal, and I am already tired waking up at the times that I do on normal school days. These friends that I have made in band all sit in the room where they do band lessons, and only kids in band can sit in that room, and my friends are not willing to sit outside with me during lunch because it's very hot out (we live in Arizona) meaning that I have to make new friends, which I am not good at because of how introverted I am. This leads to me having to sit alone at lunch. The problem with that is that I have a crush who goes to the school that I do, and I feel like if she saw me sitting alone at lunch, she would think that I don't have friends and lose any interest that she might have in me, so I end up walking around my entire campus for 30 minutes during lunch. I have gotten pretty depressed now, and I'm letting my grades slip by not doing some of the homework I get again. Now, in two of my classes I have missing assignments which the teachers won't let me make up, and my mom is warning me that if I don't fix these grades within the next week, she'll tell my dad, who I am depending on to get me a car for my eighteenth birthday. If he finds out he will probably take away my computer, which I use for probably about sixteen hours a day on weekends, and I bet that he would also not get me a car for my birthday.

I'm a freshman (18M) at a STEM school with a notoriously geeky atmosphere far away from home. I am the only person from my high school or my hometown to end up here, and as such I know no one. Now that I've been in classes for a bit, I've made a few friends, mostly outside of my department.

Socially, I had a pretty pitiful high school experience. I had several friends. However, none of them lasted long, and the ones I ended high school with probably won't last the school year.

Social skills and making and keeping friends has always been one of my greatest weaknesses. After a majority of social interactions, I feel like the other person/people thought I was annoying. I'm very verbally impulsive and continuously talk, sometimes without a filter. Usually, though, if I say something that I realize I shouldn't have, I apologize and shut up.

How do I not do this? Is there something I can keep in mind while I'm conversing that can help me learn when to talk and when not to? Am I just immature? Are the reputational demographics (lacking social skills and very nerdy) of my school partially to blame? Any other advice?

158,"I am 17 years old. I started working at a fast food chain as soon as I turned 16, and ive worked at the same place ever since. 

My managers and supervisors respect me. I bust my ass every day giving my best to the restraunt, and they know that. In just a few months, around 1.5 years after I got the job, I will be getting promoted to a manager (even before I turn 18). Yet this whole time, I've been getting payed minimum wage. 

I'm an early college student, and every term I take between 15-20 credits, and my school only pays for 12. This means that even as a 16 year old I already had to pay for college. I need this job, and especially based on all the shit that I have to deal with, i should be getting payed more than minimum wage. 

As a manager in training, I literally have to perform every single thing an actual manager does. From dealing with complaints, to changing tills, to managing up to 15 people, to creating deposits to the bank each day. I do these tasks with pride and to the best of my ability. But the thing that bugs me the most, and it's been bugging me more and more every day, is that even though i have to take care of such important tasks, I still get payed the same as the guy who sweeps dirt on the sidewalks for 8 hours straight. Not to mention that working in fast food is very mentally challenging, and anyone who has worked in fast food would understand. 

This is my first job, so I dont want to jeopardize anything. I've considered giving the supervisor and ultimatum, where if I dont get a raise, I quit, and I know they need me. But I'm afraid that I will get on thier bad side, and when the day comes when I go looking for a better job, they will put in a bad word to the future employer. 

I know that busting my ass every day will pay off in the future, but I can only go on for so long. I also dont want to get another job at the moment since I've already gotten so far, and I would have to start over. 

What am I to do? Should I just keep acting as an underpaid manager, or should I ask for a raise?

Now I'm wondering will it be worth it or is this the way to become a lecturer: join med college study first year then leave. First year because i love anatomy physiology and biochemistry. I want to be a lecturer on one of these subs. The reason I'm studying 3 of the subs because i like to learn 3 of them.

161,"Hey r/Advice

So tomorrow I’m going to be taking a co-worker of mine out to a restaurant. Not a cheap place but nothing overly fancy. I’m a bit embarrassed to admit that I’m not sure how picking up the tab at a restaurant works at all. I’m pretty young and as a kid we never went out to eat much so I never learned how to pay the bill or tip. 

I realize that the answer probably varies from place to place, but how do you pay the bill and at what point do you tip? Do you add the tip in when you pay the bill, or do you leave the tip on the table when you leave?  I will be paying for everything in cash. Thanks all!",16Sep2018,1
162,"I am really struggling to make a decision and any insight would be very much appreciated!! Sorry in advance for the complicated nature of my situation.

I have the opportunity to work a full-time job in a city 40min-1hr away (depending on traffic), OR 2 part time jobs that are 10 minutes and 30 minutes away, respectively.  They are all the same type of job, same pay, and experience-driven. Whatever I decide, I will only be working there one full year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Full Time PROS:**

\-Simplicity of working one job

\-Benefits (albeit pretty lame due to ""experience-driven"" nature of job)

\-Stronger connections (= potentially better letter of rec for grad school later)

\-Cool facility

**Full Time CONS:**

\-Long commute (less sleep, more money on gas + $5 toll)

\-Irregular hours (e.g. 10 PM - 6 AM; 6 AM-3 PM; 12 PM - 10 PM, some weekends)

&amp;#x200B;

**2 Part Times PROS:**

\-Short commute (more sleep, less money spent)

\-More stable hours (one of the part times is 8 AM -5 PM 2-3 weekdays, the other part time would have the same same irregular hours + weekends as the full time job, but I would only be working such hours 2-3 days a week. I would try to make it so that I would have the regular hours 3 days a week and the irregular 2 days a week.)

\-Potentially freedom to work a different part time job if I find that I don't like one of them

**2 Part Times CONS:**

\-The jobs make you sign a non-compete clause. Technically I am not supposed to be working both of these jobs at the same time. However, these are large companies that operate in many different states, and this clause does NOT apply in the state I live in (California). In California, non-competes are null and void and not enforceable. However I am still a little bit uncomfortable about signing something I  would be violating, even if it is null and void.

\-I don't really like the facility at one of the part time jobs (however, I am a fan of the other facility!)

\-Weaker connections (=potentially worse letter of rec due to less ""quality"" time spent)

\-Potentially more complicated balancing 2 part times?

&amp;#x200B;

Some more context: I just got married and I have discussed all of the above with my husband. He said we can make it work either way but I am a little worried about the greater volume of irregular hours for the full time job. I feel like it would take away from some quality time with my new husband. I would be willing to make it work however, and this is a temporary position... one year isn't THAT long. 

Another important note: the $ spent on gas and commuting really adds up when put in the context that I would be making minimum wage. With our dual income we can make it work but any extra $ in the bank would be great.

When it comes to the letter of rec thing, not sure if I am overthinking it. I have made a good impression on part time jobs in the past (during college) so maybe I don't need to be working full time to get a good letter of rec... thoughts?

And this was Saturday and I have already had a nightmare about him. I 100% believe her. He’s a really messed up guy and he confided in me he had rape fantasies.

On social media and such. I just don’t know how to deal with this. 

She also told me how when they broke up and she started talking to someone new that he tried to kill his self by slitting his wrists and sent her pictures. She in turn showed me the pictures she had on her old Facebook from him.  I’m just really messed up over this whole thing.

167,"I am 17 years old, from an Indian background. My grandmother is nice to everyone, except my mother. I cannot bear to witness how badly my mother is treated. My dad has tried to butt in when my granny orders my mum around but his voice has been shot down. 

I don't know what to do. I feel conflicted. Granny treats me very kindly and cares for me— cooks for me, takes care of me when I'm sick, etc. 

But, she keeps pestering my mother after my mother returns home after a long day of work. My mother is forced to cook and my granny acts like all a woman should be doing is cook. A patriarchal, sexist mindset. My mother silently bears this, not wanting to disrespect her mother-in-law. I can't bear to see this. I feel like elders should be treated with respect only if they earn it. 

So, what my granny does is: she acts as pretentious, and shows off when guests arrive, and orders me and my mom around. For example:
Gran: Go get me and my guests food. 
Mom: Okay, right away. 
Gran: get this, get that. 
... And my granny dismisses my mother, and treats her like a pariah. She calls her friends and loudly says things like,""Oh, yeah. Geeta (my mom's name) won't let me do this. They won't buy me anything new. No, no. They don't care about me."" What's more, is that what she says isn't true. Our family cares for my granny a lot. And more things, with very sarcastic undertones. My grandmother cares more about her ""pristine"" reputation more than she cares for other people. 

My mother feels powerless and is too afraid to be disrespectful to my granny, because she's afraid that my granny will spread the news to everyone (family, friends) that my mother is terrible, and she feels that my grandmother will taint her name and demean her in front of everyone. 

I feel so sad and helpelss. I feel like yelling at my grandmother for making my mom feel like this. I don't want to respect my grandmother anymore, even though she doesn't do anything bad to me.

Few months later...he told me again that he loves me and really want to spend his life with me and mentioned that i was the only reason of helping him reach his dreams and improving his personality. He told me that if i said ""no"" he won't forget me and will still love to the end of his life.

The problem is, one of them REALLY smells.

She started about 6 months ago, and is a very lovely and hardworking woman. But I cannot stand to be near her because of her smell, I feel really terrible about it and don’t know what to do? 

We’re not talking simple BO here by the way, it’s a really hard smell to describe, but it’s basically a smell of long term unwashed body and unwashed clothes, almost a sweet sickly BO mixed with mustiness and a slight hint of old pee - either way it makes me absolutely gag.

I have to hold my breath anytime I’m near her, or else I just avoid her full stop which is harsh but I have to do it or I’m afraid she’ll see my gag face.

No one else in my team seems to be acting any differently around her and of course none of us have ever spoken about it to each other, how could we?! But there’s no way they can’t have noticed. Sometimes I genuinely smell her before I see her.

I really don’t want to make a complaint, I’d feel so terrible and cruel. But at the same time, I literally cannot work with this person because of how bad she smells!

I've been friends with this girl for around 11-12 years now (Childhood friend).

Last year she was throwing a birthday party for her birthday and only invited close people to her.

I was outside the city for that date so I wasn't able to come, I apologized after and moved on - no hard feelings.

This year I was like fuck yeah nothing is going to stop me from coming to her 18th birthday party where she also invited only close friends. She invited me for her birthday before a month ago for her birthday that took place at 15th of September (Yesterday). The party was also themed so I picked one of my best suites (D&amp;G) that I use only for high ticket consultations or events where I'm speaking at a seminar. Somehow I was thinking that her birthday was 16th of September since I had a few birthdays and parties in a row this week. This morning  everything was fine - until I saw her Instagram Story and was like fuck.

I was planning to call her and take her out for a lunch or a dinner - give her present that I thoughtfully bought a few days ago especially for her birthday.

My situation..

i moved from home half way across country largely influenced by my 2 closest mates. this i do not regret but still think every day that i made a mistake, and that i shouldnt have left what i had back there. in the past 2 years one of my mates (who was living with me) decided to just pack up most of his stuff and leave unannounced, still havent heard from him. fast forward  6 months i open a business with my other buddy. we were going well, but then december hit, quiet suddenly my brother passed away. i havent spoken to anyone about the effects its had on myself.   this along with the business seen me rack up quiet a substantial debt. Buisness then flunked which caused my other pal to take off, again without any notice... so now im stuck living in a city where my 2 closest mates have abandoned me. The only reason why im here was cause of them. Anyways, now more recently i though i had a good thing going with a girl. this is where things become tricky. We're housemates. flirt a bit end up sleeping together that was that for a few months then after some other people kinda assumed me n her were together i put the words on her to make things progress to something more official. she agreed and life was good... except for the debt and my best mates leaving. Now to my right now situation. My 40,000$ debt is haunting me.(debt collectors) i have recently gotten my first job since opening my own business which is long hours for basically minimum wage, i hate it tremendously, is this what working for someone feels like?, And things went sour with the girl. we still live together but apparently my feelings for her were far more advanced than hers for me. its been about a month. we're friends. but a few nights ago she bought a guy home. im stressed about everything in my life, i struggle with depression and what ever else.. this makes things hard for me at the best time. but her bringing a guy back here has just set me off. i didnt realise she has had such an emotional effect on me. ive never been suicidal in my life but at the moment i cant stop thinking about it. tonight she has told me hes coming around again. leaving me a mess in my room.. what do i do next?   what issue do i address first.

Little background on me, I'm 27(M) and my gf is 24(F). We've been together 4 years in October. We used to have really bad fights, I mean bad. She would threaten to leave multiple times, but thankfully that has stopped about 3 years ago. But lately, it's not the fighting that has me anxious. She has made comments recently, that she said to just say out loud and hasn't reinforced them, but has stuck with me ever since. Our mutual friend ended her 9 year relationship with this guy she's been with since high school, and now the girl has a fuck buddy and drinks all the time and does whatever she wants. My gf made a comment of ""one night stands aren't bad, they are actually pretty fun really."" Now, that doesn't seem rough at first but this was us discussing how we felt about real relationships vs flings. To me, it comes off as something she thinks about a lot, especially more so since our friend is partaking in that constantly. Maybe I'm overthinking. Another comment dropped whilst we were skating at our regular outing at the rink. She wanted to tell me about a dream she had, she was really off and distant to me before this. She explained she was with this unknown stranger, that they went on these romantic walks and such and she felt this deep feeling in her heart that this guy was the one, no doubt. When she woke up, she said she became depressed because that feeling wasn't real anymore now that she woke up. It hit me like a train, I stopped dead in my skates and just stared at her. I have worked to better myself for the relationship, me, and for her for these almost 4 years, to hear that. She explained that she wants that feeling with me but doesn't feel that now. I've felt that with her since I met her, I have zero problems in that regard. I feel lost. I feel empty. I don't want to keep working at something where she feels a missing connection, I can't make that happen. To be honest, I've felt that again. With someone else. A girl I talked to a small bit in a bookstore, found out we have similar interests and personalities. I left that conversation with her with butterflies in my stomach, something I haven't felt in years. I keep wanting to talk to her, to see her, to be around her. I don't feel right about any of this, I feel wrong. I keep debating, should I leave and try building something with this other girl, see where it goes? Or, try to inspire a connection with my gf who feels an absence of one in the first place? She says she loves me, but to me, love is the very thing that creates that feeling in your chest, and the butterflies in your gut.

So yeah he's been really off with me ever since but when I brought it up yesterday because I was sick of how different he was being and noticed he was trying to avoid me yesterday, he claims it doesn't 'actively' upset him but that he still thinks I think it's okay to hate Muslims just because my father does. He claims we're still fine and that 'no shit' he wants me to still be his 'Goddess'. He isn't acting like it though, I don't think it's all in my head, he's definitely been trying to talk to me less. I've told him last night and the night we spoke about it originally, that I don't hate Muslims or think it's okay to. I just can't get it out of his mind basically and I don't want to ruin whatever the fuck this is, but I feel like it's too late and the damage is done.

192,"I'm a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous. who goes to appointments with a lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometime say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ a lot on emails and in person which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done.

194,"I'm a senior in high school so still live at home. My mom has a drinking problem. I don't think she's an alcoholic but she cannot handle her alcohol well at all and drinks more than she should every night. Anyways, I absolutely hate it.

Last night I came home after being out for a few hours (cause I didn't want to be around her while drinking) and pretty much as soon as I walked in the door she fell and slammed her face against a table. Her mouth was bleeding and stuff and it really freaked me out, and she still wouldn't admit that she had been drinking which really pissed me off. She was laughing at me for being worried and crying, and that pissed me off even more. 

I basically ended up screaming at her and telling her I hated her and hated living with her and some more things along those lines.

201,"Hello! A little background about myself and what I want to achieve as an artist:

So I'm a 25 year old who struggled a lot in a traditional university--had a lot of life problems throughout college, mental health (depression specifically), and had switched majors late (I went into uni as a business major, spent 3 years trying to force myself to ""bear with it"" and graduate. I finally convinced myself and my parents that business wasn't where I wanted to be and made the switch to teaching). I had always wanted to do something with the arts, but when I was applying to colleges as a high schooler, my parents told me not to go into the arts and choose something practical, hence why I ended up going into business.

This past year, I've been really jumping back into the art scene. I've taken classes at my uni, gone to workshops off campus, and just tried to bring as much art back into my life. At one point in the semester, my professor made a suggestion of me becoming an art teacher. It was something that I had always though about (I love teaching and art as well), so when he made that suggestion I began to think,"" Yeah, why not?""

That was around May when I began to really think deeply on it. For the past 2-3 months I've been researching colleges and talking to art professors at my uni on what I should try to do. In January I'll have finally graduated, and what I was thinking was enrolling into an art college, really solidify art and get a BFA. From there I'd go ahead apply for my graduate studies for art education. 

The reasons why I wanted to go to an art college was because even though I was able to learn a lot of art on my own, I only really saw a huge amount of improvement in my art after being in a class and having an instructor to guide me. The second reason was that if I wanted to be an art teacher, I should be learning from and watching how professional art educators work in a class setting. And my last reason I guess is networking purposes.

While most people around me suggest going back to college to build up my foundations and such, after all my research, a part of me has become really hesitant--I mean, the costs of some of these schools are nightmare fuel. A part of me is like,"" How will I survive after? Is it worth it? Even if I do have a plan, this plan is gonna cost me."" While another part of me just wants to jump into the art scene and be surrounded by it all the time. 

So I guess (just like the title says), should I go to art school or look for another alternative? 

The schools I've been looking at so far are MICA, OTIS, and MassArt. And if anyone needs an idea of my art so far, I only have an IG (nicahls\_art).

Thanks in advance!

But she added me to some group with some of her friends and that's when things started to get fucked up because she would actively ignore me while talking in that group. She was friendly and talked to me at school tho.


So like a week ago she ignored me for two days straight and i was like hey is everything okay between us etc.


She said that she's in a really bad mood and doesn't want to yell at me? And then kept talking to people in the group chat and sending videos of her dancing and being silly with captions ""i don't know what's wrong with me xD"" and shit like that.



Of course i started to panic and started sending messages checking if she's mad at me or something. It took her like 12 minutes to respond even though she saw i was being really nervous, while i was panicking she sent another video of her dancing or some shit.



Well yeah, she started talking to me and said i was too paranoid and made a joke about me being too depressed with that depressed kermit meme. I got mad and started ignoring her at school for like a week etc, she tried to talk to me and was telling people i am salty.


Well today i was like ""hey if u wanna be friends again thats fine by me"" and she said ""finally"" and yeahhhh, she started leaving me on ""seen"" again, even when i asked her ""hey why are you leaving me on seen so much?""

207,"I posted this on the r/nursing subreddit but I thought I would post this here to get more feedback:

A little backstory:

I work as a research nurse in a large academic institution with oncology patients.  There are five of us that do the same job and we have a manager that is not a RN, is a terrible manager but has worked here 20+ years.  We have talked to her many times about our challenges with her, talked to upper management etc.  Nothing has been done or corrected.  One example:   In the two years I’ve been there our employee turnover rate is 144%.  All but one person has left directly because of the management style of this person.  

Several weeks ago we have a meeting with our managers new manager.  We tell her some concerns.  Later that week managers manager takes her aside.  After that our manager stops speaking to us (we all share one big office with separate cubicle spaces).  That night our managers daughter, who also works at the same institution, posts threatening things to us on social media.  She didn’t name us by name, but then next day one of our coworkers emailed our manager and our manager clarified that It was directed at us.  

We took our concerns to HR.  Guess what they have done...nothing.  Not one thing.  Manager is still managing us and as far as we know the daughter  still works there too.  

The threatening post was:  Upset my momma and I will burn your shit to the ground.  Check your brake lines bitches I will come for you if It happens again.   She didn’t name us individually however our manager confirmed in writing to our coworker that It was.  We have screenshots of all posts and emails and a screenshot of our manager liking her daughters post.  

All HR and our managers manager have said is:  she’s still the manager, both have been investigated and there was a credible reason for their post but it wasn’t intended to threaten you all.  You must continue to act professionally towards her and find a way to move on. 

My question for the Advice crowd is:  is that normal? Do we have any other recourse?  This woman sits in our office with us but no longer speaks to us.  We have a communal bowl of candy that has been moved to her workspot and covered up.   She is the one who approves our time, does our evaluations, approves vacation leave, assigns work etc.   

As an update:  we came to work one day last week and her desk was moved.   She is not in our office and we aren’t sure where.  No one has talked to us about her moving, said whether It is temporary or permanent.  She hasn’t moved personal effects just work things.   She is still emailing us tasks as she is our supervisor but that’s It.  ",16Sep2018,2

212,"I work at a large hotel chain. There are multiple properties in the city I live in. This coworker used to work at another hotel owned by us, and the GM of the property was slowly phasing him out because he did not want him to work there.

Rumors were that he was going into guest rooms, stealing, having his girlfriend sleep in empty rooms, etc. He was being kicked out of his living situation by his roomates at the time.

GM from the property I work at had him come over to work here. He somehow finagled his way into the GM  letting him use a room to stay in for a month or two while he finds a new place. In the time he has been here, he has been a absolutely terrible employee. Not doing work, causing drama, threatening guests and employees, smoking weed in the room and while at work, etc. This is all known and was reported. A few days ago he was arrested on multiple counts ( over 5 ) of burglary of a dwelling. Turns out they had evidence of him going into rooms at the other hotel and stealing. It took some time because a police tech needs to come out and get the files, and that takes a while.

I briefly spoke to my GM about this, and his response was that it has nothing to do with us, so it doesnt matter. He was bonded out and is now back at work at the hotel.

I disagree. Its the same company, and that type of behavior ( despite being desperate ), is not something we should potentially subject our guests too. He now has very little time left on the room he was given, as well as fees for lawyer/court and all that now. It is fairly likely it happens again, but this time at our hotel.

My options are to try and talk to my GM again, or to go over his head, or to do nothing. I have gone over his head once, and it was met with small amounts of retaliation in scheduling. We seem to have just gotten past that now. Speaking with my GM is not likely to accomplish anything, and doing nothing may put our guests at risk ( Which is my biggest fear ).

227,"So at the beginning of the year my sister (23) and I (26) moved in together with two other house mates. This is the first time we’ve lived together as adults after I left the family home at 18. After a few years of having my own place or living with friends who had their own busy lives,  I’ve gotten used to enjoying space and time to myself when I’m at home. I’ve always been very independent and I like doing my own thing. I feel like my sister has really latched on to me this year and I feel a bit smothered. A lot of the time it feels like I’m living with my mother and as a result I sometimes find myself snapping at her like a teenager. Whenever she gets home she seeks me out in the house and tries to talk. A lot of the time I find that I don’t have anything to say because we see each other all the time and there’s just nothing new going on. She’s so sensitive and last year went through a period of depression so I worry about upsetting her but sometime I can’t help but get annoyed. 
An example from last night: 
I had got home from work at midnight, had a shower, got ready for bed and was watching some Netflix when she got home at 12:30ish. She knocks on my bedroom door and starts telling me about her night in detail (she had been to a birthday party). I’m tired as I had worked two shifts at separate jobs that day and this was my first bit of downtime since 8am. I was pretty uninterested frankly in what she was saying and was not giving much to the conversation. She says “what do you hate me?”. I’ve told her before that it really hurts me when she says I hate her because obviously I don’t. I say “don’t ask stupid questions” and she says something like “you just don’t give a shit” and slams my door. When I got home tonight she told me that we need to have lunch tomorrow to discuss how I treat her. Now it feels like I’m going to bloody couples counselling with my sister and it’s just a bit much.

229,"Hi,

I posted this on sex, but got no answers, so I hope here it will fit better.

I don't know where to write anymore without getting laughed at or humiliated. There are domestic forums (I live in Croatia) but if I would post this problem there I would be humiliated, called names and laughed at.

So, I am 29 year old man. I wouldn't say ugly, but really not anything eye catching. I am 100% heterosexual and never had sex. Vagina is still thing of legends and fantasies to me. I never seen one in real life, only on internet. That being said, I am helplessly addicted to porn. There is never a day without me going there, and rarely a day where I visit only for ""one shot"". I got so hungry I watched really any imaginable legal and illegal heterosexual porn. All I had in my life were few dates and few kisses. Even kisses I miss, let alone my cravings for sex. Some chances I ruined horribly where I had ""open doors"" for sexual intercourse. Either I was too polite, or in other cases too dumb. What I regret most is wasting my ""golden years"", teen years. Whilst my peers banged among themselves wildly, I was... I am ashamed to say that... :( Playing games on my STUPID PC!!! I woke up at age of 18. Sadly, too late. I also suffer mental illnesses and being hugely asocial is not helping my case.

It started to bother me really much, every passing day after age of 18. I craved and craved, but nothing. I tried and tried, still no luck. In time I started being suicidal. Then some suicide attempts... Pills, cutting... From minor attempts to nearly fatal, gruesome throat slashing last year. I am getting DESPERATE. Some suggested trying prostitutes, but I guess I don't need to explain why that is WORST possible idea. I cannot be proud of myself being virgin at almost 30 years of age. Some, quite a lot actually, people swore that sex is not something so ideal and some guy on yt even said: ""It's perfectly fine to die as virgin"", even though he is saying from point of having wife and children. Furthermore, when I read that only around 1% of all population born dies as virgin cold sweat started to run down my body. I am constantly asking myself: Am I that pathetic, failure of man that I belong to 1% of most unlucky and pathetic people on earth (I don't consider here asexuals)? Being in such shameful little percentage, being diagnosed with several mental illnesses is driving me insane. Few days ago I nearly killed myself with fentanyl. I tried going out of my skin to lose my virginity. But, no no no and no. Seeing in movies and reading on internet I always believed it would be such easy task to achieve. Sadly I realized it's one of the hardest things to get in human life (at least for men). I used to set limits and said: If I don't lose virginity by that age I will kill myself... etc. Even though I haven't done it, every passing year my suicide attempts become more reckless and serious. But imagining myself dying as 70ish year old man in hospital bed tormented by ONE thought: ""I will die as virgin!"" Is inducing panic in me. Even now as somewhat young person when I think about that fact my whole body shivers and tears come easily. Let alone as dying in agony old man. Knowing that in this one life I was given, I haven't tasted most amazing thing one can. Yeah, I had amazing hobbies. I thought gaming is even better than sex. But sadly, gaming faded, and my craving and fascination about women never did. Not even diminished. TBH I even tried killing my sex drive. What I succeeded was making myself impotent, but thoughts were still there.

One straw I hold upon is there luckily. But it is desperate one and one that is hard to pull of. Since I had basically zero luck in my country I realized I might seek further away. Not in west, no... But in third world countries. I found virtual harem of women in Philippines. I am naturally really attracted to Asians. And yeah, I found sort of girlfriend. We are in virtual relationship for now over a year. So you might ask, what is the problem? Well... quite some...

First of I would be stigmatized as choosing desperate option and stigmatized as ""man who could only have some poor women"". Luckily, I have almost zero people in my life so calling me looser for doing it is not hurting me much. Secondly, there are cultural differences, but most notably language speaking barriers. She speaks english, but much more basic one. Even worse is knowledge barrier. Even though I never went further than high school, I am wealth of knowledge and can talk about anything. She on other hand is very limited. Much too often we fought and argued because of these things. Yeah, I would still bang her all day/every day, but after sex there is little to do with her intellectually. Lastly, proces of immigration is costly and complicated (especially me being on social welfare), although I garner support of my family. Most frightening to me is the fact that to keep her, basically only option is to marry her. Which is something that scares shit out of me. If I had partner in my country, we could live in cohabitation without need to get dedicated. And as cherry on top, I really crave to have multiple partners in my life. Yeah, fantasy is having over 10... But having at least 4-5 partners before marrying would be satisfying.

So I am caught in such grinder. Whatever I do, I can't be entirely happy. I already gave her a notion that we could meet first for 3 months and just ""let it all out"", but I know I would get hugely addicted and besides I know I wouldn't call her for 2nd time to marry. Highly unlikely.

Although I am open with my sexuality with my family, they are laughing about it and besides they instilled in their minds already picture of me that I am just nerd playing with computers.

I kindly ask for all you kind people, men and women, to give me advice. Please don't laugh about my problems, don't belittle me. For one, I know I would really empathize with virgin person with same issues.

My two biggest fears are fear of pain and fear of dying as virgin. But hard pressed, I would choose pain over second one. Rather to die in horrible agony than as virgin. God forbid!",16Sep2018,0
230,"I am soon turning 24 and I have never tried any kind of intoxication in my life. Yess not even once, no alcohol, no smoking, no weed, nothing at all. I am in a creative field and every one around me was high during my college days and would give reason like it helps them think and see clearly, it helps their creativity, etc. I never felt like trying it so i didn't. I am kind of an introvert so I always avoided social events and hence no one forced me into it. Don't care much about what people think so peer pressure didn't work either. 

I think the reason thats holding me back from trying alcohol is that I have a lot of alcoholic family members. I have seen many close family members going bankrupt, failing marriage and falling ill leading to death because of alcohol.

Now i am moving to Europe for masters studies and I am not sure if i should continue being this way or not. I don't know what am I missing out on. Could getting high actually help me get more creative? Could it be a fun experience? Or should I just let it be.",16Sep2018,357

233,"Hello fellow reddit bois. I’m here today to ask for your sage advice regarding my self-destruction. In the past year I’ve had four jobs and been sacked from all of them for non-attendance. I take drugs frequently that are far too expensive and end up owing money to people you wouldn’t even ask for a light.  I am in tons of debt from pay day loans to fund drinking and drugging. I split up with my ex girlfriend because I cheated on her at her own Halloween party.

Every time everything seems to be going well for me it seems like I am unable to get out of my own way and unable to stop myself from ruining it. I had a mostly normal childhood and I was brought up by a loving mother, a loving Nanna and a younger sister who is also in many ways my best friend.  I haven’t spoke to my father since I was 11 and I am now 24.  I’ve had some mental health problems but I don’t really think they have anything to do with the choices and decisions I make. I hate myself and I feel like I’m punishing myself but I don’t know why. Any advice on how to start righting these wrongs would be appreciated.",16Sep2018,4

Im pretty sure im the only one im this hostel/motel. I have my own room and the door only locks with the key so it can be opened from the outside if I’m inside. It’s 10pm and there was some incessant knocking on my door, i ignored it at first as i was in bed but eventually opened it as i was scares they would just come in. I was wearing mini shorts and a t shirt no bra for context, not exactly conservative...

There was a middle aged indian man outside, he started talking to me and lured me away from my doorway, being polite i followed. He got touchy- feely, stroked my tattoos,  looked obviously at my chest and made me feel very uncomfortable and offered me wine which was conveniently on the table just outside my room. I managed to go back in my room but i am pretty certain he was the owner and as mentioned before, i havent seen or heard anyone else here. 

Im scared for my safety. I cant leave as i need him to unlock the main doors for me and he is outside my room anyway as im right next to reception. I have my rape alarm next to me and my bag infront of the door but it isnt safe. I feel so vulnerable and stupid for putting myself in this situation. He knows im alone here.

235,"For the past few years I’ve had really horrible anxiety and have gotten used to self sabotaging my own life - I.e. it got to a point where it felt normal to live life in fear and anxiety. I finally took initiative to change this by cultivating good habits, and after months of trying and failing I finally am at a place I am very happy with. However, occasionally, whenever things are going well (for instance one week - two weeks), it starts feeling weird to me to have such a great life and I end up engaging in something that makes me feel horrible, hence, what life “normally” is.

236,"Crush is used loosely here. It doesn’t always have to have a romantic connotation. She could just deeply admire me. Things get a little rough with the fact that I’m a gay female, but I doubt my boss knows. Big town, stuff doesn’t get around as much. 

So I’m pretty tomboyish. I’m also very goofy. This makes me a magnet for little kids. I have 5 younger siblings, so I know how to cater to children. I’m also just laid back and like to have fun. For further clarity, I’m also 18 so I’m still a kid myself in a way. 

I currently work in an office, and my boss’s 11 year old daughter gets dropped off at the office after school. 

One day my boss was telling me how much her daughter loves me and how she talks about me a lot. Apparently she thinks I’m really funny. I didn’t think much of it, some little girl things I’m funny. 

Then I noticed that everywhere I went, her daughter seemed to follow. The girl is always teasing me and following me around. 

She followed me on Instagram and has been dming me on there everyday almost. All she does is tell me how funny I am and whatnot. She keeps asking more personal questions. Like if I’m dating anyone or what I’m studying to become. It’s not just casual convo. I definitely don’t answer these questions with much depth, that’s weird. I usually ignore her after a couple of strands of messaging. 

One day her friend came with her after school and somehow they knew who I was. The other little girl knew too much about me so I’m assuming that my boss’s daughter has been talking about me. 

My coworkers say that when I take days off she is asking everyone where I’m at and acts really sad. They’ve also told me that she talks about me to them all the time. 

My sister was dropping something off for me one day and the little girl said “oh you’re (my names) sister”. 

I don’t know there’s a lot of these moments but I just haven’t put much thought into them. I don’t know how to handle this without being 1.) a jerk or 2.) creepy. 

My big issue is the Instagram dms. I think it’s very weird for an 18 year old to be messaging an 11 year old, but then again I don’t want to ignore this kid that is specifically reaching out to me. I see her everyday almost and I don’t want to be an asshole to an impressionable kid.

We would go to nice restaurants, see movies, go play games, and see stand-up comedians. All were fun for me at the very least and some of the dates were her idea. I took a bit too long to kiss her, 4th date but on the last 2 we've been kissing a lot and making out and even sleeping in the same bed, but she didn't want to have sex or anything like that so we didn't. Usually we text each other a bit every day, you know... sending a meme, asking how the other's day has been, talking about TV shows we've both gotten into, etc... Since last date which was Saturday last week and our 5th, we haven't really talked much and I'm getting a bit nervous. She's only texted me twice since last date, both times after 2+ days of me asking her a question of some sort and they we're both one liners. One of them was her telling me she was really busy but I'm not experienced dating at all and I don't know if its normal for a girl to just not respond to someone for days like this.

I want to feel good about myself, have the courage to do the things I want to do and I just don't know what to do because the slightest failure (by failure I mean whatever my mind chooses to be a failure) will result in me overthinking it and the usual result is how pathetic I am.

At the start of this year one of my friends started talking to a new group of people, so being the socially inept 15 year old I am, I followed suit. I’m quite friendly with all of them now, but I don’t regularly talk with any of them.


Let me just preface this by saying I have never felt anything like this before. I’ve gone through puberty most of the way with all my friends, but unlike them I never developed any kind of sexual or even romantic feelings. Over the past few months, however, I have been having feelings for one girl in the aforementioned group of friends. I don’t know why it’s only her, but I think it’s because she’s way more nice to me than I deserve.


However, I don’t know if I want to try and make this work for quite a few reasons. For starters, we have completely different interests. She’s a very passionate netball player, while i’m a very passionate “esports” player, for example. Also, I don’t feel like I deserve her in the slightest. I try to be as nice as possible to all my friends, but I just feel like a complete waste of space. I want to talk to her more, and I definitely will, but i’m just so confused.

Well here goes, I like this dude for a very long time, since we were in 8th grade. I'm in Senior High school now and yet I still like the dude. We became best friends since our grade school days, then something just sparked in me that I kinda like this dude more than a friend now. I told him I had a crush on him and then he said he doesn't feel the same way. It kinda hurt before but I moved on pretty quickly after that. We stopped talking to each other after that which kinda made me sad because he was the only person who understands my interest and likes what I do. Fast forward to 9th grade, midsummer. He contacted me again, like nothing happened. I brushed this off because I was happy to be talking with him again. Since then, my feelings for him just sprung up to me again. Before I reached to Senior High School I asked him why did he want to talk to me again after all that (To summarize, we didn't talk for like a year and half after my confession), he told me he misses me, he misses our conversation about life, games and other stuff. He then told me if I had feelings for him again, I don't know what came to me but I just said yes. I don't even know for sure for myself if I really do like the dude. Yeah I like everything about him and what we do, but I just feel like there's something missing between us. 

After I told him I like him, he told me he likes me too. It took him so long to realize that he actually likes me. But there's just one problem, he moved to a different school so the only contact I have with him is through facebook, and also his academic priorities. I too have academic priorities so I understand that, so he told me he was not yet ready for a relationship. I took it pretty well but felt kinda sad about it, but then after that conversation, we stopped again. I don't what I did but there might be something that I said that I should've, or  something else that I don't know. And again, another month passes and then he talks to me again, like nothing ever happened. I don't take those things personally because all I care about is his companionship and trust I have for him. We talk about things normally now again, I don't bring up about our confession to one another because the last time I tried he doesn't want to talk about love right now. 

I don't know what to do anymore, should I keep talking to him in hopes he would like me again? Should I move on now and find someone who would actually like me? This problem is really confusing so I'm sorry afterwards. I just really like being with him, but looking on what I have right now with him is not very bright. ",16Sep2018,1

258,"There's this girl that I like at my school. We met during math class last year and, since I liked her, I started up conversations to get to know her better. We talk and I find out she's a year younger than me as a junior. We became good friends after a while and things were going smooth. I hit her up on social media after a while and we just went back and forth for a while. She's not a very 'attached to their phone' type person, so when I hit her up on social media she would take a while to answer back. Yet, when I decided to start talking to her on snapchat, she seemed distant, annoyed and/or bored, maybe a combination of the three, sending only one word responses to the conversations. At times, she genuinely seemed intrigued in the conversation and we had some real heartfelt, common conversations about our pasts and our present. However, those moments of one word conversations got to me and I started to believe that she wasn't interested in me the same way I was to her. I was right on this belief because she hit me up for advice on a guy she likes. This guy goes to the same school we do and I ended up giving her advice on this guy. I told her to talk to him and kept encouraging her to do so, ironic. They ends up getting together and I'm disheartened. Our conversations ended, we barely talked to each another anymore, even though we had the same class together, and eventually we headed out for summer break. I tried to get her out of my head the entire time and began to pick up different hobbies and distractions to get her out and, for a while, it worked. But, coming back to school that summer was the hardest thing I did in a long time. I saw them together and felt dead. I ignored it as best I could for a month, and I eventually found out they broke up multiple times already, but this most recent time was official. Throughout this entire time I distanced myself from her because I assumed she would forget about me or would instead focus on herself. Though, recently she's texted me about a funny thing on my story and has greeted me everytime she sees me in public. Now I'm just not sure what to do, because I see her everyday walking home and I just want to tell her how I feel, but I'm not so sure it's the best idea.

My teacher is a crazy young white lady who hates white men. The other day she told my class (primarily the white women) to never marry white men as they are racist and the root of all evil and problems. She even looked at me when she said it as I am the only white male in the class. 

She constantly makes really gross generalizations and comments on how white men ""need to be permanently gone"". 

I am extremely uncomfortable with this class and I can't drop it because I need it to graduate. I can't really tell any other professors about it because well, colleges are (as you know) very liberal.

270,"I went to a little high-school get together with maybe 25 friends, most of them very close. I got pretty drunk, but I was having fun and didn’t feel like I was out of control. My friends said I was being very touchy though and kind of not winding down, which is making me really uncomfortable look back and ugh why am I like this. Then, I was kind of cuddling behind a guy, spoon style, and he put his blanket over me and that was fine. Then I kind of started rubbing his stomach and eventually under his pants, so like ya know, first sexual experience, and super awful and cringey. I honestly didn’t really pay attention or realize what I was doing until I was like ‘oh wow, I’m not into this at all,’ and literally just got up and left. For more context, we were in a room full of people with only the blanket over so not really secretive and I can’t remember how obvious or if I was being obvious so ahhh. I don’t like him at all like that, but he kept saying the whole night that I was beautiful and all that bullshit and how he always liked me. And now I just need help from some people who might know how to get over that really horrible choice and deal with the aftermath with him. I just need help. I really feel uncomfortable and kind of rapey even though he was touching my arm and seemed into it??

So basically, that was a mess, but what I need is advice on how to deal with that situation and kind of get over the cringe so I don’t think about it every night while trying to fall asleep for the rest of my life. :) thanks",16Sep2018,0

 I've always had issues making friends, I just didn't know how to socialize when I was young. This played a huge part in my decision to stay at home during university, and to commute to school. I am now in my third year of school, just started, and I am incredibly unhappy. I see the few friends I have having what seems to be the times of their lives living at school, having these incredibly experiences, while I'm doing nothing. I've considered transferring to a school where I'd live on/near campus, though I don't know if that would make sense, as I'd likely lose this semester of school when transferring credits, and I am almost done. I'm also considering doing a semester or year abroad, which also may give me that experience while also giving me the experience of living abroad. For context, I live in Toronto, and go to school in downtown Toronto. There are student residences available near my school, however they are very expensive, and I don't know if I could get the experience I want, in a big city. I was leaning pretty heavily towards transferring, however now I'm realizing that I'd be in 3rd year, and will likely have a very hard time making friends - which I'd need to have those experiences I want - as everyone has already solidified into groups.

I am definitely fixating on this issue, and cannot relax or get it off of my mind, until I feel like it's ""resolved"". Please help, I'm desperate, and so depressed.",16Sep2018,1

285,"Hello Reddit.

(for context, read spoiler. Without it : straight to the point)

&gt;!I met a girl something like a year ago, using a website similar to Meetup (i.e. something made to meet new people, not dating oriented). Nothing much, we didn't really have good chemistry, so even though we saw each other something like once a month, things never got further than a polite ""good evening"". !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Fast forward a week ago, when she hit on me hard all of a sudden, and she was really pushy, in a way that was very direct. The third thing she said to me that night was a question : did I want to sleep with her ?!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Not only do I not have my mind tuned to relationships or sex right now, but I also heard a lot about her, and not in a particularly good way, so I didn't want to get involved. !&lt;

&gt;!But, and it's my mistake, I got involved. To me, anyone can say anything about anybody, so I barely listened to what people said about her (it doesn't concern me, I'm not here to talk behind someone's back). If I really wanted to know, only I could be the judge. She felt bad having be so direct, and we agreed to act as if nothing happened. Long story short, we talked, she seemed really nice, and we slept together a few days ago. !&lt;

The problem ? She is pregnant. I'm not the father, she must be 3-4 months pregnant. You could say that I'm blind, but in fact almost no one has noticed yet, and I didn't notice either. This, added to the fact that already 2 days later, she was very controlling, meant that I opted out. I cancelled a date, and the next day I just didn't show up (crappy move, I admit).  


Next thing I know, she's banging at my door, and refuses to leave. I told her to get out, that I'm not opening the door. She seemed so angry, I just didn't want her in. We never know. I'm pretty sure she can't hurt me, but she can hurt herself, or I can hurt her involuntarily if I tried to calm her down, and I didn't want to have to deal with that kind of a situation with a pregnant woman I barely know.

&amp;#x200B;

She stayed all night long in front of my door. I still haven't open the door yet, I'm not even sure she's not still here, I had to shut down my electricity so that I could sleep while she was ringing the bell all night. At least she stopped banging.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her to leave me alone, I blocked her from everywhere, she has no way of contacting me anymore. Or does she ?

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I recieved texts from old friends I haven't talked to in a very long while, and they were talking about how I mistreated her. I'm also pretty sure she created a fake facebook account to try to talk to me, but I'm not stupid, and it's starting to get more and more obvious that it's her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been in this situation (thankfully), any advice on how I could deal with her ?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, even though you only have my side of the story, tell me if you think my decision not to open the door was crappy. I explained my reasons already, and to me she didn't have to stay here all night, she made that decision. I told her I wasn't going to open. She played that card yesterday, and still is probably now with my friends : ""I let a pregnant woman sleep on my doorstep"". To me, I told her to leave, she made the decision to stay. Feel free to disagree, I'm open to the possibility that I was a bastard. To me, it's just crazy that this happend after 3 days of seing each other. Even though it's not the most extreme of things right now, I'm afraid of what can happen next. She knows where I live, and obviously she is ready to do crazy stuff.",16Sep2018,1

There's no fix to it and the only thing you can do is get a new phone. Here's where I need advice.

Apple offers to replace your faulty iPhone 7 with a brand new iPhone 7 for free, if you trade in your old one. Should I do that offer and get a new free iPhone 7, or should I just splurge on one of the new iPhones that's dropping? I'm thinking the 10R or 10S. 

I know it seems silly when I could get a new phone for free, but iPhone 7's are super far behind now. Like 2 generations behind.

291,"I just moved to London by myself from a different city a few hundred miles away. I moved here to pursue my dreams of being an artist and as much as I'm loving it here I was unprepared for how homesick I would feel, as well as the guilt I feel for leaving my struggling family behind. 

My mum is a single parent and struggles for money. She has had a lot of health issues over the years, both mental and physical, and I'm worried that by moving out abruptly I might push her into a breakdown. I myself have been dealing with depression since my early teens (I'm 18 now) and one of the only things getting me through it was knowing that once I turned 18, I could just pack up and leave to start a new life. After sitting on the idea for a while, I just bit the bullet last week and booked the ticket, now I'm here. 

I understand how much my mum must be worried about me after doing something so huge. I'm also the first of her children to leave the family home. According to my brother she hasn't stopped crying since I left. I guess she would have this reaction no matter how far away I moved or how old I was. Even though we've never been *that* close, the guilt I feel about this is overwhelming. I'm still her child at the end of the day and she's still my mother. What I feel most guilty about was the way I sprung it on her with a week to get her head round it before I was gone. 

I don't want to admit it but I am so homesick. I plan on going back home to see my family at Christmas then coming back here again. I love it here and I want to remain here to pursue my dreams. I don't want to fail. Nobody ever got anything done by giving up at the first hurdle. However, I don't even know if I will make it to Christmas.

293,"So I’m going to try my best to explain this situation but it is a little hard to explain it all in a text box. 

I live in a relatively decent area and I have never had a situation like this in my life. The other day I was getting ready to go to a party around 6. My father left for the night to go play in a band. It was only my mother and I in the house. About 5 minutes before I was supposed to leave, I had to grab something from my parents room. 

When I opened the door I saw someone laying on my parents bed out of the corner of my eye. I looked over and they quickly got up and ran into the bathroom. I was super confused so I looked inside and saw a man I had never seen before. Naturally, I was super shocked stunned. He said “uh.... hey how’s it going.” I didn’t know what to say at such a casual response in such a situation. So I barely mustered a “hey” in disbelief. At this point, I went to get my mother who was on the porch. (It’s important to note that our house is one story and very long. Because my mom was on the porch, the man had to have entered through the back door).  

I started yelling at her asking who that was. She said she didn’t know what I was talking about and that went back and forth for a few minutes. I said “if you have no idea then call 911.” So she called and I went back to their room and the man was gone. They have a door in their room that leads directly to our backyard and there is a side path leading to the front of the house. 

Of course the police can’t/haven’t done anything (there’s only so much you can do in a situation like that). When I talked to both of my parents about it, they are both convinced that it was a random creeper. I can’t seem to think that, however, because of how he got into our house. It’s hard to believe that a random creep could figure out the layout of our house, and would be willing to sneak into the house with people in it. It is also hard to believe since both my dad and I would have been out of the house in just a few minutes. At the same time, my parents have always kept the doors to the house unlocked. Even the back. 

Regardless, my next step is to get a camera/lock on the doors.

I was wondering if it is possible to get pregnant if the vagina makes contact with sperm on the outside. For context (and i am sorry if it comes across a little vulgar), my girlfriend and I (both virgins) were fooling around yesterday and I came near her vagina.

This morning, however, my girlfriend noticed spotting. She said that this has never happened to her before and now we are a little bit worried if what we did yesterday could be the cause of this spotting. I have read online that during the starting stages of pregnancy, it is possible to see implantation spotting. And she is also in the middle of her menstrual cycle and I also read that during ovulation, it is possible to see spotting as well. (Its been about 18 hours since this entire series of events has happened.)

Yet I get criticized for things like pitting condiments on the wrong refrigerator shelf. Leaving earbuds on the coffee table even though I am generally tidy. Occasionally forgetting to take out the trash.

I still do a lot of chores around the house. I unload the dishwasher, wash dishes, cook dinner several times a week and clean up afterwards. I bathe and put the kids to bed. I feel like I am generally a pretty good guy. And those who know me agree.

My wife and I went to counseling once briefly. I mentioned this is a main concern and suggested that she pick three things that she could be critical about per day to make sure that they were important things. The counselor agreed this was a good idea but my wife shut it down immediately. She stated that she had to have the ability to mention anything she wanted at any time that was a concern.

It seems like so much energy is spent on criticizing the small details that I overlooked occasionally and a disproportionately small amount of energy is spent appreciating the hard work that I do.

She refuses to go to counseling now which I think would be helpful. So what can I do personally at home to cope with the constant criticism in a constructive way and keep my sanity?",16Sep2018,1
302,"My brother is two years younger than me and he recently started going to the same school as me. It’s a very difficult school yet we’re both very strong academically and we both always do fine in school.

Now that my brother has started at my school now which is more difficult than his previous school, he seems to already be cracking under the pressure even though he’s doing just fine. Whenever he gets stuck on a single problem on an assignment or something, he starts crying and screaming about how he’s going to get in so much trouble and his teachers are going to hate him and stuff of that sort.

Additionally he’s just started playing an instrument (as our school requires that everyone plays one) and he’s in a class with other beginning instrument players. He’s only had a few classes so far but he’s already doing quite well on the instrument. However, he’s reacting the same way when he messes up a single note while practicing, and starts yelling about how much he’s expected to do when, in reality, the teacher doesnt even care if they cant play it. I started my instrument 2 years ago when I started at this school and my brother is already doing much better than I was when I started, and I’m still fine now despite being horrible. In fact I’m pretty sure my teacher likes me more than most of the other students because he can tell that I’m trying at least, but I can’t get my brother to understand that effort means more than accomplishment in many cases.

TL;DR My brother is at a new school and is so concerned with teachers’ expectations that he starts crying and screaming whenever he has the slightest bit of trouble with any assignment.",16Sep2018,1

He keeps interrupting me because my story reminded him of something and he immediately wants to tell me(?). He talks a lot already, so when I can finally talk I'd like to actually be able to finish my story. 

He also keeps talking about his problems to me, which is fine, thats what I am here for (Im a great listener), but this one problem involves me and his family. He keeps talking about how he feels about the situation but has not once asked me how i feel about it, even though I'm part of the problem. Does he not care how i feel? Or what I have to say? 

I honestly don't get it. He used to talk a lot already and interrupt me sometimes but now he ALWAYS interrupts me and never asks me how I feel unless he needs advice.

If i dont speak, they are dont continue the conversation. I have to continue, ask, or be interesting.

anyways, i was very upset for a good month, as expected. every second of each day she was in my head. ive gotten a lot better about it, dont think abt her as much as i did (still do occasionally) but figured she didnt deserve me or if it was meant to be then it wouldnt have happened. 

she has recently moved on, started to hangout with other guys, parties, which i guess im happy for her having fun but like... i think im being very selfish as well for not wanting her to do that. i want her to be with me. 

okay now seriously the real topic, these past 2 weeks almost every night she has appeared in my dreams. from just us two hanging out that lead to cuddling and kissing just like we did for the 1st time we kissed, to now im almost 3rd wheeling in my own dreams???? she will be with another guy, laying up against his shoulder, and im just sitting next to her and him, just staring lol. i guess were still on good terms, she still texts me asking for... things... and likes my social media shit but i honestly just try to ignore her at all costs bc i know the chances of us being a thing again is very unlikely (for a while atleast). 

about a month ago, i started to focus on myself. working out, working a shit ton, reading, exploring nature, mostly solo, and hanging out with my buddies more. but she still is on my mind especially at night. 

i know ""time heals all wounds"" but is there anything else i can do to prevent her from appearing in my dreams??? i dont even really think about her before i fall asleep so i have no clue on even how to handle this. 

for the most part ive been in good control of my dreams, (lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis meditation etc etc) but just want her gone from my dreams. is there anything i can even do??",16Sep2018,1

She had/has an eating disorder, severe undiagnosed depression, and maybe bipolar disorder. I feel awfully guilty putting this online, but i’m not sure what else to do.

My friend talks to a lot of people and I don't want everyone in town to know that I like him.

I replied that I definitely don't do this to piss her off and that I want to decide by myself what I want to disclose and want not.

I had recently purchased a used car a month ago. (2013 Fiat 500 Abarth) from a dealership. When I had taken it to the emissions testing facility, I was notified that the obd2 port was not communicating with they’re equipment. 

I had replaced the fuses, disconnected  the battery and performed a drive cycle. I had taken it again to the personal testing kiosk and gotten the same result. Afterwards I had taken the vehicle to a Fiat dealership to see if they can figure out what was wrong. The service dept. had informed me, that all the computer systems in my car are all functioning and although the obd2 port appeared to be aftermarket everything is working as it should be.

It was a warm day and I had driven the car for about an hour to make sure it was at an ideal operating temperature. When I had taken it to different testing facility, I received the same message from one of the employees there. He had also mentioned that the egr, evap, and an 02 sensor are not communicating with they’re equipment. The car drives absolutely fine, I have no check engine lights, and there are no codes popping up for the car. 

Now I find myself unable to pass emissions, transfer plates to my new car and I’m without full knowledge on what is going on with my car. I have a loan on this vehicle and I use this as my daily to get to work (about a half hour drive).

342,"Hey, just wondering with the right procedure is here. I met a cute girl this summer who I think was really into me, but I didn't bother making moves since she was wayyy outta my league. Like ivy girl, super popular, really smart, headed somewhere, prolly gets millions of texts from other guys etc etc.

So I was just wayy too laid back to fuck with whatever type of guys were chasing her, so I kinda just treated her as one of the bois and took her out to do stuff when we could.

No romance, just chilling.

Anyways, summer ended and she went back to college. She recently said a song she was listening to reminded her of me and my buds and thanked me for all the adventures. She called me a friend in the text, so I totally got the hint, kinda hurt but whatevs.

I just replied with ""very nice taste in music"" and left it at that, I think that's a good way to end this chapter. I just don't wanna talk to her anymore cuz it hurts a lil, but she'll send the occasional text that just kills me. Should I just ignore the next one?

TL:DR Met cute popular girl. Way outta my league. Became really good friends tho. Texts me occasionally when she's reminded of our time and it hurts. Should I stop replying if I have no chance? I don't wanna be her friend.

344,"I don't even know how this started, but I'm getting sexually excited by drinking water. Literally, just by drinking water from a glass, I'll begin to get an erection. I discovered that my favorite ""type"" of water is distilled water at room temperature (only slightly cool). It doesn't work with soda, or milk, just water. Nothing seems to flow down my throat so quickly and easily as room temperature water. I try to resist it, but I have to drink water eventually because I become thirsty, and I find my myself wanting more and more water until I'm drinking copious amounts of it. It's like how your brain tends to eschew logic when you're really horny (like those people who get their penises stuck in vacuum cleaners) Recently, I discovered that I can chug about half a gallon of water at once; I probably could have done more, but I was able to pull myself away from it. Please, this is not a joke, I don't even feel like I am the same person I was yesterday. One part of me is scared because I understand that this is a serious issue. The other part is incredibly horny and only thinks about water. Does anyone know what I should do? This is not a joke.",16Sep2018,2
346,"My family is from the suburbs of Chicago, but a little over 4 years ago I moved to Northern California to ""start fresh"" and things have been going pretty well for me here. I have a great friend group, an SO I've been with for 3 years, I'm back in school and thriving, and pretty much am just working on self-improvement and living my best life.  

  

My sister got in a horrible car crash a month before she turned 21. She got whiplash, totaled the car she was driving, and, it turns out, had an incredibly high BAC. She's spent a little time in jail and lost her license. After 1 year of living in Michigan for school, she had to move back in with our parents. She's been living back at home for a year and a half and isn't doing too well--she rips her hair out at night from anxiety. Her hair used to be super curly and cute but now it looks fried and she has bald patches (one person I talked to said he thought she had mange...fucked up). Her eyes are sunken, she has horrible acne on her shoulders, and talks about depression often. She's still on my parent's GREAT health insurance, and used it in IL to see a therapist she hated and get on Ritalin (which she fucking SNORTS) but refuses to take anti-depressants because ""they're chemicals!"" (wtf?)    
    
Anyway, I found a cute little house in my Norcal town and went to fetch her and bring her here to also start fresh. I spend half my time with my boyfriend and our house and the other half of my time with sister in the 2 br I got for her and I to share. 

 My parents found a bunch of vodka bottles hidden in her closet before she moved out, but I've hidden my partying from them as well so I didn't think much of it when they told me. They are over-worriers.    

My sis and I have been living  together for about a month now, and I'm starting to realize that her drinking stems beyond normal 22 year old excess. One time I was home doing homework all day, hanging out with her. I went up to my room for an hour then got a text from her saying she wanted to self-harm. I went into her room and she was SLOBBERING drunk. Talking about how much she hated herself, unable to focus her eyes on anything, sitting on the floor swaying to trap music. I got her out of the house running errands with me which eventually sobered her up, but it was alarming.  

  

I brought her to do some work at my SO's house the other day and before she and I left at noon I caught her with a bottle of Smirnoff, about to drink because she ""was bored.""    
My SO's sister reported to me that she peeked in my sister's purse and saw the Smirnoff bottle there. She drank the whole thing while working and purposefully hid it from me.  

  

I'm not teetotaler--I've fought my own battles with drinking to excess and learning how to balance health and partying. The fact that she's hiding her drinking from someone that is pretty pro-alcohol is a raging warning sign to me.  

  

When, if ever, do I tell my parents that I think she's an addict? What do I do to ensure I don't enable her? What ground rules to I set for our home that I'm only in half the time? The few friends she has out here are friends that I introduced her to and that have loyalty to me--if I told them not to drink with her anymore, they'd listen, but that would enrage her. I'm not so naive as to think there's anything I can do to stop an addict from getting their fix, I just genuinely don't know how to approach this situation. She's 22 so she's extremely cocky and wouldn't take any of my heartfelt concern seriously, she would accuse me of being just like our parents and wanting to shelter and mother her. She wouldn't accept that hiding drinking and drinking alone are both signs of a deeper problem. She probably wouldn't go to AA with me either, though I plan on asking her to go to support me as I quit drinking (I'm not an addict, but I'm over partying).  

If she's going to drink herself to death, that's what she's going to do, but I want no part in it and I want to do whatever is in my power to help, not enable her. I'm not shy and will slap tough love on her no problem, I just don't want to be cruel.    
    
I'm really feeling angry and lost here. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",16Sep2018,2

Now, I'm making 60k a year, work at a good company with quite a few benefits, and everything *should* be going good.

But it's not.

I feel like I'm just eeking by, I feel like I'm completely losing my sanity, I can never seem to turn work-mode ""off"", and I'm constantly stressed out. I feel like all of the friends I made since I relocated here three years ago just... don't care about me as much as I care about them.

I'm a 30 year-old man, and I truly *feel* old. Exhausted, deflated. I feel like I don't have anything left to give, and nobody around me seems to want to give anything in return. I feel like I'm slowly drowning, and everyone is just pretending not to notice.

I'm seriously thinking about just quitting my job.

I don't even know what would happen. I'd probably have to move back in with my dad and his now-wife, I'd probably lose my car, I still have debt that isn't paid off, and I have zero money set back.

But at the same time, the thought of just ""giving up""... sounds really nice right now.

I don't know how to explain it. I just want to be free of stress. I don't want to have to think about work, or think about how disappointing everyone is, or even think about all the shit I have to try and do in my own goddamn life.

353,"Hey r/advice,
so I kind of need some advice on what to do next. (forgive my english please)

Me and my best friend spent a night together after I threw a party at my place (we didn't have sex but other stuff). We're still pretty young (both around 18 ish) and she has a boyfriend. He and I are almost friends I'd say. He is a good guy and I didn't want to cheat with her, she started it and so on. 
I had romantic intentions for our relationship long before and also shortly before, but I always intended to wait until she broke up with her bf. I confessed to her once, then didn't talk to her for a week to give her some time to think and stuff so generally saying she knew I had feelings for her.
This went on for like two months, until she went on a holiday with him recently (for a week). She always told me right after this holiday she'd break up with him because he had paid for it and she didn't wanna make him waste it by breaking up before.
I wasn't really comfortable with the situation, so I talked to her like 2 nights before the trip. Since then we've had no contact so I guess we're done.
The thing is, she was pretty serious about our relationship, she always told me how she loved me and wanted to spend her life with me (I never felt that way), so I'm still waiting for her to hit me up to at least talk to me about us or something. I guess you never know someone til you do.
Since I know her boyfriend kind of well and I do like the guy I don't think he deserves what we did to him and I really want to tell him. Do I wait for her to tell him as we had agreed? I don't know if I could trust her to do it and I don't really want to keep it from him since getting cheated on sucks big time.
Should I tell him or just let it go?

TL;DR:
I cheat on boyfriend of best friend, whom I am friends with, with said best friend, we fall in love, then not anymore. She wanted to tell him but I don't know if she does now. Getting cheated on sucks and I want to tell him. Should I?

354,"I’m a 25 year old female from London and I have a twin brother. I live with my husband and two doors away my twin brother lives with our parents. We’re a very close family, I also have six other siblings, so my parents had 8 children. We’re all super close and family is everything.

Today my parents answered the door to the police. Three officers asked for my brother and wanted to speak to him. My parents were asked to sit outside in the garden while they spoke. When my parents came back in the house they were told they were seizing my brothers laptop and phone and would be going to his work tomorrow to seize his computer there (my brother is an IT specialist). When my parents asked why the police told them they had an ‘accusation of indecent images’. My mother asked what that meant and they said they were looking for pornograhic images of people under the age of 18. They didn’t arrest my brother but told him to come to the police station within the next three hours to hand himself in for questioning. My brother did this and was quested about the whole thing. When my parents asked police how young these people were they said ‘under the age of 18’. 

While this was happening my older sister went round to visit my parents and saw they were upset, they told her what had happened and while they were talking the police had called my sister. They told her everything and said that as she had a three year old and a two year old (both girls) that my brother wasn’t allowed around them alone. If she wanted him to have supervised contact she had to sign a form. They told her that social services/child protection would be coming to visit her to discuss everything and they asked tons of questions about my nieces. My sister also asked how old these people were (like my parents had asked) but police told her ‘Young’. She asked if they were as young as her two kids and they said ‘very young, all we can say is young’

Then my other sister got a call, her daughters are 13 and 15. They told her the same thing. She spoke to my nieces and explained everything and obviously they were extremely upset. My older brother and sister in law also got a phone call about their ten and eleven year old daughters. As these children are older all four of them have to be questioned about my brother.

When my brother eventually arrived home my parents said he was so upset he couldn’t speak. Apparently he was crying the whole time and could barley breathe. He just kept repeating ‘I’m not a Paedophile’. He said he was devastated and didn’t want his family or friends thinking he was a monster.

My family finally managed to get this story out of him... he said he regularly visited this one porn website. He said it was a normal porn site but had an option for people to message you. He says regularly strangers would send him images and he didn’t have the option to accept them or not. He said sometimes it was mainstream porn, sometimes it was gay porn and sometimes it was children. He said whenever it was children he would block the sender, report them to the website and then forget about it. But that he did still use this site to access porn. He said he had zero control over what private messages he was sent and never saved the images, looked at them or shared them.

I want to believe him 100%, he’s my brother and I love him but I’m not sure I do. Would he have been in trouble if that was the case? Surely police would know this. Does this sound believable to any of you? I don’t watch porn myself and I’ve never ever came into contact with anything like that so I’m not sure if this kind of thing is common or could happen?

Police said he will be charged with something but they aren’t sure what yet. Apparently they need to see whether these images are category A, B or C and whether he has been in possession of or distribution. They mentioned him being registered as a sex offender too. My brothers girlfriend has two children both girls aged one and three, he’s been told he’s not allowed around those ether. He is in bits right now and on suicide watch.

Obviously no one thinks ‘my brother/husband/family member/friend is guilty’ or ‘he seems like a peado’ but I honestly can’t imagine my brother to be like that. He loves all six of his nieces and they all love him. Before today no one would have ever even imagined something like that could happen. I can’t believe he’s guilty but his story seems fishy.

I just need some advice really. I have a few unanswered questions.

1. Does his story sound believable? Do you think there’s more to it? Is he lying?
2. Will he loose his job? He works with computers and they are going into his work tomorrow to take it away
3. What will happen with my nieces?
4. Me and my husband are trying for a baby. Will this effect my future children? Will our future children be involved with social services too?
5. If his story is true, what charges is he likely to face?
6. Why didn’t they arrest him or take my parents devices too?",16Sep2018,2
355,"I “met” (have a class with her but don’t really talk to her, she occasionally eyeballs at me when she thinks I’m not looking) this cute girl at homecoming yesterday and I don’t know if I should hit her up. We have mutual friends which is why I was in the group and when we were dancing she would grab my hand and lock her fingers up and we’d just be dancing together. I was kinda like whoa cause I’ve never even had a full conversation with her and she was holding my hand and all over me. I’m not the type of person to take advantage of a girl or put my hands all over them but of course I didn’t complain lol. We were having a great time. I kept my eye contact with her and smiled all while she did the same with me. She even took my hands and wrapped them all over her at one point. At the end of the night she wanted to grab a pic with me. We get that sorted out and then I decided to ask for her number. This was when she seemed kinda surprised but i couldn’t tell if it was a good one or a bad one. Since I’m me I just assume it was bad. She gave me her number but I felt so out of place after. Our mutual friend saw us and asked me about it and I was just like I don’t know and she later asks the girl who says “she’s still hung over someone else”. I’m not sure if this is just because she’s makin an excuse to our friend just cause she asked (she didn’t say anything to anyone else just only the friend who asked since. I asked our other friends who got a ride from her if she said anything in the car but she said nothing) but again because I’m an antagonistic person I’m assuming that it’s true and she is hung over on someone else and I fucked myself. Question is, should I see and hit her up or save myself from looking like a total dumbass and not do it? I know a lotta people will be like it’s just another stupid high school thing but I don’t really care I’d just like to enjoy it while I’m this age.

356,"Moved back in with my father about 7 months ago as he was begging me to move in with him because his gf of 7 years kicked him out of the house they shared. So I said sure and we got a 2 bedroom apartment. Me, my 3 year old brother and him 

He literally does nothing around the house, never does the dishes, doesn’t change the garbages, doesn’t clean counter tops, takes the dog out once a day while I do it multiple times, or really anything so basically I am just a maid whenever I’m home. He comes home and watches TV or he hangs out with my little brother (this kid is his absolute world. I never received any attention from either of my parents EVER growing up) this kid will cuss all the time, tell you to move if you’re sitting somewhere, and will throw stuff at you, and he just thinks it’s funny. Meanwhile if I did that at that age I was literally locked in a room for the day. 

Anyways, he is always asking about how much money I have. And when I tell him I don’t know and shrug off the question (because frankly I think that’s just a rude question, and none of his business anyways) he tells me I need to keep my finances in his check with him. I think that’s none of his business and he shouldn’t know how much money I have and tell me how/when/where I can spend it. He screams at me to save up for a car, when I have $3,500 ready to spend on a car and he just ignores me whenever I ask for a ride out to the seller. I’ve told him this, and he just...ignores my words? He tells me I talk to him disrespectfully like I’m one his friends, meanwhile he makes fun of me a couple times a day and let’s the 3 year old act like a total shitstain towards me and laughs while he says “shut the fuck up”. I’m sorry that I don’t tolerate respect. I straight up told him the other day to stop talking shit to me all the time after he made fun of me for falling off my bike cuz I almost got hit by a car...he told me my elbows and knees are scraped up because ""you take it on all fours like a gay guy"" as im simply just taking the dog out. Like wtf? Thats mad disrespectful. 

He also tells me I don’t “do shit with my life” and that I have “no goals or ambitions” while “all my friends kids are going to college and you don’t do shit!” Which is just false...I applied to colleges, and couldn’t get a ride to the campus to even take a damn placement test. As for not doing anything with my life? I work 45-50 hours a week, I’m literally just trying to pad my pockets right now (like he always screams at me to do since I live with him) like, I’m already doing that, pal. 

Finally, he just loses it and throws my door open screaming that I’m cutting my hair in the shower and he’s sick of finding it everywhere. I don’t cut my hair in the shower, and I don’t know why it’s still in the shower. Nope, it’s somehow my fault. Even though it only pops up when he showers. After I tell him, for the umpteenth time, CALMLY, that I have not been cutting my hair in the shower, he makes some twisted voice and starts yelling at me through gritted teeth telling me that when I was his age he was in the military already for 2 years and had a car and that I’m not doing shit with my life, while he pays a lot of money for me to live with him, and that I’m not doing shit with my life while his friends kids are doing better than I( HELLO you asked me to live with you cuz you said finances were tight. I also pay bills here too you know!) He has 60 dollars in his bank account right now, and goes out to eat with my brother all the time. Not my fault you can’t handle finances...your son who is 2 decades younger than you has more money than you, albeit only a couple thousand more, but still, don’t project that broke shit on to me. 

He told me flat out the other day the rent in our apartment complex is too expensive and that he’s moving in with his friend in 5 months. So basically get a car and a place in 5 months. Ok, sounds good. After years of abuse from both parents because I was an ‘accidental child’ as I’ve heard, how do I bear with the bullshit until I’m able to find a place again? My dad knows nothing about me clearly, he tells me I’m this and that, and that I don’t do shit, yet here I am stacking my pockets, finding out about myself, focusing on exercise and spirituality, and feeling like my best self. But nope...I’m not shit! I don’t really listen to his words cuz I know what’s good with me, but how do I even tolerate this shit...

I'm taking her mini-golfing today, and I don't know what to do. I really like this girl and I very rarely develop crushes (last crush I developed was in 7th grade and I'm in 11th now). I don't want to fuck things up by kissing her at the wrong time. I want to make her homecoming special and have the DJ play  [""The Night We Met""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo0mm1XXz1E) by Lord Huron, and find her and tell her how I really feel about her. I want to tell her how beautiful she is, and that she deserves to be treated like a queen. Should I wait to kiss her? What do I do? I don't want to ruin things. ",16Sep2018,4

I've had feelings for the girl ever since we met, but since she was dating my other best friend, I didn't dare mess with their relationship. Well now that she's technically free, I'm caught between my own interest for her, and respect for the guy, as he's also my best friend.

375,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 23 year old who's recently thrown away everything I thought I knew about myself in terms of morals and personal integrity. I consequently am entirely lost on how to reconcile with myself who I really am now. I know I'm a piece of shit who doesn't deserve any support but I'll tell the story anyways.

2018 was the first time I fell in love with someone, it was a girl who made me smile every time I saw her. I'd met her through a really close friend of mine who I'd gone to school with since first grade. As the year progressed we developed a relationship, texted often, until the day I invited her around and we kissed. Throughout those months I loved her and she loved me back but I had an increasingly heavy weight in my heart each day that passed because she was the girlfriend of my close friend, they'd been dating for 3 years. 

After her and I kissed we broke the news to him and there has been consequent drama for a long time. Her and I have managed to detach our love for each other, her and him are still together which is the outcome all 3 of us are happiest about now. I am in the process of repairing the damage I did to the relationship between him and I, but now that the drama is gone and the dust has settled I am beginning to look at myself again and I don't like what I see. 

What I see is a liar and a cheat, I've accepted what I've done but I still can't shake the fact that I'm an actual living piece of shit for having done that to a friend of mine. I had extremely close friendships with everyone in our friend group that are now damaged to the point where they won't ever be the same. I want to be able to put the effort in and make it right with everyone but I for some reason keep waiting for someone to feel sorry for me which is honestly pathetic on every level. 

Every day is hard because I feel like I have nothing to look forward to anymore, I used to hang onto the little things happening each weekend or getting online and playing games, but that doesn't happen anymore. This is just a part of our group growing up and moving apart, but thanks to me I've accelerated it and it couldn't have come at a worse time. I want to be able to fall onto them when I need it but I honestly don't deserve their love at this point and I can't burden with this anymore. 

I thought I could be stronger for longer but this constant, debilitating drama and emotional shit for the last year has left me exhausted and drained to the point where I don't really recognise myself anymore. I sometimes feel like just going away for a while and finding something else to do, maybe it will clear my psyche, but I think that's just a dream. 

Anyway I don't really have a question I guess, maybe this belongs /r/offmychest but here it is.

Tl;dr: I betrayed a close friend by kissing his girlfriend, that's all sorted and in the past, but now I am lost with myself as a consequence",16Sep2018,6
376,"I moved away from my hometown with my boyfriend about a month and a half ago and am currently attending community college while my boyfriend is going to state college. I moved mostly for my boyfriend but also because I’ve been wanting to live in this town since I was young and because I planned to apply to the state college my boyfriend is going to currently. 

However, seeing my boyfriend and his two friends go to school at this state college has made me realize that I would rather not go to this college. I never applied anywhere else or really considered other colleges as options because of my boyfriend and I’m really regretting it. 

I’m also really unhappy in my daily life and with my living situation. I moved in with my boyfriend and his two friends because the rent is cheap but I have the smallest room out of the four people living here. I also did most of the cleaning for a month until I started getting more firm with my roommates about doing chores which caused tensions and also made me realize that my boyfriends loyalties lie with his friends and not me. 

I also have begun to realize how emotionally immature and not ready for a relationship my boyfriend is. He won’t eat a dinner that isn’t just chips if I don’t cook for him. His room will always be messy unless I clean it for him. His laundry will remain in the basket in the laundry room until I do it for him, and then when I set it on his bed so he can fold it, it’ll stay there for a week until I fold it for him. I also feel unreciprocated in all these nice things I do for him. 

I understand my boyfriend has a disability (ADHD) that causes him to have pretty extreme executive disfunction and that he tries really hard but it puts a toll on me. I feel like a housewife at nineteen years old. I only take a few classes a week so I’m home most of the time and I spend about 70% of my day doing chores for both of us, thinking about what we’re going to have for dinner, and waiting for him to get home. 

I know this isn’t healthy but I’ve put so much into this relationship, spent eight months with him, and seen him grow so much. I’ve seen drastic improvement with how clean he keeps his living spaces and how much he helps around the house but I’m still doing 80% of the work. I feel like if given more time I’ll see him pick up the extra 30% but I also feel like if I suddenly stopped reminding him to clean his room and do basic things, that he would just forget and regress to his former state of living. 

I’m really depressed and I’m suicidal almost every day. I feel like I’m going nowhere with my education and nowhere with my relationship. I have no friends in this town that I don’t live with and I don’t know how to move forward. 

I have to stay in town at least until next August when my lease is over but by the end of this semester I’ll know whether I was accepted into the state college or not. I could leave earlier if I found someone to pay my lease (probably wouldn’t be hard my rent is super cheap and the house is nice) but it would be a huge inconvenience to my family and cost us the security deposit. 

I’m having a really hard time but I’m not sure if it’s worth losing the security deposit and making my parents help move me again. I don’t know if I should stay and keep working on my relationship or get out as soon as I can find someone to pay my lease. I feel awful for putting myself in this position and I would feel terrible making my family help me get out of this mistake. I also feel awful for my boyfriend because I’ve been emotionally unstable lately and he’s pretty much my only source of happiness in a town where I have no friends. 

**tl;dr**: I moved 200 miles from my hometown for my boyfriend. Relationship and living situation isn’t working out like I thought it would and it’s making me very depressed. Not sure if it’s worth it to spend all the money and go through all the effort to move. Advice?

377,"Just, fuck, I hate this so much, I hate my blackness with a fucking passion, people say I'm handsome but I'm not, I'm handsome for a black guy at best, but, far as women see things, I am not, never have been, and never will be more attractive or as attractive as the average white guy. The only shot I even have at being as desired as the average white guy is to become wealthy or famous.

Just, fuck, the only girls that like us are the ones with no options, the desperate ones, or the ones that wanna fulfill some Mandingo fantasy once before they die. You wanna know why black dudes are down to sleep with obese girls? Because no one else is desperate enough to lower themselves to us, that's why. Even black Stacy mostly wants a white dude, maybe a really hood or unattractive black woman would prefer a black dude, but a lot of the good looking ones only want white guys or the hardest hood niggas imaginable.

Fuck, how can I cope with this? I'm hideous because of my race, it doesn't matter how my face or body looks I'm still a fucking negro and women will always be disgusted by that. What can I do? I don't have the money to become an alcoholic and throw my life away, and I don't have the balls to kill myself, so, just, fuck...

I feel so fucking broken, I hate this fucking curse, that's what being black is, a curse, a curse where you're never treated like a person and are invisible and unloved.

I don't know what to do she doesn't realize I do this because I love her but she doesn't care she just wants to feel better and is addicted I'm scared she's gonna die by OD'ing and the last thing I would have said to her is cussing her out but I can't just be positive about it and to make matters worse the rest of the family has cut her off because of it even my dad. It's very frustrating because I know she just wants to feel better but she doesn't see how it's hurting some of the people around her mainly because she's high and old and stuck in her ways. It's like I can't win in this situation because if I even try to talk to her about it she'll cuss me out and it leads to argument where I cuss her out so what the fuck could I do honestly.,16Sep2018,1
381,"Hey!

&amp;#x200B;

When I meet someone for the first time or if I´m around people I just don´t know very well I am extremely shy for some reason. 

To make this clear: I know that you are a bit more restrained or reserved around people you meet for the first time or just don´t know that well, but my problem goes far beyond that. I struggle with making small talk or keep the conversation going.

That means that when there is a moment of silence I desperately trying to find a new topic to talk about but can´t find to grab it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also observed that I am really ""tensed"" and not really relaxed and quick-witted. 

I mean, even if I´m around friends I´m not really a quick-witted person, but around new people, I just get really tensed and have a hard time relaxing and just have a natural conversation.

Like I said I think I was like this my entire life but because I had the same group of friends in school it didn´t bother me that much then.

But because I moved to a different city now and meet a lot of new people at my job it just bothers me.

Any tips on how to overcome this? ",16Sep2018,5

385,"I am a PhD student. I began working in a new lab, and find that I am attracted to one of my colleagues. This doesn't happen too often - I have a personal policy not to date or flirt with colleagues. Additionally, I do not reveal much about my personal life in work settings.

However, this feeling of attraction catches me by surprise, and i find myself playfully flirting with this colleague. She, in turns, often sits close to me, laughs at my jokes, and holds slightly long eye contact with me.

I recently invited her to join me in an extracurricular but still academically related position. I did this because she is intelligent and would do well in the position.

Upon further reflection, I realized that I also invited her because I am attracted to her, which left me feeling concerned that my invitation was not appropriate.

She responded to the invitation enthusiastically, but seems to be avoiding me since I realized that attraction was an underlying motivation in making the invitation.

Fwiw, we're the same age, both conventionally attractive, we're both generally well-liked in the department, and the attraction previously felt mutual. Also, my policy about not dating colleagues is very strict. I know it sounds weird, but my flirtatious demeanor was accidental - I consistently stop when I realize I'm being flirtatious - it feels generally unconscious.

Am I being creepy? If so, how can I stop and not create any more awkward situations in this professional environment?

388,"To start, I’m totally ok with her getting an abortion, it’s just that things are a little complicated. And yes, I acknowledge that I’m an idiot for not wearing a condom, but here we are.
A bit of background: 
So I’ve been seeing this girl for a few months now and it’s been going well between us. I recently moved away for school and we’ve still been talking daily. We are both in our early 20s and in college, but we haven’t put a title on our exclusive relationship because she’s scared of the long distance and I’m relatively ok with that.
So this is where things get interesting. Before I moved away, my girl had been on birth control for quite some time and I wasn’t worried about knocking her up; however, she stopped taking it at some point and we continued to have sex while I was unaware of this.  Fast forward 1.5 months to yesterday when she calls and says “We have to talk. It’s serious.” She tells me that she took a pregnancy test since she noticed that she hadn’t had her period in a long time and that it tested positive. She also tells me she has already scheduled an abortion for this coming Friday. (Btw I trust her telling me that I was the one got her pregnant since I believe she’s an honest person) Earlier in our relationship we talked about what would happen if she got pregnant and we both agreed that terminating the pregnancy would be best. So I tell her that I’m sorry for causing all of this and that I’m willing to do whatever it takes to help her out with this stressful situation despite being hundreds of miles away. I ask if she wants me to be there with her for this and I offer to fly over to be present, but she says that she’d rather deal with this herself and not make it a bigger deal than it needs to be. She says her best friend, a nice girl who I also trust, is gonna help her through this. I just feel like I should be more involved since I really, really care about her and I don’t want her to suffer alone. I also don’t want her to resent me for this situation and I hope our relationship continues.

390,"Okay so I didn’t know where to post this and it’s been really growing on me. I’m 15 years old from London, and recently went on a language course / holiday to Spain with a friend. The concept of the course is that people of the area take teens in as Homestays and give somewhere to stay. For me, I went out every night and spent barely any time at the Homestay. The woman looking after me and a couple other boys first started making me uncomfortable by excessively hugging me, either from behind when I wasn’t expecting or before I left. As someone who is slightly introverted and of English culture, I assumed it was just the culture the part of Spain I was in. However, it got to the point where I was very uncomfortable about being there, and was touched and bothered whenever I was home. I remember the first time I actually thought something was up was when she followed me into my room, but my feet on her breast and tried to tickle me, and, when I rejected, called me a cold hearted boy. Anyway, this went on, and I joked with friends about how she was a pedo and whatever, but the part that makes me so uncomfortable and bothers me is a very vague memory of one night. I had gone out with other friends, smoked some weed and had a little to much to drink. I could function but have photos from the night I can’t recall. It was really fun and I remember laughing with my friend on the way back. Anyway, I walked in, sat on the sofa, and I think I fell asleep. I have this re occurring memory of seeing her sit right next to me, give me some vodka, and start massaging my thighs and genitals. I was so out of it that I didn’t really know what was going on, but I woke up the next day, kind of without memory, again thinking it was a hug or something. Anyway I carry on going out and the same type of shit occurs, but I spend as much time out as possible. When I got back to London , I received a Snapchat from her, in Spanish, which roughly translates to “ open up babe, I know you wanted to kiss me that night, I loved your penis.” Now, some of you might be thinking ah nice, you got a rub down from a Spanish woman, how kinky or whatever, but no shit when I got that text those drunk/ high memories come back and it’s really playing on me. If I was a girl and she was a guy and sexually abused me in the way that she did it wouldn’t be acceptable.

And of course, when things calm down for her parents, she comes back destroyed, and I have to be supportive for her all over again. The 10th of this month, one day before her birthday, something bad happened. Her mother came frustrated from work, and told her that she didnt want anyone to come for her birthday. Of course my gf didn't want to, said no, that its her special day. And her mother snapped at her, with an intention to hit her. She, of course, tried to defend herself, and accidentaly kicked her, softly to stop her. And then , all hell broke loose. When her father found out, he snapped badly. They broke her phone, told her she won't be able to go out, or literally ""dont cook anything for that whore tomorrow, she doesnt deserve it"" even though she has tough time eating. Of course, they always chase their friends by phone, telling them not to come or say anything to her, quite menacingly. On friday, by per chance they let her go to school, a friend of her lended his phone to her to call me. OFC i was hella worried about what the heck happened. she told me that, and I told her that what they are doing, is plain tough abuse, that she needed to get out of there ASAP. because its gonna happen again. But she didn't want to listen, she said that they are her family, and that she belives maybe this will get better and they realize what they've done. She wanted to break up with me, because their parents are reckless, and if they found out she've been deating a man 2 years older than her, she feared with all her soul that they accuse me of pedo or some shit, even though I feel nothing but love and care for her. I don't know what the heck to do, I cant reach out to her, I cant see her, I cant do anything. She doesnt listen to me anymore, she is hella scared , and I know she needs me and support. What should I do? I don't know the right step. I've thought of going to the authorites to check the case, but I don't wanna hurt her. Its quite a complex case, but I love her, and I want the best for her no matter how tough it can be to reach that. I've heard her voice being so happy after bad days, her dreams and how she wanted to fulfill them. I can't give up, not like this.",16Sep2018,1

So...well, we didn't collide. We both realized last second and tried to pull back but I ended up smacking my face on the handle. He still feels horrible, even though it was both of us that caused it (honestly my own clumsiness played a big role too).

I know for a fact, every single person I see tomorrow at work is going to ask me what happened. I'm worried the %100 truth will sound like the cover up of an abused person. My SO is much larger then me, and I swear everytime I have even a tiny scratch on my face strangers give him dirty looks like he did it.

403,"So... for close to a month now, there's been... someone... that I find it difficult to stop thinking about. But I want to think about other women, and she has a genuinely lovely relationship with another guy who I also really like. But, after speaking to her for a long time in a situation I couldn't really escape (ie, a six hour car journey), I discovered we had an awful lot in common (like, more than anyone in that group, bar perhaps her boyfriend, who is a top bloke). But more to the point, she actually takes genuine interest in the stuff I talk about, and when I'm used to a lot of what I say being either too nerdy or too intense for most people, having someone drop all pretense and take interest like that is like kryptonite for me. That, plus she is extremely smart, and is into an awful lot of the nerdy esoteric shit I'm into, which, again, is like kryptonite. She is also an extremely responsible and consciensious person. Again, kryptonite.   


So after heading home, I did as much as I could to distract myself and think about other things, but I could not get the following off my mind; *Of any of the women I've come accross, no one comes close to being exactly what I would want as she.*  
I guess a bit later I was able to put my mind to other things for a bit, but now I'm back at uni, and here's the problem; I'm on a committee of a club, which she is also on.  This means I can't really avoid her, because we have to meet regularly to make sure that club doesn't go to shit. I know that's probably the best thing in terms of taking her off my mind, but it's not really an option for me. Like, this weekend I did committee training again, and for the whole two days I couldn't remove myself, and as is often the case, it's when you leave that you can't take the thoughts off your mind. I just worry this cycle may continue, and I'll have difficulty moving on.

404,"I went from a breakup - shit jobs - grief - parents health troubles - unemployment - 

Now at 26 I am like a ghost of my former self - I am isolated in my house most the time shitting myself about my dad dying - hes 84 - and it breaks my heart to see him get older.

\- I havent had sex in years - which is probably part of why Im feeling like this 

\- I have grown apart from all my best mates

\- I peaked so early in life and everything has been downhill ever since, I don't know what to do - just 6 years ago I was a completely different person

I know this is growing up - quarter life crisis - depression whatever. But what the fuck. I am a shell. - My brain feels broken. - Its killing me see all my friends grow and become the men they should be when I have been downward spiraling feeling like a boy in a mans body. 

\- I have no idea how I ended up like this or what. I can face life, and I am, but I feel like I have just blown through life, did it all wrong then thinking what the fuck - 15 years ago I had the best quality girls in town chasing me, now I sit in a room in isolation.

405,"Throwaway because I (26f) think my friend (24f) may know my Reddit username.

Ok. So I’ve contemplated posting this for a long time. Some background information. I’ve lived with my best friend for 5 years and  been friends with her for 7. Around 4 years ago, she broke down and told me she suffered from depression and I was as supportive as I could be, I sat up with her countless nights, ate crap food with her, never judged and listened intently. I came to family events with her to support her and over time, her family and I became very close. 

The issue began when I started to suggest therapy, counselling or even just making an initial doctors appointment. At the time, she agreed but it never came to fruit. 

Soon, she started to feel a little better, and things died down for a while. Until, of course, her depression came back. And why wouldn’t it? She had never addressed it at all. At this point it became my responsibility to hold the fort in the house by cleaning and cooking 80% of the time, ensuring bills were paid and everything was done in my name because I couldn’t trust that she would actually do things.

She eventually also developed anxiety and years down the line, we are still stuck in this cycle. We aren’t 16.... I’m a grown woman who is turning down dates because I feel responsible for her. I am at the end of my tether. I feel like her friendship is sucking the life out of me and I spend my time covering her back with other friends with absolutely no gratitude from her. I completely respect the fact that she is ill, but she downright refuses to get help and this is something I can’t tolerate anymore. I feel used and I can’t stand how she can put on a front for others but the person who I live with can be so nasty and lazy and ungrateful. She barely speaks to me until 10pm then comes to me in tears when I am a person who really needs my sleep, I like to be in bed by 10. But this happens multiple times a week and continues until 2/3am. Is this unreasonable of me?

She makes me feel guilty for being happy or even mentally stable and when I try to talk about something that makes me happy she tells me that it’s annoying or passes comment on how she wishes she could feel anything like that. It’s unfair!

We rent together. She can’t afford to live here alone, but I really think I need to move out for my own sanity. Thoughts? I could put a deposit down on a cheap flat/house and pay a mortgage alone, I’d struggle a little and have to make some cuts, but I could do it affordably. 

However the thought of leaving her in a situation where she can’t afford to live here scares me. I’m not trying to alienate her to make her condition any worse. I just can’t tolerate someone who downright refuses to seek help and is using me to some degree. Would you limp around with a broken leg for 4 years, and wonder why it still hurts?

So- what do I do? If I move out, I think our friendship will be over and her family would be devestated. I would be worried about her mental and physical health. Do I put her and tell her family? I’m not sure what a sane alternative will be for me! 

Help!

Overall a lack of focus in school and very very short attention span. I really don’t feel like doing anything. I still seem to have my normal sense of humour thank god, but life just seems lots more monochromatic, Black and white, dull. 

I don’t really have any friends, I struggle with confidence and happiness overall, even before feeling numb. Lots of my desires to do things have been stripped away, and I’m quite concerned this problem will only continue to get worse.

Worldwide Coverage. If you need a repair while abroad, just file a claim. Once approved, we will let you know how to get your item fixed and then quickly reimburse you.

However, when I called, they said that this worldwide coverage doesn’t apply to my location. It only applies to certain retailers, and staples is not one of them.. This makes no sense since the brochure in which this is written on has the staples logo. This is incredibly frustrating.

417,"My began making plans to go on a vacation out of the country in the next couple of months, and she wanted to take me with her. She has a lot of frequent flyer miles and hotel rewards because of her job, which would make the trip a lot cheaper than it would be otherwise, but the price she gave me was still over half of my savings. I am 26 years old, working mainly freelance and kind not making a lot of money. I've already been dipping a little into my savings out of necessity, which I hate. So even though I have been actively job hunting and opportunities like this don't come around often, I told her I needed to think about it but the answer was probably no.

The very next day, she comes to tell me that she's finalizing the plans for this trip, and that she's going with her mother. I'm fine with this and happy for her, because my mom loves to travel. But then she tells me that they're going on this trip for less than half the price of what she told me when she asked me. If I'd had those numbers when she first asked me, there's a good chance I would have said yes.

I don't want to say anything about it, and I don't plan to. My mom always takes her on trips when no one else is able or willing to go, and then comes back with all kinds of complaints about how she and grandma fought the whole time. I have a feeling that if I told her I would have been interested in going at this price, my mom would rescind the offer to grandma, which is unfair to her and would make me feel rotten. 

I guess I'm just wondering: how can I get over the jealousy I feel now? I want to let this go, but I feel tempted to say something to her when I know I shouldn't.

Just gonna give the short rundown of our friendship, so if you have some advice, please share.

Met this guy on Reddit month and a half ago. Clicked well, talked about a lot of stuff, messed around, help each other yada yada, like all friends do. Like three or four weeks ago he told me that he hadn’t been feeling so well, had been kind of off, so I decided to give him some space. Checked up on him once, told me he was feeling better, the day after that he asked me what I had been up to, I told him and the conversation just ended there, since I figured he still needed space and time. That was three weeks ago.

I found out in the meantime that he started using Instagram again (which I don’t follow) even though he deactivated his profile before that, which was kind of odd to me, but decided to just move on to a certain extent since he wasn’t texting me anymore, so I figured he didn’t want to talk and/or be friends. That was all cool, but there was still that part of my brain telling me I should text him and see what’s happening even though my gut was telling me not to. 

I really wanted to continue that friendship, so I typed in his username in the Instagram search bar and saw that he deleted all of his posts, cleared his icon and just wrote *Fake* as his bio. I have a feeling something might be wrong and my brain again is telling me I should reach out, but I don’t know... I feel like he might have moved on and doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore I guess. I thought he was lying about going through some stuff up until now, but it might have been true. Sorry if my post is messy, I’m tired, but you get the gist of it.

429,"\*Just a quick disclaimer, I'm in Scotland so things about American high schools won't make much sense to me.

I'm in my final year at high school, and whilst it is a good year because my bully is gone and I have more free time, I'm finding that there are very limited opportunities for leadership or personal growth.

I wanted to be a retreat leader (the school runs a retreat program and I had a blast when I went on them myself), however, they were judging our suitability for that based on how we coped at a leadership course at an outdoor centre (I am awful at outdoor activities).

So, that boat has sailed and there doesn't seem to be anything else other than doing two 15 minute crowd control duties per week or mentoring the new kids the school. Neither of those options are that enjoyable. I already do the former anyway.

What can I do? I really wish I cold have taken on the retreat leader option and there seems to be nothing else. I sometimes want to just leave and do something else with my life rather than staying here since options are so limited.",16Sep2018,1
430,"So this all kind of started back in June. Me (19 year old male), my Mom, and my 2 teenage sisters got evicted from our apartment in New York. We couldn't pay rent anymore when my Dad left and tried to work something out with public assistance but the landlord wouldn't work with us. His side of the deal was to make the apartment in livable condition (Infestation, no working water heater or internal heating, holes in the ceiling that caused leaks, ect.) But he refused to fix anything until he got payed. He wasnt getting payed because he wasn't fixing things. This went on for a while until he evicted us, wrongfully I might add because he never informed us we we're being evicted, which he got fined a lot of money for along with the state of the apartment. We're staying with our Aunt and Uncle now but it's *very* temporary. 

A little more context on my Mom. She's in her 40s, and in no condition to work. She got into a terrible car accident back in 2006 which left her with chronic back pain and a terrible seizure disorder. We tried working with Disability but they kept denying her for their reasons. Public assistance is our only source of income. We have an organization helping us get the help we need but they've been no help to us in the years we've been with them. In fact the one worker we've been assigned that actually helped get a lot of stuff we need like food stamps and tried to get us into a housing program was fired out of no where. 

So now were living with our Aunt and Uncle but it's not looking like we'll be able to stay much longer. The organization we're working with has tried a lot of charities but all of them want us to be in a shelter before they can help get us into housing. My Mom's been in a shelter before and vowed never to go back because of how dangerous those places can be. 

So the advice I'm looking for is if there are any places or charities that can help us get into an apartment. We've already got a roommate set up to help with rent but all the housing charities we've gone to require us to be in a shelter. I've even thought of making a GoFundMe or something but I can't imagine it would get popular enough. I hope this is the right subreddit to ask this.",16Sep2018,1

434,"Currently making less the 25k a year at a dead-end IT job. Been trying to get a full time job for many many years, getting tons of interviews but no hires. Well, actually, I have been hired twice within the past year (one was an IT Job, the other was a property inspector job) but I managed to get fired from both in a short period of time. I feel stuck in IT because I've trying it for so long but I have no real passion for it and have no clue what else I could do. I have a liberal arts degree and an associates in computer networking but having either hasn't really helped me career-wise

I have no friends, never had a girlfriend, a 34 year old virgin, living at home with mom and feel completely socially isolated/awkward around most people, even family. The only joy I get out of life are just pure escapism like comic books, video games etc and occasionally just going out on my own in nature hikes or to just wander around NYC whenever I am there for an interview

I don't like where my life is at or where it is heading. I don't what to do anymore; I've tried therapy, medication, social anxiety consoling groups and whole host of other things to get my life and career in order, but to no avail.

What can I do?",16Sep2018,1
435,"This is really long but please help me out!! I need advice. Me and my girlfriend have been together ever since November of 2017. We're long distance but not too long, just about an hour. But we're both only teenagers. She lived with her dad before, and she had her own phone, and we would text and call pretty much when ever. But, she moved in with her mom recently. Her mom is WAY more strict. My girlfriend broke her phone though, and she had to use a tablet to text me. This all happened during summer break. School was coming around and her mom told her that she needed to be in bed by a certain time. Even though her mom said that, we would stay up past that time because we just couldn't stop texting :( Last Sunday, me and her were up at around 11pm, texting. She thought her mom wouldn't be back until the morning so that's why we were up so late. The conversation was a little naughty. So I guess her mom came home, and then went in her room and saw that she wasn't asleep. So she took her tablet and went through our messages. I hadn't gotten a text back for about 10 minutes so I thought my girlfriend fell asleep. But then I got a text from her mom saying not to text her anymore, and that her daughter was not my ""girlfriend or my daddy"", and that ""we should be ashamed to be having an inappropriate conversation"". She made a few spelling errors, so i corrected her, and she called me a ""fast ass"". I got a little mad about that, but the conversation ended with her mom telling me goodnight and basically to not contact her daughter again. So I texted her on kik again the next day and it went to S. I'm not sure if the app got deleted, or her tablet is turned off. But i'm sure if my girlfriend still had her tablet she would find a way to secretly text me on snapchat or instagram or kik! But she hasn't. I was thinking about texting one of her sisters to check in, since i'm logged into her instagram, but I don't know. It's been a week since we've texted and I don't know what to do!

438,"Hello, 

I have 3 close friends who are renting 3 bedrooms in an apartment. The fourth room is empty and the leasing office can put anyone who is looking for a room in that room.  Each of them pay $850 for each room. 

They are asking me to be their fourth roommate but I do not like the idea of spending $850 for a room. Plus I need to spend 70-80 for the parking. I found several houses for rent around campus and they are going for $1400-1900 with 4-5 bedrooms, 2.5-3 bathrooms. 

The issue is my friends think that their apartment is furnished lol but the reality is it is not. It is kinda furnished, just a cheap bed frame and a cheap mattress, and a cheap hard sofa fits 2-3 at most. It is so hard lol. They like it because its furnished. Anyways, they like it because it is 10mins walk from campus. 

I am trying to convince them to move to a house so we can lower the rent to 400-500 each (we may have a 5th roommate in 6 months), plus we have extra space, extra driveway (we like working on our cars, and we can get more quietness, since the walls in the apt are so thin, and the apartment itself is small so they can barely sleep if there were friends in the living room. 

I have a fancy big 2- piece sofa that I can bring in to the future house, and I have a floor rug that I bought for $200 a year ago, I also have a TV table, and some long lamps for the living room. 

How do I work with that? breaking the lease is easy nothing to worry about. I am just lost in how to open it up with them.

We would always text every week to talk about whatever, music, school, funny stuff, and college. We got kinda close over summer break, and I kind of expected him to officially ask me out when we were hanging out the last day of break, but he didn't. When this school year started he suddenly got super distant from me. Whenever I go out of my way to talk to him in person he seems like he really doesn't want to talk, and he hasn't texted me at all.

445,"I’m currently in my third year as a junior at NYU. I don’t hate it, but I know I’m not satisfied and happy here with my college experience. I tried to join clubs, sports teams, even held e-board positions but didn’t forge any close friendships because everyone is kind of on their own agenda and schedule here, as we don’t see each other outside of club meetings and activities. 

The prospect of these being “the best four years of my life” terrify me. I spend most of my time alone and depressed here, missing the high school days where I had a close, reliable friend group and a lot of fun. 

I’m only hesitant to transfer now because I’m already a junior and only have a 3.4 right now, due to a depressing freshman year and an okay sophomore year (which kept me from transferring). I’m concerned that it might be too late to transfer as a current junior. I fear it might also be the same old story of me not being able to make friends, since friend groups are “established”, and I’ll just feel the same way, only after all the stress of moving in somewhere new again.

NYU does not feel like home to me. This is not what I wanted out of college. I don’t fit in with the fast paced, busy, independent, club-going lifestyle of New York and this school (not as a 19 year old anyway). I don’t even think I’ll remember these years if I choose to stick it out with NYU, as everyday felt and feels bland, disconnected and uneventful. If someone asked me my best college memory in the future, I'd have little to say.

447,"Recently, my 50yo mom has been concerned about her health, which I think is valid-- she works two jobs, both of which result in her sitting for most of the day 6-7 days a week, and my family's never been one for a vegetable-heavy diet. She's asked me to accompany her to exercise classes or start running with her several times, but I've always turned her down (I prefer to run alone), and her motivation pretty much disappears after that. 

Her biggest holdup seems to be that she wants company to help motivate her, but she also doesn't want to be seen struggling by a bunch of fit strangers in an exercise class. I was thinking of saving up and getting her a Peloton bike (so she'd be a part of a live class, but without anyone actually seeing her) but the price really gives me pause, and I don't even know if it'd be effective long-term.

452,"So I'm going to apologise in advance as this will probably be a long post, but I just needed to get all this out and am in desperate need of some advice and believe all I wrote is relevant to the situation. So please if anyone can give me some general advice on the below situation I will be eternally grateful. 

So some background on the situation; my sister is 15 years old and I'm 17 we're quite polar opposites in how we act, I'm fairly introverted and like staying indoors gaming, whereas she's quite extroverted. She likes going shopping all day compared to me who hates going out shopping but likes shopping online. Just things like that really. We're not really the sort of sisters that are super super, close and tell each other everything, we rarely open up to each other about our problems, that's not to say that we're distant we just don't share anything personal, which is why I am finding this whole situation a lot harder and upsetting for me to deal with. So when my sister was younger she was slightly chubby and when she was about 12 or 13 she lost a fair bit of weight quite suddenly as she started exercising and going for runs and such. She never was so thin that it was a concern she looks healthy in herself she has an amazing figure and she's tall like a model. So that's all the background you really need to know.

She currently has a boyfriend who I don't really trust at all, I know he messages other girls (Well I found out today he was trying to 'talk' to one of my friends) and I was going to tell her but that was before I found out about her eating disorder and now I don't want to tell her and her think it's because she wasn't good enough or something like that, thus causing her Bulimia to get worse. So I'm not sure what to do about this as I think she should know obviously because it's unfair for me to just leave her in a relationship with someone unfaithful but at the same time I don't went her to blame herself.

So probably within the last year or so throughout the house we've noticed that food goes missing a LOT. Like not just like a few biscuits here and there, like 1 day we have a full jar of something, lets say jam, then later that day the entire jar is gone, or an entire tub of ice-cream is gone or a whole block of cheese in just a few hours. Me and my mum thought it was a 'secret eating' thing where she didn't want people to think she eats a lot so she does so when there's no one around. And don't get me wrong that's obviously not a good habit to have and is likely to develop into something more serious, but we never noticed any physical signs of anorexia so thought ""Well it's a good thing that she's eating, even if she does so in secret"" so we left it be, and never really bought it up to her incase she suddenly stopped eating if she thought we knew. I'm not going to lie it got quite annoying when I would go out and buy myself snacks only to have them all completely gone by the next day so sometimes I got a little annoyed and told her to stop eating all my food.

In the last few months that's gotten worse, more food going missing. Until today when I went to have a shower and noticed the drain was blocked so I was trying to unlock it and up came all her sick from earlier in the day. She's always taken ages in the shower like once she's turned the water off and I guess that's why. So I told my mum about it and she told me that she was going to talk to her about it but say that she was the one who saw the shower instead of me and told me not to mention it to her. So she talked to her and my sister admitted it.

She always seems to be in a bad mood pretty much all the time when she's at home and a while ago she was having some friend problems at school where her 'friends' weren't inviting her to go out anywhere with them (But that's probably because they'd ask her before but she never went out so they gave up asking), so then she started going out with them and now they invite her out again. And she's generally a very sort of impressionable person who goes along with the crowd and wants to fit in, whereas I don't really give a shit what people think of me. She eats salads pretty much every day for dinner even when me and my parents have pizza every Saturday, however she'll be with her boyfriend and eat pizza or go out to get pizza with him even though she insists she doesn't like it to us.

I just feel really upset and confused. I don't know what she hates so much about herself that she feels she needs to binge eat then make herself sick. And this isn't supposed to sound bad but I don't understand why she binge eats if she knows she's going to make herself sick later to get rid of it, why not just save yourself the trouble and not binge to start with. That sounded really shallow, and it was not supposed to and obviously I am not going to understand her situation unless I've been in it before but I just don't understand how anyone could dislike themselves that much or feel they need to conform to these 'guidelines' to fit in with everyone of how you should look and act to fit in with everyone. I honestly can't explain how bad I felt for her and how upset this made me, and angry at myself that I never saw all these signs sooner...

I don't think she understands that all these Instagram models you see on social media that isn't reality especially not with things like Photoshop and Facetune being so present nowadays. She said to me the other week that she 'wishes she could be like me and eat chocolate and not have to exercise and still have a good figure' (I do eat quite a bit of chocolate and an still quite slim and toned). But knowing what I know now I wish I would have told her that everyone has things they dislike about themselves and no matter how 'perfect' someone may seem in your eyes I can guarantee that they have things they dislike about themselves and you don't need to look a certain way to fit in or be liked. Like I have stretch marks on my thighs, I used to wish I had bigger boobs and I'm not going to lie I was a little self conscious about it but now I've gotten to know myself a lot more in the past couple of years and have gotten over that and my mentality now is that I have to live in this body for my whole like so I might as well focus on what I love rather than what I think could be improved.

I wish I could tell her all this stuff but I'm not supposed to know about her Bulimia and I don't want her to think my mum told me in case she then she shuts herself off and stops talking to my mum altogether about any of this. I suggested to my mum that we should take her to see a doctor but she said she thinks she can help by just talking to her (Because sister hates doctors/dentists and things like that) but I think it's too late for just talking I think she needs professional help. Then my mum got upset and asked me if I thought she was a bad parent and if all this was her fault, I assured her it wasn't. It just makes me so upset to see them both like that, I was crying for literally hours.

Please, anyone who's reading this I want to let you know that you're beautiful and not to listen to anyone who is negative, do things for you, not for anyone else. Focus on yourself and your goals and don't constantly think about how other perceive you because in the end that doesn't matter and if you have an eating disorder like my sister, you're worth so much more than that. And if any of you need to chat about anything or get anything out, anonymously (As I know that sometimes it's a lot easier to talk to open up to someone without actually knowing them), feel free to shoot me a message and I'll do my best to help &lt;3 ",16Sep2018,1

458,"I am a 20 year old male who dropped out of college after depression/anxiety got the best of me and I would like to go back in the winter. I am still depressed/anxious and even suicidal somedays and would like some concrete things I can do to get myself up on my feet again. I have narrowed down my depression down to TWO things....

1. I am horrible at public speaking. Not just speaking in front of large crowds, but even in a group of 3 to 4 people. My voice starts to shake, I stutter, and my heart beats. I am really insecure about my voice. Ever since puberty turned my voice really deep, I have never been comfortable with it. I am thinking I should visit a voice therapist to learn how to use it because I feel like I am not using it right. Is this a good idea? Maybe I should visit a throat doctor to see if there is anything wrong with it because it sounds hoarse and raspy most of the time. Being insecure about my voice is one of the main reasons I dropped out of college and I NEED to be completely comfortable with public speaking before I start college in the winter because if I am not I feel like I will drop out again.

2. I have a receding hairline. My hair has slowly been retreating backwards since I was 16. I wouldn't say it is bad yet, but it is definitely noticeable. I have already accepted that I will probably shave my head in a year or two once I can grow a beard. What I haven't accepted is the fact that I am only 20 and I have a receding hairline. Like, I've never even had a girlfriend yet. I have huge self confidence/image issues because of this and the aforementioned reason. I guess what makes me the most anxious is the fact that I have had long hair my entire life that hid my hairline and I decided to cut my hair short a month ago to see what it would look like.

I am REALLY anxious about inevitably seeing family/friends again in the next few months and having them see my hairline and judge me. If my hair receded later in life, I definitely wouldn't be insecure about it, but all of my friends and even my older brothers have amazing hairlines. I feel like I've been robbed of my youth almost. I am almost certain my hair has been falling out due to the enormous amount of anxiety I experienced during my teenage years.

~~~~~

Hey all. Two years ago I was in a weird place. Felt like my life was moving to a new phase, and as it was happening I felt myself losing touch with my best friend of a few years. We lived in different countries, but spoke every single day, for hours at a time.

I lost her one day when I'd had a terrible day (boyfriend had lost a friend to suspected suicide and I couldn't be by his side), and my friend messaged me something that really upset me. We had a brief back and forth, apologizing and stuff, but it didn't feel the same after. I think we both felt hurt and guilty and uncomfortable. So we stopped messaging each other. Just one day, we stopped talking entirely. After a few months of me feeling unsure about how to approach her to apologize, I checked her facebook and she'd unfollowed me, same on every other social media/way of communicating. It broke my heart and pissed me off all at once, and I didn't even try contacting her. 

It's now been two years and four months. I messaged her on facebook apologizing for ghosting her, pretty much, and said that I missed her and wanted her to know I was sorry and stuff. Told her she didn't have to reply, I just wanted her to know that, etc. No reply, she never even opened it. Got kinda drunk and sent her a bunch more apologies and stuff... Don't even think the messages are going through.

Its possible she's blocked me, and never wants to hear from me again. Part of me thinks I deserve it, the other just wants her friendship again and the happiness we gave each other every day. I don't know what to do... I don't know how to move on, I've never found anyone like her again, and I don't think I will. We're adults, graduated from University. ",16Sep2018,2
465,"I'm an assistant teacher at an elementary school with a mission statement of diversity, inclusion and anti-bias. My lead teacher (LT) has consistently made racially charged, disparaging comments about children and families, humiliated children and adults she works with, and tells me that she doesn't want to work with kids who she thinks are ""beyond hope because they're stupid"".  

&amp;#x200B;

When I told LT that these comments are not appropriate and hurt the children, she changed her behavior but it was clearly a forced act. After a day or two, LT reverted back to her typical behavior. I was able to confirm this pattern of behavior with other assistants who have worked with her in the past, at the same school. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been brought up to our principal, who excuses the behavior saying ""\[lead teacher\] has anxiety"". When I brought up my concerns, principal suggested I take LT out to dinner and confront her about the speech and racism. I feel this is not my job and said as much, but currently there is no plan in place for administration to take action. I plan to document any future comments from LT.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should the next move be?  What are my options moving forward? ",16Sep2018,1

467,"Minor warning, cutting is involved in this story. 

&amp;#x200B;

 A while ago I was confronted by a girl who was suicidal. I'll call her Christine for the sake of not being confusing. I had known of her for a while but I never initiated conversation. Then out of the blue, she posts picture of her with cuts all down her thighs and I instantly tried to see if I could help in anyway. We became friends and I helped her with her cutting problem because admititly had the same issue. Although after a while she began flirting with me and I instantly pushed her back because I had a girlfriend. We didn't talk for about 7 weeks and I didn't think much of it because she had been getting better and stopped cutting anyways. Then, my girlfriend i'll call Elizabeth, becomes aware of Christine. She goes on her profile, and sees her flirting with me in comments. Which is why I stop talking to her in the first place. She instantly became upset. She tells me I was cheating on her, and that she never wants to talk to me again. Of course, I tried explaining the situation and showing her our messages but whatever trust she had confided in me was gone. I even got Christine to confess that we never had anything more than a friendship. But she hasn't talked to me for 3 weeks and can't wrap my head around it. We'd been dating for two years and 6 months. I feel like I got fucked over for just trying to help someone. Any advice?",16Sep2018,1

469,"So I’m very new to Reddit. I apologize in advance for likely breaking many unwritten rules of this vast community, due to my sheer ignorance.

With that being said, any advice/wisdom regarding 
my current predicament is appreciated.

I am a 16 year old student, and I just started my junior year. At this point in my life, one of the toughest things for me is trying to figure out who I am and/or who I want to be. With seemingly ENDLESS opportunities in this world, I get so overwhelmed thinking about the options I have and thinking about what will make me happy. Even though I know I shouldn’t, I often feel like I’m trying to live out others’ lives. I want to put myself on a path that will bring me fulfillment and happiness, but every time I do something, I find myself wishing I was more like a different type of person, living a different life. I make myself feel as if I need to be myself, and make my own decisions and be independent, but nothing is really my own. Anything that anybody has ever done has been inspired by something of someone’s else creation. I just feel like I haven’t been able to find complete fulfillment in one area or another, and it seems so difficult to live more than one life. I play baseball, and I’d love to continue playing collegiately, but it seems to interfere with other options. I also love the idea of dropping everything after I graduate to travel and see the world. I can’t do both of these things. As I progress through life and people seem to become more and more certain of their “niche” and the place that they fit in, I struggle to decide what to do. All of the options and different lifestyles seem so intriguing, but I can’t have more than one.

Recently, I’ve equated this dilemma to the feeling of creating a new character in an RPG and struggling to decide what class or role to play. There are so many appealing options and regardless of what I choose, I feel like I’m missing out. 

If anyone can relate to this feeling, please share how to combat it and work through it. 

Thanks

471,"I had a very intense breakup (not bad, just emotional) a few months ago. I still find myself sad at times but genuinely feel that this subtle 'sadness' will always be there ...I've gotten support from my therapist during this time, who's affirmed the same. I've developed healthy habits and etc to ease the feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am talking to this really nice guy and we've been texting. I know that dating him would be great and I can see things going somewhere. I keep having this fear that if we date long enough, the relationship question will come up and as much as I'd want to, I feel I wouldn't be in it all the way. I mean, shit example, he could properly be Ryan Gosling and I'd feel the same. It's not that I can't commit because I want to be 'free.' I do want to.  It's more like I imagine that my heart (enthusiasm) wouldn't be in it as much as theirs is and that makes me feel guilty. It also has to do with generalized trust issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should be doing this...or is this what dating actually is? I trust myself enough not to drag someone through my emotions but my biggest fear is unconsciously doing that to someone.

Any advice much appreciated. ",16Sep2018,1
472,"Okay, I'm 16 years old my brøthers, and I have a job. At this job, there is this one girl who's two years older than me, but we joke with each other a lot and in general are very comfortable around each other. 
Now I'm not going to deny that I think she's cute. However, I'm afraid to make any kind of flirtatious attempt. There are 3 main reasons for this.

1.) She's been in  a lot of relationships, which shows possibly a lack of commitment. I'm a Christian and generally am not looking for a short term relationship.

2.) I've sort of been on this road before. I had a girl that I clicked with. After about a year I told my feelings, but she didn't like me. However I made the mistake of texting her after rejection in a flirtatious way. It just ended up with messed up emotions, and I don't want to go through that again.

3.) If she rejects me, I have to work often with her and it may be awkward. We've known each other for a few days but the shifts were long.

So what do I do, those who have walked this road before? Give her an ultimatum, or only be friends and stuff my feelings?

Thank you, anyone who responds.

I've always been a bit skittish about getting close to people, and a bit more so about engaging in a physical relationship.

475,"The bride was one of my very best friends all through high school, I worked for her mom for 6+ years, still keep in touch with her dad (mine was never a part of my life so he was the closest I had to a father figure). Her and I have lost touch some over the years but I will always consider her and her family as my family and I am sure she feels the same. 

I have a boyfriend but we’ve been very rocky and I honestly don’t think this relationship will make it more than a few more months unless major changes happen.

I want to take my best friend of 19+ years (we are both females) as my “date” instead of my boyfriend. I think I’d be much more comfortable and have a lot more fun with her being there as I have severe social anxiety. Not to mention my ex who I dated for 4ish years will be there and his now wife (who absolutely despises me) is in the wedding party. 

Is this frowned upon? Not bringing your significant other as your +1? 

Also, my best friend has met the bride once before and they got along great. 

Thanks for any input! ",16Sep2018,2
