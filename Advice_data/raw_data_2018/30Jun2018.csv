0,"For my background I was born in 2001 and due to a lot of family drama my fathers name was not on the birth certificate. It seems hard to believe but my dad didn’t check how my mom filled it out and she didn’t put his name. Now, I have to get my ID card from the state but his name isn’t on there. I would just have my mom tell them he’s my father but she died last year. What should I do?",30Jun2018,1
1,"I'm divorced with 3 kids. At the point my marriage was over, 2 close (married) friends on a pissed night in, invited me into a threesome. Turned out, they had been swinging for years, unknown to me. The husband was particularly into voyeurism, long story short, me and the wife were having a lot of sex with him just watching. Fast forward 3 years, with this all happening sporadically and also with their marriage slowly disintegrating and the wife and I getting closer, she has now fallen pregnant. She has said, she won't leave him but wants to have the baby....he wants to legally be the father. I am all fucked in the head. Any advice, gratefully received...Should I walk away from letting them be parents with my child, insist she comes with me, with child....what?  ",30Jun2018,1
2,"So me (F) and him (M) are both almost 20 and we're not that close but we still hang out 2-3 times a year.  And we always do the same thing (walk around a shopping center), although always a different one.  
  
I don't really like malls unless I'm there for a specific purpose (dress shopping with friends, etc), but when we go we just walk around without intending to buy anything, and I'm kind of an impulsive shopper so I end up spending a lot of money on things I don't need.  

When I hang out with my closer friends, we like to go to random events (ie there was an international ice cream festival recently) and there's a lot of events available because we live close to Chicago.  

But for some reason, this guy does not like to go to any events. He also doesn't like going to Chicago. He does not like to go to parties either. Or go to eat anywhere. I know it's not a money issue and I'm not judging but the only choices that we have are the Mall or the movies, and I don't like going to the movies so that's off the table too.  

Does anyone have any ideas of what we might do together?",30Jun2018,1
3,"I’m a nanny, I’ve been with this family for 18 months. The kids are 2 and 4 and starting in the fall, they will both be in preschool twice a week. This cuts my hours by about 12 hours a week.

4,"My sleep schedule is messed up, and I'm having trouble falling asleep at night. My eyelids won't feel relaxed nor heavy like they do when I fall asleep. They won't have that relaxed, heavy feeling to them that I experience when sleep in a comfy bed feels so good but not in the same way dopamine feels good. It's more like having soft sunlight hit the skin.

I spend a lot of time at the computer during the day in a bland, non-changing, quiet environment, but I'm exposed to VERY little blue light. I'm exposed to virtually none from my computer and phone. I receive most of it from light bulbs and sunlight.

Maybe it has to do with dopamine levels?

7,"Me a sales guy - and the odd colored one in my team. Led and drove the largest sales in my team to a win after a long journey. Got totally screwed In comp due to company policy issues and mgmt decision towards the end of the sales cycle.  Pissed of to no end - that it hit my hard earned paycheck - while others stood to make big though no contribution throughout the cycle.  Manager is not a jerk - or I think so - he continues to support me - but was instrumental in making decision that affected the outcome. 

Been a live wire since then - and have spurned any social connect within the company due to the betrayal. Not much recourse  other than potential graces of management - which they (seem) to pursue.

Mgmt and manager invite for win party - and me  decline the invite in a stern / yet respectful manner. Manager doesn’t like my response and the relationship is becoming sour.

I don’t care at this point - but am worried that I am perceived as sulking - even though my decline is just me not being mentally prepared to celebrate with team. Perceived as sulking inhibits growth and potentially jeopardizes any potential commission  recourse. 

Hate to bow down - as it is against my core - although that’s what they are used to from  guys of my color. Hate to lose the money (if it’s even partial through good graces), hate to be perceived as sulking - as that’s not what it is.

9,"So, my crush of 2 years lives 400 miles away. We are friends, I know that is what he considers me. He considers me a good friend. We see each other twice a year with a bunch of other people. It's been a constant on and off thing of ""well maybe I can just keep the fantasy of him and I going"" (And it really kinda is just that because  he lives so far away) or ""No this is bad for me I need to stop."" He is just a constant presence in my mind at this point. The thing is, I think I've ruined things all with my stupid imagination. Now, when I am around him, I am so so sad. I always use the word ""achy"" because it feels like that describes it pretty well. I feel shaky and empty and like desperate for his attention at the same time, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know if there is anything I can salvage with us. It's also that the times that I see him are kind of important to me, not necessarily because of him but because they're like these retreats that we take with bunch of people, and so and I want to be able to enjoy them. Really, the fact that I am always desperately/secretly trying to get his attention and then feeling so lost and sad ruins the whole trip and they are really important opportunities for experiences and I don't want to keep messing them up. Sorry I totally know I explained this really poorly. I just don't know how to reclaim myself and stop needing his eyes on me and just live the retreat the way I want to or how to salvage anything with him so that I am not so depressed when I'm with him.

10,"My entire family and I were emotionally abused by my father my whole life until I finally supported my mom enough for her to finally divorce him and we’ve been no contact for almost a year. It’s been amazing. 

About a year ago I met my current boyfriend and things were amazing in the beginning (still are) but I’ve started noticing that I have very toxic behaviors such as obsessing over what he’s doing all the time, being suspicious he’s talking to other girls even though he’s done nothing to make me think that, and constantly getting upset because I feel like he doesn’t share his feelings with me. I’ve been this way for a while I think, I just never noticed because my last relationship that lasted about two years was basically insane. 

My ex girlfriend was CRAZY so I think that may have allowed me to bring these behaviors into my romantic relationships and normalize them in my head. When I say crazy I mean she threatened suicide at least twice a week, talked about marrying me to escape her family, and confessed to me that she had killed animals she purchased for pets.

Anyhow, past the backstory — I really want to work on this and learn normal relationship behaviors. I love my current boyfriend very much and he’s so sweet and understanding, I feel he deserves much better than what I can offer and I want to be the person he deserves. How can I steadily work on these issues I have without constantly demeaning myself and going through that vicious cycle of “no it’s not my fault I’m fine” and “of course it’s my fault I’m horrible”? 

TLDR; emotionally abusive dad + psycho ex caused me to have seriously fucked up relationship norms and I want to fix myself pls help I can’t afford therapy haha. ",30Jun2018,2
12,"Long story short, worst group member ever didn't do anything until 5 days before and we finally told her she would be out if didn't have anything in our inbox by tonight.

The professor is a first-year who just got hired and does not want to rock the boat, so he basically begs me to let her back in the group. I refuse and explain the situation again, to which he says he understands but changes his tone once I mention me wanting to contact the Dean. He said he cannot stop me but he would not be able to support my claim if I escalated to the Dean, as the unwanted attention would affect his job tenure. What should I do?

18,"Hey there,

I work at a warehouse job owned by a pretty large corporation. Today for lunch one of my supervisors ordered pizza. I have never been allergic to food nor had a negative reaction to any type of food.

I ate the pizza and everything was fine for about 10 minutes, then I started having a reaction. My face got red, my breathing became more and more hard. I went to the on site nurse and she said we need to go to the ER immediately.

My question is, can workers compensation handle the ER bill since this happened at work, and my supervisor purchased the pizza which was delivered to my workplace. I live in the US so I don’t want to be slapped for a huge bill of a couple thousand dollars. I could have died if I didn’t go to the ER, I am glad I did, now I just have to figure out how to pay for it.",30Jun2018,2
19,"I don’t know if this is the proper place to ask this but lately I’ve been having a moral crisis... I always seem to have to react to these odd situations and I never know if I’m doing the right thing.  I talk about these situations after they occur with friends and usually they stand behind me but of course we are like minded being friends and all. Anyway, more prominent examples:

1. There’s a nearby river that has great (deep water solo) rock climbing. I went before work one afternoon by myself and there was a group of 4 young friends (maybe 17-20? I’m bad at guessing). One of the males was across the river where one needs to swim to to climb this feature. Sometimes the river current can get pretty fast so I was standing across the way watching him and waiting for him to get in and swim across since it looked like he was about to. I wanted to see what to expect of the current. Right before he entered the water he slipped and fell on a steep rock. He landed in the water and started screaming his leg was cut off. He was SCREAMING and moving quite swiftly downstream. His friends called to him very nonchalantly like ‘come on man. Swim over. Let’s go.’ But this dude was freaking out. So I went to his friends and asked them if they were going to help him and they sort of shrugged. So I jumped in and went after him. I’m a woman by the way - when I got to him I just calmed him down and got him to believe he could swim across. We were a ways down river and I had to basically carry him back to his friends and wrap my tank top around his ankle with BONE SHOWING. He slipped and cut himself on a piece of broken glass. Then I had to basically scream at his friends to take him to the hospital. They took their time with helping this whimpering young man there. 

Omg this is long.  I’ll just go with two.. but I have so many more weird stories. 

2. A few days ago I was on the highway and about 3 cars ahead of me in the same lane (US) a car got pushed off the side of the highway by another vehicle attempting to merge. I watched as the merger started to move over and I was like ‘oh no this isn’t good.’ And the other car tried to move into the shoulder and then back again into the lane and did that out of control wag. I had already put my hazards on and slowed down when that car did a 360 and hit one car ahead of me and jumped off the grass median onto the other side of the highway. So as traffic basically came to a stop I went off the shoulder and stopped completely wondering if this car was ok. Another person stopped behind me in a truck towing a camper. He came to my window and asked if I was ok and then asked me to get out of the way so he could merge onto the highway again. I parked on the shoulder to see if the people in the accident car were ok (it was a mom and a toddler!) and NO ONE else who saw the accident stopped. The state police came and took my statement. It was obviously not a fatal accident but I’m telling you right now it was not pretty. 

Anyway, more stories like those. What the hell? Am I too concerned about others? Is the world mad? Am I doing the right things or should I just ignore this shit? (I can’t do that of course). What is GOING ON!!!!?",30Jun2018,3
20,"So to start things off, I was friends with this guy in highschool. We both moved to colorado and started renting a place. I paid for our security deposit and pro-rated rent. He told me that would be the first thing he would work on. Almost 8 months later I haven't seen the money. I also had to pay for our entire rent one month because he decided to quit his job without putting in two weeks. So he owes me 1,500 dollars and has kept on buying random shit for himself. He has started arguments with me and has shit talked me whenever this goes on. One time he stole some of my shit and locked it in his room. Threw my entire jar of pink salt all over the kitchen. Also broke bottles on the roof where I climb up so I would cut my hands. On top of that writing notes on the whiteboard we have as well as the bathroom mirror telling me to go fuck myself to keep it short. Last night he kept asking me to drink, over and over again. I wasn't having it so I avoided it. That morning he claimed he broke my fruit bowl on accident by dropping a different bowl on it. A wall in the kitchen just happens to have a new dent in the shape of a bowl rim. I hadn't brough it up yet. He is blackout drunk and starts talking shit to me, but not directly mainly throwing things and saying it. Saying I act like ""king of the house"" I begged him for months before to keep the house clean. He will let food rot on the counter and on the floor. Clog the shower drain and won't clean it so a layer of grim builds up. Will leave pieces of trash everywhere. Also crumbs and spilt drinks just sitting on the tables, as well as grease all over the stove because he cooks on high, and dishes in the sink for weeks. Anyway, apparently once I went to slept he woke up from blacking out and decided to cut the support to one of my hammock couches seats. I had to go to work so I didn't say anything and he wasn't up. I come home today and yet another part of the couch is cut. The one I sat in this morning. Also, his room is spotless. If he gets mad he'll start slamming doors and screaming.

23,"My husband who works in Washington State, USA is having a situation with a hostile work environment and no actions have been taken and  we are wondering our best course of action.  

Essentially,  a manager has brought her domestic disputes into the workplace, involved my husband and then has made his workplace hostile.  

A few days ago this manager's partner shows up in the parking lot. Starts verbally arguing with the manager and speeds off down the road. The slams on her brakes and reverses at high speeds back to the lot. Parks beside the business and starts yelling at the manager. My husband and another employee are witness to the argument and when the manager goes to get in the car with her partner, my husband stated she should stay out of the car as they are concerned for her safety. Now this partner is a known meth user, by omission of the manager, and calls the manager constantly through her shift where they get into loud verbal arguments.  The manager has not been working while she is in the store as of late, instead spending the whole time yelling at her partner on the phone.  

The manager's partner tried to yell something at my husband through the car window but the manager quickly rolled up with window and they left.

Later my husband was informed (by a coworker who lives with the manager) that the partner was threatening to beat up my husband and he was lucky she didn't get out of the car. Now this partner is always loitering around the store for hours. In the parking lot or the lobby. Obviously, he is not afraid that she will get the best of him, but is very uncomfortable being forced to work near someone who has threatened him. Whether she does something to his car or attempts to fight him he will be forced to defend himself against an unstable person.  He has bad PTSD and Anxiety so this situation is all the more stressful. Literally enough to make him spend the whole night tonight pacing up and down our hallway.  

The manager also texted my husband after the car incident urging him not to make a police report.  

Now today, the partner was again in the lobby. My husband was unable to complete part of his job because he didn't want to go into the area she was loitering so he expressed concern to the coworker who lives with the manager. She informed the manager who then said my husband ""needs to stop being a little pussy"" about the situation.   

The store manager has been informed of the situation but the only resolution we have heard is that if she apologizes she will be allowed on the property which my boyfriend hasn't agreed to. Which we only heard second hand, he has not talked to my Husband about a resolution. All he heard first hand was to ""be tough for the rest of the day and we will figure this out."" That was before he was called a pussy and hasn't been able to reach his manager since that. HR is closed until monday and the local managers seem to be hoping she quits and it will all go away.   He has to work with her again on Monday.

32,"So for context, I'm 17 and just started working on my driver's license a month or two ago. I've been putting it off since my birthday in January when I could've registered since I'm honestly very scared of driving, which I don't want to admit because of the stigma of men being afraid to drive. I've also always wondered how other people are so assured behind the wheel.

Anyway, I thought I couldn't put off my license anymore because I'm going away in late August for college, and won't be able to complete my license until I finish in 2020 for reasons. Despite time ticking away, once I went to class very little by little I gained confidence. Now I'm waiting for a date for my test for my probational license. However, I'm only a little bit confident compared to before, and I still get deathly scared and nervous behind the wheel. It doesn't help that physical things have always been extremely hard for me. I very rarely learn to pick up on such things like sports, handiwork, crafts, electronics, etc. 

A few days back, I asked my family if I could practice driving around the neighborhood. Of course my driving isn't up to par for them and try as I might, I just can't seem to get the hang of it. Then, an hour ago, my mom asked if I was confident to drive us to a breakfast joint a few minutes away from home. Eager to prove myself, I tried to drive but of course was met with criticism, perfectly normal for me. Then... While I was trying to park I missed a spot, but thought I could still make the turn. My mom was yelling at me to stop, and I, panicking, hit the accelerator instead. I scratched a guy's car and ruined an accessory, and now we're at a workshop to settle payment for his repairs. I don't know, this whole incident just served to bring back my fear of driving, but now it's worse. I can't think of any way to improve unless I practice, but I can't practice until I calm down behind the wheel, and because I can't get behind the wheel, I can't practice and so on.

33,"TL;DR at the bottom

So as the title suggests, I (29/m) am renting a town house with two other people (23/f) (33/m) that I met on a roommate app. We met several times before we signed for the lease, and they both seemed like really great, easy going, down to earth people.

About two months into the year long lease, one of my roommates, we'll call him Randall, started showing signs that he was *really* anal about little things. My other roommate and I did our best to accommodate, as he would ask us politely if we would do things a certain way. We also noticed that he would stomp around the house, and slam doors.

We all agreed that we could use each-others things, such as dishes, as long as they were cleaned afterwards, and treated with respect.

So for the first few months I was here, I was using Randall's pan any time I was cooking. Randall made it a point to tell me that his pan had teflon coating on it and to not use metal when cooking with it. I obliged, but made the mistake of leaving a metal fork inside the pan while letting it soak. Unfortunately I did this a *couple* of times. Personally I don't think it was a big deal,  the pan was not actually damaged. But I understand I was using his things, and if he has conditions for doing so, I should respect that.

Randall was *very* upset about this and took a picture of the pan and sent it to me and my other roommate along with a giant wall of text expressing his discontent. I apologized and let him know that I would go get my own pan so it wouldn't be a continuing issue. He insisted that we all have a meeting about it to discuss personal boundaries.

A few weeks later I accidentally left a light on over night. This was a very rare occurrence, but sure enough the next morning we got another wall of text from Randall saying that it was a waste of electricity, and that we are irresponsible, and he left the light on for ""whoever did it"" to turn it off. I'm really not a prideful person, so I just turned it off after I got out of bed.

That evening when I got home from work, *every single light* in the house was on. All of them. It was super uncomfortable. I went around and turned them all off and went to bed.

The next morning after waking up, I found a big pile of dishes in the sink. I thought this was unusual, Randall is usually very good about cleaning up after himself. I decided to clean the dishes, even though they weren't mine. After cleaning a few I found my pan, the one I bought so I didn't have to use Randall's, [scraped to hell with steel wool](https://i.imgur.com/SeVPaBu.jpg).

A few days later my other roommate and I decided to call a meeting. I had never seen Randall the way he was acting at the meeting. He was yelling, and pacing, calling us names. He eventually made my other roommate cry and the meeting really went nowhere. Evidently he did tell me during the meeting that he ordered me a new pan, and that it was in the mail.

He did reach out to us in an attempt to discuss things again, but after that meeting we were both reluctant, and never really followed through.

A month or so later there is a bang on my door. When I open Randall is there holding a butter knife and exclaims ""Was this you?"". I had seen the butter knife in the sink earlier, but I knew nothing about it. Apparently my other roommate had used it. Honestly I'm not sure why she did this, she only seemed to antagonize him, but she declined that she had used it. He sent us [this text](https://i.imgur.com/suRtKIC.png?1). After my other roommate didn't comply, he began walking around the house, whistling the same tune over and over, some times singing it loudly. He did this several times over the course of 2 or 3 hours up until about 2 AM. My roommate and I felt very uncomfortable and she ended up calling the police. They showed up and he didn't come out of his room. They just asked us a few questions and said contact your land lord. Nothing really got accomplished with that besides him staying in his room for the remainder of the night.

A few days later he sends us [this](https://imgur.com/a/nv0zqbl), exclaiming that we have some of his things. Honestly, after the pan incident happened I *never* touched any of his things again and my other roommate stopped after the knife.

After this I decided it was finally time to contact the landlord. I told him I felt unsafe in the house, and that I was afraid Randall was dangerous. My landlord didn't really know what to say. It's his first time renting a house. He sort of just said ""Send me an email telling me what you want to do and we'll go from there."" But honestly I don't really know what I want to do. I don't know what my options are. So I never sent an email.

I stopped using the kitchen for a month or two and just started eating out every day. A couple of days ago I decided to start cooking again. I live in this house too, and I shouldn't let him bully me into not being able to do that. I left a pot to dry in *his* drying rack next to the sink, not knowing that it would [set him off](https://imgur.com/a/0hATu4G). It was an oversight really.

Yesterday morning, I woke up to [this](https://i.imgur.com/u8LDAeI.png?1). Although I didn't put it there, I didn't respond to his text message and just put the microwave cover away and went to work.

When I got home that evening I decided to cook dinner. He approached me and began asking me why I couldn't understand not using his things. It broke out into a heated argument, ending with me asking what I needed to do for him to leave me alone. He said ""don't use my things"" and I responded with ""Okay"". He slammed his hands on the counter and said ""GREAT!"" and stomped to his room and began banging around and yelling.

When I got home today I had to pass him on the way to my room. I let out a muffled ""Hey"", and he did the same. In the process I forgot to turn the light off to the stairs leading up to the second floor. He yelled through my door and said ""ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FLIP THE FUCKING SWITCH"". Then stomped up to his room, and began yelling and banging around again.

A lot of my friends have been telling me I need to move out, but I don't think it's that simple. I feel like It's unsafe and uncomfortable for me to continue living with him.

What do I do?

TL;DR

34,"So here we go, recently I had bought a car. Long story trying to cut short, Dave (the names of characters in this story have been altered to protect ones identity mind you) owned this car and had told his friend Adam that if he were to ever sell the car, he would offer it to Adam first. Fast forward several years, one of Dave's crackhead neighbors stole the car and crashed it into a telephone pole. Dave offered to sell the car to Adam and he buys it. Now, Adam doesn't have anywhere to store the car so he asks his friend Jake if he can store the car at his house for a while until he can find a place to store/rebuild the car. A couple months go by, now Jake is tired of Adam not picking the car up and/or doing anything about it just sitting at his house. So Jake tells Adam, to come and get his car ASAP or he's just going to sell it himself. Adam tells him that that's fine if he gets rid of the car but he wants parts A and B (Part A and B are worth $400-$600 combined) off the car before he sells it. Now I buy the car from Jake and he apparently forgot to take Parts A and B off the car and tells me that he promised Adam the parts before he got rid of the car and that Adam really wants those parts. I meet up with Jake and Adam (who had apparently wanted to tell me in person that he was in fact, the rightful owner of parts A and B). I told him yeah that'd be fine without really thinking about it (not to mention I tend to cave when confronted with a hostile persona) and now I'm really starting to feel like it's not my problem and that I should just keep the parts and tell Adam to make like a tree and frig off. It's not that I want to be an asshole, I just think at this point, the parts are mine and I paid for them. Unfortunately, Jake has my address (as Jake had offered to deliver the car to my house for an extra $40, which I was more than willing to pay as I do not have a trailer and would have spent 3 times that renting one) and my phone number and had told me he would give Adam my number to schedule when we could meet up and I could give him the parts.

TL;DW The previous owner sold a car to me, without remembering to take off a few parts that he had ""promised"" to give back to his buddy before selling the car, now buddy wants parts from me.

What should I do here? I'm trying to be a better person, as recent events have left me in a rather tight spot and maybe I should be the nice for once and give this guy a break? Idk any help would be of service at this point. Thanks!",30Jun2018,1
35,"Currently we live in a small apartment, both are retail managers and finishing our college degrees. We share one car and are paying off our credit card debts. We look online for homes fell in love with ones in Georgia but have never been. We would like children in the near future but I would like to be settled before that. Not sure how to get started on all of this, and the expense of moving seems overwhelming. We’d like a fresh start somewhere. 

Tl;dr - What are the logistical things needed to move states?

What should we work on first? 
How much should we budget for the move/home? Should we get an apartment first?
Should we set up interviews for jobs in Georgia before moving or have money saved to live off of first? How do we pick a city to live in? What if we hate it? What would we be getting ourselves into.

36,"4 years ago, I was about 115 pounds, 5'4. I was doing sports daily and had built up an average amount of muscles from volleyball. Then I got depression when my father died and my stepdad became abusive and I became a lazy piece of shit. When my stepfather moved out the only person who gave me any discipline was gone so I laid in bed all day, went out all night, quit school and  I started living in my room. I'd sleep 15 hours a day and only get up to eat or watch tv or do drugs with my mom and one of her boyfriends. I injured my back by laying down and sitting too much and only one year ago I decided to stop moping around. Now I'm 200 pounds, 5'4 and 18 years old and when I try to ride a bike for more than 3 minutes I get blurry vision and my heart feels like its going to beat out of my chest. Should I just focus on losing weight before I get back on the bike? I've been lifting weights and doing 5 minutes of skipping rope daily but biking feels like its going to kill me. I had to move out of the city because my moms boyfriend was harassing me so I don't have a job yet or access to a gym.",30Jun2018,1
38," I am 21 and my girlfriend is 18. Her family loves me. I spend time with  them all the time, I get invited to their family events, and I even  babysit for my girlfriend’s baby sister. But yesterday I was in my  girlfriend’s room with the door locked. We were pulling a fast one just  before her parents came home when someone knocked on the door. It was  her mom. It took a while for us to get dressed and the longer we took,  the knocks became angrier. She opened the door and there her mom was,  fuming mad. She looked at me and said “I trusted you”. A thousand slaps  and hair pullings were done as she dragged as out of their house. I did  my best to take all that were thrown at my girlfriend. When we were  outside the house, she told us to fucking leave and never come back. We  only had the clothes on our back. No shoes, no wallets. Finally her mom  threw my backpack outside and luckily I kept both of our phones inside  of it. We called a taxi service and I took her to my house. After a few  hours her dad called her and asked her to go home. He was surprisingly  calm about all this. I took her home and on the way her dad kept calling  asking if she was fine. I left her about half a block from her house  because she didn’t want her dad to beat the shit out of me. I planned to  face her parents head on to apologize but she was against it and our  friends kept telling me that it was a bad idea. So I left and now I’m  here. I don’t know how to fix this.  


I still want to go and  apologize because that’s the only thing I can’t think of. I will never  give up on this girl so I need to make up with her family but I  obviously destroyed their trust. What should I do?",30Jun2018,12

43,"So I'll spare you a few details of my past, but I'm currently in the midst of my undergrad and working up toward law school. I'm 2 years in and 24yo if that offers any perspective... Anyway, I've recently taken up some side work offered by an uncle (through marriage) of mine. He seems pleased with my work and is eager to have me continue working with him. The money is good, but construction brings me back to a time where I had trouble believing in myself, a time where I also had many other family things ruining my self-esteem.

So my question is, how do I gracefully bow out of working with my uncle after this job is complete at the end of next week? He already has things lined up for a few weeks from now. I haven't agreed to them, and I mentioned that the first day of the new work I would be busy, but he just suggested I just start working the day after.

Any input would be greatly appreciated, and I will likely be up all night if anyone needs additional details. Thanks in advance. :)",30Jun2018,1

45,"I'm currently at a large state university. It is one of the best in my state and my family is so proud of me being accepted and coming here. Right now Im a week in and I'm not sure if this is the right choice for me...

I'm about 400 miles away from home. I dont particularly miss my family, but I miss the city itself and my friends. The town here is very quiet, and students within the university just goes to parties to get drunk, high, etc. I'm not much of a party person at all. I haven't really clicked with anyone yet, no one seems to have a similar personality as I do. And I just sort of feel lost. I wander around the campus without anything to do, and I don't quite feel at home.

I've been thinking about transferring back to my home city and going to the university there. It's nearly not as prestigious as the one I'm at now. Some people don't think of it as a good school either. But I think I'll be happier living at home, commuting and being back at the scene I'm comfortable with.

I'm sort of juggling this issue and a lot of things come to play. Sometimes I feel like because its only been a week, I haven't situated myself properly and I shouldn't make such rash decisions. This is also a good university with prestige and I will most likely have a better education and better opportunities here than the other university. Will I get screwed over if I go there ? (I'm getting my bachelor's. Not sure what I'm going to do yet, I might study Criminal Justice/Criminology)

However, I don't feel like I belong. I like having freedom but I dont like being completely by myself in a whole new world. I don't like sharing a dorm with someone. And I really hate myself for thinking this, but my boyfriend back home is influencing me, too (he's not telling me himself to come back, I just miss him). Even when I was first accepted I wasn't excited to attend. 

I was on the phone with my mom and she told me to think hard about this, and she sounded so disappointed with me thinking about transferring back to a significantly worse school. But I feel so lost in this situation. I've talked to friends, family, and even my old teacher. I'm still on the fence about it so I'm hoping I can get a better direction here. 

I guess not only am I asking about whether or not I should stay, but what can I do to ensure a successful future for myself if I go to the university at home ?

Thanks for reading this. Sorry if there's any format issues as I'm posting this on my phone, and sorry if it's too long. There's not a day where I don't think about this for hours.",30Jun2018,0
47,"I'm early 20s. I'm about halfway through a computer science degree. I'm pretty good at math, software and solving complex problems. It's actually sort of fun to me, too. I don't hate it. I'm getting the degree because I excel at the subject material, I don't hate it and it'll land me a decent paycheck when I graduate.

Meanwhile, I love lifeguarding. It is hands down the best job in the world. I don't want to leave when I get off work. I've guarded for three summers, including this one. Being real with myself, there have been two other summers where I got certified but didn't end up guarding because I was in a bad place mentally and in life in general (not really in the state to enjoy anything). But really I'm just so happy when I'm at work guarding. The work forces me to be physically fit, humble and aware. It's so rewarding keeping people safe. I always love the way all the guards are like a family. The problem is, it's tough to make any real money as a lifeguard. If I could make a livable wage guarding, I'd quit school right now and never look back. 

When I'm doing schoolwork, or working my other job (not guarding), or doing pretty much anything besides making music with friends, exercising or lifeguarding, I get this awful feeling that I'm wasting my life doing things that I may be good at but don't actually enjoy. Things that don't leave me feeling complete.

Get to car, it reeks to all hell. Problem is that prolonged exposure to the smell (minutes) of pot gives me a nasty goddamn migraine. Between these two, coworker was likely smoking in car.

I report her, she finds out and calls me effectively asking why I snitched. Knowing better than to bite, I tell her that so long as her drug screen is clear that she’ll be fine.

55,"So my ex and I don't have the best history. He was great for at first. There were a few times he would get a little too sexual when I wasn't ready to do that stuff yet. We only occasionally did some stuff but we never had sex. I just wasn't ready. He was also a little mean and was full of himself at times but that was nothing to really worry about.


Anyways we broke up for a while. I dated a few other people and he also dated a few other people. I told my best friend all about him. She was great at listening and letting me know when he wasn't being so great I was blind of because I really loved him at the time. She has helped me get back out there and try to find someone that would treat me properly.


A few months ago, I started talking to my ex again. To me, he seemed to be different. He really seemed to grow and not be as ""douchey"" as my best friend would say. We started dating again a couple weeks ago and so far it has been going great. To be honest I'm a little more comfortable with the sexual stuff now but it's not something that is really a thing right now. He still is a little touchy but I'm much better at telling him no this time.


Now back to the main problem. My best friend still doesn't approve. My boyfriend seems different and my best friend keeps saying he just wants the same thing. She does her best to approve but she will occasionally remind me of what my boyfriend was and it's just really annoying. I am an adult and I know how to judge people properly.


My best friend keeps warning me but I just don't see the problem here. It is none of her business to know about my relationship. I'm just not sure how to talk to her about it. She really is my best friend and I trust her but my boyfriend is great and I don't think he will be like he was before.

According to her, he just wants sex, is the same old mean person as he once was, and that he is very full of himself. I can still see the full of himself part but I think it's cute. Anyways, I'm not sure how to talk to her about it. Any help would be appreciated. Again, she is my best friend and I don't want to lose her.

tl;dr I got back with my ex. My best friend thinks he is a jerk, full of himself, and wants nothing but sex. I think he is different. I don't know how to talk to her about it. I don't want to lose either of them.",30Jun2018,3
57,"Hi guys. Me and my ex dated for 2 years and broke up since we couldn't see each other. I couldn't visit her much cause her parents were strict so I snuck over. This went on  for about a year until her parents changed schedules and there was no way I could see her. We mutually broke up 5 months ago, and since  then I've been heartboken. After we broke up she got with another guy (long distance though) and they broke up and I recently found out that one of my  somewhat close friend is talking to her.

I was under the impression that I would get $9.25 a hour (that is the minimum wage in my state) however they gave me $7.90 a hour. Is that technically legal for them to do since the federal law minimum wage is $7.25? I was under the impression during this job that I wouldn't be paid minimum wage. I could just leave this job and go to Burger King across the street and make $10 a hour. (Although that would mess up scheduling). Should I ask a manager about my pay?

A little bit of a backstory: I’m fully japanese but have been living in the states for pretty much all of my life. I’m in Japan for the next month to visit family. My grandmother has Alzheimer’s Disease and around four months ago, my mother went to check in on her and things were already starting to get a bit ‘bad.’ Fast forward to now, the disease has started to take quite the toll on not only my grandmother, but also everyone else around as well. Mood swings, making us (mother, aunt, and I) do most of the things around the house (cooking, taking out the trash, etc.) 

Do you guys have any tips/advice on how to convince my grandmother that she needs to start to look for at least a helper or somewhere else to live? The apartment is all gas, so forgetting to turn it off could be not good. She’s very stubborn about it and would barely listen to what any of us has to say because she ‘can still do everything on her own.’ I think she needs to realize that it’s not only affecting her health, but the mental health on everyone else around her.

To keep it short, I (M) have a good friend (F), and we get along fairly well.

She and I recently agreed to go out together to just get lunch. She tells her boyfriend later and he does not like the fact that the two of us went together, thinks I have strong feelings for her/doesn't trust that she won't do anything with me. He wants her to not really talk to me or see me, at one point she was just trying to say that we should talk less and can't go for any one on one things anymore (bigger problem here is that she is one of 2 friends I have right now, personal reasons make it so I can't really get any more).

While I was in the restroom about 10-12 minutes he calls me. I tell him I'm using the restroom. He knows that I'm obviously going number 2😐 Just had to say that because abviously it takes longer.......so anyway, he hung up on me. When I was done I walked outside and didn't see him so I called him and he said he just left and didn't want to wait because I took to long. I took 10-12 minutes at the most.....also anytime he uses the restroom I always wait for him. He takes way longer sometimes especially when he's going number 2. Also when I walked outside it was still light out. I had kicked the door and I was locked out and he didn't seem to care. He was gone for about 15 minutes. When he got back I was upset and said I didn't want to talk. Probably shouldn't have said that so he then said okay I don't care then I said what he did was rude and he said he wasn't going to talk to me and walked away. He does this a lot to me to avoid conversation. He knows how much it hurts me. 
I got really hurt by this because im in the house all day being a stay at home mom and haven't been able to walk since it's been hot. He acted like it wasn't a big deal. I also am hurt because I always wait for him and I see he couldn't do it for me. He acts like this a lot with different things.

I treated talking to him and old him he was wrong and so rude he said he will have his mom take me tomorrow. 😒 I told him I was in the house all day and I wanted to take a walk with my family. He said what do you think your my bitch? Your not my bitch. Smh I then said he was so rude and I'm tired of it he treats me like a piece of shit. He hustled walked away and most likely will ignore me all night if it doesn't have anything to do with our son....

Was I wrong, was he wrong? Advice please😕",30Jun2018,3
77,"So I tried all the things that you guys had told me to do. I hit her, and that got me a threat of homelessness. I tried calling the cops. That ended in getting the phone line pulled. the shit is still happening. Worse yet, my own mother is pretty much facilitating it.

When she does something, she ""talks about it.""  By this, I mean she tries to, the little sis makes up some outrageous excuse, and gets out of punishment. I feel unsafe. As in I'm afraid of the second this little girl snaps and kills me because she  is used to getting away with everything. She's been trying to get me banned from every platform I either make content for or find enjoyment in. My mother refuses to help unless I put down my sole means of entertainment(video games. shit like Warframe and  mapping for Beat Saber.) I can't even get books to read because I dont have a job. Why do I not have a job? Even if it's just on the other side of town, (I live in a community that you would miss if you blink an eye) it's apparently too far for her to drive, and she forcibly got me downgraded from a license to a permit. I am trapped here with nowhere to go. Nowhere to hide, and soon, nowhere to escape to. I need help. Fast.

82,"Hey everyone, I'll get right to it. I'm resigning from my current workplace due to abuse from my employer. I'm looking for advice on the resignation letter. 

This is what I have so far.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;July 3, 2018  
&gt;  
&gt;Paul,  
&gt;  
&gt;I am writing to notify you that I am resigning from my position as Home Theater Control4 Integration Technician with Soundcrafters. My last day of employment will be July 17th.  
&gt;  
&gt;I appreciate the opportunities I have been given during my time with your company, as well as your professional guidance and support. However, I want to be perfectly clear as to my reasons for leaving.  
&gt;  
&gt;After you asked me over the phone if I was a “retard” for not leaving a customer’s battery backup at the shop and instead leaving it in the work truck, I needed to take some time to consider the question. I realize now that I must be a “retard” for continuing to work for an individual who believes that name calling and using derogatory terms is okay in the work place, especially coming from an employer to an employee. I also realized that it would be “retarded” to work for someone who finds physical violence okay in the work place.   
&gt;  
&gt;After I picked up an employment application from your desk to ask you about it, you deemed the proper response was a slap across my face that was forceful enough to twist my neck and send me reeling. You did respond to it later and said that you should not have “hit so hard”, NOT that you shouldn’t have done it at all. Since then you’ve “jokingly” slapped or smacked me, either on my head or face, or threatened to do so. In front of customers, and in private. I now have a pain in my neck that I have not been able to get relief from and an aversion to being within striking distance of you.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am giving you two week’s notice as a consideration to my coworkers and to current customers. I wish you and the company the best of success in the future. If I can assist with the transition to my successor, please do let me know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Very sincerely,  
&gt;

85,"I’m an 18 year old girl and I’m known to be very boy crazy among my friends and the people in my school in general. I talk to a lot of guys but it never becomes anything serious because that’s not at all what I’m looking for, very rarely do I hook up with these guys or even hang out with them.

Today, this boy I’ve been talking to on and off for years tells me that I’m a tease. This is not news to me. I ask him to explain and he basically goes off about how I’m self-serving because even though “I obviously don’t owe these guys I talk to anything,” I still basically do. 

Now I’m going to go into a little rant because I’m annoyed, but this boy is not the right one to deliver this message. He’s completely stuck up his own ass and genuinely believes that he’s better than everyone. Freshman, sophomore, and junior year (AND almost all of elementary school) I turned him down because I simply wasn’t into him and last year (junior year) me turning him down turned into a blowout fight that left BOTH of us in tears. He is hands down the most arrogant person I’ve ever met in my entire life, so me turning him down really messed with his ego. Earlier this year, he would talk to me a little bit, even though he had a girlfriend. He would ask me for nudes and I would always say no because he has a girlfriend and that’s bad karma. 

Anyways, when this whole conversation started, I thought that it was at least partly him just letting out his pent up anger towards me since he “has very high standards” and I’m one of the only girls that has ever turned him down. I still think that that is definitely part of it. However, I realized that he is pretty much exactly right. 

It made me realize that I’m emotionally unavailable, and therefore extremely selfish. I’ve always kind of known, but the fact that a dumb teenage boy has actually picked up on it is a wake up call for me.

To put it clearly, it usually happens that I’m not actually into the guys I’m talking to, I just want the attention. Therefore, I don’t have any interest and don’t want to actually have to get with them (dick move I KNOW). Once I get what I want, which is just attention/the feeling of being wanted, I’m done. Then, having sex with them becomes completely unnecessary in my eyes because why do more than I have to? 

The reason I’m mentioning sex specifically is because that was a huge point that the boy I was talking to was making. He’s one of the horniest people I’ve ever met, so the sex aspect is his main concern. 

I KNOW I’m a bad person for this and that all this time I’ve spent trying to dodge bad karma has been a waste. I want to change this and stop being known as a “tease,” but I just don’t really know where to begin. 

Any and all advice is welcome. 

Also, that was really fucking long, my bad guys. ",30Jun2018,3

88,"TLDR: I make a lot of money, but have also recently picked up a toxic work habit and don’t know how to quit that life.

So I’m 24 years old and I’ve considered myself a pretty hardcore workaholic my entire life. I’ve always worked to maximize my income when I can because I like making a lot of money. However, I’m not sure if I’ve recently just gotten into a toxic environment and I’m just not seeing the consequences.

So I work full time at a successful production company and the pay is good so now looking back, I don’t know why I ever would’ve wanted to take on an additional job unless it paid really well. But with that said, 5 months ago I got offered an overnight position at a company because a friend of a friend works there at a high ranking position. The overnight job is at a low budget news station downtown where I work from 11PM - 7AM. So I’m literally being paid to watch TV overnight with nobody to supervise me. The job is really easy and nobody really gives a crap as long as I didn’t fuck anything up. I also went to college for this kinda stuff and have been doing this for 3-4 years now so I could do it in my sleep. Also on the upside, I get to sleep 2-4 hours on the clock every night when I need to because I’m usually by myself 99% of the time. 

Since I started working at my 2nd job, I’ve been working 80 hours a week Mon-Fri. My schedule is pretty much I wake up at 1PM, go to my 1st job at 2PM-10PM. Then after that I go to my 2nd job at 11PM-7AM. After my 2nd job I go home and sleep from 7:30-1PM. Rinse and repeat. I usually get about 5+3 hours of sleep collectively per day. My weekends I stay home and catch up on sleep or usually just watch TV because I’m an introvert. The only time I get to have fun and socialize outside of work is overnight and I’ve grown to love being a night owl.

So with the overnight job, at first I was getting bored because I thought I was wasting my time because I wasn’t doing anything and I’d rather spend my nights sleeping. But after a couple weeks things got interesting. I found out that the station was just a block down from a bar and since then, Ive started going there almost every night before work. Sometimes I’ll even go to work to clock in and then go out to the bar for a couple hours and have a few drinks. By now the bartenders and waiters all know me and I’d say I’ve become a regular. I also started talking to this really cute waitress and we really hit it off. Usually at this time of night with sleep deprivation, having some booze in you and any amount of chemical attraction, you’re down for anything. So I invited the girl, let’s call her Asia to come to the station after her shift ends so I can give her a tour of my work. (Being able to say you work at a news station vibes really well with the ladies, I never figured out why.) An hour goes by and I’m back at my office and Asia finally swings by. We chat for a bit and I was still really buzzed so I asked her if she wanted to see the roof. The roof was kinda magical because you can see the city skyline and girls are really into things like that and one thing led to another and we ended up doing it on top of the roof. Since then we’ve been having dates up here a lot because she usually gets off really late (2-3AM) and I’m still at work at that time. So we usually just hangout for a bit and smoke, drink, have sex until she leaves. 

I’ve been hooking up with Asia and other girls for about a month and a half now and its become the highlight to my days/nights. I’ve noticed I’ve stopped putting in the effort with my day job and when I’m there I just don’t wanna be there. All I can think about is my night job and what’s in store for me that night or who I’m gonna hook up with. I think I’m really putting a lot at risk here. But I just can’t imagine going back to a monotonous shift because I’d probably crash out once I’m back to doing nothing all night.

I’ve really thought long and hard about going back to a normal schedule and quitting my 2nd job but the one thing stopping me is, why, when I’m making an additional $30k/yr on top of my main salaried job just for not doing anything. I know I may have a really impressionable and juvenile personality, but my reasoning is I’m still young and I’m just putting time in until I’ve established myself and my career.

89,"So we did it bare (I know it was careless) and at that time she was fertile (we couldn't help it). It was around June 16. Her expected menstruation is June 22. But until now, she hasn't had her menstruation. So it's been about a week of being delayed. She's hesitant to use PT, scared of the result.

But when we did it, I made sure to clean up after every session(5). I peed and washed mine and resumed after an hour or so of resting. I'm aware of pre-cum pregnancy also. I pulled out every single time (i mean I used the pull out method before with my exes).

92," I'm 20m flatting with a few friends all 19-20 years old with one of which, 20f, is my best friend. Basically we have always had a very touchy friendship often holding hands and what not. A mutual friend zone which has absolutely sat fine with me. Anyway I have had a rough year after a series of shitty events with the latest really leaving me in a state. I confided in my friend which basically ended up with us cuddling and her staying in my bed that night, and then in the morning she kissed me. We kissed for an hour and then we had an awkward couple of days before we had a talk about it agreeing it was a mistake, she felt terrible and nothing more will come of it.

However since then I have developed much stronger feelings for her that weren't there before now I have a very strong crush on her. I am super confused as where to go from here whether to tell her how I feel with the slim possibility of her reciprocating the feelings or whether I should move on.

95,"I am the youngest in my family and am living at home while I finish graduate school. My older sister is nearly forty years old and has recently displayed some outrageously immature behavior which makes me very concerned.

My sister, X, attended college nearly 20 years ago, and met two women, Y and Z. Y and Z are sisters, and X lived with them on and off campus throughout college. After college they continued to live together for some time, and although I was very young then, their relationship did not seem right to me. My sister has always ran to bail out Y and Z whenever they had trouble, buying their groceries and not ever being reimbursed, letting them live in her house when Y and Z lost theirs do to poor financial planning, drove them all over even though Y and Z have their own cars.

Z got married a few years ago and moved across the country. Y suffered an intense depression when Z moved and as a result, she either travels cross country, or Z visits several times a year. Each time, they drag my sister along. Y and Z are both married with kids now, and my sister seems to be the fifth wheel, resigned to taking care of their babies and toddlers while Y and Z hang out together. This has always seemed to be a codependent relationship, but over the last couple of years, after Y got married, it seems to have gotten much worse.

Y and Z have a younger brother that is in and out of prison and addicted to drugs, and has a toddler, A. Y and Z's mother takes care of A, and now my sister is expected to care for A every time they visit as well. Around this time my sister inexplicably decided to stop taking medication for her severe, severe ADHD. 

My mother and brother went on a vacation with my sister a couple of years ago and were deeply offended when my sister ignored them the whole trip and texted and called Y and Z nonstop.

A few months ago I noticed my sister driving an older, beat up car that she had bought many years ago, even though she has a brand new car that she pays upwards of $600 a month in a loan. Apparently, her new car fits the carseats better for Y's baby and A as well, so she let them use her brand new car indefinitely while she drove an old broken down one.

Her latest behavior pushed me over the edge. Once again she is dropping everything to go across country to visit Z with Y, and asked me to watch her dog while she was away. Her dog is very old, is incontinent, severely senile, and is in severe pain. My sister seems to have ignored the dog's condition, where she cannot walk and falls down and cries/whines all day. She has not taken her to the vet in months, and refuses to consider putting her down to end her suffering.  I am currently caring for the dog, and it enrages me to know end to see her in that condition.

Please help me figure out what might be going on with my sister. I love her to death and am stymied about what to do. She has put her own life on hold for years, never married, or been able to have kids of her own.

TLDR: Sister cannot bear to be apart from women she met in college, won't take ADHD medication, lets said women use her and take advantage of her. Has put her own life on hold for many years for these women, and finally left me with a suffering and neglected dog.",30Jun2018,1

* I dont earn a lot on my current job and i dont think ill get a raise when i accept the new contract. My answer will 100 percent be a YES if i get a higher pay. But if its still the same, im not sure. 
* Problem is, with my current salary, its not that bad. Its a bit enough already for me. Im scared that if i try a completely new job, i will start with a low salary again since for example, i applied for a marketing job but im a designer. Im afraid i will have to start from the bottom again. BUT you never know since some companies have better pay.

Should I stick where im familiar already and comfortable? Where the company is not too strict and i have lots of free time. BUT the pay is just.. enough and the job im doing is not as exciting as before. And be stuck on doing that for 2 years.

Try a completely new job which I find kind of exciting since its new. But i am so uncertain about everything. Will i get lower pay? Can i handle a new job? But there is no 2-year bond and i can just quit easily if i dont like it. ",30Jun2018,1
99,"Call-ins: 

1. J tries to get his shift covered by other coworkers days prior. Texts me and asks if I can work for him tomorrow (7a-7p). I said I can’t because I work the night shift (7p-7a). He says okay, so he calls in at 3 am! And it’s annoying because technically they can’t call anyone in until 5am, so who is going to answer their phone at 5am, let alone come in two hours later?!!

I told him that if he plans on calling in because he can’t get his shift covered, don’t do it at 3am, do it at like at least 10p so they have a fighting chance of finding someone before 7am. I did not appreciate being mandated to work 16 hours because he wanted to do something. If you’re sick, that’s one thing but calling in after trying to get your shift covered is clearly not OK to do to your coworkers. He says Ok and I think we’re cool.

2. He calls in and the supervisor got the call while in my unit (again, at like 2 am) and she says “Okay.” Very annoyed and is short with him. She hangs up and says, “Well, J is ‘just not going to make it in because he graduated’”. And told her that it really burned her. Mind you, he was going to graduate that weekend and this was he Thursday before. So he was literally just partying and ‘couldn’t make it’. I have no idea what reprimand action he received, but it was seemingly nothing. Small unit, not many people working, we kind of need him to fill shifts so we’re not spread thin.

I decided not to say anything even though I was very upset with him because I only see him in passing for shifts and I don’t mind him as a person. Except when he makes me stay at work for 16 hours so he can be hungover like a dipshit. Mind you, this job is at a hospital doing patient related work — it’s not like we could have used him, but it doesn’t *really* matter if we work short. It’s just the one employee in that position per shift. 


3. We texted tonight about his new job that he will be leaving for in a month. Again, he just graduated and has been in school working one day a week during his last year of it. I tell him congrats because I’m legit excited to see someone succeed.


I had asked him if would cover a shift for me this weekend because I suddenly found a sublet and needed to GTFO super fast. So, he tells me he’s working the day shifts so he can’t. I said, that’s fine. It was a long shot that since it’s a holiday weekend that I would find anyone to cover the shift anyway, and it’s my problem so I’m not blaming him for that.  So, we text a little bit and just be friendly.
He fucking calls in at 1am tonight!!!! It’s a Friday on a holiday weekend. I obviously don’t know if he called in to party again, but clearly, it seems pretty fucking obvious he did. Any time I’ve called in because I’m sick, I’ve called or texted the staff working just to let them know they might get mandated. Which, he doesn’t have to do but I feel like he would have said something earlier about t if he had actually been sick? Not only that, you’re awake at 1 am to call in, shoot me a text, we texted earlier for a good bit. 

TL;DR: My coworker calls in for shitty reasons and mandates me for 16 hour shifts even though he knew I was trying to move this weekend while simultaneously working 12 your night shifts. And after other stupid call ins. Should I say anything?


Since he is leaving so soon, I don’t want to say anything for fear of causing unnecessary drama in the workplace. BUT I opened my big mouth and vented to my coworkers about it, which I should not have done, but I feel soooo bitter about the entire situation. 
Not only that, one time I warned him (even though I wasn’t working that night) I couldn’t come in after someone else called in, so he might get mandated because he was working — he says something like “well I’m not staying.” Just like, fuck the nurses trying to take care of patients and do your job, I’m not staying. 

I get he’s moving onto a better job, but this has went on over a year and this job isn’t beneath you! Even if you don’t need this job, at least be considerate of your coworkers instead of screwing us over.  That’s just not a shitty thing to do. 

Should I even say anything when I see him Sunday? It feels like I’m letting him ‘win’. Which is so petty but I’m so mad! ",30Jun2018,1
100,"So, basically, I was sexually abused by a family member at around the age of 7 (I'm now 21). He is a cousin of mine and at that time he must have been mid teens - 14/15 ish.  On one occasion, as far as I can remember, it included penetration... 

I remember some times he would involve my sister too, who at the time would have been aged 8/9. We have never spoke about it since.

I was never physically hurt or beaten during this time. But just have recollection of some of the things that took place.

I have never really told anyone of my experience, definitely not any family members, only a few very close friends and my girlfriend. I think, like most areas of struggle in my life, I have just tried to ignore it and not think about it - I just put it to one side and move on. However, is this the best approach? I don't struggle when I see the cousin who did these things, but only remember what he did.

I feel the in some way this has affected my life. it included an early introduction to porn, which I struggle to deal with now - and has probably in some way impacted my relationships.

Is there a correct way to respond to this? Should I start do something about this? If so, why? Or should I just continue with my life and not bother about it as I've been doing so far?

Thanks",30Jun2018,2
101,"This past year (my senior year of high school) I developed a crush on a junior. We were both in the school’s orchestra.

Most of the year we didn't really talk, but I got (and still have) a gut feeling that she liked me back in some capacity. We started talking over instagram mainly, I talked to her once after a concert in April, thanking her for the night (she had cheered me for something). The last week of classes earlier this month, she signed my yearbook, writing something I thought was really genuine (and with a heart). Our orchestra was playing at our grad ceremony the week after testing and what not, we had to attend a few extra rehearsals. I wanted to give something to her but had to miss it, so I stuck it in her orch locker with a note, which she said made her happy. And finally, the day of graduation, I worked up the nerve to ask for a photo with her.

And now that high school is over, and now that my crush is looking at colleges to attend after *her* senior year, I'm worried that I missed my chance to talk to her more before the year ended. The college I'm going to is in the same area of the high school (I'm actually commuting) so I don't have to worry about distance, but just about continuing to talk and grow close, and if my crush would even want to still talk to me. So I guess my question is, how can I keep in touch and try to (in the very least) stay friends?",30Jun2018,1
103,"Hey all. Usually I go to a hookah lounge to hang out with friends, acquaintances, etc. I have two cousins, I mean i'm not friends with them or super close to them, but we talk to each other.

I never call them to hang and they never call me.

But I do go to the same hookah lounge they go to, since its affordable and I really like it.

When I go with anyone else, and if I see them, I always find that one of them sits next to me and his brother (my other cousin who usually is spending 20-30 min parking his care) joins him later (sitting next to us).

I mean I don't hate that their doing it, its just odd that they (he one of them) chooses to sit next to me and another person. When I see 1 or both my cousins I do say hi, I mean I think it would be rude if I didn't, but thats not really an invitation to sit next to me.

I mean, I probably would be thinking differently if they were close to me or friends, but the fact that we never go out of our ways to hang out, and then they sit next to me is very strange. Not saying its creepy, but its little below borderline creepy, but getting there.

If I ever got there after them, I'd say hi but I wouldn't sit next to them.

Any advice? Because I don't really want to sit next to them, because when they sit next to me and other people I'm with, they try to talk to much and I really didn't go out to spend my time talking (being) with people I didn't want to hang out with the first place.",30Jun2018,1

107,"My stepdad has always treated me as if I don’t exist or like a housemate. We don’t have any particular relationship, and we never talk to each other. Though years ago, I was more immature and ignorant as to act when his daughter came to live with us. I was used to being the youngest kid, and I was very self-centered. Stupidly enough, I ignored the girl, and he lashed out at me (makes sense). Flash forward to now, I’ve definitely changed. As she is living with us this summer, I’m currently a few years wiser, and I’m the one to look after her. Her dad doesn’t wake up until the middle of the afternoon, so I usually help her get something to eat. We play together, watch tv, and talk. But just recently, my stepdad yelled at my mom “can you tell me what the fuck is going on?” Apparently I was bullying his daughter and ignoring her, because I was in my room all day working on my summer school and couldn’t play with her. He was yelling at me to “come down(stairs)”, even though I was telling him that “I have no problem with her.” Let me tell you one thing, his daughter is definitely not a child anymore and she is the type to speak her mind and not hold back. My step dad didn’t ask his daughter first if there was any issue, and he just jumped to the conclusion that I was doing so. My mom screamed at him to ask her about the truth and his daughter said “I have no problem with her.” When talking to her today, I asked her honestly if I had done anything to offend her and she said “no.” Anyways during of the argument, my mom was so pissed off by step dad lashing out on me, she started angrily yelling about how he was bullying her kids (because he was recently pissed off at my brother for not saying “hi” to him). She said she was going to divorce him, and I feel the guilt that I stirred up so much drama. As for now, I’m definitely not going to talk to my step dad first, and I’m scared to be so much in the same room as him. There is so much tension in the household, and I’m worried they will separate.

110,"Now I've been going to this summer program for about a week so far, bouncing around trying to find a group that likes to stay out late/clubbing and all that jazz.


This one girl who I had met from the first day and I started a random convo, and a little while later she said she'd hit me up to go out with her group that night. All girls who I had met previously, but not really hung out with.


The one dude from the group was going elsewhere for the night, so the girls asked if I wanted to bring any friends, which I said no, as everyone who id want to bring would have been seeing family that night. Almost sounded like she didn't want to go with them lol cause she kept saying stuff like ""are you gonna be ok hanging out with just girls????!?""


Anyhow we meet up, and after walking around a bit and even comments from the one girl like ""you're cool"", I show them this low key bar that would be literally impossible to found otherwise. There's not even a sign. You go down a dark staircase to find this shit. 


We spend the rest of the night there, smoking, drinking, chilling. Then we go back in cabs. All seems chill. But then the next day rolls around. The girls asks me where some cool locations are so her friends can scout the stuff like the spa during the day. I ask if they're gonna be out late and clubbing and they say no.


BUT remember that one dude from the group? I run into him, asks me if I wanna go out late that night. I'm confused as hell. The group already said they wouldn't be, but the girl messaged him asking if he wanted to go out late and clubbing and all that jazz.
I've asked him to talk with the girls to see if I'm actually being ""ditched"".




Now some reasons I may have been cut from the group:


-I wasn't touchy at all, hardly flirty, but I did make a couple comments about how I didn't really like hanging out in all guy groups.


-I was kinda non descriptive and a little unintentionally mysterious about the other groups I had hung out with earlier in the week.


-kinda feels like they used me to find out where the chill bar was... I also did make a comment about how I didn't want too many people finding out


-maybe they thought I was lying about some of my friends not being able to come?



If I think of anything else I'll edit...


But anyhow, when the dude gets back to me and I'm being ditched how do I move forward? Why might I have been ditched in the first place, should I ask them? Thanks for reading


TLDR; might've been ditched by a group after the night seemingly went well. Need help finding out why

So, that brings me here. I was told myfreecams was a good option because you don’t have to get nude and the money is the best on there. I filled out the application and I was approved.

So, now I have things to figure out.

1.) how to get my boyfriend who I live with on board with the idea. We’ve discussed it as a potential option before but he very much doesn’t like the idea of it. I’m only trying to do it for a couple months just to get a savings account going and pay off some debt I fell into as a result of my job loss. I do NOT want to do this long term at the moment.

If anybody has some advice on this I’d very much appreciate it, as well as other advice on the subject if you have it.

121,"Dear Reddit,

First I must preempt this post by clarifying that I'm on my cell phone, so please excuse my possible faulty grammar; also this will be long so please bear with me.

A bit of background: (M18) rated a 5-6 I work at a local grocery store as a stockboy; I handle new products. I work with a manager (F18) 6-7 and we have a solid relationship; banter, flirting, joking, sarcasm, stories, gossip, etc. My manager has a younger sister (F16?) who she herself (manager) has admitted has a ""huge crush"" on me (more on that later). You must understand I'm a somewhat charismatic person, and tend to do this to some degree with all female employees and a more ""friendship"" version for my male collegues and managers. 

A bit more of background: I'm M18, 5'8"" 160 (healthy). I have terrible memory, I get super stressed when I'm behind so I work ahead, I can create a laugh although not super funny, I'm charismatic, ""cool"", cocky, arrogant, slow (somewhat). I'm a virgin and have a (possibly misguided) belief that I should lose my viriginity. I don't any close friends (outside work) since I've graduated highschool (and not many when I was in; infact the last time I've hung out with someone for a few hours outside HS was in 2015 at a former friend - who has moved on).

My personal thoughts: I find myself attracted to her; there's some chemistry (slightly above what I have with other female managers although the chemistry is different, as in I see them more as potential friends than partners) and she's single (more on that later)

Storytime #1: The day was going great, my manager (lets call her A) invited me to go with her to a restaurant. I did and we bonded immensly over workplace gossip, antidotes, jokes, flirting, etc.  On the trip she nonchalantly brough up her sister has a crush on me (more on that later) after she talked about former boyfriends and past bad relationships. I got back and we ate in the main office by ourselves (after we dropped off food for her sister and others) for nearly 30 minutes - I was being the ""greatest stockboy"", ""best employee"", ""best person at the store"", ""terrible"", ""a future manager"" (which are phrases I commonly say - people believe through repitition - hence as I say and as she agreed the ""cockiness"" intentional as it may be).

Storytime #2: I was in the backroom and her sister (let's call her B) came ""looking for lacy"" to tell me (paraphrased) that they were arguing about a M regular customer who is A: a 7-8 B: a 6-7. I suspect that this was intentional.

Interlude #1: I forgot a detail (I'll keep it brief) when we were in her car she mentioned that the person who trained me spread rummors that I had a ""mental illness"" (after asking that I don't take it the wrong way) -  Let me adress the point - before I poison the well - that I have deppression, possible bipolar, anxiety (somewhat) and borderline personality disorder (in the past somewhat) (also comment if you need more info) (also it's a self diagosis so take with grain of salt) but the underling implication was it's some form of mental disability. luckily for me it was shot down quickly by another manager. The person who trained me I had a somewhat high opinion of (now less so) and she mentioned her sister was also ""slow"" using and anticdote to support the argument. The statement was - in my opinion a comparison to try and set me up with her; at least that was my initial thought (think what you will). This was one of the very few times my tongue wasn't ""steel"" and I said rascally that it was his opinion no matter how wrong (I said this very subtle and not direct) and I never directly disputed the point.

Storytime #3 (The Important Stuff): There is a roof leak and A orders me to get a ladder which I do and she climbs up very quickly (I say to justify it to myself even now) and another worker holds it (female aswell) she pushes the roof tile in and it breaks, she only gets wet, also touches a bit of fiberglass. Other worker jokes I should be doing this, I justify and deflect that she's the manager. Also she calls the head guy to get his opinion and I mess that up, A has to fix the situation (after head guy tells me to put her back on phone), I believe I probably could've solved it if not for my stupidity (yes I'm being hard on myself). The situation gets resolved and although A asks me to cleanup (I dry some things off) I don't mop (which is my job) and instead another worker (F) does (she rightfully is a bit upset with me) and I justify to myself (because another manager asked me to clean a specific bathroom - although the implicaion was it wasn't as urgent.

Storytime #4: I cought up with A later (between the time she has changed clothes and had made a couple of jokes about wet clothes or something to that effect). I had been feeling guilty and made myself apologize. I asked to see her in private and said basically I want to apologize for not being the one do the thing, and I felt guilty. She said basically Oh my god we're not having this conversaton and argued that what she did was right because she's the manager. She did ""lalala"" (joking trying to break tension) after a bit of bugging she said what I did was ""sweet"" but she didn't want to put someone under her in harms way. After a bit of back and forth (all the time trying to organize isles; her being somewhat lighhearted and me unusally serious as I felt hesitant, helpless and guilty like it's my fault and still do) I offered to drop it and suggusted beaking tension which we did.

Interlude #2: later on an employee 50'sM who was bystandard joked that I was a chicken and I did my best to counter (jokingly) and he asked me to run an errand, which altough is my job still stung since this waw infront of A. I was still abit deflated (I spent about half an hour in a bad mood and unpreductive because of my guilt).

Inturlude #3: A gave me a ride home although B (who can't legally drive drove - not too bad though) because I never learned. A brought up she had a date with a guy in like ten minutes (I joked about her being late). She mentioned previoulsy in the day (before I went stupid) that her date was (subtle) clingly, annoying, creepy. She also is in the middle of dating a few different people.

Falling Action: I'm still feeling guily, like I hesitated, i'm a coward, I'm a whimp, I'm weak and just plain stupid. I'm a bit worried about the work climate in two days (which is when I work next) although A wont be working that day (girls talk though). I wonder if she thinks less of me, I understand that venerability isn't such an attractive trait and I diplayed it in a weak mannor. Infact I'm so down that I wouldn't be supprised if the head guy fired me (althouth I know he won't, I've worked there about a month, and he and A talked about the situation; btw I didn't finish everything I was supposed to do for the day and a few other workers including A and B helped me out).

Question Time: Reddit what is your thoughts on my mess-up. Is it possible to recover? Am I stupid? Should I quit (joke)? 

Sincerly, Thank You in advance.

129,"I turned 19 at the beginning of this month, so I'm very young. I see many girls my age who love going out, being social, drinking, partying, just being out and about with friends in general. I find that I don't really enjoy any of that. I have tried going to the hookah bar before, didn't really care for it. I have drank a few times, and also didn't really care for it. Parties are just too loud and not really my thing honestly, maybe on occasion. I actually love staying in my house, surfing the internet, listening to music, and hanging out with my mom when I do go out. I'm an only child, no sisters or brothers. I stopped attending high school, and spent my junior and senior year doing online classes due to an unfortunate situation. I graduated early, and finished fairly quickly. I so far have completed one semester of college, and I'm returning this August to take 2 more classes, twice a week. I would've went more, but I am expecting a baby due in October. Being pregnant has left me even MORE exhausted, and I find that barely going to one store and back leaves me so fatigued. It's really hot where I am at as well, and I just enjoy being inside where it's cool. I do enjoy going swimming at the pool in my apartment complex, but that's about it. But I found that even before I was pregnant, I never really enjoyed getting out much. I like journaling, watching tv shows, the pool, I do enjoy getting my nails and toes done, baking, I like arts and crafts type of things, but once again most of that involves being in the house. I used to love shopping, but I don't really like going to too many stores anymore. As I've gotten older, I kinda just like getting exactly what I need and getting out. I don't have any ""friends"" at all really. Most moved, or I lost contact with them. I do interact with people at my college, but I don't really have a friend to go places with or really talk to. I actually go all day long without any text messages from \*anyone\*, besides family. Sometimes I do wish I had a girlfriend to talk to daily, or just someone my age to hangout with, but it doesn't really bother me too much that I don't. Especially since I have a child on the way, I know that'll keep me plenty busy. I actually picked community college for my associates degree because I liked the laid-back, quiet, atmosphere. I don't like being around a lot of people, and honestly just get annoyed sometimes. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I am missing out. I know you're only young once, but I do sometimes wonder if ""something is wrong with me"". I honestly could live in my house other than maybe going out a few times for grocery shopping, or out to eat. I don't know if it has maybe more to do with the fact it's worse because I am pregnant now, but I realized I didn't even care if I did anything for the fourth of July or not. Usually I would go to the carnival a few days before, but I can't do that now that it's not safe during pregnancy. But, I have no interest in fireworks, or anything else for the matter actually. I'd rather just stay inside. I don't feel depressed. I mean I have been having mixed emotions in regards to having a baby right now, but I am excited. This started before I was pregnant too, so it's nothing really new. I guess I wonder if something is wrong with my personality or I'm a boring person for my age.",30Jun2018,1

I just want to know how do I make the best of his last days? Weeks? 

My family and I are with him everyday and I try to be present in the moment with him everyday. He finds joy being surrounded by us. We put pictures up for him to see in the room.  We take photos and videos of him when he's being silly etc.  we play his favorite shows and movies. 

But I want to know is there more I can do? Do you have any suggestions or recommendations? there some type of make-a-wish I can apply for or does that take time? I want him to be comfortable and happy. I feel like I'm running out of time and it hurts.

132,"So lately my girlfriend's been ""inactive"" when we text each other, she's been sending me either very short replies or one worded replies. 

I asked her about it a week ago saying that she's been very quiet lately and she said that she's been struggling lately with self image issues as she thinks she's not pretty enough and that even though people compliment her, she feels like they're not genuine. 

I didn't know what exactly to say to that so I just listened to what she had to say, thinking that if she told someone what's been on her mind it'll help her feel better. That slowly led to the topic changing and we started talking about something else.

A few days after, I asked her again how she's feeling and she told me she didn't know and I just reassured her that everything will be ok (I know, I'm really bad at this).

As of late, she's still been very distant in her replies and stuff, and I really don't know what to do, it's been disturbing me for a while now so I'd really appreciate some advice on how to go forward with this. Thanks for listening. ",30Jun2018,1

I have friends on Facebook that I went to school with but after school life happened people had kids and now I just have people that comment on my posts but no one to actually do stuff with and have fun... I feel like I can't talk to anyone because sometimes I just get really sad and I want to play some video games with people or talk but I feel like I come off as desperate cuz I try to hard to hard to get people to actually do stuff with me and then I scare them away... Mostly I just like to play video games I don't like to party or watch sports so..

I feel like it was easy to find people to hang out with  in high school but as an adult I don't know any locals that like to game.

135,"My parents divorced a long time ago. My dad gets custody of my brother and I every winter and summer break. These used to be great as I got to spend time with my dad (as i admitadly have a very distant relationship with). But recently when I come over he's gone from sunrise to sunset and only comes home to eat dinner. He works two jobs, he's a civil engineer and a relestate agent on top of that. I think its insane and that hes working himself to death. Meanwhile while he's working his two jobs me and my brother are just stuck at home all day with our stepmom and step brother. Along with that there's a big elephant in the room.

 My stepmom is very obviously pregnant, shes gained a lot of weight and has a bottle of prenatle vitamins laying on the counter. My father has never been very open (he didnt even tell me he remarried i found out when he pulled us into his house and there was a random lady there) because he doesn't want my mom knowing about his life but I thought he at least he would tell me. I'm hurt that he wants to be this closed off from me about this. 

Also he never shuts up about the divorce and how horrible it was and how it was my ""bitch of a mother's"" fault. He acts like I wasn't there and that I don't rember him hitting my mom. He was always an abusive and shitty husband to my mom and never took responsibility for it. He always balmes our uncle or aunt or my mom or ect. 

I'm also scared to tell him im majoring in history. He doesnt support me being anything but a docotor (he's indian) so whenever he asks what im majoring in collage i get scared and lie to him.

138,"My friend is planning on killing herself. Her father, who has been her only familiar support over her life, killed himself a couple of years ago. She flew home to see the rest of her family, and came back with this feeling of distrust and disappointment in people in general- there has been family issues preparing the funeral, about who's receiving how much insurance, taking advantage of each other. She came back to restart on her life, because she doesn't know where home is anymore. As friends we've helped each other out so much, have been together in difficult days when I was once a self harming alcoholic with depersonalization issues (recovering). She exhausts herself working day to night to not think about other things. I know how wanting to commit suicide feels like as I've been through it myself. 
I don't disagree with it deep inside- everyone has the right to do whatever they want with their life. But to think my friend is doing everything to prepare for her death really kills me. I can't do anything about it because I'm only in the same city here on break and am going back to where I live soon. 
She doesn't want to talk to a professionalist because she knows she's going to make it. 

She's on my closest friends I have here. I could say I came here for a week mainly to see her. But so far it's been terrible once she told me.

139,"Sorry if its a long read but thanks in advance if you do end up reading. I'm on vacation for the summer in my hometown. it was my cousin's birthday this past Tuesday, so he invited us to his house for a small get together and drank some alcohol like we normally do. It was at the most 10 people so it was a more personal gathering. I only knew my cousin (whose birthday it was), another cousin and my sister. With us there was this girl who we'll call G, and she was a friend of the cousin who invited us. G was super cool, she liked the same type of music I did, she had a particular sense of humor that I really liked and overall felt a general attraction towards her (she has dyed hair of a blueish color which I love). We kept drinking and talking about random stuff, held hands and eventually kissed (basically everyone saw it). I dunno if it was the alcohol (probably had something to do with it) but i felt compelled to be with G, but not necessarily in a sexual way (though I wouldn't mind it happening lol). We made out for a while, took a few pictures together and talked to people around, all the while we were embracing each other as we'd known each other for a long time. G then asked me if I had a girlfriend to which I said no. I asked her the same and she said ""sorta, but it's kinda complicated, we got into a fight the other day, so things are not going well"". At first I was kinda against doing anything with G and she noticed but we just moved one and I guess I forgot later on lol. Eventually, she said she was gonna lay down so she went to my cousin's bedroom. I didn't want my interaction with her to end there so I followed her to the room and asked if it was okay if I laid down with her. She said it was ok, so I did. We made out for a little bit and I tried to make a move on her. She said she didn't want to go further and she just wanted to cuddle. I respected her decision and I was ok with it because I also wanted to cuddle with her (and I was actually happy with just that). We ended up sleeping together (just cuddling), her arm around my chest and my head rested on hers. The bed was uncomfortable but I didn't care because I was with her. The next morning, I woke up with G sleeping next to me and next to her was my cousin. Since they were still sleeping I got up and left the room to go talk to the other dudes that were there last night who were up already. We had to leave kinda early so me and my sister left without giving much more than a goodbye (I couldn't really talk to G besides saying goodbye). So now to my predicament. We are having another get together tomorrow at my house and I really want her to come. We exchanged information so I can contact her no problem. The thing is, the people that are coming tomorrow know what happened and I don't want to seem like I just invited her to test my chances with this girl. The cousin whose house we went to is coming but he doesn't invite anyone else unless it's his house we're going to. He could invite her if I asked but I don't want to seem to obvious. So how can I go about getting to see her again at one of these gatherings while not being completely obvious I want her to be there?

140,"What would you do? I’m 26, bar admitted in a southern state. I’m going through some serious depression/soul searching.

I have a possible job I’m waiting to hear back on here, doing consumer bankruptcies for 50k/year in a moderate sized southern city. This is currently the only thing that I’m looking forward to. If I don’t get this job, I’m back to unemployed lawyer living in my girlfriend’s apartment. Maybe Barnes and Noble?

I’ve been extremely depressed, I’ve sought a psychiatrist and and my bar’s JLAP, neither of which have helped me from slipping through the cracks.

Basically I’ve been told I was headed for this glorious profession, now I’m barred, and I absolutely hate myself and my life.

I applied for a BS computer science degree at a local shitty university, and thinking about it just makes me smile.

I am absolutely sick of acting like a lawyer to everyone I know, having no idea what I’m doing, having limited prospects for a job where someone can teach me what to do. My girlfriend is a 2L at a local law school, and I almost feel embarrassed being so exasperated about career around her.

- Driving without insurance (3 points, £250)

144,"I know I wasn't raped, and I would never claim I was. I don't want to offend those who have actually been victims of it. But I can't help to feel like I was *somehow* raped in a sense. I know I wasn't, but inside I feel like it. My first time having sex traumatized me and I can't let it go. It was years ago but I think about it all the time. I regret it so much. 

I was 16. He was 18. I had literally never done anything with a guy before, not even kissed or held hands. I wish he would've taken it more slowly. He was my boyfriend of 2 years, we met online and he traveled to visit me. Everything was fine and happy until he kissed me. We were in some kind of secluded forest area. He carried me and lifted me up and put me down on the ground. And then he like hovered over me to ""give me a massage"" I felt really scared and hated it. 

So the next day I was going to pick him up outside of his hotel. I also wanted to tell him that I thought we should take things more slowly. He said we should talk about it inside his hotel room instead so he told me to follow him there. I was so scared and devastated, I'd been crying all night doubting our relationship and if I really wanted to be with him. Once I'm his hotel room, j completely broke down. I was crying and hyperventilating and telling him we should be friends and not do this. 

I was a mess. He put me on his bed and in his lap and said he was gonna heal me from my sorrow and then he began touching me. I should have stopped him. But instead I said yes. He was so sad. I didn't want to hurt him, so I said yes to having sex out of guilt. I wasn't in the right state of mind, I had stopped crying but I was numb. My eyes were closed or half closed the whole time, I didn't dare open them. It hurt so fucking much. I told him over and over ""ow ow ow"" it hurts it hurts it hurts, and squirmed so he'd stop doing it so roughly. He didn't use a condom, nothing was planned, he called me a wh*** and hit my face and I

148,"ok so 


I have a tight nit group of friends there are 3 of us. Since i'm on a work visa I don't know to many people so these are really my only close friends.

 One of these friends I really get along well with. At fist I had no attraction to this friend at all. Then I got to know her. Still no attraction just really enjoyed her company. The one night when we were all out together. Something hit me. I felt that beautiful feeling of wanting to care take care of someone. And it was her. Out off all the times I have seen her. Now she was beautiful to me. 

2 weeks later my roommates have a party. I invite her. we both get drunk end up holding hands kissing. things get romantic. I end up walking her home holding hands and kissing good night. 

Here is were everything go completely down hill. I feel I have mad an absolute dumpster fire of this whole thing. 

I am suppose to be leaving the country in 2 weeks to see a girl I have know for around 3 years we have been on off and were planing to do a holiday trip together. To not make things complicated for my self I decide to not say anything about the ""that night"" and act like it never happened. 

week late I tell her over text  I should have said something  about what happened. but I did not wanna start anything since I was leaving so soon. she says she fine and not to worry. ok cool.

Now here is were things get worse 

My friend cancels our trip she will be going to rehab. Now I have to tell both of my friends I'm staying. 

After this fact. She stops making planes with me. dose not text me anymore. Delated something on social media with us all together.  the only real interaction I get with her is at work. She seemed ok but I could tell something was up.

2 weeks past and finely I get her alone at work. tell her how I feel.


I tell her I was an asshole for not saying something right away. I explain to her about my other friend I was going to see.  Here  is were I also think I screwed up my words. I told her when I fist met her was not really attracted to her until I got to know her. Also told her I wanted a relationship with her not just some fling that why I did not say anything. I did not wanna make things hard since I was leaving. When I said this she cringed and smiled at the same time. I told her I like her a lot and was gonna ask her for another chance. 
she said she kinda seeing someone atm so.. 

later that night she seemed mad at me. I don't know what to think anymore 

The biggest mistake was not telling her. Even if she says she ok I'm still sorry if I did hurt her in anyway.

out of all this I just want our friendship to go back to normal. I 100% fine with us being just friends again. I just miss her. I miss what we use to be.

150,"So the story starts like 1 month ago when i went to vacation with 2 of my friends, plus a friend of a friend who I didn't know yet. We got attracted to each other during the vacation and we were holding hands and cuddling time to time (but nothing more to not get weird with our 2 other friends)

After we came back from vacation we saw each other in the first week and it really went great and she was a lot into me so I was into her too.
But she started her new job, got a lot of stress and said she couldn't handle a new relationship in the same time...I said it was okay and we could see each other when she got time. So we did and saw each other time to time but it was weird like she didn't want to see me.

A friday, we were supposed to see each other but she said she felt sick and went to the doctor, after the doctor she prefered to go home and rest and asked me if I was okay with it, I said not really.
And there goes the big text saying again she is not in a good state of mood, a little depressed and that she is too scared to be in a relationship, that when she is like this she prefers to be alone (but she goes out a lot...), she talked to her doctor about me and he adviced him to tell me things, and asked me if I was okay to stay friends while she heals herself. I said no because I will still went to be with her...

2 days after that she texts me and ask me how i'm going, that she wants to see me, that she cares about me etc...I was kinda cold because I was still processing what she told me before.
During the week after I asked her if we could talk because I still had questions without answer in my head and I couldn't get them out. She told me she had a party and we could talk after but she never talked to me after her party...
Now it has been 10 days we didn't talked and I sad, pissed and lost in my head because I can't get her out of my head

I don't know if she was bullshiting me ? Did she really liked me but really can't get a relationship now, or she just didn't like me and it was an excuse to friendzone me.
I don't know if I should text her back either since she doesn't text me maybe she just don't care and moved on.

I'm just looking for some insights from people here (women and men) because I don't know what to do. I really liked her since she was everything I look in a women, and also I don't go out a lot so I don't met that much women haha

151,"So I had some self confidence problems before, and used to be incredibly submissive as a child. I still do sometimes, but largely overcame them. I'm very sociable now, and usually won't have any problems with courage/confidence.

But the problem came with this girl(17f) I like. I've noticed myself comparing how ""powerful"" eatch one of us is, and get anxious/annoyed if I think she'd be more ""powerful"" than me. 

I'm not really this kind of person, I definitely can't justify wanting my potential gf to be weak. Specially that I'm a feminist myself. Yet I can't ignore this feeling that she'd be more domineering and exploitative of me if she had ""more power"" 

I think it's linked to how conscious I am about people being mean to me, and not being able to do anything about it. It's my belief that successful relationships don't have a power structure. I couldn't care less if it was my *friend* who said something that may have been a bit mean to me. Why would I care when it's her? 

It's not the problem that she *is*  perhaps too assertive or disrespectful, it's that I *fear* she would be. So I check if she has ""power"" over me. 

Again, I know that's wrong. But it's my psyche, it's not like I'm gonna actively undermine her self confidence or something like that to satisfy myself. I'd absolutely never do that to anyone. 


Tldr : I look for ways my potential gf is more  ""powerful"" than me, because I fear she'd be a nerk of she was. Mostly because if past experiences.

About two months ago when I was brushing my hair and I felt a depression in my hair. Now sometimes, when I don't brush my hair it clumps together and you can see skin and this started my obession (you can see that even though I can explain this my brain won't stop). I've asked a few of my closest friends and they thought I was joking and told me that I'm being stupid. Now when I see random guys on the street I focus on their hairlines (typing this out really does not make me sound good) and if they are balding or not.

Since I've never paid this much attention to my hair, every new thing I notice becomes new evidence that I am going bald even though it isn't. This is having an impact on my life because I feel that due to this undertone constantly in my head, my short term memory has vastly declined. I can't remember where I've put things only minutes after I've placed them.

154,"I never seem to keep friends long because it's always the same: 80% are compulsive liars, 50% are weirdoes (not in a cute way) and like 2% are people I can actually stand to be around (yes, there's overlap between the liars and weirdoes).

So I started a new course after cutting off a bunch of my toxic old friends. Now I'm quite a friendly person and I wouldn't say I was shy or came across introverted. We were a small class of maybe about 20 with a couple of groups between us. I made friends with a couple people and all was normal with the odd late-comers.

So a guy joins us who I find attractive straight away. Not only that, we seem to gel and have similar interests. He told me he makes music and can freestyle and etc and when I said I spit bars on occasion and asked him to show me his expertise, he refused and I just laughed thinking he was joking or whatever.

It starts off with him apparently coming from new money parents and making comments about how he's in stocks and when we've been out shopping urged me and my other working class friends towards buying things out of our budget... You know, like an insensitive rich kid.

Fast forward to us hanging out, I don't mind subbing people for friends every now and again. He always seems to claim to 'not have his money' and my friends and I have subbed him more than a few times, mostly for outings he himself encouraged.

When it was just the two of us and we were chatting for hours, he was going on about how we've nearly finished the course and how it'll be one of the last times we can hang out and how it was such a shame he never brought any money and asked me to buy him a drink. Of course, I gave him a hard time about it for a while and only bought him one drink not thinking anything of it but poked fun at him for 'relying on my pauper paycheck'.

I thought we got along quite well, spending hours chatting and whatever, going out for drinks and for smokes and etc. you know, like friends. He always did this subtle bragging when talking and I always took the piss out of him for it.

So towards the very end, I noticed he was immediately willing to go halves for smoke and drink when before, it always was an IOU or something. I think I opened up to him the last time we hung out about how I always make friends with compulsive liars who lie about things that nobody would even think to lie about. The irony. 

In the past, I had friends lie about rape, cancer and even things like what shows they'd seen or their favourite colours. So imagine, you make friends with someone thinking they're one thing - say a person who likes biking and Evangelion (two random things lol) - and they turn out to be someone who can't even ride a bike and hasn't ever seen Evangelion. Two things you wouldn't expect people to lie about, yet they seem to do it to me all the time and my stupid ass believes them because it's not something unbelievable or something I'd think you'd benefit from. I mean, what do you gain from telling people your little sister got raped?

I asked him what his image of me was when we first started the course, expecting him to say things like 'I thought you were into x, I thought you would be x, I liked how you dressed, etc.', instead that question really caught him off guard and it confused me because everyone gets impressions of people when they first meet.

So fast forward to when we finished our course, there was a big group chat drama where one girl called the guy out for spreading lies about her. Notice, since we were friends, he made a lot of assumptions about the girl to me and I assumed it was just him venting and corrected him about those assumptions thinking they just had a misunderstanding. I never expected him to go around badmouthing her to people he didn't really speak to like that.

The girl also said that back when we first started, he went around bragging to people that I'll do all his work for him and buy things for him. My ass - I always demanded my money back. And when I went to confront him about it, he aired me. It's been a month and the pieces are starting to come together. 

I remembered at the start of the year, two of my other friends were talking about him saying he lied about having a swimming pool in his bedroom (a lie he originally told me saying he thought other people would discriminate against him for having a silver spoon in his mouth) and half of the pictures he kept showing with girls were all old (he went on like he was some f-boy). I put the pool thing down to jokes and the rest of it as insecurity.

The girl who he slagged off saw him coming off his drive by chance and said that his house wasn't as special as he kept claiming it was. Apart from his car with his custom number-plate, he's showed no evidence as being as well off as he claims. I noticed that the way he speaks doesn't match where he's from and a lot of pop culture references seem to miss him completely (I always teased him about it but maybe there's an actual reason).

Based our almost year-long relationship I can say that I have two theories- 
1: when we first met, he took one look at me and assumed I was some b*******t fool. He thought because I was attracted to him, I'd do all his work for him and buy him things because apparently, I have no self-respect or self-esteem or experience with men (he low-key offended me during a game of never-have-I-ever by saying he thought I was a virgin). He also lied about being rich and his sexual exploits because he's a shallow f***er. Little did he know he'd actually like me/feel guilty and that why his attitude changed a little bit towards the end of the course and why we've been able to talk for hours on the phone or whatever. 
2: he may have lied about a few things out of insecurity, but his intentions weren't malicious. His lack of pop culture knowledge, adorkable bragging and occasional philosophical comments mean he probably was less than popular at school and wants to pretend that he was something (he told me that he played like 20 girls at school and they all confronted him - I didn't fall for that one). He intends to go abroad somewhere where people won't be able to see through his facade and that's why he listens to so much shallow hip-hop and speaks with outdated/American slang and explicitly told me that he dresses and moves that way just to get female attention (he said he'd 'never thought of it that way' when I told him that people do dress for themselves lol so innocent)- it's because he's shallow and insecure, not necessarily a bad person, just socially awkward which is why he puts on this f***boy persona. But of course, still he lies.

I tried to keep it as short as possible including enough details for why I doubt this person in particular and my behaviours that may be making me a magnet for liars. I'll be honest, I'm self-centred and believe that may have something to do with it. I think I don't spend enough time actually observing the behaviours of people around me because I'm very accepting and take things at face value. I'm willing to put the little things aside for a good time as long as I get to at least brutally tease you about whatever it is you may've done lol.

Maybe I've got some kind of 'image' I'm unaware of. I don't see how I attract these people. I'm a tall woman with a bit of weight (I've lost a lot this year! yay) and I'm blunt to a fault and even though I get along with everyone, I'm not afraid to confront people. I brutally tease and banter with people, especially my male friends. Do I attract liars because I'm honest?

To everyone that actually read all of this, thank you! Before I go on to make new friends and meet new people, I want to know if I'm bringing this all on myself or not and sort out my behaviours. ",30Jun2018,1

157,"If you don't want to read the whole story of how I feel, skip to the bottom. 

I just graduated high school 4 weeks ago and I already miss it. All the memories I had , all the friends that I wish I could still talk to but ended up getting separated. I wish I could just go back into the past and enjoy EVERY FUCKING MOMENT I HAD. I NEVER APPRECIATED THE PRESENT MOMENT IN HIGH SCHOOL. Im listening to my playlist from freshman year and it's making me sad as fuck.  I realized around my junior year that Im going to miss high school, but everyone wanted to leave. It was like I was the only one who really enjoyed it. I never even went to parties or played any sports at school. It was the small things that made me happy. Like staying up all night texting in a group chat and playing video games. I REALLY miss the conversations I used to have with my friends discussing where to skate after school and walking home in the heat. 


I just felt so fucking nostalgic right now listening to my playlist. I miss high school but I know that the past can never come back. How can I let go of the past? Also, Im also going to college but I dont know what im going to be. Im just going because my parents want me to, and I DO want to go , but i dont know who ill become. My parents told me that college will lead me to a successful life, so I trust them. What should I do?",30Jun2018,1

I'd like to meet someone and be able to vibe with them like that, but I feel like I'm a bit ""undatable""

I'd like to start meeting people but I get really stressed when the idea of work/having my own place/having a car comes up, I don't really know what direction to take this.  


Should I try to repress these feelings of being alone and try to get myself in order? Should I stress less about this and try to get out there anyways? I stress that I'll meet someone I like, but they'll be off put by my lack of car/lack of job. I don't know what to do

160,"Hi, so basically I have a friend who is genuinely nice, but is trying to convert me into Christianity. I have told him before that I am an atheist and that I was at one point a Christian as that is how I was raised, but I had many bad experiences with it and, since I’m taking a course in science, religion just isn’t for me. I’ve explained that to him and yet he continues to try and get me to go to all these Christian events. 

The tipping point that is really making me start disliking him is that I have told him countless times and he KNOWS that I am having financial difficulties and grew up in a family living on the poverty line, but he is trying to pressure me into going to a camp that will cost $400, that is for Christians. I don’t want to go partly because I am not interested in becoming a Christian and also partly because I do not have that kind of money at all. 

I don’t want to be rude or offend him by saying that I’m not going because I am not interested in Christianity, and trying to explain to him that I just don’t have the money won’t work. I’ve tried it, he just doesn’t accept it as a reason. 

What do I do?

161,"I've been watching some Boogie2988, and he's such a forgiving person. After being abused by his mother as a child, he eventually forgave her. In the comments, I saw someone say that anything can be forgiven; even though it can be extremely difficult sometimes. Is this true? Can anything really be forgiven? I need advice for this. I'm a forgiving person by nature, but one of my personal rules is this: sexual assault is unforgivable. I've had this rule for years. Four months ago as of next Tuesday, I was raped. The person who did it was a school friend. I've gone to great lengths to distance myself from her as much as I can, including leaving behind all my old closest friends to make new friends who have no ties to the girl.

Was this necessary? Or is it possible to forgive the person who hurt me? Am I able to be a good person without forgiving everyone? Will the pain go away if I am able to forgive her? I hate her. She haunts me. I never want to forgive her. But is she forgivable? And will it help me? ",30Jun2018,34
162,"So I met this girl on tinder in very late April. We clicked and for the first time I deleted the app after our first date. I was studying for my board exam at the time but still managed to see her weekly.  

Little caveat,  neither of us (23m/22f) have our own place so no sex. For the fourth date we went to a park and things got frisky and we started having sex in the car but stopped as it was unfulfiling. She suggested we get a hotel. I'm in professional school and as such live on student loans but I figured if we get something cheap we could split.  


After my exam I traveled for 3 weeks and recently got back.  She went ahead and booked for a airbnb under the assumption that we can cancel it if it doesn't work out.  I got back last weekend and we  had a fight that threatened the relationship.  I wasn't sure about the bnb anymore and told her to cancel but she said we had until Wednesday to figure out so take my time. She convinced me it'd be fun and since I'm about to get busy this is our best chance so I agree Wednesday night. 


Friday evening and I drive up to her town 45mins away and we checked in. It was relaxing and we were there for an hour before everything went downhill.  Apparently she told her parents she was off somewhere and they could see her cellphone located somewhere else so now she tells me she has to leave and drive to a different town where she had initially lied to her parents about being. 

I'm livid because I have no use for the place if we aren't both staying there so we both left 1 hour into arriving. I'm at a crossroad here. I originally agreed to pay half so if I don't pay it means I'm not holding my end of the deal which is shitty. At the same time, for a guy on student loans, It feels like a massive waste of money and it was a one sided decision and I feel like I shouldn't have to pay for her stupidity especially since the entire thing was her plan to begin with.  It wasn't even in a town half way between us, I had to drive up there. I'm torn but I don't plan on seeing this girl again and could care less what she thinks.

However, I have been seeing his Snaps as of lately and he has posted that he wants to commit suicide and that he thanks his mom for loving him but he's very sorry for something he knows his mom will be hurt at.

I asked him what is wrong, and he told me that he is accused of a felony charge, and he thinks he'll not make it and he'll end up in jail. This was of a few hours ago, and I really want to help and support him, but my worst fear is when I'll learn he is dead.

170,"I'm not sure what to do here. My fiance and I met 8 years ago. At that time, I was very liberal and he was libertarian, but neither of us was very political in our daily lives so it didn't really matter. Ramping up to the 2016 election he started to be extremely political all the time. Spamming Facebook and Twitter with his anti-Trump, pro-Hillary posts. I agreed with him for the most part, but I didn't like how he was becoming the overly controversial person we used to make fun of together.

After Trump won, I sort of hoped he'd give up and move on with his life. But it only made things worse. At this point, he considers himself an unironic SJW, he hates conservatives of all forms, and is starting to worry me with his obsession with political issues. He spends all day and night on Twitter and watching MSNBC. Yesterday, he yelled at me in a group chat of our friends when I refuted his claim that the immigrant children at the border were being treated exactly like Jews during the peak of the holocaust.

To me, his beliefs are extremist at this point, and it is starting to affect his behavior towards me. I still lean liberal, but I can usually see both sides of an argument. If I play devil's advocate or express an opinion that differs from his, he outright tells me I'm wrong. There is no respect for my opinions, unless they line up with his.

172,"My first post on reddit. Honestly sometimes I see great advice with a lot of dumb comments that aren’t helpful. It’s whatever. It’s the culture- great. But if at all possible please just help guide me. I’m in shock.  I respect all of you out there but I’m begging for helpful advice when I’m outside my capabilities. My husband is deployed and I cannot contact him until he gets to his shift in 10 hours. 

Currently, I am headed to a city in the south. My son was attacked by bouncers in a bar.  Yes, he had been drinking but his friends who had just arrived and hadn’t been pregamming (they had just arrived from a 10 hour road trip) and this happened within minutes of their arrival. 

He was in the bathroom and the bouncers attacked him at the urinal. And dragged him outside. My son is not a large man. 5’9” and maybe 170.   They knocked down two people in the bathroom-my son being one of them.  I guess the other person is who they wanted ?  

This city is a party city and yes-I’ve been there. Lots and lots of cops. I don’t know how the cops responded-just there on the street corner or being called in but when the bouncers drug him outside the cops threw him into a wall.  He was yelling-“I have my plastic key in my pocket and my wallet” (hotel key). I guess they were yelling for him to shut up and he just kept yelling that over and over. (Fear? Adrenaline?). He was then thrown to the ground. He was stomped in the head and kicked.   He was being told he was not cooperating as he’s trying to wiggle for air. They kept screaming and he was trying to say he couldn’t breathe. It was an cycle that only got worse before it got better. 

The police then released him once they knew he wasn’t who they were responding to and gave to the bouncers walked him home? My son strongly protested -“saying the person who involved me getting beat up is who you’re entrusting my safety to? Please let my friends take me back the one block”(again they are sober)  they then threatened him with go with who we said or we will take you to jail and you can have them pick you up from there. 

I’m taking the lonnng drive to go get him at the hospital. I obviously want a lawyer. Cops are completely out of control. Of course, in a day and age when everyone videos-his friends didn’t because I think they were in shock this was even happening.  I do know this city-cops wear body cams. What I don’t know is if they always wear them or if they all wear them. I realize I will have to retain a lawyer-to get access but how much of a case is there? 

I know the “law” however I have found it isn’t always applied the same way to everyone. Sometimes you hear the most insane lawsuit being awarded-and the next thing you hear is cops getting off for murder even when it’s clear they are guilty af.    This would obviously have to be a civil case. We aren’t a sue happy family. But I have no idea how else to get access to those body cams to hold the party responsible for his injuries.  It cannot be he said/she said. The footage is our best hope.  Does it matter he was drinking? He wasn’t doing anything wrong. He wasn’t black out drunk. He wasn’t even belligerent. He was socially drinking. 

So-he’s alive and thank goodness. That’s the best news. 

I just paid his insurance bill-so thank goodness he has decent coverage. 

He may have damage to major body parts that will hinder his future career which he is currently in school for-take 8 years of school and specialized training after that. He will owe a huge debt to FSA loans.   

He has broken ribs, he also had sports on his schedule this month and can no longer participate.  The sport is a hand selected team that represents the US in a particular discipline. 

The experience is scary and horrific. I don’t know if that’s considered part of a suit. 

What would be your first step? I “know” what I want to do which is attend to him first and then find legal counsel to obtain on Monday.  I would like to go to the station but I don’t know how I can reasonably ask for this footage (which I know I cannot get) for a grown man by his mommy.  In my world-I would think it would be that easy because people are suppose to do what’s right and of course cops are good people and never use force unnecessarily. 

This won’t make the news but he’s not terribly fair skinned-which makes me wonder if race was a factor. 

Helpful comments only please!! I have tried to make this as clear as possible, without going into huge details as to protect him. So that’s why I have left out particular details.  I did not change details. Just was vague about who and where

*Hello,*

*I approached a girl few months back 2-3 months back at work she was new at her job and I was the one who had to make a pass so she can enter the building.*

*She's one of those cute girls with a shine in the eyes, a spark which spark also transitioned to my eyes.*

*I saw her coming in the building and she came to reception and... I kept her there for a while pretending I am new and that I do not know how exactly i need to do everything in order to print out a pass just so I can start a conversation.*

*I was working there only for 4 days then I was going to another building and I decided to act this time and grow some balls and just go an talk to her.*

*She came down later that day and she smoked a cigarette in front of the building and went away. I didn't do anything guess why? :D*

*2nd day she came in morning we said few words sort of ''Hey, How are you? Have a nice day! Well same thing she came down for a cigarette again after work but she was on the phone so I didn't do anything once again.*

*3rd day After work I went outside and smoked a cigarette then a 2nd one waiting on her to finish, then she came down and we started talking I approached her and we had that general talk Where are you from? and after about 5-6 min I asked her you know what we should go grab something to drink if you are not busy, she said i would love to but i have a boyfriend, I explained to her directly that I don't want anything special, and that I respect the fact that she has a boyfriend and so on... we went home...*

*4th day last day I decided that i am getting at least a number or Facebook or whatever just to keep contact. But morning, mid day she wasn't there I did not see her, but then about 10 minutes before finishing work she sneaked behind me and touched me on the shoulder and said Hey! You know what, you should get my number later when we go for a cigarette.*

So we did go for a cigarette and i got her Facebook instead of the number because I had a problem with my phone. ( I guess this is where i started to Fuck Up.)

Next day we started talking and we were literally explaining each hour of the day what each one of us is doing how and etc... Which gets boring fast and we haven't even gone out yet so we are basically learning so much about each other over Facebook that when we meet we will have nothing left to talk about. Haha it was very fun and interesting at least for me.

And this went on for 2 weeks and I kept pushing her to meet up, I probably asked her 6-7 times for 2 weeks. After a month or so we did finally manage to meet up she called a friend of her(male) and He was a decent dude he was cool and he helped a lot keeping the conversation up and yeah we had few beers it was awesome, (Lately I haven't been very social and this was a very fun thing to do).

Then we kept on meeting every day even if we had 30-40 minutes and 20 minutes travel time to meet we did even if it was for one cigarette time, and we did go out a few times on days off work to a park to enjoy the weather it was fucking awesome not gonna lie.

Then next we meet up in a park with her and 2 female friends of her and me, it was fun they went home a bit early and then me and her stayed alone in park for 1 hour something and it was getting really flirty and touchy and yeah... then i had to start going to work and we went to the underground station and she came to hug me for good bye and gave a me a kiss on the cheek...

And she left me in underground thinking what the fuck is going on and what do i do?

And here is where i realized that i might actually have some feelings for her... even now I am still not sure if I do, I mean she is great, funny, beautiful every time we are together outside for a beer or something both of us are shining! I don't know how to explain it better but I am sure you guys know what i mean, but at the same time i am not the guy who is gonna go and fuck up someones relationship or mess with that in any kind of a way... I respect that and i say away.

Then all of a sudden after few days she just stopped replying to any text, and after 2 days of no response I directly asked her Whats wrong why are you ignoring me did i do something? Tell me if so.

Her reply was instant, Hey look my boy friend saw chat with you and he asked about you and I told him the ''truth'' that you asked me out. Sorry but he does not want me to talk to you. Really sorry about this.

I said its OK I understand but why did you say that to him? I explained to you that I asked you to go for a drink I want to make friends... if something else happens then awesome! If it doesn't I don't mind having +1 friend.

And from there we started ignoring each other, but we couldn't so every 1-2 days we were sending a message here and there and problem is that she kept on saying Sorry , every few hours and I can't sit there and not reply, I told her the truth i am not a fake person... I opened up to her and told her how everything is!

So slowly we started talking again and then we stopped and started and stopped.

Then I snapped off and told her look lets meet for a beer i know you are not comfortable but that's better and faster and that way there is no misunderstandings, so we did meet for 2 hours or so and we had a good serious talk we had a good laugh and we went home.

Then she started messaging me again, Hey How are you doing?

One day I was done (1 day before going on holidays) I send her few more messages in which i explained to her how i see the situation and that I want to break it off because otherwise i can cause her problems and its pointless to chat/have a friend with which you can only chat on Facebook and you feel like you are hiding from someone when you are doing it, I said I do not want to do this but it is better hurts less for me hurts less for you.(because she said she was Hurt but if I wanted it that way so be it. From there I told her look how i see things is that you are in a shitty situation in which you put yourself in, I want to be your friend and i appreciate you but this is getting out of hands, only solution is you to have an argument with your boyfriend and prove to him hes got nothing to be jealous from this is what we talked about last time we met also, she said ok i was going to meet you today but... anyways we didn't meet and the day before my holiday she said Look i want to be your friend and i will try to sort it out I will make it work because i want to be your friend and we are going to meet when you come back from your holiday, (My flight was on her birthday).

While i was on a holiday for 15 days we did talk but she didn't seem interested, and this is what pisses me off that she is making me go to her, so she can ignore me for 2 days reply with 1 word answers and i find that pretty ignorant and selfish.

Anyways I came back from holiday flight landed she kept on ignoring me we didn't meet for her birthday ( I did buy her a really cool gift that she would of loved for sure this is how I've been raised I didn't do it because I love her or whatever and she knows that very well)

its been 11 days already, and I am starting to get very disappointed, Why? Because I expected that after she said she wants to be my friend and she will make it work, that she actually will do something about it.

We aren't even talking anymore she will reply after 1 day if i send her a message but that's not the point.

What do you think?

Should I keep going for it, should I just forget it, should I become a complete dick with every girl like I was few years back where I use to have tons of girls around me because I didn't show any feelings or any interest?

I don't know... Its confusing, I LIKE HER! I do, but it does not have to be sexual or I don't want a relationship.

I would try a relationship with her if she didn't have a boyfriend yes.

IMPORTANT

Few comments she made, when we met last time and had a serious talk, she opened up too and she said that, ''It would be so much easier if you weren't so good looking'' and also '' You definitely wouldn't be just a friend if I didn't have a boyfriend''

Is she just playing around with me and i am being blind or she likes me or WHAT!? FUCK!...

180,"throw away account for obvious reasons. 

Im a guy. I'm fairly attractive, polite, never did drugs, cigarettes or alcohol. 22 years old. Never been in a relationship despite many opportunities. Never hooked up, never kissed or held hands (you get the picture).

I've got this silly fantasy that one day I'll meet an SO and I'm saving myself for her. For someone I'm emotionally passionate about. 

However, there's this girl whom I've known for a few years. She's been a friend but i know she's desperate to get married.  She's fairly attractive too, and offered to hookup with me when we were talking about pent up sexual frustration. She's had plenty of boyfriends in the past, but I'm not sure if she's a virgin. 

So, my question is, should i just meet up with this girl and just *do it*, or should i continue to chase my fantasy on one day meeting the right person? I know there could be right people out there for me. 

This girl really wants a relationship with someone, and is obviously using me for some heated stress relief. She asked me if she could be my SO and I told her there was nothing emotional here. She still said let's go for it. I'm using her too, so it cancels out. 

A potential problem could be her turning manipulative because she's a bit like that. Crying because her parents didn't pay for her parlor, stuff like that. She's not like me in terms of personality. She's not all that mature. She's wanted to get married for years but idk, no one's showing up. I'm afraid having an affair with her might lead her to manipulating me for more or something (but this is baseless, as i told her i respected her no matter what happened ahead and she said likewise). She knows im not looking for anything else and i'll be sure to remind her. 

She's told me she's interested in me in the past, but i told her we're just friends. 

I'm just a human too. I've waited for so long, and I'm sexually repressed and frustrated. I keep using the word 'emotional', but this **is** an emotional decision for me. One one side i want to fall in love with someone eventually and live my life with them, and one the other side i want to fuck someone immediately. Should i let my first encounter with a woman be something completely meaningless and empty? Is the sex worth it? 

I just want to let her have her way with me and vice versa and just unload it all. it doesn't even have to be a one time thing, I'm sure she's willing as long as i am, and that's so irresistible. At the same time, I have this horrid feeling that this is wrong, and i should wait for my would-be SO. It feels so guilty doing this. Which one should i go for? 

Choose for me, Reddit. You're my go to for everything, and I trust you. You're deciding my future now. Keep in mind I'm monogamous and faithful in nature. I've been loyal to someone who i haven't even met for so many years. 

Thanks for reading. I appreciate all help. 

P.S, since I've laid myself bare anyway, and I've got nothing left to hide, is a 5 inch penis okay? fml ",30Jun2018,2
181,"Hi there,

so I have a problem with my crush. I know her fairly well but things aren't go straight. I know she likes me so that's one step. Recently I invited her to an Dinner but sadly she had no time because of her vacation in Croatia.

So often she writes simple messages to me like: ""Heyy or What's up?"" but I don't know what to answer, I don't want to do useless Small Talk . I don't usually write to her unless I want to ask her something or have a topic to talk about.

So my problem is what could I write to her? I would rather do something in real life but she is away for 2 weeks. Any advice for future plans?",30Jun2018,1

184,"Okay so her friends hate me for my eccentric personality (compliment from teachers and friends). They said im a weirdo (dont get me wrong, i have social skills) in a bad way. And things got worse when everyone knew I am in love with her. They kept on teasing her to me, though she still wants to be friends with me and acknowledge my eccentric personality. 

After high school (now senior high school as Philippines would call it) one time her group of guy friends saw me and asked me how im doing. But here is the interesting part: they pressure me to drink at their place. When I said no, they were disgusted and their next move is touching my phone, dissed my friends for fun and they denied their actions after dissing my friends (for god sake I have to explain to my friends it wasnt me). I never saw them again. 

I told her about their actions, yet SHE INVITED THEM TO HER PARTY EXCLUDING ME. WHY? Because aside from not being close to her (just befriended her last feb 2017 and her debut is june 11 during her birthday), she thinks that they will treat me shit and both of us will be affected. 

Me and my crush are good friends. But she is a paradox: she hates her friends' actions and attitude but she is still friends with them. She even cared to me about being bullied bybher friends, but yeah, still invited them to her debut. 

Should I still be friends with her or leave her until she isn't in touch with her friends anymore?

TL;DR : her friends treat me shit, but she cares about me and good friends with her. ",30Jun2018,0
185,"About a week and a half ago my fiancé and I moved into a new apartment. There are six units in our building and we have an upstairs neighbor that’s very loud. While moving in my fiancé briefly met her and said that the first thing out of her mouth was “hey I’m (name) let me know if I’m loud at night okay” and I thought it was kind of odd. The first night she was walking around a lot and we were so tired we just ignored it. The second night the walking continued but turned into stomping and she began screaming bloody murder. She was screaming things like “I didn’t do it” “I didn’t mean to hurt her” “liar, you’re all liars” along with blood curdling screams that sounded like she was being stabbed. This went on until about 2 am and we were going to go knock on her door to tell her she needs to quiet down but we were afraid she might be dangerous or violent. 

We went to the office the next morning and told our landlord and showed her videos of what we could hear from our apartment. She said it was unacceptable and would write her a letter to remind her of quiet hours (9 pm-9am) and would talk to her in person. She seemed to quiet down that night our landlord talked to her (this was about a week ago) but now she has started back up with the stomping, throwing things and screaming. 

What we planned to do was talk to our neighbor in person and then if she doesn’t get better we would go to our landlord again. How should we go about this situation and make sure she understands that she can’t be doing this? We live in New Hampshire if that helps with any laws/rules there could be to help us ",30Jun2018,114

187,"We’ve been together for 3 years.

My girlfriend found various packs of cigarettes while cleaning the house and she decided to keep 6 for her and give the rest away. I’ve asked her “why are you keeping 6 packs? you’ve stopped smoking. give all of them away”

She got instantly angry with me and said she can do whatever she wants and I’m not her father. I’ve tried to explain to her that I don’t want to tell her what to do, but I’m just pointing out the fact that I don’t see the point in keeping all these cigarettes.

The thing that really bothers is that the last time she started smoking again for a brief period of time, she instantly said I needed to help her about it. 

So, basically when I try to tell her something in advance she tells me it’s her life and that’s none of my business. But then when she’s in trouble it becomes MY problem and I need to solve it.

What should I do?

Thanks!

188,"I’ve (F21) been with boyfriend (M21) for 2.5 years. Recently I’ve been feeling like I need to let go. I want to have fun! Go to parties with girl friends, flirt with anyone I please, and just be left to do what I want to do (to be a little selfish in my 20s). 

He’s a great guy but I know we wouldn’t get back together if we broke up, I just don’t think it’s fair for him. 

We are both upcoming college seniors and we currently live together and have already started another lease for senior year (so we’ll be living together until next July).

The problem is that I was always insecure in high school and never really got to live life. When I got to college I had this new found confidence and I felt good about myself and stopped caring what people think for the most part. Soon after that revelation I got into my current relationship. I just feel like i never got to do my thing. 

Anyways, I’m starting to resent my boyfriend a little and I don’t want to feel like that. I’ve been trying to get rid of these feeling but they keep coming back. I’m starting to think it’s time to break up but I’m not sure how go about it and how to live with it in my situation. 

Am I being unreasonable? Any advice would be helpful. I guess I just kinda need to be persuaded to break up with him. He’s amazing and I would feel so guilty about hurting him but I really need me time.",30Jun2018,1

192,"This is kind of long so there's a TLDR at the bottom if anyone doesn't feel like reading all the drama. 

So I live in an apartment on the second story. When you walk up the stairs it is a square of space that's probably like 6 ft in both directions. There's 4 apartments up here, with the door next to mine being not even a foot away. The other two are across from me in the 6 ft space. 

An older woman moved in months ago with what I assume to be her granddaughter who is about 12 years old. The older woman doesn't work and has been weird to my boyfriend and I since she moved in here. We've had problems in the past but we've mostly gone to ignoring each other and it's been a pretty peaceful few months. 

Well now that it is summer, for some reason at least 6 kids aged 4-11 who also live in the complex have taken to coming over every single day and sitting RIGHT IN FRONT OF my door with the granddaughter from next door. They do not run around and play or do normal kids things. They sit on my door stoop and be obnoxiously loud while playing music. The apartments here have absolutely no sound barrier and I can hear every single word they say even when talking at a normal volume. I'm in school full time and also work full time so if I'm at home trying to do course work or take a nap, I can't just blare music or tv to drown out the noise because that will just distract me even more. 

I let them sit in front of my door for 3 hours the other day and do this until I finally went out and said ""you guys need to find a new place to play. You're sitting right in front of my door and it's way too loud for me to have to listen to everyday."" I sat there for a moment for a response but they all just stared at me blankly so I closed the door and went inside. It was quiet after that.

Well a few hours later my boyfriend and I went outside to walk our dog. The granddaughter from next door was still sitting outside with one other friend but they were being quiet. The granddaughter apologized to me for being loud and I told her it was okay, I know they're just being kids, but I'd prefer if they played somewhere else that isn't in front of my door. (I have told her and her grandma this months ago when this was happening previously.)

So before I could finish talking to her a random man who was standing downstairs calls up and says ""are you the neighbors?"" Long story short, he's apparently a friend of the older woman's and he is visiting them. He tells us that she's old and ""not all there"" and he'd like to settle any problems between us and the neighbor. We tell him we truthfully have no problems and we've really just coexisted peacefully the last few months but we don't and have never liked when people hang out in front of our door being loud. This has always been the problem we've had with the older woman and the granddaughter. 

So he promises that he's going to talk to her and everything is gonna be fine. We were nice to him but we didn't really care one way or the other if he was able to ""settle"" things. Well the next day my boyfriend leaves for work. I have the day off so I plan to get some much needed homework done. Around 9:30 AM I hear the man who we had just had the conversation with the day before. I peek out my peephole because I'm curious and nosy and the man is holding a large box full of crayons, chalk, markers, etc. and he sets them down right in front of my door. He then begins pointing saying ""ok you sit here, you sit here..."" and continues on as he gets the six kids from the day before to take up camp right in front of my apartment and do their crafts. 

I can't tell if this is deliberate or not so I'm like what the fuck??? My mom and I had planned to get lunch so I just turn on some music to drown them out and begin getting ready so I can go to my parents house early and just do homework there. It's now 11 and I'm ready to leave. The kids are still out there being as loud as can be but now they've had pizza ordered for them? Because, you know, it's sanitary to eat pizza off the dirty ground in front of someone else's door.

So I walk outside and I'm on the phone with my mom so I don't even look at these kids or talk to them. I just lock my door and walk downstairs to my car. While I'm doing this, the granddaughter from next door is telling the other kids they need to be quiet (yeah fucking right) and one of the older boys calls out ""I don't have to be quiet. I CAN BE LOUD IF I WANT"" Where the fuck are these kids parents, first of all??? 

So I don't know if all that was intentional but this is getting ridiculous. I don't give a shit if these kids play outside. But of all the grass, sidewalks, and other door stops to sit in front of, why does it have to be mine? I've tried being nice, I've talked to her guardian and whoever that weird guy next door is, and it's done nothing. Is this a valid complaint? Would my apartment complex even be able to do anything if I approached them about this?

TLDR; kids are (possibly on purpose) sitting inches away from my door for hours screaming and playing music. I've asked them and a parent for this to stop happening yet it does not stop. What can be done? Is this a valid complaint? Will my apartments even care?",30Jun2018,1

She tried to negotiate by exchanging her good grades with an apartment of her choice (she wants one with a kitchen as she loves cooking and baking), and was countered with ""good grades are your own benefit it has nothing to do with us"". This is of course true to a certain extent however my gf was trying her best to make them proud and this broke her heart. On the car ride home from visiting the apartment, her dad said ""you've grown up now you are independent and can make your own decisions"" which really pushed her over the edge. I was wondering if anybody has any advice on what I or my gf can do to get her the apartment she wants. This is an Asian family btw.

196,"When I was 6, my parents and I moved from Asia to the U.S. We always kept our head down and my parents had few friends. On weekends, we either stayed home or went on road trips. 

My mom in particular has rarely been able to get along with others. She comes across as unfriendly (ex: doesn’t say excuse me, says bye to people who haven’t finished talking, etc). She has a college degree but hasn’t been able to keep a job (not even minimum wage) for 15 years. She doesn’t have friends and her entire life revolves around me. 

My dad is much friendlier but he also hasn’t been able to keep a job in the U.S. For 15 years, he worked at 10 different offices either because he was laid off or because he’d found a higher-paying position. 2 years ago, his manager made budget cuts, my dad was laid off, and the only job he found was in Asia. 

So my dad went back to our native country and my mom has been living with me since. The start to my career has been rocky bc I come across as the stereotypically shy Asian woman. I graduated from a top undergrad as a math/econ major, had 18+ interviews for finance/accounting jobs, and only got one offer. I’m just as qualified as, if not more than, my college peers yet they’re all at much better firms than me. 

I can’t help but think that my social skills are whats holding me back. When I was younger, my mom discouraged me from socializing because she wanted me to focus on school now I feel guilty about not going straight home after work bc I’m the only person my mom talks to.

198,"I know I wasn't raped, and I would never claim I was. I don't want to offend those who have actually been victims of it. But I can't help to feel like I was *somehow* raped in a sense. I know I wasn't, but inside I feel like it. My first time having sex traumatized me and I can't let it go. It was years ago but I think about it all the time. I regret it so much. 

I was 16. He was 18. I had literally never done anything with a guy before, not even kissed or held hands. I wish he would've taken it more slowly. He was my boyfriend of 2 years, we met online and he traveled to visit me. Everything was fine and happy until he kissed me. We were in some kind of secluded forest area. He carried me and lifted me up and put me down on the ground. And then he like hovered over me to ""give me a massage"" I felt really scared and hated it. 

So the next day I was going to pick him up outside of his hotel. I also wanted to tell him that I thought we should take things more slowly. He said we should talk about it inside his hotel room instead so he told me to follow him there. I was so scared and devastated, I'd been crying all night doubting our relationship and if I really wanted to be with him. Once I'm his hotel room, j completely broke down. I was crying and hyperventilating and telling him we should be friends and not do this. 

I was a mess. He put me on his bed and in his lap and said he was gonna heal me from my sorrow and then he began touching me. I should have stopped him. But instead I said yes. He was so sad. I didn't want to hurt him, so I said yes to having sex out of guilt. I wasn't in the right state of mind, I had stopped crying but I was numb. My eyes were closed or half closed the whole time, I didn't dare open them. It hurt so fucking much. I told him over and over ""ow ow ow"" it hurts it hurts it hurts, and squirmed so he'd stop doing it so roughly. He didn't use a condom, nothing was planned, he called me a wh*** and hit my face and I


It's so frustrating because I can't find solace or solidarity in being a rape victim because I'm not one, but I can't get over the regret either and I feel so worthless and awful. How can I heal from this?

200,"3 years ago or so my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. Both my sister and I were living at home at the time and when she found out, she immediately moved out without saying anything to anyone. One day her boyfriend she'd met online just showed and she disappeared the same day without notice and moved across the country. I took care of my mom basically alone as my dad is not suited to that kind of emotional labor. I watched my mom slowly fade away over the course of 2 years and she passed away last January after fighting cancer for the third time. 
My sister and the boyfriend she had moved in with at the time broke up shortly afterwards and she moved back home just a few months after my mom passed. I resented her for what felt like her abandoning me and my mom and her/our cats though I understood why she left as it is a toxic household. Our dad is extremely emotionally abusive and an alcoholic. When he gets angry he breaks things. And he incessantly berates and belittles anyone who does not live up to his standards. It is a stressful place to live and if I had the means to move out I would as well but I wouldnt have left my mom while she was ill and I wouldnt have left without telling her or anyone I was leaving. Before my sister left I had naively believed we were close. It blindsided me when she hadn't confided in me when she was leaving. She told me later she was afraid I'd be angry and use it against her. 
Over the past year I have felt like we've both tried to move past that and be close again. But things at home have gotten difficult recently. 
My dad has a new girlfriend in his life who seems to have taken a hold on him. He met her about six months ago and my dad moved her into the house without much thought to how it would affect my sister and I. It's his house and I get that he doesnt need our permission. But we were given zero notice and this woman just appeared in our house one day. At first she seemed nice enough and to be 100% honest I was relieved to be out of my dads immediate attention for the time being. However I've recently learned that my dad has spent thousands of dollars on this new girlfriend. She is building a house and he used money he got from my grandma's (she passed away about a month after my mom did) life insurance that was meant for his retirement to buy this woman all new appliances and write her checks for thousands of dollars. I know this because after my mom passed and it took weeks for my dad to be able to access her bank account, my dad put my name on his because if anything ever happened to him he wanted to know someone would be able to access the money if we needed it for medical bills.
His new girlfriend, who I like to aggressively refer to as Brenda has taken to telling my dad that my sister and I are cruel to her because we never talk to her. This isnt entirely true though as both my sister and I have made attempts to approach her but neither one of us excel in awkward forced social situations. For a time we both tried to be as friendly as we knew how to be. This was never enough though as we learned when my dads normal patterns started to change. My dad began punishing my sister and I every time brenda told him that we were ignoring her or that we hadn't said goodmorning to her as we were rushing out the door to head to work. This made it much more difficult to be nice to her and she would use this further against us by telling our dad that we were punishing her for his actions. Naturally this made things worse.
 One night I lost my temper when both my dad and Brenda were berating me about being a horrible ungrateful person and for not going to a family get together that her family was involved in. (I don't particularly like my own extended family. And I dont like brenda. And I have intense social anxiety. I decided not to attend this party they were throwing for those reasons.) I told her that at least I wasnt manipulating thousands of dollars out of a lonely widow. (To date my dad has probably spent 80k on this woman in 6 months. He doesnt even make 80k in a year. This was all from money my grandmother left him.)
Things escalated and my dad said I was taking advantage of him as well since I was living under his roof. I went to my room to step away from the situation and try to de-escalate things. Unfortunately our walls are paper thin and I have excellent hearing and I heard brenda actively encouraging my dad to beat me for speaking to her that way. 
My sister on her part has had her own run ins with them as well and the last two weeks have been extremely stressful. I recently got a new job where I should be able to finally move out within a few months of saving and I had been speaking to my sister proactively about getting an apartment together and escaping. We'd talk about how good it would feel to be free of my dad and brenda. We'd talk about never coming home again. Cutting ties with our dad. It was our little spark of fierce hope. It would be easier to pay bills if we pooled our money together, we'd be able to move out much sooner and we could keep our cats together as a family (1 is mine, 2 are hers though I took care of them the 3 years she was gone and have known them their entire lives). I've basically made it through the past few weeks by mentally telling myself that my situation was only temporary. 
The problem is my sister left last night. With no notice. Again. She met another boy online and I guess shes gone to live with him. And she took her two cats. She didnt even give me the chance to say goodbye to them. Or her. I know I should be happy for her. Proud of her. Relieved at least one of us has escaped. But I cant help but feel abandoned again. I cant help but feel those emotions from the past few years swell up again. I resent her for leaving me alone to take care of my mom. I resent her for hurting my mom like that. I resent her for giving me hope. And if I'm being totally honest I resent that shes gotten out when I havent. And f***ing hell I resent her taking the cats without letting me say goodbye to my beautiful fur babies. It's likely I will never see them again. I know very little about the person she left to be with except that hes 4 states away. But I know the things my sister and I have talked about the last few months. And I know enough to know that we both planned on cutting all ties when we left. I just didnt expect to be part of them. 
I dont want to hate my sister. I love her. But I dont know how to let go of the boiling resentment I feel for her right now. I dont know what to do anymore and I feel like I've lost my spark of hope. ",30Jun2018,1

202,"My GF and I have been doing long-distance for a little while and we had less than a year left, like 300 days to be exact, where I was then going graduate from college and then go and move in with her and help support her through graduate school. Things have been great. I stood up to my controlling parents to defend her, I was going to get a great job to support her, and we had just seen each other and were going to see each other for a week at the end of July

This last weekend some shit went down. Friday night, she and her friend who she had been hanging out with a lot lately went out to the bars  to have some fun. I let her go have fun. I checked in a few hours later after the bars closed to make sure she if she needed a ride or anything and I heard nothing. The next morning she texted me that she and I found out that her and her friend met these 3 guys and after the bars closed, went to back to their place to hang out, where her friend and these guys did cocaine and my GF talked with one of them and crashed until 6:30 am.

 I felt a little disrespected, but we talked through it and came to a conclusion that it was wrong and that she would communicate better next time. About an hour after talking about it, she out of nowhere asks for space. I asked why and she said just because. I respected it, but a little while later I noticed that she had taken down our relationship status on Facebook, which was private between us, but still. I asked her about it and she just said “Idk”. 

I was nervous for the next few days and then sure enough she said she was done. Everything before last Friday had literally been perfect and now she’s telling me “distance made her lose the attraction and that I don’t have any money saved up” which isn’t true because I have a few Gs in stock and she has always been about the saying “distance means so little when someone means so much” and was sending me pictures of houses and stuff. The change occurred so randomly and she wouldn’t tell me anything about last weekend. It was reported to me that Saturday night she was seen with a guy who matches the description of one of the guys from Friday night. All of this kills me and it doesn’t make any sense and I don’t know what to do about it.

The guy wants to get physical with her and the girl just want someone to mess around. I have showed her lots of evidence like chats and images which prove how mean they are but all she says to me is ""I know they are bad but I don't know what to do ?"" and when I tell her ""Just stop talking to them or stay away from them"" she says ""Those are y only two friends if I stop talking to them then I won't have any one else to talk to"".

2) She's always confused about her feelings for others: she's dating some other guy(same guy for whom she broke up with me) Now the guy told her how serious he's about her but she told me that she doesn't want to be serious with the guy so asked her to at least tell the guy about how you feel and how you don't want anything serious but some days she would just say she want this guy always some time she talks about how casual she's with him. So I asked her about her imbalanced feelings and she said ""I am confused whether I love this guy or not""

The main problem is whenever I tells her about how bad she's doing with her life and whats the main problems she either replies to ""yeah I'll think about it"" or she'll act like everything is cool now and says ""I'll think whenever I'll have a real problem"".

How can I help her and make her understand everything wrong with her ?

I am asking this here because most of the people around me thinks I am still obsessed with her and Am just jealous with her being with someone else but thats not true I just care about her and really want to help her.

207,"I (23F) was 18 years old when I first started watching her family vlogs on YouTube. Few weeks went by and I was starting to skip through the videos and only watching the parts in which she was on the screen. I knew I really enjoyed looking at her but I didn’t understand how I was feeling at the time. I think I was even shutting down my feelings for her because she was a female and I was expected to only like men. Flash forward to today—I am completely in love with this woman and my fiancé doesn’t mind it one bit. He is actually very supportive and even watches her videos with me. 

Is it bad to be sexually attracted to a YouTuber who is so family oriented? She’s a 36 year old woman with multiple kids but I can’t help it and not touch myself when she’s on my screen.

210,"Help, any advice appreciated. Either about the issues or how I sort them out and get help irl.

I have a long term girlfriend of 4 years, and we are thinking of getting married and starting a family in the next year or so.

I've always been afraid of commitment and it has made me panic a lot. I've messed up and I don't know if it's fixable.

To give you some background on me, I am a bisexual leaning towards gay, I would say 95% but I can handle the sex ok, I just don't have any desires to other women. 

I have previously tried living and dating gay men but had some awful experiences and felt terrible. I don't see that changing ever. I'm quite homophobic, but not in a mean way, just in a anxiety way.

So a few weeks ago I met a guy through an app, we traded handjobs and kissed a bit. 
I thought it was nice. I felt better and not as stressed about the marriage, it made my relationship with the gf much better.

Then I met a second guy and it went a bit too far and we almost had gay sex. I felt bad about that.

I don't want to turn into one of those dirty gays that lurks around toilets and posts dicpics and obsesses about penises. I think that is worst case scenario. I think that happens when you don't have a healthy relationship. But I can't.

I know gay cure therapy doesn't work, or it's illegal now. But I had it before and it worked for me. I'd like more.

I had a therapist but I have trouble talking about my issues so I just avoid it as much as I could and it cost me too much.

Could anyone tell me a step-by-step guide to solving the problem, or will it pass?

214,"Hello boys and girls,

I am 20 years old and last few years i have made quite a few bad choices and now I am depressed and for all that time I have also been pretty anti-social so I lost my circle of friends.

I've decided to change my life, instead of laying down and letting myself getting F\*\*\*\*ed by life, now I will ride the hell out of life.

So, I am depressed I got not friends, I got no education, I live with my mother and my brother, I love a girl which has a boyfriend but she likes me but things there are very complicated and that is fueling so much on the bad side even tho she likes me too anyways fuck her...

I spend my time at my day job decent pay not enough not a job I want to do for too long and also there is no steps to go up the ladder in this job.

I've always wanted to be a pilot and I will achieve that.

Now let me ask you, If you have been in this kind of a situation or similar give me your side of the story lets share a little bit that way I can extract the best out of each one of you and make myself invincible!!! Hahaha :P

What do you think I should be doing instead of sitting at home and playing video games smoking weed(since recently) smoking a pack of cigarettes a day and also not training anything like gym, martial arts(used to for a long time).

What do you think is the stairwell I need to take, which steps, do I got and get my education sorted while working this job(gives me a lot of free time to study while at work) or should I go into something that I love doing which for me is any extreme sport anything that provides adrenaline.

Where should I start? To get to the Ultimate me how do I find who I am? How do I f\*\*k life? 

Any advice? 

Thank you very much for reading, I have written this in a direct and simple way I got a weakness and that is that I do not know what I want most of the time that is why probably the text above will be confusing for some of you and yes it is pretty general.

221,"Alright, so I was fired yesterday out of the blue at a job I had just started a week and a half prior. In early to mid June I had quit my previous job and I was in the search for a new one. I won't go into why I quit that job, but just know that there were reasons. My previous job was my first line cook job at an occasionally busy Greek diner. Mainly breakfast, some lunch, but for the most part I was working by myself on the grill and egg stations towards the end. I was there for roughly a year and a half. I picked it up quickly and I was doing very well, despite how hectic it could be. I worked Memorial Day basically just me and one other person and the place was swamped. Just know it wasn't the work load that made me leave that place. It was management. Shit, it's almost always poor management. 

Fast forward to this new job. I got a job at a cafe as a cook. It's a very tiny place. It mostly caters to local business men/women during their lunch hours and before going into work. It does get busy, but it was absolutely nothing compared to the diner. I thought I was doing well. I learned the menu quickly, it was about a quarter the size of the diners. I made limited mistakes, but the mistakes that I made just happened to be in front of the owner. They were stupid mistakes that anyone could make when it gets busy (i.e. forgetting to put bacon on a sandwich, dropping a sandwich because it was the first time I wrapped food the way they did). The owner would come into the kitchen and just throw everything off, she couldn't handle the pressure like my previous owner did. Barking orders and just making things worse. 

Here's where the possible legal issue comes in:

Well, yesterday I got fired because it was a ""trial period"" and because of my ""physical limitations"" they didn't think I could handle it long term. I was told their ""trial period"" was a ""trial day"" during the interview. That would have been my first day. After that day, they officially offered me the position and I thought I was past their bullshit ""trial"". They gave me some bullshit about how they can keep me on the payroll and let me know if anything changes, but they have some other cooks they want to try out. I didn't mention anything during the interview, because I don't let it affect my work, but I had back surgery several years ago. I stupidly mentioned it to the cook I worked with, the one who actually fired me. 

The ""physical limitations"" comment makes me think they took my back surgery as a weakness and decided to cut ties with me. I worked a year and a half at the diner, yes there were days that I worked and my back was just a mess - but I did it. I pushed myself for the first time in any career. They didn't even give me a chance, even though I felt and was told that I was doing far better than they expected. Multiple times I was told how good I was doing. Multiple times I was told that it wasnt a big deal that I made small mistakes. The ONLY thing I can think of is that they fired me because they didn't think I could handle it due to my back. 

My friends are telling me to talk to a lawyer because they say it is an illegal firing. Several friends said the same thing. I'm not sure it is worth it and I'm not sure I even have a case. I didn't tell them during the interview, but I didn't tell them because I legit think it didn't matter. I did it at the diner, I could have easily done it there. 

Any opinions? Any questions (I think I included everything)?

This might get buried in this sub-Reddit, but at least I asked for assistance and didn't just let it go like I have done to things in the past. ",30Jun2018,1
222,"I applied to work for night shifts, I checked my rota/work schedule and I’m not noted to work nights till 3 weeks from now. 

I don’t drive so I spoke to the general manager and he has already altered my shifts to correlate with public transport so I could get home for the time I have to work the late afternoons and also get to work in the morning but I don’t think he understands that it’s impossible for me to get to work at 6:45am because the earliest transport from the nearest train station is at 6:20 but the bus to get to the train station doesn’t start till 7am, the walking distance from my house to the train station is 1 hour. There is a direct bus from my place to the city but it starts at 6:30am (arriving at the city for 7:15am).

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over this feeling? I don't know why I went a year without thinking of her and now all of a sudden I can't stop.

Just to add to this, I had started to date a girl during my stay in Canada but I broke it off after only two months because I wasn't getting any feelings for her and I didn't want to waste her time. ",30Jun2018,1
240,"So a couple of people asked me to update my previous [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8svdwt/is_asking_me_to_leave_my_house_for_a_few_days/). Essentially my housemate asked me to leave my own house (I own the place) for a few days as she moved out because she didn't want to ""disturb"" me. She had a followup message saying that she didn't want to see or deal with me as she was packing her stuff.

Anyways! She moved out today and boy was it something. Firstly, as per everyone suggestions, I either moved all my stuff into my room or took a picture of it to make sure I had evidence should she try to take something. The only things I left in the common space were small dumb things that no one would really try to take....you'd think! She stepped out for a short while and when she was gone I went glancing around the space and guess what, she'd taken my things. 

I confronted her when she got back and we yelled a little bit - I know these things are mine and I've got the receipt to prove it, can I have them back please. She responded that she didn't care if I had a receipt, they were hers, and she slammed her door so loud I'm sure the place shook. At this point I was like, aight, I'm just gonna not engage because she's straight up crazy. I sent her a pretty long but polite message including screenshots of my receipts saying hey I have proof these are mine (as a side note - we had an argument before where I told her she should probably start saving her receipts and she told me saving receipts was stupid and people our age don't need to do that....HAH), give me my stuff back, and by the way you've left some things that are yours which you might not realize. At this point I think she understood that if she kept acting like a psycho she would be, in essence, screwed, so she changed her tune real quick. Said she was sorry and she'd give them back but thought they were hers, blahblahblah. I expected them to be left out as I didn't want to go rooting through her things for them.

Today was fun as I got to watch her try and pack her mountains of things into her car - she took pretty much everything that wasn't bolted down or 100&amp;#37; mine. So think like, old paper plates and cups, tiny shitty plastic shot glasses, misc junk we had in little containers in the communal area, just dumb things. Some stuff that she had bought for the place didn't fit into the car and she couldn't take it with her, so rather than giving it to me to use (think dumb things like cutlery holders or placemats) I think she dumped it. And in the end she still ended up taking the small things she admitted were mine :/ 

The moral of this story is don't move in with crazy!  I think I still have to ask for advice, so, anyone have advice on how to vet potential housemates for cray before they move in?

241,"I’m 15 years old, and since I was born my family has made me go to Turkey to visit my family. I love my family, but not to the point that I want to see them so frequently. Every single holiday I get, the entirety of it is spent with them. My youngest cousin is 22, and even then there is a very large lack of common interests. Everyone else is 40+. My dad stays back home, so it’s just me, my mom, and the extended family. I’m a teenager, with a lot of school friends, I’m pretty social and practically require almost constant dialogue with a friend so I can be content. However everyone else is back at home spending time with each other, and so nobody really talks to me until at least 10 pm. After that I have to stay up extremely late just so I can get some dialogue with my friends, before going to sleep and waiting at least 10 hours until I can get in contact with them again.

I brought my Playstation over with me, however after a certain point it gets boring, after about a day actually. After that I have to go out with my family or something, which is alright, but just feels like more alone time than anything. 

I’ve tried every single thing to try and cope with the time, if not actually enjoy it. But after having gone to turkey so many times, I’m exhausted, bored and lonely.

I voiced this complaint to my parents last year. I told them I’m willing to stay alone back home as long as I don’t have to spend much time in turkey, if at all. But I was criticized for not wanting to spend all of it with my relatives. I was told by my father “wherever your mother goes, you’re right there with her”. Unfortunately, my mom wants to spend her whole summer with my relatives, which is understandable for her, just not for me. I learnt to cook, took up responsibilities and etc. just so I might have a chance at staying at home and can spend time with my friends. But to no avail. 

In the end, I’m left feeling sad, lonely and extremely bored. And nothing to do about it. I feel like I’m about to lose it and I need advice on what to do.",30Jun2018,2

But..she is only thinking about herself lately. Even when talking with someone else who is sad about something at that moment, she starts to talk about how sad she is about whatever issue she has and how high sensitive she is etc etc.. it’s the same over and over again.

I want to say something about it because i feel it is starting to annoy me more and more (also because most of her problems are self-created), but i can’t think of anything that doesn’t sound sarcastic or angry and i don’t want an arguement..

252,"I hope this is the right place to post this. Please direct me to the correct place if not! I need advice and help, and honestly just someone to talk to.

Oh where to begin?

A little backstory, I hail from the south originally and I moved to Northern Minnesota for work last year. Ive finally started to make new friends and get to know people on a more personal level. Im finally happy again! I struggled with depression for a while since I was, for the first time really, all by myself. Fast forward to May, 19th. Some girls I work with at a small hospital invited me to a little bonfire at one of their houses and I am more than happy to go, finally im making friends! The night starts off fine, we are sitting by the fire drinking beer and laughing and talking about everything under the moon. I start to get pretty drunk and ask if I can just crash on the couch because Im far too gone to be driving like this, and in Minnesota they don't mess around when it comes to DUI's. The girl who owns the place has no problem with me sleeping there and so I retire for the evening.

A couple of hours go by and I start to have a sexual dream, its so real and feels so great! I notice it starts to feel too real and I wake up to the owner of the home on top of me riding me. I don't have sex with anyone without a condom unless we are in a serious relationship and trust each other, and I didnt bring any because I had no intention of having sex. I try to get her off of me but I can barely move, I'm a rather large guy and am not weak by any means, but for some reason I could not get her off of me. I ask her to please stop because I do not want this, but she wont. She rides me until I finish inside her, and she simply gets up and goes to her room. I try to get up and get my clothes, because fuck this I'm not staying here now. Still I can barely move, I have never felt like this before. All I had to drink was beer and a few shots of Tennessee Honey, and that is not nearly enough to get me to black out. The only thing I can think of is maybe I have been drugged. I know that seems like a farfetched idea, but I remember going inside to take a piss and leaving my drink in the cup holder in my chair. When I came back and finished that one along with a couple more beers is when things start to get fuzzy and I get extremely drunk feeling. I know me, and I have never felt that way being drunk on beer. 

Since Im unable to move I just try to sleep it off. The next day I wake up and leave early in the morning. I wasn't sure what happened or if any of it was real. All I knew is that I just wanted to go home and shower and go to sleep. All day I felt groggy and sick to my stomach, No doubt a hang over. She texts me later on in the day asking if we had sex. I told I wasn't sure what happened but I definitely remember something happening. The next day I finally start to remember things here and there and I definitely remember her riding me. So I text her and tell her to get Plan B and Ill pay her back for it, because I came inside of her and we need to fix it asap. I told her friend D what happened and she gets invovled and takes her some pills. S(the host of the party) proceeds to freak out on me for getting her friend involved. The only reason I told D was because she knew something was wrong with me, so I told her everything that happened. S starts blaming me for the whole thing, saying she didn't force me to have sex(fucking really?) with her. We go back and forth about this for a bit and finally everything resolves. She takes the pill, at least claims to have done so, and we dont talk for a while.

Fast forward to June, 9th. Im working a midnight shift at work, and so is S. She comes to me asks if I want to go out for a smoke. I join her and she starts talking about that night, then she drops the bomb. ""C(me), Im pregnant"". I instantly get sick to my stomach. Im stunned, I dont really freak out I have no issues processing what I just heard. She tells me its not 100&amp;#37; mine because she had slept with 2 other guys around the same time as me. I say ""ok, what are our options, what is the next step?"" She assumes I mean abortion and starts in with ""Well Im keeping it! why would you suggest such a thing?"" When I totally didn't suggest at all, which hopefully gives you and idea of how things will go from here. Throughout the whole ordeal ive been co-operative with her, trying to figure out when we can do the paternity test. on the June, 22nd she had her first dr's visit. He told her she was 6 weeks and 4 days on that day. I started doing the math and at first it didn't add up to me, there was almost 2 weeks time between when we were together and the date the dr was telling her. In my excitement I forgot about the whole 2 week period with conception. Pretty much take away 2 weeks because they tell you how far along you are based off of your last period. I told her congratulations but there was no way it was mine and I stopped talking to her. For the next 2 days she sent me message after message calling me a piece of shit and dead beat and anything else you can imagine. She sent me a message one day and told me that the dr. told her she most likely conceived on the 21st of May. 

Now I'm not sure how accuartely they can narrow down the exact day, but I do know that there is usually a 1-5 day window of when the conception is possible. The 21st is a very conveinient day obviously, because it puts me within a day and a half of when all this went down. I know she is just trying to get in my head with her statements, well it worked. I went back and re did the math, took off the 2 weeks and sure enough that puts the 21st as the possible day. Once again I'm devestated, I thought I was free and clear but I may not be. She won't let me attend any appointments with her so I can not ask my own questions and hear from the doctor this information, so I have to hear it from her, and there is a good chance its all skewed to make me look like the father. Keep in mind there are 2 other guys who are possibly the father, and I have no clue if she is speaking to them the way she is me. After doing the math the second time I told her I want to do a pateranity test asap, which would be next week. Apparantley the 8 week test cost $1700 which I am more than willing to split the bill on, but she refuses to do so. She says we are going to wait until full term because she doesn't want to spend the money for this test, and she says they are not 100&amp;#37; accurate. Ever since I admitted that, yes there is a chance it could be mine, she has treated me like shit. She will not let me attend appointments, she will not agree to the testing, she is extremely rude to me in every message or interaction. She is making this feel like it is my fault when the only fault I had was trusting someone enough to let me sleep on their god damn couch!

Hell are these other guys receiving this kind of treatment? are they even aware of what is going on at all? Fuck man, I am literally at my wits end with this. I can't eat without getting sick, I dont know the last time I had any quality sleep. Whats worse is I have found another girl who really likes me and we have been dating for the past month or so and now I have to tell her what is going on and hope to god she fucking stays. I have feelings for this girl super hard, and I am terrified its all about to go away, and I'm not sure if I can deal with it right now!

I dont know why I wrote this, and I do aplogize for the long winded read. It has been cathartic typing this out, so to those of you who made it this far I appreciate you. For anyone who has any advice they could give, or encouraging words I would be very greatful. Some of what I say may sound like rambling and I apologize if it doesnt all make sense. Any advice is welcome.

254,"Hi there,

So I'm looking to buy a used car for quite a while now and I stumbled upon a 2011 Audi A4 with only 88,000 KM on it. By going through the pictures it looks like it's in perfect condition, the fishyness comes in with the price of $5500. I looked around and a car like that goes for around $13,000 to $15,000, do I decided to shoot an email and see what I get. 

In response I get this,

""Well, let me just jump right into it. I just got divorced and the vehicle was awarded to me in our divorce. I have a low price ($5,500) because I want to sell it before July 6th ideally I have a deployment coming up and would prefer to have my mother who is taking care of my children have the cash instead. 

Now, a few words about this 2011 Audi A4 2.0T Quattro Premium Plus is in perfect working condition, with nothing mechanically wrong - like new! This vehicle has 88,246 KM, used just to cruise. No accident history, clear title, no dents or dings and no scratches. Transmission type: Automatic. If you decide to buy it, you'll receive all the papers, owner manual, keys, a buy-sell contract already signed by me and the clear title.""

My main question would be, is this legit? Also what documents should I look through to check if they are telling the truth?

Thank You in advance.

260,"I’m not sure how long this will be, I’m sorry if it’s too long.

Basically, I’ve always been a talented musician, and music will always be a part of my life. However, I’m starting to question my decision, because becoming a musician (for any reason outside of being a teacher) can be a very risky career in many ways.

I made a mistake on my college application after I graduated from high school and opted to go to my local community college instead of an expensive, high-end music conservatory. This might have been the best mistake I’ve ever made in my life. I never knew how incomplete of a musician I was until I came here, and my current piano teacher is trying to fix me in every way he can. 

I would like to mention that my questioning has nothing to do with doubts about my musical ability, because I am super fortunate talent-wise. I just don’t think it’s smart to pursue a degree in music composition. Because of this, I have been losing motivation to practice.

As for other careers, something I have always been interested in is metoerology. That would probably be my second choice as for my profession. Some other options would be a geographer, a contractor, or even a designer.

The only person I’ve told was my significant other, and I’m afraid to bring it up to my parents until I’ve thought about it for enough time. Can you guys give me any advice about ways I can make a desicion or talk about it with others? Is it too late to switch?

I would be open to teaching piano part time to young students if I did choose a different career.

TL;DR: I am currently pursuing a degree at my local community college, but I’m questioning becoming a musician rather than something else interesting to me; metoerology.",30Jun2018,3
261,"I'm 32, M, 10 months sober, and have been depressed for as long as I can remember. Not the ""my gf dumped me"" type but the ""I should feel good and physically can't"" kinda depression. This lead to a 12 year ritual of getting drunk every single night....I can literally only remember 5 days of not drinking, one which involved  a nice sized dose of mushrooms. 

Mushrooms were one of the only substances that gave me absolute unadulterated organic feelings of happiness. Microsdosing for the short term I'm sure will work. The long term results are what confuses me since from what I understand once you stop taking them you're back to square one.

Antidepressants I have taken in the past just made me numb. I feel like they were essentially masking anything that was wrong as opposed to fixing. Also I honestly think the effects aren't as understood as Drs make them out to be. Yet I hear great things from small percent of people in my life they have worked for

In the past I have taken a few
 -Prozac
 -Effexor
 -Strattera
 -There was another I forget the name

Blood tests seem to be a fairly rational yet veeeery overlooked routes to take for curing depression (well with the Drs I have gone to over the years).  My Dr now isn't that great but I have to work with him because my insurance is CRAP.

I do exercise, ten miles a day 5 days a week on a bike. Eat a real food diet. take B-100 and D3 almost daily, quit smoking a month ago, Tried getting out of my comfort zone MULTIPLE times, was doing talk therapy every week coupled with AA (4x a week) for months until it just got kinda redundant. I'm also not in any way suicidal....just meh

So my questions....are there routes to take before taking pills? Should I just take it and try it? Has an undiagnosed issue with thyroid, adrenal glands, poor testoserone, etc cause anyone years of depression anxiety, and if so how did fixing them help? Maybe a food allergy held you back? Are there commonly overlooked blood work tests that i could address? Are SSRIs even that effective or just a placebo for most people? Has microdosing or SSRI helped you in the long run?

I am going into this knowing every person is different just looking for well, opinions from personal experience. Unbiased (if they exist anymore?) studies would also be helpful Thanks :)",30Jun2018,1
262,"Okay, so I broke up with my girlfriend about 2 weeks ago. We had been dating for about 5 months at that point. 

We weren't really good friends before we starting liking each other. Even though we both had classes together and were in the same clubs for the past 2.5 years, we barely talked in real life until January 2018 (senior year of highschool) when we both were at a volunteer event for school. I guess I didn't really seem interested in her before because I always thought of her as emotionless because she didn't show that much emotion when I talked to her before. I remember my friends and I jokingly said she was like a robot because she didn't show emotion. 

So after that volunteer event, we started texting each other a lot, and we got into some deep conversations about our lives. She told me about her own problem with talking to strangers and making new friends and how she was worried when college starts because she might have trouble making new friends at first. I told her about how I had issues with myself and how I thought that no one took me seriously. She was the only person I had admitted this to at this point. 

I started having a crush on her after this conversation, and so did she. Our friends could tell we liked each other, and after a month, we started dating. For the next 4 months, I really worked on my self-esteem and how I presented myself,  solving the issue that I had admitted to her. I told a lot of people about this problem too, and I got more mature and gain much more confidence in myself. 

However, I guess I started to subconciously notice that she still had some confidence issues in herself. 

Some examples include: she was always indecisive in choosing places to eat, even after I said that it was her turn to decide. I was always the one who asked to hangout. 90% of the time I was the one who decided what we would do when we hang out. We usually watched action movies or play videogames, and when I asked her if she had any other activities or ideas for us to do, she would just say, ""I don't know."" Also, I noticed how she's a little uncomfortable to talk to teachers. One time, we were together to ask our English teacher to let us make up an essay after school. We were walking together in the hallway, but as we entered the classroom, she stopped by the door and I walked in alone. I didn't realize she wasn't in the room until I was halfway to the teacher's desk. I walked back outside and encouraged her to walk in with me. 

Because of reasons like those, I guess I started to see her differently. We stopped having serious converstations and we stopped taking each other seriously, so I broke up with her. She said she lowkey saw it coming and wasn't surprised. At first, I believed that we were just too different to be in a relationship. We didn't have that many mutual friends and usually never hung out in groups because of that reason. 

But after thinking about it, I realized that that wasn't the problem. Now, I believe the problem was that she has self-confidence problems. Its not severe, but its still apparent to me.

Okay, so should I tell her this? I know I'll sound like an asshole if I do, but I feel that she won't entirely fix this problem if I don't tell her. I still care about her as a friend, and I don't want her to feel awkward or have trouble making friends in college when it starts in 2 months.

Thanks.

I'm a girl who's family is from a particular African country. Due to a history of abuse and infighting, the only family I have regular contact with are my mother and my aunt.

Growing up I disliked eating the traditional food from my country. I straight up refused to eat it. Nowadays I can stomach it, but not without gagging a little. 

I also don't have the same fondness for other aspects of the culture that my mother has. I think the traditional patterns and clothing are beautiful, but with no family weddings, birthdays or celebrations to attend, I would never get the chance to wear it. I can't dance and the music just doesn't speak to me (it's catchy but it doesn't feel the same as when I listen to music that I like).

My family is from a particular tribe within the country which has a language that is slowly decreasing use. My mother has been pushing me to learn it for a few months now and gets frustrated when I say I don't want to. Not because I hate it, but because I will never use it. I have no family to speak with, I have no reason to ever travel to Nigeria again and I just don't see it as necessary. I like learning languages but what frustrates her more is that I choose to learn French and Japanese instead of her native language, which she sees as a rejection of my heritage.

One other big problem is the way I talk. I've had problems with it before, especially with classmates but what really hurt me is that my mother said to me one day, that I don't talk like someone who lives where I do and with the family that I do. I told her that I always talk like this and she told me that it was because I wanted to. 

I guess she was implying that I'm trying to be someone that I'm not. Some posh girl who thinks she's better than others black people because I don't talk like them. I'm not. I do what to change the way I talk, not because I'm trying to impress anyone, but because I either mumble my words or I'm too loud when I'm trying to get my point across. I want to better myself, but for *me*.

I've spoken about this before, and about how I don't feel black enough due to my hobbies and interests and character. But I like antique tea sets and furniture and watching Downton Abbey and calligraphy and drawing maps, reading about architecture. None of these things are inherently black and yet I love them all. I feel embarrassed sometimes when I tell people about my hobbies because they're boring and not what you'd expect of a black girl. 

I know it sounds like I hate myself but truly I'm not. I'm not ashamed of where my ancestors came from, or my skin colour or my curly hair. But what I am ashamed of, is the fact that I can't live up to my mother's expectation of this patriotic Nigerian who throws herself into every aspect of the culture.

I think the biggest problem of all is that I would like to change my name before starting university. I came up with a first and second name which I adore but when I suggested the last names King and Aldridge or just keeping the one I already have, she got angry because I didn't want to change it to her family name.

I don't hate it at all, in fact I think it's a beautiful Nigerian name, but it doesn't suit the first or second ones. I don't like the way they sound together or the way it looks written down. I know I'd probably get used to it over time, but I feel like there would be this feeling of dissatisfaction and regret if I changed it to that. She sees it as me distancing myself from my culture and me being ashamed of myself and of her. I've said everything I can to convince her that I'm not but she's still disappointed.

I know that when I do eventually change my name she's gonna tell me the exact same thing and bring all this up against me. I know that I will cave and try to please her by changing it back to hers and I don't want to do that. I've come to the conclusion that the only way to save myself from the hurt that I will cause us both is if I stop caring but I don't know how to go about doing that.

Any advice?",30Jun2018,5
266,"Some of my friends weren't adding much value to my life and when it comes time for them to be dependable people, they're not there for me. They talk a lot of shit behind other people's backs, and about their circumstances which seem a lot like my own. I didn't feel good hanging around them, but I have stuck with them so far because sometimes the banter is fun. However, I slowly cut them out of my life and from social media, and a lot of them have noticed when I started distancing myself. I feel an immense sense of guilt over this and can't help thinking if I made the right decision or not. I also feel like an immense piece of shit and a bad person for doing so and feel like I can't detach myself from the previous good memories I shared with these friends, but lately we've just been very different people and I'm growing out of these friendships.

267,"Hi guys, Pnssy Destroyer here.

This is going to be pretty long but I'll try to make it as short as possible:

I'm contemplating dropping out of college and I'm not sure if my decision is a right one. I'm in community college but I'm not just a dumb student. I was an overachiever in my previous school years with a 4.2 GPA, ECs, sports, academic medals, gifted education, you name it. I chose CC because I was taking CC courses during highschool for free to finish my GED early, and the agreement was for me to finish the rest of my prereqs until I transfer to state uni. 

Right now I feel like all the classes I'm taking right now are just slowing me down from what I want to be. I run two small side businesses (freelance designer and Ecommerce) but I never have enough time to get to them and I feel miserable. I don't see the value in taking these dumb irrelevant courses (Calc 2-4, Physics, Chem 1-2) when I'm a Computer Science major. The demand for me to study has started to wane on me as I slowly see the real world's irrelevance to a degree. I have also been shocked by how useless I feel when my job applications were rejected, simply because I lack 3+ years of experience or it just isn't ""good enough"". I'm frustrated by the fact that I have all these demanding courses that take up my time and energy, but I know in the end will not leverage me any better than my fellow peer with the same degree. In other words, I don't see the point in spending more money and time on this.

The other thing is my personal life. I live in a dysfunctional family where my parents constantly fight each other. One of them wants to take control of all my decisions in life and only values me because of what I can bring to the family and not unconditionally. The other enables it and keeps venting out the frustrations of the other. I can't handle living here often when I try to perform and meet the demands of both parents. I am asking r/advice because I know they'll mock me for even coming up with the idea of dropping out. They don't value my hobbies either, saying my business ventures are ""too risky"" and I should focus on school more when in fact I'm slowly not caring about it. I was threatened once to be disowned simply because I disagreed with their religious beliefs and that I should be kicked out of the house. I have planned running away before, but without regular income, license, and personal documents I don't have much safety in it either. 

I have had depression and suicidal thoughts before because of the way my life was. I'm over it though, but the constant fear of getting yelled and to lock myself in my room whenever my parents fight is one thing. I suffer from low self esteem because I would always be told it was my fault for whatever happened in the house, when in fact it is also their problem for contributing to my confused childhood. I'm okay though, but I'm having recurring thoughts about one day running away somewhere, and it's getting worse that my performance in school is affected. Sometimes I wish my life would have been better if I had a more supporting family, but we can't always have that you know.

Conclusion, I really don't know what I should be doing in my life. I'm on the grip of running away once I get my license in July and going on a road trip out somewhere and living in my friend's dorm and then finding a job and I can finally be on my own away from this place. I'm not yet a mature adult (I'm 19), but I am really asking what to do. I'm just lost and I have so many things on my mind. 

Thanks guys",30Jun2018,3

269,"So, I was talking to my dad who is a businessman, and he was mentioning that if someone comes from his caste/ community he would consider them “more honest”. It makes me sick to think of someone not getting a job because of the community they were born into. 

This is not the first sentiment they’ve expressed along these lines. They have previously stated that they only want me to marry within this community, but I’m 18 and that’s far away. There are more examples, but none as direct as this.

I pointed out to them as strongly as I could how wrong it was and they laughed at me and said I was a child who didn’t know any better and that I’d learn. 

Is there any way of changing their minds? Is it even worth the effort?",30Jun2018,2
270,"I live in Virginia, United States

Hello! I need some legal advice on what's going on with my brother at the house. Okay, I would like to start with a bit of a backstory. My brother is schizophrenic and has lived with me and my mom all of his life. I am 20s, he is in his 30s and my mom is in her later years. My mother relies heavily on his income, my income and her own income to make ends-meet at home and she tries her best to help him. Roughly 2 years ago, a man name ""Allen"" who worked with services for in-home services (I’ll just called it TS) came for my brother for six months, and eventually got into an argument with my mother. He then referred (mostly out of spite) to social services who got deeply involved and then everyone agreed (unfortunately) to get mental health services from a local mental health facility (we were with the upstairs division at first, they were nice). This led to them performing services that offered my brother medication every morning to help him cope with his symptoms. Eventually, up into around last year (she was coming for roughly 2 years after the incident with Allen and before the upcoming incident) a woman who goes by the name of “S” came by and all was well. But last year, around June, she went and called social services on my brother and told us that we were unfit to take care of him and that the state should take him into custody and out of the house because he ended up peeing on his clothes (long-story there but we went through our best to help him). Eventually that fell through and she got into an argument with my family, and eventually that led to my brother having his check signed over to a new Payee and him stopping the peeing on his clothes (he did that several times before) and I have tried to get more in-depth with helping my brother. “S” (this is his case manager btw) stated that she would help him by taking him out and spending time with him outside of the house.

This worked out for roughly the last year and she has came by and have tried to spend time with him, but recently, the nurse who comes in the morning has refused to give him his medication (we don’t know why, but she states that “She is not allowed to anymore"") and instead gives it to my mother. He refused to take it for my mom and so I helped out my brother and have started giving him the medication. But just recently, “S” and the doctor who comes by to check on him said they want to force him into a group home because he only sleeps all day or plays games. The problem is that he doesn't urinate on himself anymore (for a year+), he takes a shower and he generally gets around and does stuff around the house. But the doctor and his case manager wishes to go over our head (my mother and mine, and even my brother's) and force him into an assisted living facility when he has family that cares for him and loves him. I'm planning to speak to the supervisor on monday to see what I can do, but last time I spoke to him (during the first argument with “S” where she lashed out at us), he didn't really do anything. I really don't want my brother taken out of the house, but it feels like “S” and the doctor (the doctor is the only one on the team, and has even admitted that he has improved over the year(s)) but they still want to work together to remove him from the home and go over our heads. Is there anything that me and my mother can do to stop this situation? (we have tried to stop services there and transfer to a case manager upstairs who was alot nicer, and even tried to get him a different case manager who would be able to spend greater time with him or someone to offer services when his current case manager is unavailable, but it has been impossible so far)

TLDR : “S” wants to break up our family even though my brother is doing better and the doctor wants to try to force him into a home against his, and my mother's wishes and basically doesn't care what we think. I've been getting more involved in his life while going to school and the like and doing my best to help. I'm planning to call their supervisors on monday to try to communicate what's going on, but I don't have any faith that it might work out okay and will only cause more problems. What can we do in this situation, especially if their supervisor takes a uncaring attitude? Can I take it higher up the chain regionally? Should I seek a lawyer (hopefully for cheap)?

271,"I honestly have no idea what to do. My grades are slipping, I can hardly take care of myself, and I never remember what's happened to me. You really don't know the value of a single day until you lose many. It's been June 30th for god knows how long, even though it's only been a day, since it can't be anything else and still follow basic logic. I no longer feel hunger, and even pain and emotions are difficult to feel. Hours seem to pass like minutes. I'm running out of options. I think what started it was a seizure I had some number of weeks ago. There were too many people talking at once, and it gave me a mental overload and I began to have multiple seizures. I begged the people to stop, and they just told me to shut up and that I'm not having real seizures, even though they're diagnosed by multiple doctors. That day made my summer pretty much fall apart and the memory loss is getting even worse. I'm absolutely terrified and I don't know what to do.

274,"I started a new job on Monday. The temp who was filling the role was clearly not happy when I arrived. He was on the phone with his agency, complaining loudly about his perceived treatment at our site, and was upset that he “was not told” that he didn’t get the job. When it came time to get his keys (so they could be passed on to me) he wouldn’t hand them over, and the coworker who was there to train me had to accompany him to HR to get the keys back. After finishing up with HR, he made his way to the CEO’s office to do some more complaining. It all made for a very awkward first hour at my new job. Throughout this week of training, I, along with my manager, heard a slew of complaints from the rest of the staff about his tenure; that he was degrading and rude, attended meetings where he misrepresented himself as the person in charge, and basically didn’t do his job. Furthermore, we spent a good portion of the week fixing his mistakes (some of them major - costing us thousands of dollars), picking up his slack, and cleaning up his messes (figuratively and literally). 

The icing on the cake came yesterday. The computer had been acting funky all week. The manager started to look into it, and delete all the crap applications the ex-employee had added to google chrome. Then came the computer history.  Porn. Tons of it. This guy had been browsing porn for much of the day, everyday. It was no wonder nothing else was getting done. 

As a creepy/bizarre aside, prior to my arrival on Monday, he was looking up porn/images of a famous woman from his era who shares my unusual first name. When we’d met that morning, he insisted he “knew my name from somewhere ...” as I insisted that we hadn’t met before. Seeing what he was looking up just before I got there straight-up gave me the creeps. (Not to mention - I shook his hand. Yuck.) 

The manager, steaming mad - especially after the week we’d just had, fixing his careless mistakes - called his temp agency manager. If he wasn’t going to be fired before, I’m pretty sure he will be fired now. 

Maybe I’m just paranoid because of the surge in workplace violence, or maybe it’s because he acted so hostile toward me when I arrived on Monday - but I’m growing anxious from fear of retaliation. Especially since I’m sure his anger from not getting the full-time job will be compounded by losing his temp agency job AND the embarrassment of his porn viewing. 

It’s a small facility, he knows my schedule, knows the ins/outs of entrances and security (which isn’t all that secure) and knows the parking situation. Also, my office door must remain closed &amp; locked at all times bcs of the nature of my job, but doesn’t allow me to see who’s outside when answering the door. 

Any suggestions on what I should do? I’ll be working completely alone. I hope our conversation can help others avoid/identify workplace violence before it happens. 

TL;DR - the temp found out he didn’t get the job when I showed up for my first day at my new job Monday. He wasn’t happy - and took his complaints to his agency, HR, and the CEO. By Friday it was realized that the extent of his eff-ups at our site will likely cost him his agency job, as well. He was already so mad at us when he was leaving that now I’m afraid of retaliation.

277,"me and my friend, 'louise', have been close for about 3 years now. i consider her my best friend, definitely. around may, we started bickering a lot more, just about stupid things.

i guess the final straw was when she asked for me to give her back a birthday present she had given me. i was confused at first, but i said i'd give it back. this sort of led to another fight, as she thought i was being rude/was mad about her asking, and i said she was overreacting and i'd give her the gift back if that was what she wanted.

she then went on to apologize for overreacting, and saying that she hasn't been feeling good recently. this is where i acted like a complete idiot. basically for the entirety of 2018, i have been struggling with my own mental health issues (bipolar- i just started therapy+medication in case anyone suggests that), and i didn't even stop to consider that she was attempting to open up to me about hers. i interpreted her saying she 'didn't feel good' as in, she didn't feel good about our friendship. i talked to another mutual friend, james, about what had happened between louise and i. after i explained to him, james said that he 'was getting the vibe that louise didn't want to be friends with me anymore', and louise just didn't have the heart to tell me. i agreed, thinking that all the bickering and her asking for a gift back supported this. 

i never responded to louise's apology, and we haven't spoken since. at first, i was feeling really angry at louise. i was mad she asked for a gift back, mad she kept picking fights, etc. i struggle a lot with feeling like i'm a burden on my friends, and that they don't truly like me, and i think this contributed a lot to the anger. but, recently, i'm beginning to think she had every right to do all of those things, and i was a terrible friend to her, and i abandoned her when she was just about to open up and was turning to me for support.

i'm not sure how to go about apologizing for this. i did attempt to call her last week, and she didn't pick up, and instead texted james asking him to 'check in on me' himself. is this her way of saying she doesn't want to talk to me anymore? do i text her instead?

i'm sorry for such a long post, i realize this all probably seems really petty to you guys, but i haven't got anyone else to speak to. 

TLDR; my best friend was seemingly turning to me for mental support, i didn't get the hint, someone else told me she didn't want to be friends with me anymore, we haven't spoken in a month- i'm an idiot.",30Jun2018,1
278,"Okay, so I fear I may have been a royal freaking idiot. 

So basically, I've had some of the actual worst luck with girls. I've been rejected, friendzoned, led on, ghosted, you name it. Despite being in my 20s, I've never been on a date, had sex or even kissed a girl before. Meanwhile, all my friends have paired up no problem and now no longer see me because they're always with their significant others. They're always making fun of me due to my persistent unending bad luck in love.

Naturally, this has resulted in me getting a little desperate.

I went to an illicit massage parlor nearby. It was my second time there, and I have another friend who is similarly unlucky (though not as unlucky as me - he did used to have a girlfriend), who goes to this place regularly.

So I got my massage. Massage itself was wonderful. But at the end, she said I was ""too young"" to get a ""happy ending"" (a handjob). I tried to convince her I was in my 20s, but she wouldn't believe I was over 18. By the way, I'm often mistaken for being OLDER than I am.

In the heat of the moment, I wasn't even fucking thinking. I just wanted to get jacked off. So what do I do? I give her my fucking DRIVING LICENSE. She reads it for AGES, obviously trying to read the fine print, getting glasses out and everything...... then TYPES SOMETHING INTO HER PHONE.

I did not get my actual license stolen, I still have it, but I fear she may have entered all the details on the license including driving license ID and my address into her phone. If she has, what is she going to do with it? Is she going to hire a HITMAN on me or something???

Only afterwards did I realize what a colossal fool I'd been. What happens if she DOES have my information? What can she do with it? Could she hire a hitman? Somehow get my bank details too? Put points on my license? How do I fix this if she does now have my license details?????",30Jun2018,1

Basically my friends and I live in three separate cities. The last time my one friend was in town she sat me down and invited me to a road trip in France with her and our other friend. She wouldn’t stop talking about how much fun we’d have together and how excited she was. After she left she got super busy and I hadn’t heard anything about the trip. I didn’t mention it, assuming that it wasn’t going to happen or would happen later.

Cut to now, and both of my friends start asking their twitter followers for food recommendations in France for their upcoming trip (the same trip they invited me to). I instantly feel like I missed an email or text thread and check to make sure...nothing. They planned the trip without me. 

I am not much for emotions or confrontations, but I expect people to be up front with me. So while I would normally just ignore this and try to rationalize it in my mind this time I want to know what I may have done wrong...and also let them know that it’s not ok to go back on their word.

289,"This week at my summer job I met this kid. We both work at this summer camp and will be seeing each other multiple times... hopefully. At first he was resistant to going to bed on time and talking. I eventually got some things out of him, some really bad red flags.

He talked about how he would kill animals like skunks and other rodents on his farm with his gun and grandpa. It didn't seem too out of place because he didn't seem too put off by it, and I wouldn't either because he isn't killing for the sake of killing. He mentioned how he was in a hospital and saw a guy who failed to commit suicide by shotgun. He went into graphic detail like how the dude didn't have eyes. He said it still haunts him. He also mentioned he sees a young, bloodied girl baring the face of his suicidal girlfriend every day. Sometimes when he is in the woods, alone, or waking up he sees this girl. He knows it's not his girlfriend or a ghost, he has tried to kill the girl with a machete before. I was really concerned that he breaks open razor blades and cuts himself a little bit.

The really bad stuff he mentioned was that his mom was abusive, he lived with an abusive step-dad, and has attempted suicide three different times. The main thing he is worried about is not being with his girlfriend. At camp he cannot visit her and later in the year he is moving out of reach of her. He is scared that she will kill herself, especially since he a text that she tried to kill herself with pills but took the wrong ones. He thinks that if she kills herself, he is too because she is all he has left.

He left two days early to be with her. He mentioned how he really wants to run away with her. I talked with him the night before, we stayed up really late talking about it. I was really distressed, crying for a lot of it. I told him the two of them need to seek help and not to worry if he lands in a psych ward.

291,"Girl here. I work for this company and there are 2 employees making me extremely uncomfortable for the past 4 MONTHS, they obviously have higher positions than me since I'm an intern (Note: I'm underage!) so I feel very awkward talking about this with anyone else besides the other interns. I'll explain my situation:

So, employee A  makes comments of bad intentions towards my clothing options which aren't one bit revealing, and he even follows me around the company when he gets an opportunity. 

Employee B takes things to another level, he touches me a lot, example whenever he approaches my desk he stares at me smiling like a creepy man and plays with my hair before I can avoid him, and sometimes he corners me near a staircase, which is kind of hidden and there's no cameras, and grabs my waist and laughs. I can only awkwardly move away as quickly as possible. And I'm very scared that someday he'll take advantage of me.

Everyday I get home in need of a shower, because I feel so dirty. 

My biggest fear is talking about it with my bosses (other interns are witness of these occurrences and are urging me to talk to our bosses or else they will) because I feel like they would brush it off or tell me that these employees were just joking around in a playful manner with me since both are the eldest employees. And I don't want to get a reputation for not being able to take a joke or whatever, plus I'm scared of the aftermath of my actions too.

Please if someone could give me any advice feel free to do it! If it is harassment and if I should talk to my bosses; or if it's nothing and I should get over it; or if I should handle them myself?

292,"I made a series of very bad financial choices regarding a car. I had a steady full time job that I thought I'd be at for a while, so I got a loan for a used 2007 Dodge Caliber. It was in worse shape that I realized 'cause it turns out I know nothing about buying a car. Original loan was for just under 5000. Jump forward two years, I have had several different jobs and moved states 4 times.  I needed the car because I was following work state to state for a job that I LOVED (tall ship sailing), but wasn't making enough to even cover routine maintenance. Toss some depression and anxiety in, and here we are in 2018 and I have a car that I am literally POURING money into to try to keep it even vaguely safe so I can continue to go to my 2 part time jobs, which are paying for rent and grad school. Today the check engine light came on, so I'm going to take the tripled commute time and switch to the bus because I can't afford the new shocks and struts I need (they're bad, like, leaking bad), plus I still own about 3300. 

I can't seem to find anyone who will scrap it because I still owe on it. I don't think selling it is that answer because 1. I doubt anyone wants to buy a 3000 car on craigslist that needs as much work as it does and 2. I'd kinda feel like an ass selling an unsafe care to someone. I thought maybe I'd just let it get towed and auctioned, but if they garnish my wages instead for the storage fees I'm screwed. That paycheck-to-paycheck life. I just want the car gone, I don't care if I keep paying a loan for nothing, it's helping my credit score.  

tl;dr - I fucked up and got myself into a spot that I don't know how to get out of. How do I get rid of an unsafe car that I still owe money on?",30Jun2018,1
293,"I want to change my name to something that I love but my mother is angry that I don't want to change it to her family name. She sees this as a rejection of her and her family.

I don't hate it at all, in fact I think it's a beautiful Nigerian name, but it doesn't suit the first or second ones. I don't like the way they sound together or the way it looks written down. I know I'd probably get used to it over time, but I feel like there would be this feeling of dissatisfaction and regret if I changed it to that. She sees it as me distancing myself from my culture and me being ashamed of myself and of her. I've said everything I can to convince her that I'm not but she's still disappointed.

I know that when I do eventually change my name she's gonna tell me the exact same thing and bring all this up against me. I know that I will cave and try to please her by changing it back to hers and I don't want to do that. I've come to the conclusion that the only way to save myself from the hurt that I will cause us both is if I stop caring but I don't know how to go about doing that.

295,"I am 21 years old and I work as a Project Manager for a construction company. I started off as an 'Organizer' but quickly climbed the company ladder by learning everything I could and making suggestions to better the business that have mostly been implemented. I currently make about half of the industry standard, and I've always told myself that it is okay because I'm young and I've only been with the company for two years. 

However, lately I feel that I'm not making nearly enough for what I do. There are two other Project Managers in our office who make more than the industry average - but don't take on nearly as much work as I do (I currently manage 35 projects while they are only managing 15 to 25). It is also common for them to chat with other coworkers in the common area for HOURS. On top of this, I graduate in December with a Bachelor's degree. My degree is a form of business and computing - so sometimes I'm requested to develop new scripts and programs for the company for no extra money. 

Bottom line, I feel like I should be getting paid a lot more. I don't know how to tell my boss this as he has already been very good to me throughout the last two years.

296,"My fucking parents are being petty af over some stupid shit that happened a month ago. I was out with some friends and they robbed a store but the thing is I didn't even have a gun. Plus we were let out of jail because the store didn't press charges against us. But now my parents are sending me to military school now which is retarded.

The stupidest shit is I told them I had like 20 friends I could live with but these shitheads literally track my phone to pick me up. And even though that’s stalking and bad parenting, they claim that it's for my own good but really it's because their mad I'm staying with guys. I guess this isn't the worst part, the worst part is that they decided to take my phone in school and when I decided to stop goong to school till they gave it back they kick me out. So I go from my grandma yo live with my 2 boyfriends and they finally get the police to track me down and keep me on house arrest.

This is why I flunked, because of them but no it's my fucking fault. Yeah right. And don't get me started on dating... they also say I need a place away from these bad influences. Mostly because they are stipid and think sex is bad... but okay I listen and I stop bringing guys over at night. I had anout 3 girlfriends  before they scream at the idea of me being a fucking lesbian. So I can't get dick or pussy and I'm basically supposed to be a zombie and not call people. Even though I have friends to pay my phone bill. Like what the fuck is these idiots problem...

-----------------------------

But wtf ever, I'll go to military school because there's probably off buff guys who can fuck better thsn half of the guys here anyway. But only if I don't have to lose my hair, I can get no shitty hairstyle or listen to some bitch ass hoe order me around like I'm a pet. What is military school like? I heard from some of my guy friends they want or have tried that army shit and have gotten lots of pussy and it's fun in a way. So if I can get laid freely and party, I'll be good.

Anyway, my uncle (cousin's dad) just called to ask for assistance. They are first generation immigrants (from China) with some difficulties with English, and are having a hard time dealing with everything that's happening. From what my uncle just told me, my cousin is not doing very well emotionally, and barely has eaten or slept since the accident. I promised to drive down to them with my mother and brother tomorrow and see how we can help. I speak the best English in my family, so i can help with some basic translation. My cousin who's 28 just got married about a year ago, and they were anticipating a baby boy and starting their own family. I can imagine this whole thing has ruined everything, and they are really lost with directions at the moment. I can't even begin to imagine how the samaritan couple's family is doing right now.

I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with the situation. So, what can i do to help them? What should i do in this situation? I can do some basic translation, but what else? How should i deal with my cousin who's not doing very well emotionally? Would it help if i take on the tasks for him, or should i encourage him to handle them personally? Should i help them (with their permission) set up a GoFundMe page to hopefully help relieve some of the financial stress? What should we do about the other family impacted by this tragedy? Should we call them or meet them? The couple just wanted to help a fellow person, but got killed in the process.",30Jun2018,1

302,"Last night at a busy gas station I found a small/medium sized dog. He looks older, nails long as all hell and he was wandering around aimlessly in a dangerous area. He kept going up to people and trying to follow them into the store. I asked the clerk about him and he said the dog was dumped a few days ago and he just hangs around and gets free food from everyone. I tried to get him to stay by the door when we were leaving but he wouldn’t so I put him in the truck(SO wasn’t happy). I figured whatever his situation, he’d be safer with me. 

Although the clerk said he was dumped I still searched local lost dog posts. I found several posts about this particular dog. The most recent post being still active. I contacted the owners and said I saw him and told them what the clerk told me. They said he’d never gotten out before and this was the first time he’d ran away. Everything they were saying just wasn’t adding up. They gave the location of where they lost him last and it was a good 3 miles from where I found him. I know dogs get around but this guy is small and old. All he does is lay around. 

I’m not sure what to believe. Did they dump him and are having second thoughts? Why were there so many posts about him being lost but the owners said he’s only ran off once? He’s an old fella and should be in a cool home, not roaming the hot streets. ",30Jun2018,4

304,"Hi, thanks for reading. This has been causing me inner termoil for a while, but now I need to decide what to do, if anything. 

tl;dr:

\- I'm a  support worker for adults with learning difficulties (LD's) who are semi independant.

\- My boss is so bad at her job everyone I support hates her, her decisions as manager have seriously affected the quality of life of residents. The residents all especially can't stand her.  She has no understanding of the meaning of the word care and shouldn't work there (though isn't necessarily a bad person deep down). She once literally said a resident would never achieve the only thing she ever wanted (to live on her own with her cats), and that we should never try, despite me believing she is the most capable of them all)

\- The home is tiny, has no space for activities, and because the residents are semi independant the company is not forced to improve things. This is furthered by a £0 budget for activities as residents have their own money, despite a budget making a huge difference.

\- Residents are live very sad lives, and I feel sorry for all of them. Their rooms are rubbish, their kitchens so small they couldn't cook even if they wanted to. They are also quite hard to handle sometimes, which is definitely made worse by care quality. 

\- Many workers, particularly older ones, have become completely broken down by this, and are unmotivated, and don't care anymore.

\- I don't know if I should:

a) get my boss fired

b) do something else (what else can I do.. Should I fight hard??)

c)  do both

d) do nothing

\- I'm just young, but I feel like I really need to make a difference here, but I am afraid and don't know how to do it, or what to do. Please any advice would be great. 

\- Thank you, this is really important to me, but more importantly to the people who I support, and also the other staff there.

ts;wr

The people I support are semi-independant, meaning that they have support whenever they need it, and staff like me are present 24/7 to make sure they are always covered. The end goal is to hopefully one day help them get to a point where they will be able to live, on their own (with our help) out in the community. Further to this they have their own money given to them from the council, differing from typical care of adults with LD where all purchases are made on their behalf (though this independant finance is in all cases managed by their family or organisation as they spend it within minutes). Probably the biggest problem we face is the absolute lack of funding to spend on these individuals, and the lack of space within the home (it's hard to explain the setup, but trust me it's small) to do any activities that are free, including a serious lack of space for staff to do basic things, such as a kitchen, or even a sink to do washing up. This has caused the residents to become very miserable over time. They are bored, lonely, and uninspired. Though the company claims to be 'passionate about support', offering 'a meaningful, fulfilling life consisting of opportunities and success', this is far from the truth in the department I work in. Every staff member has gone in with enthusiasm about making a difference, and those who have been there the longest are now completely broken, unmotivated, and have lost all care.     I was discussing with a colleague today, that a budget of even £120 a month from the company (bear in mind the council pays thousands (I think even tens of thousands) of pounds per month to provide support for each of these individuals) would make such a huge difference, just taking them all out as a group to do an activity, and this really is a minimum budget yet the difference would be huge. The status of independence of these residents is such that as they have their own money, we are given no budget to spend on them, however it has become quite impossible for us to do our jobs without this kind of funding. The residents are impossible to motivate when it comes to spending their own money, which is perhaps to be expected, however because of this the quality of care has dropped so significantly. 

It has become clear that the current model for care for these individuals is not effective. They are very uninspired, and are deeply miserable. Often they will start fights with staff, and it's looking like they have no future from our perspective, and theirs. This is significantly worsened by the fact that our boss is just terrible at her job, and should not work in care. She's not a bad person I don't think, but she is dreadful at her job. One of our residents is actually very independent, though has serious issues with paranoia, and this is holding her back from her dream of living in the community (she can't stand it where she is now). During a staff meeting we mentioned that she needed psychotherapy, so she can maybe work through some of it. At this point my boss goes 'No there's no point, she will never, ever live in the community ever. She will most likely stay here for the next 10, 15 years, and then go live in a similar facility but for older people. She has no chance of ever living in the community.'.  Now bear in mind, this woman basically only talks about two things: Cats, and how she's getting out of there soon, and how much she hates living where she does. When my boss said what she did I was disgusted, as were all the other staff. She had already decided this womans future for her. Worst of all was the fact I strongly disagree with her. It is our job to try EVERYTHING to promote independance. I believe she is actually very capable, with the right support, and quite a bit of psychotherapy before hand, to live in the community as she wishes. She is responsible for herself, and her two cats, who are healthy and well looked after.  


On another occasion she asked an ex-resident who had moved on to the community though is still supported, who is also now pregnant with her and her partners baby, to move out of her house and back into accomodation. This is completely unacceptable, and a ridiculous thing to ask, leaving her obviously very upset, and only because there was an empty room and was costing the home. We also have a petty cash fund that is used for basic things needed for 24/7 care... Coffee, toilet roll, etc. I'm told she recieves a bonus if this doesn't spend much, however at our expense as staff, who are told to be very very stingey with it, even though the company elsewhere does not suggest this. She is terrible with the residents, and they all hate her. One particular resident will take any opportunity.. Literally ANY opportunity to call her a b\*tch. How can you work in care if the people you care for all hate you? How is this representative of your quality of care? There are many other examples of all the things wrong with where I work. Most come from a lack of money (I don't know how much this is my boss not giving us the funds we want or fighting the company to get them, vs I don't know how much this is the company not getting them). To put it in context, during training (which I didn't recieve for 3 months of working there), we watched a video about abuse, and different forms. The way we treat people with LD's has changed a lot over the last 100 years. The 60's were the last of the really bad ways. Since then however we still do not treat them as they deserve and need. While watching the video, it showed us an example of a home from the late 80's, raising awareness that it's not always abuse as we imagine it that can be a problem when working with these people. Sometimes it's not abuse, it's just bad quality care. Me and my collegue watched this video and we both looked at each other realising 'fucking hell this place looks just like ours'. It wasn't abusive, just not conductive of positive behaviour, and bright futures for the people we're supporting. 

  
All in all I've realised I need to change things around there. I feel that is my mission now, I just don't know how to go about it. That is what I need advice on. Should I try and get my boss fired? I have only worked there 6 months, however from what I can tell her boss seems to be a good man, and I know they've had problems recently as it is. What else can I do though? Even if she goes, the building is barely suitable for  purpose, and the company doesn't seem to be offering any funding or desire to improve things. It's not bad enough to be illegal, but it's bad enough that no new resident will move in, and the ones that live there all hate it. I am also in a position where I can't lose my job, I really need my salary and I'm technically still on probation.   


Thank you very much for reading, even if it was just the tl;dr. A lot of this text may not be as coherent as I'd have liked, I'm both very tired, but also wanted to get a lot off my chest. There's also a lot of things I've missed. Writing it was as much a part of the process of understanding what's happening, as reading any relevant answers may be. If you do have any advice for me I'd be very pleased to read it. I'm just a young guy, and haven't been working in care for long. I really wasn't expecting to not only have to deal with this kind of environment, but also to have the responsibility placed on me (though perhaps I can persuade certain other workers to share the burden as they feel similarly). Thank you. ",30Jun2018,1
305,"I’m doing a welding apprenticeship while pursuing a mechanical engineering degree. Classes are paid for by the company and I take them on company time. Im interested in engineering and how things work. However, I’m failing calculus and Im just now figuring out that I might not be cut out for this degree. If I fail this class, I lose my apprenticeship and I cant continue my paid education, but I still get to keep my job as a welder. I make $22 an hour. 

I can easily afford my rent and other bills while still having money to do fun things and support my hobbies. I’ve saved a good amount over the past 2 years as I’m pretty frugal. 

However.. the actual job experience SUCKS and I’m concerned about my health. You are constantly in confined spaces, twisting your neck and back and forced to hold yourself in those positions for hours at a time. You are constantly exposed to carcinogenic smoke and metal fumes. I go home with small burn marks and metal splinters on me, Im exhausted, drenched in sweat, and sore. I heard that people develop arthritis, lung cancer, vision problems, and back problems as early as 40 and I really care about my long term health and longevity. 

**If I fail out of my engineering classes, I could I quit this job, move back in with my parents, and go to a regular university or community college to pursue another degree that doesn’t require calculus.**

*OR*

**I could I stay in this job, keep the money flowing, put up with the harsh conditions, and try to pursue an online degree through tuition reimbursement or something and hope that I could move up in the company or attempt to apply for another trade in the company (its a shipyard).**

My parents are really stressing that I get a bachelors degree. I also hear people that college is a scam and overpriced. I don’t know what to do. Giving up the paychecks is really going to suck. Most of my friends are in  massive debt, just finished college, and they haven’t made real money yet.

306,"Ok, so my mom has always been a hardworking woman, she often complains about working so much, but always looks for more work to do around the house. My brother and I have always obliged to help her around the house. Now my brothers are working and in college, and im in summer break for high school.

 Throughout the school year my mom would constantly complain saying ""why do I have to work out here when I have 2 strong men in the house."" I was involved in after school clubs as well as the band and Jrotc teams and so i often wasnt home until around 6-8 around when the sun was setting and my brother was working or at college courses so i would say ""mom we do our work when we can but were usually busy."" On weekends I would help my mom and if my brother was home he would help to but still throughout the week my mom would complain. Now that its summer, i was hanging around with my friends and I would still help my mom with chores, although i would occasionally forget some mundane tasks like taking out the trash. The night before my birthday my mom said i needed to mow the lawn, but i had made plans to hang out with my friends. So the next morning on my birthday my mom is yelling at me to mow the lawn, and I said I would do it tommorow and headed out to meet up with my friends. Later when my friends and I came back to my house the lawn was cut, we went inside and hung around inside for a while. 

(Before we get to the next part I payed 200 dollars for a camp in Michigan for a group im in called the Sea Cadets that im part of, my mom said she would pay for the plane ticket.)

 Later my mom comes in and says to me ""Im so embarressed that I had to do work alone in the yard when I have strong men in the house, and so Im not going to pay for your ticket"" in a nasty tone while my friends are there. So im like wtf i said i would do it tomorrow no one said you had to do it, and then she starts yelling at me, and i yell back and storm out the back door before it escalates further. Me and my friends then left to one of their houses.

For the record, my mom has not been supportive of me in my interests. She despises that i play music in the school band and hates that im interested in military programs.

I remember not wanting to go to soccer practice because I had a sore throat, and when my father came home he started screaming, threatening to take away all my toys. Whenever I would try to talk, he would interrupt me, screaming whatever message he was so intent on driving home. He has NEVER talked about his emotions and got even angrier when I would confront him about his anger. I resented him for it, and realizing that I would never have a decent conversation with him, I distanced myself, avoiding him and conversation at all costs.

I am now 17, and the other day my mother heard about a party that was happening, one I wasn't even invited to. She called the parents of the kid having the party and asserted that I was going to the party. My friend found out about this and informed my the the kid who was having the party was angry at me for inviting myself. Naturally I was angry at my mom, so I confronted her. However, during my confrontation, I could feel myself becoming more and more like my dad. I yelled the same thing over and over again, cutting off my mom whenever she tried to explain. She eventually left in tears. I felt terrible and immediately realized what I had done.

Recently, in a flurry of rage about me not getting the exact job he wanted me to get, my dad terminated my cell coverage plan and closed my bank account. I cannot contact my employer or my friends without my cell phone and I feel stuck.

309,"As you can imagine the job is difficult. It’s not so much difficult as in hard but it’s stressful. In my facility there is one officer per dorm. Each dorm has between 60-70 inmates. There are no cells in the dorm. 

Everyday it’s like dealing with 8 year olds trapped in a violent mans body. You constantly are threatened and made fun of. I can handle it but anyone who says it doesn’t have at least some affect is a liar.

The job itself isn’t even the main issue though. It’s the shortage of staff. We’re supposed to have about 250 officers to be staffed. We have 194. This means mandatory overtime out the ass. Now I would work 5 12s or something like that but that isn’t how it works. 15 minutes before you’re supposed to go home you can find out you’re required to stay for an additional 8 hours. This happens multiple times a week. 

Because of this all the newer officer quit. For my class. 4 of us out of 175 people were picked. Statistically 66% or 2/3rds of is will quit within the first month. The more senior officers abuse the hell out of FMLA meaning anytime they get forced they use FMLA and get out of it meaning the newer people get blasted the hardest with mandatory overtime. You basically get no off days. You off an off day? Na they take it away at roll call with some nice letter they give you. 

The pay isn’t even that great. You can make some serious money with the overtime but you basically become a prisoner yourself. Give up all your hobbies and life. I work every holiday. You don’t even get paid for holidays. You accrue a holiday day if you work a holiday. That holiday day can then be attached to a week of vacation day. Yeah except if I work every damn holiday and only can attach ONE day per week of vacation and I only get 2 weeks a year then I’ll just have a bunch of holiday time I can’t even use. 

There is also no pay step increases. Everything is frozen. No basically this is it. I feel like I’m just throwing my life away.

311,"I live in Virginia, United States

Hello! I need some legal advice on what's going on with my brother at the house. Okay, I would like to start with a bit of a backstory. My brother is schizophrenic and has lived with me and my mom all of his life. I am 20s, he is in his 30s and my mom is in her later years. My mother relies heavily on his income, my income and her own income to make ends-meet at home and she tries her best to help him. Roughly 2 years ago, a man name ""Allen"" who worked with services for in-home services (I’ll just called it TS) came for my brother for six months, and eventually got into an argument with my mother. He then referred (mostly out of spite) to social services who got deeply involved and then everyone agreed (unfortunately, it's the only one near and they have bad services) to get mental health services from a local mental health facility (we were with the upstairs division at first, they were nice). This led to them performing services that offered my brother medication every morning to help him cope with his symptoms. Eventually, up into around last year (she was coming for roughly 2 years after the incident with Allen and before the upcoming incident) a woman who goes by the name of “S” came by and all was well. But last year, around June, she went and called social services on my brother and told us that we were unfit to take care of him and that the state should take him into custody and out of the house because he ended up peeing on his clothes (long-story there but we went through our best to help him). Eventually that fell through and she got into an argument with my family, and eventually that led to my brother having his check signed over to a new Payee and him stopping the peeing on his clothes (he did that several times before) and I have tried to get more in-depth with helping my brother. “S” (this is his case manager btw) stated that she would help him by taking him out and spending time with him outside of the house.

This worked out for roughly the last year and she has came by and have tried to spend time with him, but recently, the nurse who comes in the morning has refused to give him his medication (we don’t know why, but she states that “She is not allowed to anymore"") and instead gives it to my mother. He refused to take it for my mom and so I helped out my brother and have started giving him the medication. But just recently, “S” and the doctor who comes by to check on him said they want to force him into a group home because he only sleeps all day or plays games. The problem is that he doesn't urinate on himself anymore (for a year+), he takes a shower and he generally gets around and does stuff around the house. But the doctor and his case manager wishes to go over our head (my mother and mine, and even my brother's) and force him into an assisted living facility when he has family that cares for him and loves him. I'm planning to speak to the supervisor on monday to see what I can do, but last time I spoke to him (during the first argument with “S” where she lashed out at us), he didn't really do anything. I really don't want my brother taken out of the house, but it feels like “S” and the doctor (the doctor is the only one on the team, and has even admitted that he has improved over the year(s)) but they still want to work together to remove him from the home and go over our heads. Is there anything that me and my mother can do to stop this situation? (we have tried to stop services there and transfer to a case manager upstairs who was alot nicer, and even tried to get him a different case manager who would be able to spend greater time with him or someone to offer services when his current case manager is unavailable, but it has been impossible so far)

TLDR : “S” wants to break up our family even though my brother is doing better and the doctor wants to try to force him into a home against his, and my mother's wishes and basically doesn't care what we think. I've been getting more involved in his life while going to school and the like and doing my best to help. I'm planning to call their supervisors on monday to try to communicate what's going on, but I don't have any faith that it might work out okay and will only cause more problems. What can we do in this situation, especially if their supervisor takes a uncaring attitude? Can I take it higher up the chain regionally? Should I seek a lawyer (hopefully for cheap)?",30Jun2018,1

314,"TL;DR at the bottom

So as the title suggests, I (29/m) am renting a town house with two other people (23/f) (33/m) that I met on a roommate app. We met several times before we signed for the lease, and they both seemed like really great, easy going, down to earth people.

About two months into the year long lease, one of my roommates, we'll call him Randall, started showing signs that he was really anal about little things. My other roommate and I did our best to accommodate, as he would ask us politely if we would do things a certain way. We also noticed that he would stomp around the house, and slam doors.

We all agreed that we could use each-others things, such as dishes, as long as they were cleaned afterwards, and treated with respect.

So for the first few months, I was using Randall's pan any time I was cooking. Randall made it a point to tell me that his pan had teflon coating on it and to not use metal when cooking with it. I obliged, but made the mistake of leaving a metal fork inside the pan while letting it soak. Unfortunately I did this a couple of times. Personally I don't think it was a big deal, the pan was not actually damaged. But I understand I was using his things, and if he has conditions for doing so, I should respect that.

Randall was very upset about this and took a picture of the pan and sent it to me and my other roommate along with a giant wall of text expressing his discontent. I apologized and let him know that I would go get my own pan so it wouldn't be a continuing issue. He insisted that we all have a meeting about it to discuss personal boundaries.

A few weeks later I accidentally left a light on over night. This was a very rare occurrence, but sure enough the next morning we got another wall of text from Randall saying that it was a waste of electricity, and that we are irresponsible, and he left the light on for ""whoever did it"" to turn it off. I'm really not a prideful person, so I just turned it off after I got out of bed.

That evening when I got home from work, every single light in the house was on. All of them. It was super uncomfortable. I went around and turned them all off and went to bed.

The next morning after waking up, I found a big pile of dishes in the sink. I thought this was unusual, Randall is usually very good about cleaning up after himself. I decided to clean the dishes, even though they weren't mine. After cleaning a few I found my [pan](https://i.imgur.com/SeVPaBu.jpg), the one I bought so I didn't have to use Randall's, scraped to hell with steel wool.

A few days later my other roommate and I decided to call a meeting. I had never seen Randall the way he was acting at the meeting. He was yelling, and pacing, calling us names. He eventually made my other roommate cry and the meeting really went nowhere. Evidently he did tell me during the meeting that he ordered me a new pan, and that it was in the mail.

He did reach out to us in an attempt to discuss things again, but after that meeting we were both reluctant, and never really followed through.

A month or so later there is a bang on my door. When I open Randall is there holding a butter knife and exclaims ""Was this you?"". I had seen the butter knife in the sink earlier, but I knew nothing about it. Apparently my other roommate had used it. Honestly I'm not sure why she did this, she only seemed to antagonize him, but she declined that she had used it. He sent us this [text](https://i.imgur.com/me1VYxb.png). After my other roommate didn't comply, he began walking around the house, whistling the same tune over and over, some times singing it loudly. He did this several times over the course of 2 or 3 hours up until about 2 AM. My roommate and I felt very uncomfortable and she ended up calling the police. They showed up and he didn't come out of his room. They just asked us a few questions and said contact your land lord. Nothing really got accomplished with that besides him staying in his room for the remainder of the night.

He continued whistling and singing through the house any time we were within earshot. He did this for about a week.

A few days later he sends us [this](https://imgur.com/a/cW7wgdw), exclaiming that we have some of his things. Honestly, after the pan incident happened I never touched any of his things again and my other roommate stopped after the knife.

After this I decided it was finally time to contact the landlord. I told him I felt unsafe in the house, and that I was afraid Randall was dangerous. My landlord didn't really know what to say. It's his first time renting a house. He sort of just said ""Send me an email telling me what you want to do and we'll go from there."" But honestly I don't really know what I want to do. I don't know what my options are. So I never sent an email.

I stopped using the kitchen for a month or two and just started eating out every day. A couple of days ago I decided to start cooking again. I live in this house too, and I shouldn't let him bully me into not being able to do that. I left a pot to dry in his drying rack next to the sink, not knowing that it would [set him off](https://imgur.com/a/ht7onqL). It was an oversight really.

Yesterday morning, I woke up to [this](https://i.imgur.com/6vzj8rU.jpg). Although I didn't put it there, I didn't respond to his text message and just put the microwave cover away and went to work.

When I got home that evening I decided to cook dinner. He approached me and began asking me why I couldn't understand not using his things. It broke out into a heated argument, ending with me asking what I needed to do for him to leave me alone. He said ""don't use my things"" and I responded with ""Okay"". He slammed his hands on the counter and said ""GREAT!"" and stomped to his room and began banging around and yelling.

When I got home today I had to pass him on the way to my room. I let out a muffled ""Hey"", and he did the same. In the process I forgot to turn the light off to the stairs leading up to the second floor. He yelled through my door and said ""ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FLIP THE FUCKING SWITCH"". Then stomped up to his room, and began yelling and banging around again.

A lot of my friends have been telling me I need to move out, but I don't think it's that simple. I feel like It's unsafe and uncomfortable for me to continue living with him.

What do I do?

316,"It's summer and I still haven't applied to any uni so this is pretty bad... anyway here's a bit of background info about me


I am a 17 years old male, I live in the UAE, Dubai. I've always been good at school; like, always been the top of my school. I have a stack of honor certificates, student of the month certificates, academic excellence certificates etc.. I also won the spelling bee (country level) just the other month.


I haven't gotten my HS certificate yet, but I am expecting an average of [98.7%~99.3%]. We have this thing called the EmSAT here, which is the same as the SAT in the US. I got 2000/2000 on English (I probably don't reflect that when I type on the internet lol), 1850/2000 MATH, 1750/2000 physics, and 1700/2000 chemistry. I also have many teachers who are willing to write letters of recommendations for me when I apply for uni.


Now here's the deal, I have no idea what I wanna do in life. Like, I have no passion for literally anything whatsoever, I am good at all different subjects in school but I hate every single one of them. I work really hard and I make a good team leader but I don't see myself doing anything really.


I've thought about going into engineering but it seems to me that just about everyone and their grandma has a degree in STEM now, the market is flooded and landing a job is really hard. I have no interest in medical school because I feel like I've already wasted enough of my life reading books and the last thing I wanna do is spend 10 more years doing that. I also though about going into dentistry school to become an orthodontist (you don't have to get a general bachelor before going into dentistry school where I live so that would be ~6 years) but the more I read about it the more I hate it. Also thought about becoming a uni professor but you have to do research on top of teaching and I really am not about that life. It's like overworking myself the past few years has left me so depressed and unmotivated.

So, what should I do? where do I start? I am so fucking scared that I'll fail in life and it's eating me up.. I really need to succeed so that I can GTFO Dubai, it's not exactly the best place for atheists or gays to live over here.",30Jun2018,4
317,"Hello Reddit! So my background: Asian American female who graduated from a Pharmacy school, currently living at home with strict Asian parents (general contractor and realtor). I haven't done much to upset my parents and I've tried really hard to not cause any trouble. After spending 6 years living alone in school, I found it pretty difficult to live at home after graduation due to developed lifestyle differences. 

My parents are expecting me to take out a 500K loan (which I can take out once I have a valid pharmacist license) to help them build our current house into an apartment unit. They did not talk to me about this at all and assumed that I would be fine with it.  They have a valid plan since they are experts in their field. We have a house in the center of a city and I know they can sell the house for way more than the loan amount even if they sold it now as is. They promised that the loan will just be under my name and they will pay everything back once the house is sold. I still have school loans I have to pay off and I don't have much in savings, which makes it difficult to be independent. 

I am not expecting any sort of compensation and they haven't said anything that would be an incentive for me to help them. I have been advocating moving out this whole time and they're just really not buying the idea. My mom says that it is selfish, greedy, and ungrateful of me to want to move out and waste money on rent when my dad is working hard outside as a general contractor. 

I feel really conflicted. They helped to support me until this time and I do want to help them back, I'm just not sure of it at this magnitude. I'm willing to give them half of my paycheck every month to help them if they're in a hard spot. Once I'm financially stable, I wouldn't even think twice about buying my parents cars or anything they might need. My friend's opinion is that it is a very high-risk investment and that 500K can really fuck up my life if anything goes wrong. 

If I do agree to help them, what are some things I should look out for in terms of paperwork/laws, and any potential advice? And if you think that this is too risky, I would also love to hear your opinion as well. Thank you so much for reading this long post!!

318,"Ok, so I have this friend that is pretty terrible. They’re constantly aggressive and violent towards everyone, pushing and kicking them as hard as they can. They also constantly put themselves down and expect everyone to feel sorry for them, yet they have no problem insulting other people’s personalities and appearances, and I always feel self-conscious around them. They always have to have their way and simply don’t care about other people.

Me and another friend tried confronting them about all of this a while ago, we were calm and nice, simply asking them to stop. Their reaction to this was to claim they couldn’t change who they were and it’s because they were bullied so they are dominating and aggressive as a defence mechanism. They then proceeded to ignore us until we had to apologise for bringing it up.

A month or so after (they had still kept up their behaviours they knew we didn’t like), everyone in the friendship group was fed up of it. We planned to talk to them about it (once again calmly and nicely) and say that we wanted them to stop. They then said nothing to us after that and hung out with their friends outside the circle for a while before they came crying to us apologising and saying they’ll change. We all accepted their apology and agreed to move on. That was good enough for me.

About a week after they’re back on their bs. Doing the same stuff they used to, and when it’s bought up in the moment it’s just disregarded. I really don’t know what to do because aside from that stuff they are a great person, but nobody wants to put up with this anymore. I also don’t want to have to deal with them begging for forgiveness again and feel like it’d just be easier to let it happen.  ",30Jun2018,1

320,"Up until two weeks ago my husband acted like everything was normal. No fights. No arguments. Nothing. Then while home with my 13 year old son a man knocked on the door and served us with divorce papers. My son was so upset. The man actually gave the papers to him. When my husband returned with out daughter (11) he said he wanted a divorce but had no plans to leave or what to do next. He's been sleeping in the living room since. I've had to take off days to go down to the courthouse to learn how to file a response. We chatted and he says he wants to spend more time doing music. He already spends two hours everyday practicing but wants to go out and see bands and record more. Not sure why he needed a divorce for that when I've never complained about his doing that. Found out through the filing that he had opened up a bank account I knew nothing about. He helped me set up a new bank account and wants me to pay our bills. He acts like everything is normal and wants us to suddenly move into a larger more expensive place that is far from the kids school. He has not withdrawn the divorce papers or filed an extension giving me time to file a response. He has not agreed to  counseling.

323,"I don’t know how to word this post without sounding like an arrogant asshole who’s full of himself but I’ll try anyway.

Basically, due to individual circumstances about 3/4s (including me) of my group sat back a year in high school. Out of all of us I can comfortably say that I am the one who has adjusted best, making new friends and being invited to social events and such. The first few times I was invited to events by new people I would always invite my original group with me to try and get them to adapt to the new situation, and they would come .

However over time they stopped coming to such events which isn’t the problem. 

The problem has risen more recently. On two occasions they’ve asked me themselves to go out which I’ve agreed to. On both occasions about an hour before we’ve been meant to go I’ve had texts from them saying they’ve changed their minds and we’re not going. As we usually go out later than I would with the newer people this then leaves me stuck in as I don’t particularly fancy having to go out by myself to catch up with others.

However, when catching up with others who went out the following week on both occasions I’ve been told things along the lines of ‘I saw your friends out on the weekend, how come you didn’t want to come out?’

Regrettably it is now summer and high school has finished, leaving me in the position where I’m not as close to the newer people to be able to talk to them daily and make plans and then also my ‘friends’ are actively trying to screw me over out of hitting the town .

327,"(To preface I am asking for advice here as I truly feel like there is someone she can talk to or something I can do to help sort this all out but I am unsure where to start. We are both in Highschool also)

I will try and detail the events as thoroughly as possible but I only can go by what she has told me about this whole incident.

Around a month ago a boy in my sisters year started to flirt with her, talking outside of class and sedning her messages. My Sister thought the guy was attractive and nice, and seemed to consider him a friend of sorts. This guy was in and is still in a relationship with another girl in the same year, and my sister was aware about them being together. My sister asked me a few times what she should do about his advances towards her given that he was in a relationship, to which I said its best to steer clear of doing anything as he would then be cheating on his current girlfriend.

 After a while of this guy messaging her round for a party/gathering of people at his place, I saw her go round in the evening and talked to her when she came back home the next day visibly upset  From what she told me then went to bed but she was not willing at all to have sex, but despite her saying no multiple times and making it clear she didn't want to he disregarded it and raped her. 

Obviously I was extremely angry and felt awful about this whole thing uppn hearing about it, but my sister made me promise not to tell anyone and to not do anything about it - stating that it would make things worse and that she was going to talk to an adult she trusted and see to it herself. Not wanting to stir things up for fear of making it worse for her, I let her do her own thing - which I'm now thinking was a huge mistake. She then told me that the guy who had raped her had messaged her to apologise - but not in a genuine way but rather in a way that seemed to try to bury the issue for fear of the truth getting out (she kept these messages). She rightfully disregarded these messages. She then told me that the guys girlfriend was aware that he had been cheating and that him and my sister had slept together (his girlfriend was not aware he raped her) and his girlfriend started to spread stuff about my sister being a 'slut' etc. This seemed to die down after a while and I assumed my sister had spoken to someone about it (I know, really stupid of me).

Fast forward a couple of weeks and the heat surrounding my sister in school has risen considerably from the guys girlfriend and her large friend group. I just walked in on her extremely upset as people were talking behind her back and someone she used to know well sent her a message saying she was making everything up about the rape in order to get attention and deflect criticism for her actions and that 'everyone knew'. 

So I've realised that my sister did not talk to anyone in the end and is now being accused of making this whole thing up. The fact that she was visibly upset she was after the night  and also the fact that the guy that did it apologised to her makes it clear this is not a fabrication. Unfortunately she seems to be in a difficult position with all of the stuff revolving around her getting with someone already in a relationship and she is obviously upset with being labelled a liar after such an awful event, so with that in mind I feel like I should do something to help or talk to someone that can help her sort out the fact that she was raped. I am really unsure what to do and any advice would be hugely appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",30Jun2018,3

I have seen this guy get into it with random people I have never seen before so I didn’t think anything of it...until I saw all the Cadillac SUV’s roll up to pick up the trouble makers. 

Over the next couple hours I saw someone pull up to my neighbors condo where my neighbor pulled an assault rifle out of the back seat and ran back into his condo as the car drove away. Two other guys stood out in front of his condo. The other two were another neighbor in the condo complex and the brother of another neighbor. 

Nothing happened but I have been a nervous wreck ever since. I’m doing my best to mind my own business and keep my head down, but is there more that I should be doing to be safer?

I can’t call the cops. There are so many neighbors that defend this guy that they would all know it was me and I would be in danger. I’m also one of two white males in the complex. (I’m not saying that every non-white person is involved, there is just a long history of the neighborhood having community barbecues that neither I or my white neighbor were invited to) 

My girlfriend seems fine and is taking this way better than me. But I grew up in rural Midwest surrounded by corn fields. She has seen this kind of stuff before but never to this level. 

I can’t afford to move. I can’t afford a gun. I can barely afford rent. I’m a college student who is just trying to make ends meet and I’m at my wits end. I’m not asking for financial help at all, just advice on how to handle this situation. Thank you. ",30Jun2018,1
343,I am a 17 year old boy and i was in a fitting room at khols and it was a one dressing room for guys and girls type of thing and so in my room that i was in i happened to find a a pair of women thong underwear that ha the price tage and looked untouched right next to other clothes in a pile on the floor. since i was in the room changing in my privacy and the thong was in that room I was curious and i tried it on withotut thinking too much about it because of me wanting to know why girls wear it and how it felt etc. and crazy enough they felt pretty amazing and kinda sexy lol but i feel like this was wrong and now im probably gay for it or maybe i am going to hell.. i feel guilty,30Jun2018,2

345,"I find that I’m rather unsympathetic (or empathetic, not sure which) towards other people’s problems. I joined the army two years ago and left after 1 year of service and honestly seen the wort of and worst-off people there, it’s beena whole year since I left and it feels like most people’s problems are really dumb and I just can’t relate to them   
Relationship problem? Break up you’ll probably find someone better  
Money problem? Join the army they’ll feed and pay you  
Family problem? You don’t talk to them anyway

What I’m trying to say here is I just can’t relate *emotionally* to people, everything seems so clear-cut and matter-of-fact if you get what I’m saying. I’ve always been like this to an extent but I feel being in the army just amplified it a bit. It’s like my emotional response to things is extremely dull;  
for example when I was in service a friend of mine was hit by a truck, there was gore everywhere, the whole bloody picture, and I didn’t even flinch. Granted it saved his life because we were able to get help quickly but I just feel like it should’ve affected me more considering that there were guys around me vomiting, others just frozen in shock, and such.

From this I can’t really ever imagine myself in a relationship, like yeah it would be great to have someone to love and cuddle with and shit but I just seriously, honestly can’t picture myself actually falling in love or even reciprocating their feelings. Never have fallen in love/crushed on someone in my life either.  
I know I’m not depressed because I’m still motivated and enjoy many things.
That’s not to say I’m emotionless, I get happy, angry, and such but I really feel like I just don’t relate to others and that I might just find myself either alone.


**tldr**: Never really relate to people emotionally, I understand what they feel but don’t feel it myself. Never loved someone in my life and wondering if this would all add up to me spending my life alone and if there’s a way to fix this mess.",30Jun2018,1
346,"So far I've spent most of my summer indoors really doing nothing. I work nights 4x week, and I do jiujitsu a couple times a week, other than that I spend the rest of my time at home. I've looked for ways to meet people and I have a car, basically Im stuck with no ideas right now. Im a guy, 19, in good-shape, in a major city, don't have many friends and want to make more, no girlfriend.",30Jun2018,1
348,"I've lived in a new town for nearly two years now but haven't really made any new friends that I didn't know before I moved here. This has led to spending more and more time at home without really doing much and I'd love to be out doing something with other people more. 

I've never really had a huge group of friends anyway, but not really sure of th best way to go about meeting new people without seeming a bit strange. I've tried the app 'Meetup' but most things in my town don't really appeal to me (lots of singles groups, book clubs etc which aren't really my thing). Any advice or ideas that have worked for you would be greatly appreciated. ",30Jun2018,1
349,"I forgot to RSVP to my childhood best friend's wedding and now the deadline is passed and I feel awful lmao. I thought I still had a few more days but nope, deadline was yesterday. I feel really bad about this, do you think she'll hold it against me?? Like we only hang out once or twice a year but still, we grew up together and it's weird to realise that I won't see her get married",30Jun2018,1
350,"I am currently a senior in high school, and have always been in love with the idea of health related careers- more specifically dentistry. As a child with crooked and missing teeth, for the past 8 years I have been back and forth out of my dentist and orthodontist’s offices, and I’ve decided I want to be a dentist, or at least try the field and see if I really do enjoy it. 

I am not the best student. My current, unweighted GPA is a 3.3, my weighted being a 3.5. I have never been serious about my studies, but I am willing and ready to change this. My worst subject is math, but my best is biology. I have excelled in my science classes (anatomy, biology, physical science). My psychotic chemistry teacher of mine nearly failed me, but when I retook the class in summer school, I passed with an A minus. I have been too afraid of the teacher to take any other essential courses (physics, advanced chemistry, etc.) as have many, many other students I know also pursuing STEM or STEM-esqe careers/who this teacher has failed/nearly failed. 

I shadowed both my dentist and dental hygienist, and both of them told me not to be afraid of the math aspects of their careers, and that college tutors could help me through it. My dentist also claims she was a C-math student in high school,  and excelled in science courses, like myself.

I want to know if these women are bullshitting me and if it’s realistic. My mother insists I’m incapable of this, and should try to be a dental hygienist instead. I don’t know if she is trying to manipulate me into going to a college closer to home (which would certainly be like her), or if she is being ‘real’ with me. Please, give me your honest opinion. If you need more information, I will be happy to provide.

TLDR: I want to be a dentist. I’m an average student at best. Bad with math, great with science. Dentist and hygienist say I can do it, mom says I should give up on it. Should I go for it?

351,I have glasses that go darker when exposed to sunlight and the way my eye doctor put it is that film over the lens has come off and now the glasses are very smudged. I am in the process of getting new ones but I want to clean these up for comfort. ,30Jun2018,1
352,I am a 17 year old boy and im in highschool right now as a senior and well i have this secret that only i know and i plan on taking to the grave which is i secretly wear and enjoy and feel comfortable in girl thongs and g strings. i once tried them on as a younger kid and ever since i always enjoyed wearing them. I now wear them all the time under my pants or shorts for school and work. however i am worried one day my parents or friends may catch me slipping and see the thong slip from above my pants when im either sitting down or tieing my shoes or stretch my arms up. how can i be more cautious and avoid anyone ever realizing im wearing a thong?,30Jun2018,2
