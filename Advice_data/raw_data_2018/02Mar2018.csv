A little background:
I am the 3rd out of 5 kids. My sister is 5 years younger than me, the baby of the family, and always seemed to get what she wanted growing up. ( A year before she was born, my dad made partner so $$ started rolling in). I have a love/hate relationship with her.

Growing up, it may have seemed like sibling rivalry or jealousy but she definitely was treated differently.  For example: I wore my older brothers hand me down clothes, i.e. Lakers jerseys/jeans etc to school (I'm a girl btw) up until I was old enough to get a job and buy my own clothes. She was bought name brand clothing and didnt have to get a job until she was 19. She was definitely spoiled because hearing the word ""no"" sent her into a rage until my parents gave her what she wanted to shut her up. Whenever she didn't get her way, she'd say the most hurtful things, picking out insecurities to feel as if she was on top.  My parents scolded my brothers and I for "" picking on her because she was the youngest"". Yet, She was constantly getting into fights with people at school, picking on her friends, and my parents would still rush to her aid.   We went no contact  for two years when she started high school. She was captain of the varsity softball team and it really went to her head.  She treated everyone in the family like they were beneath her and my mom and dad just lapped it up. Besides the constant enablement, I didn't really have a good relationship with the parents to begin with ( for other reasons). So once I turned 18 I got out as soon as possible. I found out through my younger brother that she started drinking and smoking pot, A LOT.  He told me my folks would buy her alcohol as long as she stayed somewhere safe. As soon as she graduated, It only got worse. 

Now, I cant really go into detail,  but  2 years ago she was involved in an accident which left her with no license. My parents had let her live in one of the houses they were flipping so she wasn't on her ass financially.  My parents  hired the best lawyer in the state and continue to baby her into oblivion.  
Coincidentally, the accident happened around the time that I just ended a long term relationship with my bf of 7 years. My car that I bought my sophomore year in high school was just starting to die and money was extremely tight. Word got around and out of the blue, my parents contacted me. They basically gave me an offer I couldn't refuse. They offered a room in the house "" to help me save money for a new car""  (they make me pay rent btw) as long as I can drive my sister to and from work. My older brothers are married with kids  and my younger brother lives across the country. 

My parents decided to play fair and made my sister start paying rent too which threw her into a violent rage.  Since the move in,  it's been nothing but hell.  She basically treated me like I was her personal servant and said I owed her ""for not being there for her in high school."" She goes out almost every night and gets completely wasted. Shes constantly on tinder and brings random men home weekly. We've had multiple fist fights about it because things started to go missing but it was never her fault. Ive tried to talk to my parents about it and told them she NEEDS rehab. They laugh it off abd tell me I'm being over dramatic and to stop picking on her. Or ""she needs you right now,  you cant just abandon her"". But fail to realize that I'm being verbally and physically abused. They continue to spoil her, buy her things because  ""she had a bad day"" or because ""they want her to feel supported"". The more things they bought her, the worse she got with me. She would have a bad day at work, and Id come home to my room being trashed. I dont even confront her about it because thats what she's looking for. Instead, when I had stopped giving her rides to work and my rent went up. 

I finally was able to afford a car and decided to buy a slightly used one. Cash. This freaked my parents out to no end they decided to lower rent if I stayed for a few months. I  figured I could tough things out and save for a few months rent at a new place. This was 6 months ago.  
Last week, my sister opened up my mail and found out that I had rented a storage unit.  I was slowly buying lightly used furniture from a public auction and keeping it in there until I got a place of my own.  Since there is no legal lease agreement,  I could leave whenever I want.   She told my Parents and were absolutely furious. They raised the rent again. I feel so trapped. They refuse to get her into a rehab program or even to a psychologist, but I'M the problem. I get guilted into staying because ""she needs me"" but when I stay home, I'm basically just making sure she doesnt choke on her vomit in her sleep.  They just buy her shit to make sure she doesnt go crazy.

I'm so scared for her, and I feel like if I leave and something happens to her, then I will get the blame. ",02Mar2018,1

5,"Hi everyone,

I have received a threat from a handy man that i had contracted to undertake some digging work in my yard. I decided to end the contract as his schedule was always busy and he was unable to complete the work during our time frame. 

He has claimed to have completed 80% of the work as outlined in his quote however the work completed is no more than 33%. I responded to his invoice saying that i do not believe that 80% of the cost is accurate and will offer to pay 1/3 of the payment as agreed to in the quotation.
 
He is now claiming that the work site was unsafe and that he has injured his ankle and will ""take me to the cleaners - and we are not talking about $200s of odd dollars, we are talking about $10,000s.""

Does he have a right to make this claim with his lawyer? The depth of the trenches dug were no more than 600mm deep. All electrical conduit had been marked out with high-vis tape and to me there is nothing that would be deemed unsafe.

Thanks",02Mar2018,1
6,"Throwaway because my friend frequents Reddit.

Some background:

I (16M) met a girl (16F) this summer and I pretty much immediately started liking her. We talk the whole summer and become very close and very good friends. (She can be pretty shy and has social anxiety but has become much better over the course of the past year). Fast forward to October and I tell her exactly how I feel. She tells me that she sees me as a friend/distance wouldn't work. We don't talk for a little bit but as time goes on everything goes back to normal and we are just as good of friends. 

My dilemma is that in 2 weeks I am going to spend the weekend at her house and go around her town with her. This is all fine and dandy except for the fact that I still like her and I don't want to make anything awkward. I don't want to try and force anything but I also wish she could see how much I care about her. I use her good friend as almost a ""double agent"" and she tells me that the girl still just sees me as a friend. (I think it would be good to point out that neither of us have ever been in a relationship and that it is more difficult for her to pick up signals.) I just want to know how to proceed with the weekend because we plan on doing things like watching a movie/going ice skating etc... ",02Mar2018,4

15,"My father and I have had a strained relationship for most of my teenage and adult life.  I was told growing up he never wanted to get married or have children, and he ended up with both - me and my sister (28 and 23 respectively). He was very controlling, was specific about what kind of people we could see, what sort of media we were allowed to consume, etc etc.  More than once he tried to ban me from being in theatre because he didn't like me being on stage where people could see me.  He was very strict about us being quiet and demure, not touching things, not asking questions, not wearing makeup or jewelry, he wouldn't even let my sister cut her hair until she was in Jr. High.  

He travelled a lot for work, spending more and more time away from home.  Eventually, about the time I was in high school, he transitioned to living mostly overseas and coming home maybe once or twice a year.  I found out later this was due to a lot of credit card debt that he was trying to run from, and he asked my mom for a divorce so the courts wouldn't come after her.  She refused.  It got to the point where I felt as though I had a single parent, and on the few occasions he did come home he would live in the basement, away from the family.  

Last year, my mom passed away. Dad came home for her funeral, then again six months later when his dad, my grandpa, died as well.  At the second funeral, he basically announced he was engaged to a thirty-year-old woman he'd met in the Philippines.  He told me that she could never replace my mom, but it was okay because I was ""an adult and (didn't) need a mom anymore"".  

He's now in the process of trying to move back to the states with his new fiancee so she can get a green card, probably going to move her into my mom's house.  There's so much more here I didn't get into and I'm willing to answer any specifics, but I've been so furious for the last year.  Dad is the source of a lot of my insecurities and mental problems, including my absolute door-mat mentality. I feel like it's time for me to finally put my foot down and stop being his pack-mule/servant, but I also feel that cutting my only living parent out of my life is selfish.  Is this the right thing to do?

17,"Hello guys.

I am here for your opinion.
So, a little bit about the situation - My boyfriends sister (17) came to see him from other town, for 2 weeks. I cook her quality, healthy lunch/dinner, she haven't said thank you a single time since she has been here. She doesn't eat certain vegetables, and meals just because she doesn't like the taste? So I have to cook something else for her. Its not like a some sort of hotel right, where you can pick whatever you want, you are a visitor, so have some respect and eat what's been served? I even made healthy desserts, she refused to eat them and instead whinged her brother to bring her to shops to buy sweets, she is 17 and doesnt know how to cook anything? Even instead of going to shops (1 min away) and choose what she wants, she eats sweets or doesn't eat at all. She doesn't seemed grateful and satisfied when we took her to good and expensive restaurants. She have never offered her help in kitchen or anything else, very rude and ungrateful attitude. Her brother is well mannered man, totally opposite to his sister. She is also working, but expects us to pay everything for her. It's just western mentality or what (I am from Europe)? To be like this? I don't know how to deal with such people.",02Mar2018,5
18,"Sorry for the long story, I tried keeping it short but I failed miserably as I wanted to give the full picture.

Exactly 2 years ago, I started a new job at a relatively small firm,  In the beginning everything was great. I had good colleagues, I really liked the work and had the most amazing boss ever. Plus in my first year alone I received 3 trainings. Unfortunately as good as the first year was, the second year was absolutely terrible. It all started with a reorganisation last year where they changed the company structure and several people got new functions. Among them my boss, who was told he had to focus more on the management part instead of also still performing technical work like the rest of us. They also added 2 new teamleaders which was completely irrelevent as my new teamleader his field of expertise was completely different from mine.

I was already very negative towards those plans from the beginning but since I was still a rookie, I just went with them. As time progressed, it became more and more clear that we had several peak moments where we could not handle the workload (due to my boss not doing any technical work anymore). Basically every time someone fell sick or took holidays, shit started hitting the fan.

The first few months of those peaks, I was still super motivated and put in a lot of hard work and overtime just to get things done anyway. I did alert my new teamleader regarding the situation but the general feedback I got was ‘Just do your best and we’ll get there’. A few more months passed by and our sales team brought in some big projects. The result being that every day was now a peak day and work was piling up no matter how much overtime I put in. Once again I alerted my teamleader that this was not sustainable and that we needed additional resources. However the response was somewhat similar and nothing really changed.

Fast forward to December last year where 2 out of 5 team members were sold as consultants to work on one of those big projects for at least half a year. Plus another colleague left because he did not agree with some of the changes the company made earlier and they refused to work something out with him or compensate him. Anyway we were down to 2 people in a team that still had 5 people a year earlier. Then on one dreadful Sunday, I was supposed to go to a customer for a migration which would take about half a day. Unfortunately due to stuff going wrong, that ended up taking 14 hours. The day after I was completely broken, I felt like shit and could not get out of bed anymore. I went to the doctor and she prescribed 2 weeks of sick leave as I started getting physical symptoms due to the stress. After that, I wrote a pretty honest/assertive mail explaining the situation was completely fubar and sent it to the CEO of our company. He called me that afternoon and told me he took my mail serious and would discuss it with the CTO later that day. Unfortunately that was the last I heard from him.

Upon my return, I had learned that my boss was once again performing technical work out of neccesity. They also found a replacement for my colleague who left and were looking for an additional resource. Unfortunately those 2 weeks of sick leave didn’t help much and since the workload was still way too high, I have completely lost my drive and motivation since then. I can’t seem to be bothered anymore and I am also working at a much slower pace than before, sometimes even lying on the couch for an hour when I am supposed to be ‘working’ from home. Since I no longer wanted this and wanted to keep the honor to myself, I decided to update my resume and fork it over to those hungry recruiters. I already got some offers but nothing that really stood out yet though.

Anyway we had our yearly company event today and I told myself that I would simply hand in my resignation in case they put up a good news show without recognizing the problems. However to my disbelief, they actually announced they would be getting rid of those additional teamleader roles that didn’t make much sense. Plus they also announced that they are looking for 2 additional resources and sort of apologized for the things our team had to put up with the past year. I had my mind set on leaving however the presentation and announcements today actually gave me hope again. It looks like it has finally gotten through to them and the stuff they proposed was all positive (unlike last year). 

However I am now completely lost on what to do. It will probably take some time before they find and train additional resources. The workload is also still very high so my motivation is thus still non existant. On the other hand, I do really like the work itself (when portioned correctly) and I have never had such a great boss before. Not to mention the chore of finding a new job plus you have to start over from scratch again and it may not neccesarily be better.

21,"I’m gonna have to put this into a list to explain it all.

PIANO: I’m forced to take piano lessons by my mom. At first I was willing to take them because I thought they were fun, but then as time went on, I started to hate it more and more. I didn’t realize it at first though. I just kinda started dreading going there. Then I eventually started to hate the teacher, got bored of the music, and I began to REALLY hate the theory. So I asked her if I could quit. She didn’t really respond so I stopped asking. Then a while later she started using my words against me saying the reason I was getting bad grades on piano was because I “was too lazy”. I tried to tell her I was bored of piano and that I wanted to quick but she just said that the only thing not boring for me is video games. I constantly get in trouble because I’m always in a bad mood after coming back from piano, and am usually told on by my brother about how bad I did. This piano thing is really killing me.. my entire day can be ruined just by the fact I have to go to piano class that day.

ACADEMIC TEAM: Same story as piano except I don’t hate everything. I just don’t really enjoy it. I mean, our academic team teacher even said she was disappointed in me herself. I haven’t had the guts to tell my mom that I want to quit academic team.

GRADES: My brother gets 96-100 in every class on his report card. I get 90-96 on my report card. My mom just hates me for this. She wants me to be just as good as my brother (even though she never says it). She says I’m lazy for not getting those grades, I will end up working at McDonald’s, and that the only reason I get bad grades is because of video games.

FAVORING: My mother favors my brother a lot. She always takes his side of the story. Always. I have no say in it.

BROTHER: My brother always wants to see me in trouble. He always tells on me for the slightest thing. He always bends the truth in his favor and when I try to explain the truth (my mom favors him and always takes his side) my brother always wins. I’ve stopped seeing him as a brother, and instead I see him as an obstacle that wants nothing more than to see me suffer. He also acts like he owns me.

THREATS: My mom usually threatens to hit me or give me away. Not much more than that though.

Okay, that’s most of it. The reason I decided to write this post is because of what happened today. Today my brother told on me for being bored and unresponsive in piano. My mom got mad and started giving me the “your lazy” lecture. My brother, being the bitch he is, took my mothers side and starting yelling at me too. I lashed out at my brother telling him about how he always acted like he owned me, and got in trouble for it. I’m currently in trouble right now because of what happened.

Sorry for the wall of text. Had to get this off my chest. If there’s more I need to tell, I’ll edit this post and put it in.

I work in a very stressful field but my place of work is wonderful, supportive and very flexible hours (I pretty much make my own schedule).  I like all of my coworkers and I get a lot of satisfaction from what I do, and I’m very good at it (or so I’ve been told, I suffer from bad imposter syndrome)

In December, I applied for a job with the government doing pretty much the same job, but this one is more well know (people either don’t know my job exists or get it confused/don’t know the difference for the job I applied to).

Over December and January I had a written exam and oral interview and on February 1st I got the notification I was on the eligibility list and when a placement came available, I’d be called.  Today I got the call for the job.  I’m struggling with accepting it.  I’ve tried to weigh the pros and cons.

The way I see it
Pros:
-it is a government job.  
-Good salary, good benefits/pension (better than I have now)
-more money
-no more on call
-no working weekends (I don’t and haven’t in a long time but it is a possibility in some cases)
-more opportunities for advancement (none with my current job for years)

Cons
-I love my job and we had layoffs recently so I’d feel like I’m betraying my current job 
-I’d work straight 8:15-4:15pm, with OT at 1.5 for anything over 4:15 and double time past 6
-slightly more stressful and more legal paperwork 
-I wouldn’t have the confidence I have now
-it’s 12 month temporary to start, which is how all government employees start in this field, and 99% get offered permanent
-id have to rework my gym schedule

29,"This is going to be sort of long. TLDR at bottom

Recently I’ve been going through absolute stressful hell. Between two car accidents on a brand new truck (none of which were my fault, one was a hit and run while it was parked, lost $500 on deductible) and a lot of personal issues that have stemmed from anxiety and depression. 

During the first accident I had just got my truck and was in the process of transferring my insurance from my old beater car. I got hit by a box truck that didn’t bother waiting for me to get ahead while an ambulance was coming behind us. I was caught in a technicality and was “not insured” on my truck. This happened back in November. As a result of this accident my license got suspended. 

Now here is where, in my opinion, things get really fucked up. 

Last Wednesday (21st) my mother received a letter in the mail notifying me about my suspension which was active on the 18th. That day my brother and I drove all the way from Atlanta where he lives, to northern Indiana where my mother lives to visit. My brother and mother both knew of my suspension but chose not to tell me because they didn’t want me to get grouchy on the way up. (I’m known for getting really grouchy in these stressful situations but never direct to one person unless it directly involves them).

My brother and I agreed to split the driving, but instead I ended up driving 9 out of 11 hours because he was too lazy and slept the whole time. All while he knew I didn’t have a valid license. Twice I was in a situation where two state troopers were behind me.

When we arrived there is when I was told about my suspension. I was obviously pissed and for the weekend he and I spent in Indiana i kept to myself because I was pissed at the both of them. They kept wondering what they did wrong.  

My mom tried apologizing to me about not telling me saying “I just didn’t want you to be stressed out and angry on your way down.” I responded with “Of course I’m going to be angry, my license is suspended for an accident that occurred 3 months ago, but you also lied to me and allowed “brother” to let me drive 9 hours instead of at least trying to minimize how much a drove. Would it have been better to be just mad at the situation instead of both that and the fact that the both of you kept it from me?” She stayed silent.

I stayed distant from my brother because I’m tired of trying to explain all the stupid things he’s done. We also work together. Today (1st) I made progress on the suspension but had to drop $250 on the reinstatement fee, not to happy about it but whatever, I need my license back. 

Same day, my brother asked me if I’m doing better and mention that he and his wife have to tip toe around me because of how pissy I’ve been. He kept saying that I can’t keep stressing out about the license thing until I finally, very lightly, confronted him about the lying part and making me drive so long. He tried to tell me that it was to help me,
So we could drive there calmly and cool because if he had told me he would’ve just stayed here in Atlanta and made me find a way to Indiana (I also had a job lined up to paint a house for a client in Indiana that he invited himself to help me with) and handle that whole situation because “it’s not any of my business.” 

After I told him that the whole situation was fucked up he proceeded to say “This is what I get for trying to help someone. For trying to be nice, now I’m pissed. I always try to help but it just backfires.” And ten basically tells me to go fuck off and organize the back of our work trailer. 

TLDR: Mother And brother didn’t tell me my license was suspended. Brother made me drive 9 out of 11 hours at night from Atlanta to northern Indiana. I was told about it on arrival and was pissed I wasn’t told before. Brother claims trying to help and gets pissy with me. Ive been miserable the past week and a half.

44,"I’ve always had this weird thing where I want to talk to just random people, but not in person.

45,"I was born in Houston, Texas and moved away when I was probably 3-5 yrs old. I’ve only ever lived in Wyoming after that and then WA where I reside now. All of my family on both my mom and dad’s side all live in Texas. My only brother, my mom and I are the only ones living in WA. I desperately miss Texas and have a deep down urge to want to move there. But moving there would change and mean a lot of things. 

For one my TX fam and i have a good relationship but they aren’t very empathetic. Moving there wouldn’t necessarily be for my family,  but of course for the first time in my life i’d be living close to them. 

So what i mean is, as i get older, i have a passion to move somewhere i love very dearly. Yet, couldn’t ever imagine leaving my mom and, my boyfriend is from PNW and don’t really think he would want to move there. But, things change you never know. I just struggle with this urge daily. I miss Houston. I miss Texas. It’s such a big part of me and who I am. I LOVE the pnw and also wouldn’t want to move but...there’s more to life than that. 

The advice i’m asking for is what to do in this situation? What type of questions should i be asking myself for a decision this big? Is it wrong to want this? I’m so young (21F) but have big desires. And I miss my family. ",02Mar2018,1
46,"I've been working for the same company of about 80-90 employees for the last six years. I'm not a college graduate and am currently making around 75k/year. 

The company I work for is in BAD shape, and will probably go bankrupt / shutdown within the next 6 months to a year. Outstanding debt to the IRS for back taxes, tons of money out in loans etc. 

I'm a hard worker and always rise to challenges, I have since day one. I take on more work when needed, learn new skills to make myself more marketable and able to achieve different things. This had lead to the owner thinking that she can just dump tons of different tasks on me and I'll just deal with. I'm currently performing the jobs of three different people (that were fired or laid off over the past couple of years and never replaced), and I got word today that they're laying off the three people that I currently supervise. This would leave me as the only employee in my department, and I don't think that I can handle it.

I haven't been happy in a long time, and have been watching the owner make horrible decisions that don't make any sense, cost us money, and ultimately, loses us customers. Things that seem so obvious to the rest of the company he ignores, and goes on his own path.

My gut tells me that if they lay off the three people I supervise tomorrow, that I should put in my two weeks notice. I don't think I can handle the extra pressure, workload, and stress, nor do I really want to. The downside to this, is that I'm not the most fiscally responsible adult, have a fair amount of debt, and have adapted to a lifestyle that fits my salary without saving any substantial amount of savings. Quitting would mean that I wouldn't be eligible for unemployment and I'd have to find something super fast, with nothing lined up. I think that I could float myself for a month or two. Hindsight is 20/20.

While I have a bunch of marketable skills at this point, I don't have a college degree. My current salary is awesome and I'm scared that I won't be able to find anything else similar if I quit. I'm also scared as this is BY FAR the most substantial part of my resume, and if I quit I'm worried that the owner will take it personally and refuse to do any kind of recommendation letter or talk trash if future employers called him. 

I'm in a place where I don't really know what to do, and I just want someone to tell me which path in the fork to take. ",02Mar2018,1

59,"The situation is that my wife is pregnant and due in July. I went to speak with my HR rep to talk about what steps I need to take in order to comply with all company regulations regarding taking a short leave after. The catch is that I won't be eligible for FMLA leave until my one year anniversary in October.


My plan is to take two weeks right after the birth using the PTO I have saved up. She said that's fine, but I may get a point because I don't have enough PTO to cover the whole time I'll be gone and I'll have a short check. Then in October once my wife's FMLA is up I want to take another two weeks using FMLA so she can ease back into her job and not have to worry about our child as he gets acclimated to daycare.


The first meeting I had with her, she told me that FMLA doesn't apply to fathers when the birth of a child is the reason (not true). She also told me that I didn't need to provide any written notice of a planned absence (also not true). Then today, she told me that fathers can take FMLA time off, but the parents had to divide the 12 weeks of FMLA leave between them so that if my wife took the whole 12 weeks, I couldn't take any. (again, not true).


From everything I've read in the employee handbook and from quick Google searches, both parents can take 12 weeks of FMLA leave after the birth of a child. Only if they work for the same company will the 12 weeks have to be divided among them. My company handbook also states that written warning of at least 30 days in advance (if possible) should be given. Obviously I can't give them an exact date for the birth, but I can give them an idea of when it will be.


I'm not sure if she is actively trying to dissuade me from taking my rightful FMLA leave in October (illegal) or if she is just incompetent (I'd guess the latter) but I want to get this straightened out ASAP. 

I have a meeting with the head of my department tomorrow and I'm not sure how to handle it. I don't want to make any enemy of my HR rep, but I also want to make sure I get everything I'm entitled to by law. Any advice would be welcome. Thank you.",02Mar2018,1
63,"So let me start off by saying my friend’s dad (who’s probably 50-60ish) has had a history of alcoholism. Lately he has seemingly vanished, ie not responding to phone calls, hasn’t paid bills, hasn’t been seen at his house, and his car is still in the driveway and hasn’t talked to anyone. It’s like he dropped off the face of the earth a month ago. My friend and his sister get their rent money/food from the Dad (friend and sister are in college) and he has not transferred any money and now my friend’s sister is facing eviction and already doesn’t have power/running water. The same is about to happen to my friend since he needs to pay pills. Last time their dad vanished, we looked inside his house and found lots of empty vodka bottles which made my friend and I panic. We call the police and fire department and they break inside only to reveal he isn’t there. A couple weeks later he finally gets in touch and has been in the hospital for pneumonia. He was actually pissed off that he had so many missed calls and chewed my friend out for not leaving him alone. I don’t understand why he doesn’t inform anyone in his family about where he is, as it’s very worrisome and confusing. This time he’s been gone for nearly a month again and his family has been calling jails/hospitals but no luck. I want to be supportive and help my friend but I have no idea what to do. I think they’re filing a police report tomorrow and I’m not sure in what ways that can help, but I think action needs to be taken. I’m trying to be supportive for my friend but the situation also angers me. I don’t understand why my friend’s dad would make everyone (extended family included) worried about him. Where and why the f*** would a father vanish on their kids?

I’ve had low iron before but never had symptoms this bad.

Symptoms continued and then my stool was becoming really hard to pass and I developed acid reflux. I had a stool and breath test and that was normal as well! I got more tests done a couple days ago and everyone was normal except my blood sugar, which was low. Bad blood levels would theoretically explain why I’ve been so tired, BUT it was normal when my symptoms first started. I have started eating healthily over the past few weeks but I remember I did used to binge eat junk food so often for years (I’m 18 and age huge high sugar, high fat meals almost every single day for like 3 years straight. I’ve been eating more healthily for the past couple days). Today I had dark chocolate, not even a huge amount and now I feel anxious and even more fatigued than I was before so I definitely have blood sugar problems but a) I’m not sure how to treat high/low blood sugar or prediabetes b) I checked online and diabetic symptoms typically do not result in changes of stool colour c) I had fatigue even when my blood sugar symptoms were normal.

I’m thinking possibly I have bile salt deficiency which would also explain my acid reflux but apparently it’s a rare condition? I know I possibly have both prediabetes and another condition.

76,"Hi There,

I am looking for a bit of advice in regards to my thinking patterns and changing my life outlook. I am a male in my early twenties and close to graduating my computer science degree. I just finished up a co-op with a bank.

While at the bank, I struggled everyday. I felt like what I was working on was not what I should be doing, I felt bored and listless and that I could be doing something much more valuable. I was a software engineer there and I have some skill so I was put to use, but building a web app just didn't excite me. I had daily meetings I would attend and I just didn't feel committed. The sad thing is I don't think it was the job, it was me, it was my outlook, If i had the management position, or the architect, or the QA testers, would I be happy? I'm no means depressed and have a healthy lifestyle. I meditate everyday and am doing relatively well in terms of physical/mental health. I consider myself extroverted and emotionally intelligent, but also still have that analytical thinking capacity. I just didn't see the value in anything I did. 

NOW, id be remiss to note that this ""overthinking"" is a common theme with me and always has been. I use the app headspace to help control it by practicing mindful meditation and journaling my thoughts. But this overthinking applies to other domains in my life as well.

So, could anyone offer me some career advice firstly on the best way to assess where I am and the types of jobs that might suit me better. Also, any links to videos/articles or books that deal with this topic of finding meaning in your work and being less of an over thinker. Ultimately, I really just want to feel satisfied when Im at work and that I am putting myself to work that I know I can value and is stimulating. I don't care about pay nor do I care about status.

77,"Okay so this might be a long one, so let me start.

Im currently a student at a slightly prestigious technical Institute (not MIT), in the physics major curriculum. I chose physics as far back as 8th grade, through a combination of reading ""a brief history of space and time"" and religiously watching ""through the worm hole "" I really really was interested in astrophysics. This interest wained over time, and eventually when my high school counselors said ""so are you still interested in astrophysics"" I'd just say yes to get done with the meeting. When I got to high school physics, I hated it. It was boring, uninteresting, and all around just awful. This should have been a warning, but I just thought ""oh this is basic stuff I'll get done with in a year and go to what I really want to do"".

Fast forward to this semester and I'm failing UP 1. I don't go to the class, I hate everything about it. I hate the topics, I hate the people, I hate the atmosphere of the classroom, I hate physics. The other math and science classes (such as chem and calc) I deal with and get and can enjoy sometimes, but physics I just can't stand. I haven't gone to a class in 3 weeks. My academic advisor told me to give career services a call, which I will tomorrow. I'm seriously considering changing majors.

The problem? There are three

1.) I have no idea what I want to do in life. I want to enjoy my career to the point where I never want to retire, but I also want to make decent money (nothing extravagant like a million dollars or something, I don't want to be wickedly rich, if I can get 6 figures, I'd be happy). I cannot think of anything, I've never really had a passion for anything. I was fairly smart in school and really had a passion for learning new things. I was good at the sciences and maths, but I really think I excelled I'm history, it was very enjoyable to me and I was able to pass the APUSH test with a 5 without really studying (I'm not bragging, I did awful on the Calc and Chem AP test, and got a 4 on the English).

2. I don't want to leave my school. I love the area, I'm starting to make friends, I have really nice scholarships and grants, and I am considering rushing a fraternity next year. I commute so the price also reduces from their, and this leads me into my third point

3. Emotionally abusive father. My father, to anyone looking at what he's done for me, would call him a saint. He's paid for my two semesters of college (about $18k so far) and is letting me live with him rent free. He's a very seasoned project manager so he makes about $110k a year, so it's not crippling him financially, but I was raised by my mom and we were dirt poor my early life so that amount of money boggles me and I appreciate it dearly. The downside? He treats me like he's a loan shark rather than a father, and he is an extreme alcoholic of 30 years, destroying his mental state. A typical day, hes drunk by 4 pm to the point where he can barely stand and he shouts everything he says. If I forgot to do something (put dishes in dishwasher, put clothes away, etc) he shouts at me, saying I'm a fuck up or even calling me the n- word (I am 100% white). Whenever i say something to him while he's drunk, he immeadiatly forgets, and when he has to tell me something, he forgets he told me and tells me again 10 minutes later, by 8 pm he's asked me the same question about 6 times, getting angrier each time he ask. He accuses me of lying and being lazy, he accused me of taking his pain meds one time, and I thought he was going to hit me because I swore I didn't take them (I literally said ""I've never taken your pills, why would I take your fucking pain meds""). He's 50 and I honestly think he's showing signs of early dimentia I'm 18 close to 19, an adult who works and goes to college, and it's all very demeaning. If I bring up anything about college (say he asks me about a class, and I say ""it's difficult, I think I'm having problems with it"") he will over exageratingly slam his head into his hands, shake his head back and forth, and Huff very loudly, like I'm 5 years old. He will them ask ""you have any idea how much fucking money I'm spending on this? You better"" and then brings up how I better have a paid internship by my third year because he isn't helping past that point. His attitude and abuse stresses me out to the point where I lie about how I'm doing, and will stay on campus or in my room to avoid him. I can't live on campus (don't have the money, especially if he doesn't pay). I came close to vomiting the other day when I saw my failing grade because I worried what he would say (got all A's last semester except for one D in another physics class and he was very mad, saying I was wasting money). If I change majors, especially to something he might not like, not only would I possibly lose his financial support, but a place to live, a mode of transportation (he let's me drive his car, but I pay for the gas and upkeep) and I might be forced to go to a smaller college back home, which would honestly make me just not want to go to college. 

Adding to this, when I was 10 my mom met my future step dad. He and my father are alike in many ways, he would provide me with cash and things like a good parent would if I earned it or was good. However, he was very emotionally abusive, leading to a weird relationship between us 8 years later. A day would not go by where we wouldn't argue, he would always been my ass about something, and never would geniuenly just talk to me. It got better as I got older, but it's really left me with no real male figure I've been able to look up to in my life. Everyone we've ever been around would say ""he treats that kid like shit"" and even my mother acknowledge that she feels sick to her stomach for letting him treat me the way he did. This leads me to believe I'm not being over dramatic about my biological father 


This whole thing is stressing me out, I hate my major and feel trapped. I don't know what I want to do, and I feel like the only person who would really support me is my mother, but she's not financially well off right now and can only provide moral support. Please help

sophomore year of college , we'd dated for a very short period of time and broken up for both having severe mental health issues, at one point she traveled abroad and at several points after transferring schools she dated other guys, still in a bad place I often got angry with her about how she said she wouldn't see other guys so quickly after we'd broken up( although it had been awhile not to mention people are allowed to change there minds) but to make it short I was being aggressive towards her choice in the pursuit of a relationship , other things had happened up to and after this point that I can't remember the details of clearly so I won't include them. 

I'd definitely said some hurtful things that I can't forgive myself for that I'm sure she hasn't either when I was in the darkest parts of my untreated depression . Now over the past year or so things had slowed down, communication wise. And after about a month of nothing , she blocked me. I was very upset at first but with some time I realize that a lot of my behavior was charged with jealousy , and just general toxicity at some points and I assume that outweighed the bad causing her to leave. I've been trying to figure out how to be better to those I care about without being a jerk

87,"Hi all! The title is very straightforward. My SO and I both have a job and with my SO graduating from college this May, we were looking towards renting our first apartment together. Several questions

1.) What should I be asking when looking for more information about a given apartment complex?  
2.) What red flags should I watch for?  
3.) Anything else I should know before doing this? Things, or tips you wish you knew before searching?  
4.) I know the process probably varies place to place, but what is the general process from start to living in the apartment? What does the process look like and how long should we budget for searching?

90,"Hi Reddit

Myself and my girlfriend are going through a rough time and there are two major reasons why. First reason was earlier on in the relationship I sexted a rando girl I met cause my GF said it wouldn't be bad but it was, she was the one sexting me on the account (snapchat) and then that night went off the deep end with harming. I felt like utter shit like I lost a part of me and every day for the next few weeks she would bring it up joke about it say she’s over it then be super mad about it again. We eventually moved past that but I was having another problem with an ex-friend/roommate of mine who I was sleeping with before my relationship with my current girlfriend. My old roommate owes me alot of money upwards of 2 grand and to evade this was changing the story of how we slept together for so long (Not going into details sorry) but I didn’t tell my current girlfriend cause I was scared from her past it was going to fuck her up really badly. I caved in one night and told her now she is more mad about that than the sexting thing. Saying that I just want to go back to her because when she had nowhere else to stay other than the streets I let her stay on our couch. Everynight before we go to sleep she tells me I am more abusive than her exes who actually hit her and cheated on her says that she can’t look at me or touch me. Now she says she can’t even trust a single word I say cause “It’s so easy to lie to her” even tho it killed me to do. She says I don’t show her I love her in anyway and always put her second when I have put her ahead of my own career right now ahead of my gaming ahead of my social life she is always my #1 though and #1 priority that day. I make her breakfast cause she has an eating disorder make sure she has premade lunches to eat that day if I am at work, if I am at home I make her the lunches I prepare dinner shower with her not cause it’s a steamy shower with my partner to make sure she cleans herself and doesn’t harm/blackout. I am broke, in a lot of debt on the edge of losing my apartment she bails me out alot financially and I am so grateful for that I just don’t know what to do. I haven’t spoken to any friends or family or anyone about this I feel so alone I just need help on what to do about this.

91,"My school is set up so that students can choose from an enormous variety of classes, but for any of them to matter you have to take 2 years of it. We also have minimum graduation requirements and recommended courses for college that we really have to take.

I took journalism this year but it didn’t count for anything, and journalism 2 is next year if I get in. That covers some of the graduation and college recommended courses, and I could continue all until my senior year.

The issue is that I don’t know if I have time or if even like the class in the first place. I have less than a month to sort everything out, so it’s basically now or never. I also have to start deciding what I’m doing over the summer.

My mom thinks I should volunteer and not do summer school, but I’m thinking about not taking an AP history class sophomore year and using that free space to take journalism instead, then fulfilling my history requirement with world history over the summer instead. If I did that, I don’t know if I’d have time to volunteer and volunteering is a huge part of college apps. 

There’s also clubs, lots of them. I’m only in 2 right now and I feel like I should be in more. Next year I want to apply to some clubs that specialize in community service, but damn it’d take tons of time.

I’d be volunteering and taking World History this summer and J2, trig BC and calc AB, kinesiology 2 (should I be doing a sport??), English 2H, chemistry, and Spanish 2 next year as well as joining a volunteering club, one that does life-skill competitions, and another for national history day. But, I really don’t know if that’s enough.

I need scholarships badly if I’m going to go to college since my family doesn’t make enough to financially support all 3 of the kids in my family for college, but not little enough to qualify for any substantial financial aid.

96,"So I work as a weekend only nurse at the local hospital. I work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. Worked the same job for about 4 years day shift with self-scheduling. I switched due to childcare and my families schedule. When I switched to the weekend only program I signed a new contract for the $10 more an hour so my new base pay is $10 more than what it was before, with additional pay for night shift and being a charge nurse. 

Well while working weekends only, I got pregnant. About 6 months into my pregnancy I went into preterm labor. I should've gone on light duty, but my boss had said she had no work for me to do. So not wanting to use all my fmla and pto, I continued to work. Made it to 35 weeks and could no longer do it. I went to HR and Thur had plenty of work for me to do in clinics. While at my light duty job, I got a call fromHR saying that while on light duty, I would not earn my weekend only pay, I would earn my old base pay. They then said I didn't have to worry about daycare anyways (I actually did because it was 5 days a week I had to pay for daycare while on light duty compared to 1). It was none of their business. My personal finances were my business not there's and I had signed a contract raising my base pay. I was shocked and did not want to stress myself out. I was in the middle of my first day of light duty job and didn't want to let it ruin my opportunity to still work. I asked if my PTO I had would be able to be stretched over my 12 weeks of FMLA. HR said yes they would make that work, and at the weekend only pay, I was surprised. 

Only about a week after I started light duty, I was induced due to pre-eclampsia and I had an abruption. My son has heart issues since birth. I cant help but feel guilty had I went on light duty earlier, had I just went on leave earlier, every patient I lifted while pregnant, every early labor scare, if I would've done things differently he would've been healthy. Well about week 9 of maternity leave rolls around and it's payday, check my account before I pay some bills, I have $35 deposited...I should've had about 1,200. I called HR to ask the woman I spoke to about my leave and pto, she did not call back. I called back Monday and she answered. She said that my boss had entered numbers in wrong and now I have no more PTO and the remaineder of my maternity leave I would not get anything deposited. 

I am thankful my son is alive, I am thankful I am too after a fought delivery and many complications, I'm thankful I have a job, and could take all 12 weeks, but I feel as though I was taken advantage of. About a week after returning to work I get a bill in the mail from HR for my benefits. Because I had no paycheck one pay period I had to pay out of pocket to cover my benefits. I'm just so upset with myself for allowing this to happen. I want to talk to someone at work more about it, I honestly don't know where to start or if I'm just being over dramatic. I feel as though asking for back pay when they payed me below my base pay or having that money go toward the bill for my benefits would be reasonable, but I really just don't know. I also was wanting to move back to days, I was told I would always have a day position waiting by my manager,but I know that is never garunteed and if I bring this issue up I more that likely will not get my day shift position back.",02Mar2018,2

98,"Here I go making another pointless post. I wonder if I'll look back at this one two years from now wishing I had done something then? 

I live with my parents and I turn 21 in a couple of months. I'm not doing anything to better myself, my life revolves around video games. I'm just slowly deteriorating mentally and physically and at some point I'm going to reach a tipping point and kill myself. I don't want to die, I just feel like I'll end up killing myself in the future if my life continues to slowly decline like it is now.

I tried going to a actual community college last year and I didn't even finish a semester because I started playing League of Legends again. I think that's the real reason to why I quit school, but I like to tell myself it's because I didn't want to be stuck in the shitty fucking state of Georgia for four years. I guess the bright side is that I'm not in debt at all, but the reason I'm not in debt is because my school was being completely paid for by my step-dad's GI Bill. How fucking great is that? Not good enough for me apparently, I'd rather throw away a free education for video games and the chance to move. I don't know how I'm able to live with myself. I guess I make these pointless posts because I'm too embarrassed to tell anybody I know about this.

I keep telling myself I'm going to save enough money to move west to somewhere like Colorado and I'll think about paying myself through school there. How much money is enough though, don't think I'll ever have enough. I don't even know how I'm going to manage the moving part without ending up homeless. 

I mean I can barely even function as an adult right now living with my parents, how would I ever be able to make it on my own? I can't even take care of myself. I'm not overweight or anything, I just can't do what NEEDS to be done. My wisdom teeth have needed to come out since I was 15, I've had a chipped tooth for the past two years and I just recently got a abscess. I don't even know what it is actually, it's on my front gums, it's red/yellow, inflamed and it hurts when I push on it. 

I don't know what I should do, most people would probably answer that question simply with, ""go back to school."" I know that wouldn't turn out well for me right now though, I'd start out with a ton of motivation and dedication but it would slowly fade as I realize I'll be stuck in Georgia commuting to a community college everyday for 4 years with no social life. I wish I had done well in high school so I could have gone to a 4 year school and lived on campus and just focused on my education, but I'm a overall failure unfortunately.",02Mar2018,7

107,"Hi, 

I'm a student (20) in Malaysia's National University and from time to time my little sister (12) would give me a call, crying, because of our older brother (22) abusing him. We have both our parents at home; my dad has retired (from the Army) and my mom is still working as a teacher who comes back home late. 

The situation here is my older brother would abuse her in a lot of ways that are seen by ignorant Malaysians as just ""siblings"" kind of way to get along. So my parents are enablers in this case. They may have stopped him halfway or told him not to do it but obviously they aren't enough, as it still happens and it makes my little sister cry almost everyday. My parents also don't comfort my little sister or defends her as much so she has nobody to turn to except me. 

The kinds of abuse she received is:

Physical abuse and psychological abuse

He has slapped, punched, choked, shoved her if my little sister doesn't follow his orders. His orders are usually ""well-intended"" such as reminding her to pray, eat, take a shower or study (which is why my parents don't do anything about it). He hides under those facade to abuse my sister. In fact, yesterday I have sent a message to our family chat group to tell everybody that he's abusing our sister and he should stop. In return, he has choked my sister today for reporting the incident to me. I know sending another message would just make him beat her more, so I don't know what to do as I can't be physically at home. 

He has also used terms to belittle her such as ""cibai"", ""kafir"" or ""babi"" all are degrading Malaysian terms. My parents don't call him out on this at all, but once my little sister talks back to defend herself, it'd be her fault for talking back to an older sibling. 

I don't know what I should do. I've sent another message to the family chat group and turns out my other 2 siblings are AGAINST ME for trying to address this issue. They've attacked me by bringing up my past faults and said I'm pretending to be a saint. 

In the end, the whole family is being ignorant, except me. Please help?

A) I only act weird with people I personally know, so it's obviously a gal I know.

B) Why won't my friend tell me who said it? Is she really letting me being insulted and not telling me who said it so I can stop being their friend?

131,"I’ve never really seen sex as something that I needed to chase after. Even in high school, when I dated girls, sex just wasn’t on my mind. I liked having a personal connection with another person, but I always struggled with intimacy. Even little things like holding hands just didn’t appeal to me, and the girls that I dated in high school broke up with me out of frustration when they discovered how uncomfortable I was with kissing them; hugging them, etc.

Now that I’m older, I’m starting to feel a sense of urgency. Most people my age have already had sex multiple times, with multiple partners. I feel like I need to play catch-up before I’m left behind in the dating world. What happens when I meet a girl that I really connect with, and I’m completely unable to please her in bed because of my lack of experience? Having to explain why I’m still a virgin in my late-20’s is not a conversation I want to have.

All that I know about sex comes from porn or movies that I’ve seen, and even then, I wasn’t paying super-close attention to what sexual positions were the most ideal; I’m not glued to the screen, fascinated by it like most people are. Even the porn I view doesn’t involve actual sex. It’s just fetish stuff like transformation/inflation. Physically impossible in the bedroom obviously, and not something you can replicate in real life.

One of my friends suggested hiring an escort. At least then I can say I’ve had sex, even if it was uncomfortable or I didn’t enjoy it. Having sex is pretty much a rite of passage in society at this point, and even though I’m not really in a hurry to do it, I feel like I need to do it, just to say I did.

**TL;DR** I haven’t had sex yet, and I’m wondering if I need to have a sense of urgency about getting laid as soon as possible so I can check it off the list of things that I need to do in order to be considered “normal”.",02Mar2018,2

135,"Hi, firstly I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my dilemma.

I am turning 22 mid this year, completing my final year of university and working part time in the field I will be graduating in.

I'll spare you the details, but can give you a pretty vivid idea of my situation. Asian, Catholic, youngest child (female), with old-school parents. They have always been anti-boys, anti-social life and anti-happiness, but I've been fighting for my freedom since I was a young teen.  The plan has always been to save up and move out the day after I graduate (I figured I couldn't afford to move out earlier (literally).)

But now that it's closing in, I can't help but feel anxious and slightly guilty about abandoning them right after they've finished with ""raising"" me.

I've heard all kinds of advice and I have tried everything:
-Speaking with them calmly and rationally (turns into a screaming match)
-Speaking to them angrily (turns into a screaming match)
-Rebelling (turns into a screaming match with a touch of abuse)

All of the above have come from close friends, and I'm afraid I'm left with no choice but to pack up and go. I'd like to hear some wisdom from a different perspective or anything that would help the leaving process.

146,"I know the girl from my degree program from 4 years ago, she was in the same class as me, and she called me last night from a bar via WhatsApp saying she is wasted and ran away from hospital because they were threatening to lock her up.

I went and found her in town and took her back to my place to sober up and so I could keep an eye on her whilst she slept it off.

She told me a lot of things like she is under treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, she was sexual abused as a child, that she made a suicide attempt last week by taking all her meds at once, and that she is afraid she will go home and commit suicide. She had been off her meds for a week apparently and in and out of hospital 4 times in the last week. The most recent time she left the hospital apparently she got verbally abusive and trashed the room she was in, because she was afraid they would send her to get locked up.

I don't know her hardly at all, she was in my class and about 6 months ago we bumped into each other in town and went for a coffee.

This morning I took her to the hospital (of her own free will) and we saw a Psych doctor who gave her a renewal for her meds. I wasn't in the consult, but she told me that the doctor said she would need to meet with her specialist (the head of psychiatric at the hospital) on Tuesday but that he is on vacation until then. In the meantime the offer either to admit her to the hospital (which she definitely doesn't want to do) or to stay with someone instead of being alone.

I have only a few contacts with people who know her, her best friend who lives in the USA (this is taking place in France). I am in touch with him but he is of limited help as he can't do much and doesn't have contact with her family. Her family live on another continent, except for her brother who lives 1000km away. She doesn't want any of them to know about anything that happened because she's ashamed and embarrassed and doesn't want to burden them. She gave me contact info for another friend who never picked up or replied to my calls and texts.

I don't know what to do. Right now she can stay on my couch but that is clearly not a long term solution. I don't know if I should contact her brother (I wouldn't even know how) or if I should try to look up some other people who I know she was friends with years ago when we knew each other, even though she said she doesn't want to burden them.

What should I do?

The background is that she and I have known each other for several years through school, and even after graduating, though we don't work together, we still make time to see each other once every few months. When we're together, it's totally effortless and we both have a great time. Had we both been single when we met (I was married - yes, my wife knows about her - and she was also attached to the guy that she would ultimately marry), I like to think that we would have wound up together. If I'm honest with myself, I have the same feelings for her that I have for my wife (yes, I know that's messed up, but that's another post for another time). Anyway, the most recent time that I saw her, she enthusiastically invited me to her baby shower. I tried to play it off like guys don't go to baby showers, but she was insistent and told me that it was co-ed and that I could bring my wife (who despises her, but again, another post for another time).

I'm scared that I might get a criminal record since I'm over eighteen (I'm twenty-one). However, it's the first time I've been caught with cannabis.

So, basically, I'm not allowed to smoke in my house and I usually go out by myself, and smoke a joint or two while walking around my town. We're currently suffering from extremely heavy snow here so lighting up has been a right pain in the arse recently, but I still go out anyway.

So, I decided to go out yesterday night for a walk and brought my tin with me. I smoked half a joint (it went out due to the wind and snow, and I struggled to light it again). I went to a petrol station for some food, and I was the only person there besides the cashier. My half-smoked joint was in my tin and I was ready to try to get it smokable again once the wind calmed down. I was not expecting any other customers to come in because the snow has literally made everywhere ghost towns.

Well, just my luck, two policemen came in for coffees and were standing behind me as I was being served. I was desperate to get out because I knew they could smell weed, and I could hear them mentioning it. 

I walked out casually and I could see them follow me moments after and I was stopped. I got a little panicky and I had to be put in a car and driven to the station because they couldn't search me as I was freezing, so I was technically arrested. If not, detained.

I never really gave them any attitude, I sighed in frustration a few times but I negotiated nonetheless. They searched me at the station, found my tin which had my smoked joint, and twelve other pre-rolled ones that I was going to smoke later. 

They took my details, they know my name and where I work. They confiscated my stuff and gave me a lift home. I feel like I am completely fucked and my work are very intolerent to the use of drugs. Could I be fired, or is it likely that the police will notify them?

167,"Just discovered this subreddit, so please be gentle.

Here’s the brief summary: had a decent job for three years but there was no growth, so I took a 9-month career break and travelled. Came back to my hometown and for the past (almost) year I’ve been working a low paying job, but it was enjoyable when I started. This job is no longer shiny and exciting, rather it’s stressing me to the point that I’m getting sick before I leave for work (or just straight up crying cheap mascara tears down my face). And even worse, I’m so depressed and crunched for time that when I’m not at work, I’m simply sleeping and dreaming of a time when I wasn’t a total failure with my 30s creeping up on me. 

Here’s where it gets difficult: I’m in love with another city. I have a few connections out in New City (it’s across the country from where I am now). I’ve done the research and visited there twice to ensure it’s a place I’d like to live. There is a college for grad school I’d like to attend, as well. I’ve met with a few people at said grad school, too. Like I said, I’ve done the research.

The plan was to finish my lease in the late summer, quit my job and head to New City with or without a job (I’ve got about $10k saved). I’m more than happy to fold sweaters for a living in my late-20s (for a bit, at least). And I’m sure many folks can remind me how hard it is to apply for jobs when you simply don’t live in the area you’re applying. My connections keep encouraging me to use their address on my resume...

However, this current job is so lifesucking that my performance has dropped. I got a written warning the other day for low sales. Signatures were exchanged and it’s almost like I can smell me being fired in the near future. 

I’ve dipped my toes into a staffing group to help me find temp work until I’m ready to go, but no biters yet. Thought, it’s only been a week.

So - here’s the question: should I wait out the current situation in my home town or just go to New City now? Or change everything completely? Or just play in traffic?",02Mar2018,2
168,"I am fairly good at my work, and fairly busy, and therefore occasionally receive lines from people such as:

* Your [work] was so good, wow!
* I know you must be super busy, but...
* [Our team] is doing so well!

On one hand, I know that these can be 100% innocuous lines delivered simply by positive people, or those that recognise that I do good work, or those that have a genuine request for me but acknowledge I may be busy.

*On the other hand*, I have some paranoia that people around me try to flatter me / recognise how busy I am because they realise I have something of an Atlas complex (believing I carry the weight of my world on my shoulders and all that) and can use that to appeal to me to get what they want.

This would be quite Machiavellian of them, and I do not expect that everyone who says these things would have that intention. However, I am around quite political / educated people with plenty of negotiation experience, some of whom COULD discern these things about me and try to use them to their advantage.

So, that is the first concern — how can I distinguish if people are 'trying out' these phrases to see if they get me to do something?

The second concern is — how can I tell if they really do work on me? I like to think they don't (e.g. I recognise the flattery, tell myself it won't work on me, and then reconsider the request), but I often end up trying to accommodate them regardless. I have trouble distinguishing whether this is just a sign of decent character (my actions *out* of this context, I think, show I am relatively charitable and proactively help others) or whether it is actually working on me despite my self-refrains.

178,"I stay over his apartment practically every night, although I do have an apartment of my own and we don't ""officially"" live together. A few weeks ago, I noticed a moth in the house. It was really small and hard to catch, but I hate bugs, and wanted it gone. I asked him to try to kill it and he brushed me off saying ""it's just a moth, they're harmless."" I felt dismissed, but whatever, not my apartment. A few days later, I saw 2 moths. I explained to him that they've already reproduced, and we needed to kill them both. He agreed that if they're reproducing, that's not a good sign, and he killed them. Obviously those weren't the only two moths in the apartment though because now it's gotten out of control.

This week, we've found larvae on the ceilings and COUNTLESS moths flying all over the house. Yesterday, I hit my breaking point with the moths while he was at class. The larvae were in multiple rooms and there were so many moths. I tried to kill all the moths I could (minimum 20), and I killed all the larvae I could too, but I'm short, and couldn't reach the ones on the ceilings. While he was gone, I researched the problem online, identified the particular kind of moths (Indian meal moths), and figured out what we needed to do. 

I called him once he was done with class to let him know about my concerns, and when he got home I showed him how bad it was. I also read to him what I had found on the internet as far as solving the problem. He then proceeded to tell me that I'd been going on about this for too long and was ""assaulting him with information"" and that he had JUST come home and that I'm acting like he/we haven't been doing anything to mitigate the problem.

I feel like he doesn't understand that ""just killing them"" isn't really a solution at this point. I even explained to him that it's not like I feel like he or we haven't done anything, but that what we've been doing a) is not working and b) is just barely scratching the surface of the issue. 

How can I get my boyfriend to validate my concerns rather than dismiss me? And also does anyone have any tips (from experience) on getting rid of Indian meal moths? ",02Mar2018,1

183,"Obviously using a throwaway here: I am a 20 year old who attends community college full-time and works a part-time job. I still live at home with my parents, who are generally very supportive and nice to me. They help me pay for college and let me live at home rent free. Their only condition is that as long as I live under their roof, I follow their rules and do my portion of the household chores. The condition for them paying part of my tuition is that I get good grades. That’s all fine and perfectly acceptable to me. It’s a pretty sweet deal actually. However, my parents are firm believers in corporal punishment: If I ever break any of their rules, don’t do my chores to their satisfaction, or receive a single poor grade, I still get spanked like when I was a child. Just yesterday I got my butt paddled for forgetting to take out the garbage can and recycling bin on pickup day. 

Needless to say, I am very unhappy with this part of our arrangement. I find it extremely humiliating to be physically punished like that. I am technically an adult, after all! Really the only way to get away from this, is for me to move out and stop accepting financial support from them. This is something I don’t think I can currently afford. My part-time job pays just enough to cover my portion of my tuition, and I really don’t want to take out student loans (I plan on transferring to a four year institution after finishing up community college, so I possibly will need to take out a few loans in the near future, even though my parents have already said they’d consider continuing paying part of my tuition). 

What can I do? Again, I love my parents and we generally have a decent relationship. I truly appreciate their support and really like living in their house for the most part. I just don’t want to be spanked anymore!

We're pretty successful, put-together people. We both came from abusive backgrounds and have a genetic history of mental health issues that make us hesitant to have kids-- even though we're both pretty awesome ourselves. My wife can be anxious, with health issues being a trigger for her, and it would be  very difficult for me to choose to subject her to child birth.

Adoption, to me, is the most ethical option if someone can find it in themselves to do so, rather than adding a new life to a crowded world. While I still eat meat even though I know its not the best thing-- this may be something that I could do to make the world a better place.

Adoption may also benefit me over having a child of my own. I have a tendency to get overwhelmed, much as I love kids, especially when sleep is interfered with, and adopting an older child might allow me to be a better parent while letting me skip some of the years where I worry I might have trouble being fair to my spouse. I'm sure I would force myself to be a good parent to a younger child-- but it would be tough to sacrifice sleep and self-care while still maintaining my current workload and responsibilities.

My wife and I-- teachers-- we obviously love children. She works with second graders and I work with middle schoolers. I have worked in the poorest district in the US with many students who were in the foster system or homeless-- I can empathize and help kids who's lives haven't been perfect and who may have triggers or behavior issues. That being said, I am not interested in a special needs child, just because part of what I would enjoy in raising a child is helping someone grow beyond what I was able to-- to maximize their potential (hopefully in a non-psychotic pressurey way).

213,"Everyone involved in this is 25-26. Sorry it's long.

I currently live with a roommate (Joe), who is a guy I've known essentially my entire life. We've lived together for 2 years now, and 2 years in college. Used to, we would hang out quite a bit, watch movies, go grab a bite, etc. He was a guy I considered my good friend, and he would invite me to a lot of stuff with his group of friends. He's much more well liked, popular, outgoing, etc. than I am. I'm liked by people, but don't make friends easily, so him inviting me to stuff was really appreciated. 

He has a female friend (Mary) who used to be at our apartment all the time. Like, on average 3-4 days a week. She clearly enjoys her friendship with Joe, and because she was always over, I got to know her and over the last year we've become pretty good friends as well. I like some things that she's into that Joe isn't, so she shows me those things, makes jokes she knows I'll like, and we just generally get along pretty well. 

All three of us used to hang out quite a bit, movies at least once a week and we'd play games, go out and eat, things like that. We hung out constantly, and I liked it because basically I had made a new friend at the age of 26 which is rare for multiple reasons. But recently, Joe seems to dislike hanging out with us as a group. He sees Mary 2-3 times a week for rock-climbing which they do, and he sees me every day obviously, but when the three of us get together, he acts out. He gets mad about very little things, like innocent jokes that are 10 times tamer than the ones he dishes out, or for just unknown reasons. 

Examples: Joe and Mary were at the apartment watching a movie, and I was out. I got back and watched like the last 10 minutes with them. It finished and we started chatting, and Mary wanted to play some game. Within about 5 minutes, Joe had gotten up and left the room and never came back. He pretended like he had just remembered something and got lost in it, but it made me and Mary feel like we had done something wrong, so she just went home. Or once we were playing Mario Party on the N64 and he got extremely angry about losing a game and just dropped his controller and refused to play or speak to us, and when Mary tried to jokingly get him to rejoin, he shoved her and caused her to get a bruise.

My conclusion from all of this is that for whatever reason, he is being selfish with his friendship with Mary and basically doesn't want me to be as good of friends with her that I am. He has a long-distance girlfriend, and me and Mary are not romantically involved, so I don't get what's happening. It's been 2 months since she's been at our apartment for more than 10 minutes, he always expresses disdain at the idea of her coming over and doing the things we used to always do together, but frequently drags her out to go rock-climbing with him even when she's not feeling up to it. It's causing me a lot of stress, and almost every time we all hang out, the night ends with a very tense mood for seemingly no reason. Joe and Mary have been friends for a while, so they hang out by themselves frequently, but I only ever get to see her in the group setting, essentially. It feels like he's intentionally trying to make it so I can't be friends with her and I don't know what to do

I've been told I need to confront him, and I think that's correct, but I've seen other people confront him and I know how he acts. When he acts out, he does so in a manner that makes it look either joking or unrelated, so he never quite crosses the line into socially unacceptable behavior which would be easy to bring up. And I  know if I bring these things up, he will most likely deny that he's doing them, or deny that he's angry about me being friends with Mary, and it'll probably just end up making things more strained, with me looking like I'm the bad guy. Mary hasn't said very much about his behavior, and I think she's just excusing all of it because she enjoys being friends with both of us. Maybe she's in a similar position where she doesn't want to confront him either, I don't know.

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. I feel like I'm just going to lose this battle, and he's going to force me out of the friend group and I'll go back to how I was.",02Mar2018,1

For example, the one I'm fairly certain is one the complainers takes several smoke breaks (non-smoking workplace, 1 break and lunch allowed, no more than that) and goes out to adjust her parking disc twice a day every single day. I've never complained about any of this because I'm fairly laid back and wouldn't really have minded if they didn't then have the gall to try and throw me under the buss with their accusations. And now I can't bring it up since it'll look like I'm being vindictive (I did blurt out one slacker out of the shock of being accused - and frankly out of fear of being fired - when my supervisor talked to me about the issue, which I'm regretting already). Our workplace is fairly small so today I gathered my coworkers, told them about the accusations, and told them that a) I think it's nonsense and b) I really don't appreciate the complainers going behind my back instead of coming to me with their complaints. This situation is also why I think I've got one of them pegged - I've worked with her long enough to know her mannerisms and expressions well enought that from her reaction and comments to the situation I'm fairly certain she's one of them.
There's also two aspects to the issue that make it especially shitty. First, I thought we had a good working relationship and that I was getting along well with everyone. Hell, *I even threw an evening gathering for everyone from work, at my home* . Secondly, our workplace is so small knowing there's two backstabbers has pretty much made me lose trust in *all* of my coworkers. What should I do?",02Mar2018,4

227,"Hey all, 

So, I'm sure everyone here is aware of GoFundMe and the reasons that people resort to using it. It's literally asking people for money. I've come across a ton of legit reasons to use it (funeral costs, medical costs, charities, etc.) and I've also found myself annoyed at other reasons people use it such as vacation costs and such. 


Someone suggested I use it, and I'd consider it, but I keep thinking that I really shouldn't and I honestly might feel guilty. Maybe even embarrassed. I hate asking for money, but I'm wondering what other people think? 


My situation is that I live in the US and I'm moving to Germany for graduate school for two years. I worked part-time all throughout undergrad, but I might not end up working while over there since school will be much harder and I'd most likely have an unpaid internship. While tuition would be nearly free (just about $1,000 max in fees and such for a year), I'm saving as much as I can and my ultimate plan is to take out loans for cost of living. There's a chance that I'll be moving to Munich, which is the most expensive place to live in Germany. However, I don't know yet where I'll end up as I've only received one acceptance letter so far. 


Anywho, if I were to use GoFundMe, my ""goal"" wouldn't be as much as others that I've seen by doing a quick google search. Some people are asking for like $30,000+ for grad school. My ""goal"" would only be about a couple grand or so. Also, I didn't have a graduation party from undergrad, and people typically give money gifts at those, right? Part of me thinks this isn't much different, but also part of me just doesn't feel right asking for money from friends and family. 


Is this a legitimate reason to use GoFundMe? It it ethical? Please be honest guys. I really don't know how I feel. 


Thanks in advance!",02Mar2018,6

231,"My younger sister is pregnant at the age of 17, but because she's very difficult to deal with and I'm in college and working all the time, I just can't ""control"" her behavior.

&amp;nbsp;

Our parents doesn't really care about what we do unless it creates big issues. (like drugs or crimes)

&amp;nbsp;

But this ""thing"" has been going on for months and even my mom almost quit her job to manage our problems...

&amp;nbsp;

It was about 3-4 months ago when my sister met a dude online while playing games and he live in the same city.

&amp;nbsp;

That dude was about 3x years old and had a marriage, heard the reason why he divorced is because he's a alcoholic and we're always drunk. Anyways, they talked for 2-3 weeks and started meeting each other.

&amp;nbsp;

They went to a motel literally at the first day, and every time they meet at that same place, this lasted quite a while (for 3 months), and my sister told that dude she haven't got a period for 3 months... (know what the means?)

&amp;nbsp;

First he said he'll be responsible for this (and tells me secretly he wants to propose), but right at the next day we lost contact with him, his phone is off and my sister told us just the day before yesterday.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom and dad went to his house knocking on the door hoping for a response, originally was gonna ask what's going on and threat him to court.

&amp;nbsp;

When he was back after 2 weeks, told us he was out of the country for a vacation, and just came back.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom and dad (including me) don't believe him, cuz that dude looks poor af and he rents the house with his other roommate, my sister was crying the whole time while this is going on...

&amp;nbsp;

After clearing things out and collecting information, I took a day off at work and had a talk with my sister.

&amp;nbsp;

She told me he's really a nice guy and treated her nice, I just couldn't listen to this bs, I was so mad and said ""he treated you nice is just because he wants to fuck you"".

&amp;nbsp;

After hearing that, she cried again and smashed my iPhone X on the table, the screen was cracked too.

234,"I have a friend who lied about sleeping with someone this summer - she is trying to get back with her ex and he found out. She lied and said the person assaulted her. I have seen the texts between her and the person she is accusing, in which she reached out to him for sex and then followed up with a series of texts the next day, showing that their interaction was consenting and she would like it to continue.

I don't know how to move forward with this information. The person she accused is upset and wants to walk away from the situation without confronting her, and that's entirely his right to do so.  I need advice on two things:

* He is afraid that due to the current #metoo movement, people won't believe him, and him confronting her will actually make the situation worse.  How do I show him that I support him?
* This is not the first lie of this caliber she has told in the past year in an attempt to get her ex back.  We're at a point where I need to walk away from her, as she's starting situations I want nothing to do with and do not support.  We've been friends for 23 years - how do I go about this, while still respecting my other friend's request for privacy about this situation?

236,"Please forgive any awkwardness in my writing, as English is my second language.

Here is a summary of the situation. I honestly couldn't make it shorter.

Started first-year undergrad education with very precise plans and ambitions. Had absolutely no intentions of getting in a romantic relationship, as I wanted to make my studies my n°1 priorities. I would soon meet a girl through a mutual friend. They have been together since the early years of high school, but to this day, I don't know how serious their relationship is.

When I first met her, I didn't find her attractive at all. We quickly became friends, eating at the same table every morning, having amazingly long and deep conversations. I started spending more and more time with her. She loves dancing, I don't know how to dance, but we ,went dancing together anyway, and I had the most wonderful evening of my life. That night, as I came home, it suddenly dawned on me that I was truly, deeply in love for the first time of my life. I tried to repress this feeling because of her long-lasting relationship with the friend who introduced her.

That same evening, she asks me to convince her boyfriend to go dancing. He hates dancing, because he tends to be shy, as am I, and she says if anyone can convince him, it's me. I honestly try to convince him, even though I am conflicted. He doesn't budge. I go on winter holidays and hope the feeling will go away or be reciprocated.

Fast forward a few weeks. I am experiencing internal turmoil, trying to balance my friendship with him and her, the passion that hasn't diminished one bit, and the need to stay focused on my studies. In the meantime, I remain silent and try to remain normal, but the look in my eyes has changed. She notices that something is off.

A few more weeks pass. I try to give her hints of my feelings, and plan to tell her everything, which was eventually unnecessary, as she eventually confronted me. I told her everything. Her answer: she's open to a great friendship, but no more; maybe _someday_... but she said it was still highly unlikely. She tells me to try and let my feelings 'cool down.'

Heartbroken yet unsurprised, I acknowledged her answer; honestly, this was to be expected. So I tried to move on, to reason with myself, to let water flow under the bridge.

It didn't work. Months later, I am still shaken. My plans, my goals for the future have become second thoughts. I can't find the drive to move forward anymore.

You know how it is said that when you have a _why_, you can bear any _how_?  
Well, I lost my _why_.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

237,"Last year I was chosen for a leadership role as a “lead” PA of a small group of healthcare providers (NPs and PAs). To be honest, my boss who is a physician who oversees our entire group (doctors in addition to the NPs and PAs) got pressure from corporate to hire a lead PA so I don’t even know if he wanted me in that role. I haven’t really enjoyed the position much as leadership and administrative stuff isn’t my cup of tea. Regardless, I have done my best. I joined some committees, attend multiple meetings a month, do the scheduling, audit charts, try to deal with any issues that arise. I put in way more than the hours I am paid for. I’m not a natural leader but I have really made an effort to become a good leader. 

The problem is I get zero support from upper management (the CEO and CFO, doctors in charge of our whole group) which totally undermines me. I feel like no one takes me seriously or gives me any respect. For example, when there are any changes from above, they notify me about it at the same time as everyone else. They don’t involve me or update me about any big moves. Another example is we need to hire another NP or PA and recently I told the head doctor that I wanted to do a really good job this time interviewing candidates and looking at references. In the past they have just hired people without thorough exploration of their background and personality, and without involving me which is strange as I am the lead of the NP and PAs, and we have gotten burned over it. So he said he agreed with me that we needed an interview.  I contacted both the new candidate we are considering and the head doc earlier this week asking him what times work for them for an interview but the head doc never replied. Then the other day he just walked into my office with this new candidate and was like “Oh, yeah, we decided to just do a quick interview”. Then right in front of her he said “OK, so we decided she is starting August 1st.”  So he basically hired her on the spot without talking to me. Another issue is we have an NP who is constantly having issues at work and is a royal pain in the butt. She has had multiple complaints from other coworkers about her unprofessional dress so I have had multiple conversations with her and have sent out emails regarding dress code - a dress code the head doc said he wanted me to implement - and she still continues to wear what she wants.  When I ask her why she is not wearing her uniform she tells me “oh, (head doc) doesn’t care and never says anything.”  Even though he is the one who told me we need to implement a dress code. Yesterday I went to go speak to the head doc about this and asked him if he could talk to her about her dress code. He basically looked really awkward about it and told me to send an email and then said he is sorry that I’m having to deal with this. Basically, he’s not willing to back me up. So why would she listen to me about the dress code? I just feel like I look like a joke in front of the employees. Why should they take me seriously as a lead if I I am never involved in an important decision making processes, I am not involved in hiring, and I have no power when it comes to disciplinary actions? I don’t understand what my role is. I don’t know if I should just talk to the head doctor and tell him how I’m feeling, or if I should just settle into this mediocre leadership role as it stands.",02Mar2018,1
239,"I've been struggling with this for a while now, because I have some mental health issues which cause me to not fully trust my feelings all the time because I do tend to overanalyze things and I have noticed that my feelings of insecurity and dissatisfaction with my relationship tend to be much stronger when I am in a particular kind of head space. 

On paper, our relationship is everything one could want... we are financially stable, have lots of family support and healthy friendships, we treat each other with kindness and respect, we have similar visions for what we want in our future, etc. But our values are misaligned on some items, more a matter of how we prioritize them than what we value though. He prioritizes being productive over doing things purely for enjoyment, whereas I'm much more the ""good enough is good enough"" type when it comes to things and am much more oriented toward spending my time and energy on enjoying people and places. I worry that over time these misaligned priorities will cause resentment. I worry he will resent me because I simply don't have the desire to meet the same level of standards he holds for our house, cars, etc. I worry I will resent him because he sees a lot of the things that make me happy as unproductive uses of time. We both put effort into the things that are important to the other but at what point will it just be enough? Are we actually a good match for each other or are we just playing house because we like the life we have built together? ",02Mar2018,4

this is gonna be a long read, so I appreciate it anyone actually does read this haha 

(approximately 5 min. read) 

a little back story; on June 12,2017 I fell off my skateboard and tore my ACL,LCL,MCL, And PCL. As I lied on the floor of the street I knew I was screwed. I didn't know how bad the injury  was but I couldn't feel my leg and the pain was excruciating. this happened my senior year of high school. so I didn't get to go to prom, or graduate on stage. I missed a lot of days of school and my grades were bad as well so I was sent to summer school. but I couldn't do summer school! I couldn't walk or go outside without help going down the stairs, etc. honestly I never liked school. (I believe the public school system is messed up but that's a whole nother story.) my whole summer was one big flop. I stayed indoors 24/7. only ate pizza and Chinese takeout. gained weight. and my depression came back and consumed me more and more each day. fast forward to late January 2018. im walking, driving, taking my dog for walks again thanks to an arthroscopy and physical therapy. my mom's been on my ass about school this whole time. ""what are you going to do about your studies?...you need to get your diploma!..."" I was tired of hearing it. so I went to my school and asked what was up with my situation. turns out I was transferred to night school. (adult school.) and they gave me a ton of work to do since I would be home recovering for about two months. frankly, I didn't really care if I ever did get my diploma or not. but my mom and now my dad are really pressing me about it. I think every immigrant parent has a thing about their child and college being the only route to success. it's present day now. I had my last surgery on Feb 9th. when I woke up from surgery for some reason I told a nurse about my depression and suicidal thoughts. she made me realize how loved and valuable I am to this world. I'm not completely ""cured"" yet but I've learned to have more positivity and self love and all that now so I'm doing better. I'm trying to keep a consistent plant based diet so I've been losing some weight and begun to be happy with myself. since I did have surgery again I have to go through that whole process of not being able to walk and having to do physical therapy again and dealing with all the stuff i dealt with the first time around. I'm gonna be honest, I havent done one ounce of work they gave me at night school. I opened a textbook and said ""nope!"" lol. my parents keep asking me if I'm doing the work and I keep lying that I am. I don't want to sound like another millennial who thinks they knows everything but I know what I want to do in life. there's nothing else I see myself doing. (creative directing, photography, videography, entrepreneurship.) and I do not need a diploma for it. some people don't understand that it's not the 1980's anymore. there's a quote I like to live by: ""how you make your money is more important than how much you make."" I want to make my parents proud but that means doing something I don't want to do.it sounds selfish but I know I'm not gonna be happy doing what they want. my dad wants me to go into business with him and he promises we're gonna make a lot of money but that's not what I want to do. should I risk disappointing them for the sake of my passion and happiness? should I just finish school and get my diploma? should I go to college and make my parents proud? (I was interested in going to Academy of Art in SF but my hs academics and attendance were shit. it's also expensive as hell.) what should I do!? does anyone have any experiences similar to this?

There was a point in my life where I really cared about what people thought about me, and I was really good at being well-liked too. I had a cool social media, more friends than I had time for, and sometimes even neglected my family at times to hangout with peers. My social realm was once the most important aspect of my life. 

I’m almost 22 now. In the past year, I’ve withdrawn a lot —from certain people at least. I went on a big backpacking trip by myself that opened my eyes to what is truly important to me. I deleted my Instagram and Snapchat - I have no business maintaining these ‘fake-friendships’ that quite frankly just seem like a big circle-jerk of ‘fitting in’. I’ve been spending more time with my parents and siblings. I feel more pressure to keep up with only a few friends that I consider lifelong. I also have become pretty certain what field I want to get into career-wise. I spend a lot of time on my own and enjoy it. I workout, and I eat well. I’m proud of who I am and I am comfortable with myself. 

The part that I’m struggling with is that I cannot help but shake this impeding feeling of still caring what these other people think of me (the ones that I don’t even associate with anymore). I am hoping that once I graduate I will no longer to be surrounded by people who I feel like are judging me. I guess it feels like I am in this weird transition of not caring anymore, but still sort of caring…. it’s confusing and stressing me out a bit. Honestly helped a lot just to write this.

So should I focus my resources on the prerequisite important course test (and assignment, too) I have, and drop the course I'm most likely going to fail the midterm in, or keep sticking it out and struggle to study today and tomorrow for the math, maybe barely get a 50, and do poorly on the prerequisite course? It's only getting harder from here and maybe it's best to just drop the math and at least do well on this test so I have a better footing in the courses I am currently taking.

To be honest, I'm really not enjoying school, so my thought process is maybe the fewer courses I have to worry about, the more I can actually enjoy learning. Am I being stupid? Rational?",02Mar2018,1

Now the car is gonna have lug locks and I have a garage for it now.

257,"Dear Reddit 

I am conflicted and could use some outside perspectives.  The time is coming to have children with my SO, and everything in my body is saying “Get moving!”.  At the same time, my brain is like a separate entity saying “Why would you bring a child into this world?” Sort of antinatalism, but not really.  

The problem is, I’m terrified it will be a girl.  If it’s a girl, I’ve signed her up for a lifetime of unrealistic beauty standards.  Not only that, she’ll be looking for love.  What if her future lover is selfish, or mean?  What if he scrolls through beautiful women all day and makes her feel inadequate? How can I bring her into this world? Where some men have collectively agreed that ogling at naked Instagram models and consuming porn is normal, and yet when some women collectively agree that it hurts us, we need therapy/have low self esteem.  I mean, how can you not have low self esteem?   How can I subject her to something that tortures women daily? Meltdowns, tears in front of the mirror, diets, the allure of cutting yourself open and sticking balls in your chest, all in the name of beauty.  

What if everyday I tell her she’s beautiful and she doesn’t believe me?  How can I tell her it’s going to be ok when I struggle with it too?  

And what if she’s beautiful? I fear that too.  The temptation to bare it all and get fleeting validation from men.  

I’m not saying this is how all girls turn out, I’m saying that these are the things I’ve seen around me in my 30 years.  I don’t want to bring a sweet little girl into this world, it’s just not a nice place anymore.

How can I have children with these thoughts plaguing me? Or how can I get over them?",02Mar2018,0

You never get see friends or your partner or do your hobbies as much as you'd like. But you almost always work more than you like.

That doing things for money is unfulfilling, but then doing what you love and not getting money quickly becomes stressful because you don't have money.

264,"(Also posted [/r/Relationships but thread got locked](https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/81blgc/me_22_f_with_my_boyfriend_21_m_8_months_ive_been/))

It's both our first time being in a relationship so this might appear naïve. We both never meant to date but here we are. Eight months in but I don't know anymore.

He is quite a polymath. His knowledge is vast while mine is below average. I mentioned this as this may be relevant to his behavior. Whenever we discuss a topic, Religion, History, Philosophy or anything under the sun. I've always been opened about all of his opinions. I let his teachings lay upon me but when it comes to me, he's got his ears closed. He's always rejected my thoughts. He always has the urge to disprove it or always just automatically thinks that I'm wrong. And that doesn't only affect general topics but also when we're having an emotional argument. He would always just say that it's my depression creating those negative thoughts because since he doesn't ""think"" or ""felt"" that he was acting such or he meant it to be that way. He is completely unaware of this behavior and in denial every time I open up my concern about it.

We have always been well communicated. We open up when something bothers us and we look at It objectively in order to resolve it together. 

But this time, 
it's different. 

Again, as long as he THINKS and FEELS that he is not being that way then it is not the truth. He's always seen it just my ""depression"" or ""mind"" creating those and making it difficult for us. Evolving into mindless drama and when drama starts, it gets him upset because it feels as if I'm accusing him. It calms him down when I say ""No. No, of course not. You've always been loving and caring. It's just my mind creating these. I'm sorry.""

He has told me for quite a few instances about a conclusion that he came into as a counter-argument:
&gt;""You're the only one that gets hurt and cries all the time because of me but my family and the people around me has never been that way. Are you sure it's not you? I'm not blaming you but your depression.""

Here's another scenario:
&gt;I was joking about making him do an extreme sports while I take a video of him and send it to his mother and then he got a little upset and explained to me that he doesn't like such activities. I apologized and understood him. I didn't ask anymore. But when comes to me, he would always question me why I don't like doing a particular thing as if I need to justify myself why something bothers me otherwise, my opinion is nvalid and irrational. 

He gets upset when I question a certain person in his life like his brother's girlfriend because it would feel like I'm attacking them and not respecting their opinion but it's okay if he questions and gives opinion anyone in my life. It would probably make sense because while the people around me had caused me depression, he'd always had led a fantastic life surrounded with people that loves and supports him.

Another example of that is when we had a discussion about the LGBT+ after talking about nationalism(I think) *(I'd like to state beforehand that we respect them and I don't mean to speak ill of them in any way if my statement is perceived to be as offensive.)*
I asked certain questions to understand better their objectives and in the end, he said that 
&gt;""I refused to ask them questions to not cause trouble. We should just espect their opinions."" (I agree with him.) 
but it made me think that it seems unfair how he's able to respect their opinions but never mine. He just thinks that he's being a skeptic.

He always resorts to his defensive mode and would pile reasons over reasons that he'd even pull up something from the past that's been completely resolved just to support his argument. 

Another scenario:
&gt;At one point he told me how he can't love me forever and he doesn't think that he would want to live with a partner. Note that this isn't during any emotional argument but he shared it as if it's just a random factual statement. It hurt me, of course but he couldn't understand why it would hurt me. He thinks like It's only hurting me because I'm not looking at it objectively. Of course, I am aware that very few cases where relationships lasts for longer than 50 years at least or that nothing lasts forever but wouldn't it hurt you if you were given those words? 

*I'm sure that this wouldn't be the case with his mother. If his mother has told him about these, he would listen and understand.*

I don't know anymore. I'm so so confused. 
Please, someone. I beg of you. What is it that I'm doing wrong?
Am I being reasonable or irrational?
I'm prepared to change for the better. I always am.

What should I do? 
I badly need an advice ): Please. I've been having my breakdown. I'm on the verge.

266,"This is somewhat of a long story but I'm looking for advice on this situation.

I am friends with this married couple that I met through my ex boyfriend. Here are the dynamics: Married couple ""Bob"" and ""Audrey"" have been together for years. I have realized that Audrey is an extremely shitty person after having her in my life for the past two years. It took me awhile but I think I finally see things clear.

For some reason ""Audrey"" always had a bit of an influence on me. My self esteem was low at the time and she enjoyed bossing me around but her and her husband were fun to hang out with on occasion while I was with my ex. I kept the friendship going and shortly into it things start getting weird.

I think Audrey obviously has some issues. She started hitting on me and we had a brief few interactions where we did things together drunk. This will come into context later. Her husband knew and didn't mind. 

Let's add the third person ""Joe"" to this dynamic. Joe is Audrey's ex boyfriend who broke up with her and that she starting hanging out with again after she was married. It is well known that Audrey is still in love with Joe. She never got over the situation because ""he was the one that got away"". So Joe is now friends  with both Audrey and her husband Bob. Joe hangs out there all the time and basically lives there.

Here's where things get weird. Audrey's husband won't cuddle with her because he doesn't like it with anyone, so apparently she allowed to sleep in the spare bedroom in bed with Joe to cuddle. She sleeps with him every night instead of her husband. Bob claims he doesn't care. However, it is extremely obvious she has strong feelings for him. And now the feelings have been returned by Joe. Her husband made it very clear that he wouldn't' mind if she messed around with anyone else but Joe was strictly off limits that way because of how she felt about him. Joe and Audrey just play it like they are very close friends to her husband.

Back to my side of things Audrey has pretty much been using me and anyone she can to please her at the time. It took me awhile to open my eyes and see this. She only wants to hang out when its convenient for her or shes bored and there's nothing else to do. She's an alcoholic and anything we do has to involve drinking. Then she'll get me drunk and get me into situations I shouldn't be in. She'll ask me to go to dinner because she doesn't want to spend time just with her husband Bob.

I continued to watch the dynamic get more strange and Audrey verbally abusing Bob and treating him like shit. Anytime he would talk she would tell him to ""Shut up"" then go back to paying attention to Joe. She claims she loves her husband Bob and won't leave him but she's very in love with Joe.

So Audrey continues to treat me and her husband like shit and I'm starting to feel very bad and uncomfortable for the guy. She has this personality that just pulls you in. So me and her husband become closer because we got ignored anytime all of us hung out with her and Joe. 

One night while drunk she tells me she's been sleeping with Joe. Not only sleeping with him, but sleeping with him unprotected while not on birth control. Her husband does not know. Although, hes a very smart man and I assume he has his suspicions. Joe is also very close with Bob and is probably one of his best friends at this point. 

I always knew Audrey would do something like this but was very disappointed in Joe and thought he was a better person and would have more respect for Bob. 

So not only has Audrey tried to trap me in some sick love triangle but now she is fucking Joe behind her husbands back. She is very controlling of everyone she has in her life and basically runs the show. No one else matters to this woman. Everyone in her life is disposable unless shes getting something out of it. She needs constant attention and will look anywhere she can to get it. Her husband makes most of the money and owns their house. I don't believe he's happy but I don't think he'll leave her. He treats the abuse as if its normal at this point. Like ""Oh, that's just how Audrey is"" whenever she treats him like shit which is almost all of the time.

The last straw for me was hanging out with all three of them, and Audrey and Joe disappear to a dark basement with all of the lights off. I know whats going on and yell for them to come upstairs but they never do. It was getting late and I wanted to come home. This leaves poor Bob alone in the living room by himself.

Bob and I still talk sometimes but after that night I cut things off with his wife. I told her I was tired of her treating me like shit and everyone else that didn't fit her needs at the time. I want Bob to know. I think he deserves to know. But I don't know if it's the right thing to do to tell him.

This woman is very manipulative and could maybe lie her way out of it or slander me in some kind of way. I just hate to see this going on and watch someone get so abused like this. 

So Reddit, do I tell the husband? Or my ex which is husbands mutual friend and Joe's best friend. He thinks the situation is very messed up but doesn't know that they are sleeping together. I don't think he would want to be friends with Joe anymore and he would tell Bob. Do I tell anyone or just walk away? She could very well get pregnant with Joe and claim its Bobs. Although, I'm not sure she can stop drinking long enough to have a child safely. I feel like so many peoples lives are being ruined and am unsure of what to do.

267,"I'm posting a lot today, as my mind is all over the place and I'm having a moment of motivation. 

I need advice on how to get started in online classes. I work in a warehouse, currently, Sundays-Wednesdays for 10 hour shifts. Despite consistency in maintaining numbers in the top 10 for the whole warehouse, I still haven't been able to get hired to the main company. 

It's really hard for me to find motivation in life lately. I'm the main one that takes care of the house's dog, walking her when I'm off and keeping her exercise and paying the majority of her bills. I clean my room, dishes, laundry when I'm off (when I can push myself to do it), make time for my mom. School is so daunting. I did poorly in my final semester for my Education associates for this reason. I'm not sure if maybe I've fallen into a depression and have random moments where I want to try, or what the issue is. But online schooling would be the best option for me as I can still be here for the dog when I'm off, and can study on breaks at work and at night when I get home, and in the mornings when no one is awake. 

I don't even know what I want to study, or what I want to be, but I want to be more than a warehouse temp, going underappreciated at $11.50/hour. I can't keep being seen as a child by my MIL either, being looked at like her son could always do better and probably should. And what sucks is I KNOW I can be better. I used to care about school. I used to love it. Waking up every day going through the motions barely remembering the day before because it's all such a rut is becoming overwhelming. It almost feels like I'm watching my life pass by rather than actually living it. At least school was something new every day - a new conversation, or a new lesson, or a new paper written. There were always deadlines and something different to do each day. I'd feel like I'm actually doing something that isn't shuffling around with no direction with my just-two-months ago great credit tanking as we speak. Even when I had two jobs I at least wasn't struggling. 

My fiance is working and that's beyond helpful, but my goals differ from his in the fact that I want to get out of his parents house before we're married, or at least before we ever think about a child. He thinks we would at least have support here so if we do have one it would help. So we I think are both saving for different things. 

I got the W-2 for my previous job over a month ago and my stupid ass can't find it now to finish filing my taxes. I got his done. But I can't even contact the old jobs HR because my employee ID number is no longer valid, so that's making me panic because I need that return money to pay for driving school because what the fuck 22 year old doesn't know how to drive... 

I'm sorry. Like I said my thoughts are everywhere. I need any help I can get to actually feel like the adult I want MIL to see me as.",02Mar2018,1
268,"I'm living in Vancouver, BC, CANADA.  After accident, my car insurance company are not fully covering my damage.

As I was traveling straight, a person appeared in front of me, while taking his left turn.  As I tried to swerve out of the way, my right bumper collided on the right side of his two doors.  

Other driver claimed full responsibly, so no deductible on my bumper repair, but my car insurance company are not covering my windshield damage.

The Result (to my car): was damage on the right side bumper which has hole in it, and the lower right hand side of windshield has two chips (same side as the bumper damage).

My car insurance company says they are not covering windshield, because it is ""IMPOSSIBLE"" for debris from the other guy's car to fly up and hit my windshield, because the impact of both cars was so low to the ground.  

They say the windshield damage occurred from rock chips at a different time from the accident.

All I know is before the accident, my windshield had no chips in it. It was in perfect condition.

The car insurance company guy was rude to me on the phone, and told me to phone the ""dial-a-claim"" number to set up an appointment at a my car insurance company claim centre, to dispute it with them.

Within the a week of the accident, those two chips sprouted huge cracks which stretch across my windshield (the car insurance company says the stretched cracks were initiated by impact of accident, when chips were already there).  Also, there is no dirt in the cavities of the chips (which indicates they are new chips).  

Is there an explanation for these two chips in my window?  How can I argue with them and have them cover my windshield damage?

271,"i own my driver's license since last summer, so i am still really new to driving. at that time my parents and i bought a car for me so that i could actually make a use out of my driver's license. at that time i didnt know what i would be doing after school, where i would work and so on. i eventually started to work at a company 5 minutes on foot away from my house, so i rarely have to use my car, which means that i don't get a lot of practice in driving.
but every time i do drive, i do something stupid. every single time.

in these few months that i own my license, i have scratched 3 cars with my car. with every stupid mistake i made, i became more and more insecure in my driving skills.
today was my scariest experience so far. i was driving with a friend of mine down a really crowded road. the cars were sometimes driving on two lanes, i just couldn't focus on the 100 things that were happening at the same time, so at one point i turned around for a second to look out for a taxi (they drive basically however they want where i live). i focused on him for too long that i didnt have the time to react to what was in front of me, so i hit another women's car. no one was hurt, i wasnt even driving fast, must be about 30km/h, but it still scared me to death. i couldnt continue driving for a solid 20 minutes because i had to cry in my car to calm down. the woman wasnt even mad at me, she didnt shout or anything, she was super easy about it, but i just had this constant thought of having failed once again. 

what if next time, this isnt another car, but a pedestrian? it happened in only one second. i cant stand the thought of taking someones life in one second because i wasnt able to concentrate properly.

 by now, i feel almost scared just thinking about driving, because i just keep imagining what mistake i will make today, and if it will cost someones life at some point. i can pay for a new bumper, but not for someones life.

i know that my reaction is probably really overdramatic, but this is just how i feel about this. i feel sorry for my parents and the rest of my relatives, for putting together money to buy me a car which i am scared to drive.

thats why i want to work on this fear of mine. but i dont know how. for now, i really dont want to drive for at least some weeks, but i also know that i cant work on it if i dont practice it. i would just like to change my mindset about driving before actually practicing it.

i hope some of you have tips for me on how to do this.

280,"Hi!  So I don't know if I brought this on myself but here goes.  I posted on a few different subreddits a couple weeks back looking for someone to start a relationship with.  I said that I have bad anxiety and that meeting people is hard so I'd like to try something out online first, preferably from my area but a few hours away is fine too.  I got some responses from people nearby and I also got a response from someone in another country saying he liked what I said and would love to get to know me.  (By the way, we're both male, if that matters.)  The guys near me were nice but we didn't click.  The foreign guy and I did.  He's very sweet and asked me a lot of questions about myself and we have a lot of similar interests so I ended up just chatting with him.

At first things seemed pretty good.  We talked about our lives and interests and our families and friends.  The usual.  He told me he'd never been in a relationship before (we're both in our late 20's) and that didn't bother me.  Very quickly though he started to say things like he loved this falling in love feeling or he would say something about when we live together etc.  Basically moving very quickly.  I'm not opposed to thinking about the future, I mean I did post personals looking for someone to hopefully start a future with.  I chalked this up to him not having any experience with dating and figured I could just be okay with it.

The more he opened up to me the more I realized he has a very low self esteem.  He's been telling me just about every day how he's afraid I will ""ghost"" him and that he feels worthless and can't sleep because he's worried he'll die alone.  I've tried being supportive the best way I know how and respond with things like, ""don't worry, you won't die alone,"" or ""I'm not planning on ghosting you"" etc.  He keeps telling me this is his worst fear.  If I don't reply to his messages in a few hours he sends me sad smiley face emojis.

So basically, I just don't know what to make of all this.  I don't know how to react when he talks about wanting to be my husband and our kids and how he will want to take our kids on vacations to his home country.  He's researched my area and learned all about it.  I don't think he's being a stalker I think he just doesn't understand this isn't really appropriate.  I don't know what to say to him when he says he wants to die or he's going to die alone or he feels worthless.  Since it's only been a couple weeks I had made another post last night on reddit looking for someone to sext with (I like to do it, this guy didn't seem interested) and I temporarily blocked him so he wouldn't see the post because I was worried he would freak out.  Minutes later he sent me a message telling me he saw my posts and hoped I found someone interesting to talk to.  I didn't think this was a big deal because as far as I was concerned he and I were just talking and he keeps telling me he's going to die alone and then he told me today he couldn't sleep because he was so sad.

So I'm looking for advice.  I don't know what to make of this.  He's a sweet guy and I've enjoyed talking to him for the most part.  I feel like I dug myself a hole by trying to reassure him of his fears and said the wrong things.  I'm realizing now that I don't want to be in a relationship with him because I think he has a lot of issues to work out.  I'm not in a place in my life where I want to hold his hand and fix him.  I'd stay his friend but I'm worried about how that will affect him.

I dont know how to comfort her, I feel like I'm saying all the wrong things. I really dont know what to say to her, I feel like this is such a heavy event that I literally cant come up with anything. I feel like an idiot and a shitty friend. I went over on Wednesday night and was able to give her a hug. If I were in her shoes I would want to be alone, so I try not to bother her. I'm sure she has a ton of people calling/texting/messaging her at this time. I've been texting her good morning and good night texts just so she doesn't feel so alone. 

what are things I can say or do to help her feel comforted/supported?

285,"Recently was in a relationship with a man who quickly committed to me. According to his friends, I was the only girlfriend he seemed to really care about and commit to for so long.  He almost begged me to commit and be exclusive.  I seemed to be the center of his world. I met his parents and he constantly mentioned our future. He told me he's never met a woman like me and sees me as his home and look forward to our future.  During the relationship, he was very attentive and loving and constantly in contact. 

Long story short he showed some signs that he wasn't ready to settle down despite planning to ask me to move in. Some of these signs were being active on dating sites, staring obviously at other women, and going on dates with other women. It seemed he wanted to have his cake and eat it too, by having me to himself but keeping his options open.


Needless to say, I ended the relationship but he seems to still try to keep in touch daily, as he sees other women. I have heard he is regularly sleeping with several women.
Please , I am not posting to receive judgement or rude comments. I am dating others and fully intend to stay broken up. I've stopped contact with him. I am just trying to make sense of this all, as I truly cared for him. What I am struggling with is whether he actually just found out I'm not the one for him. He seems to still have deep feelings but I don't know if it is enough to overcome his need for freedom.
Is this just a symptom of him not being ready for commitment, or is it that he didn't find the right girl so he has continued to play the field in search of ""the one""?",02Mar2018,4

287,"Hello gents, my name is John.

To start this off I am still young and ambitious about what I want to do in my life. I am 20 years old.
I'm having difficulty trying to cope with what type of profession I really want to do in my growing years. I'm sure you older folk have heard this numerous times and already have that answer in your head. 
At the age of 17, I started my first year old college and ended up with a 2.97 GPA. I enjoyed the classes that I had such as A&amp;P (Anatomy and Physiology), General Health Studies, and different courses. I didn't mind waking up at 0800 to go to classes, and also I enjoyed learning the different type of lessons/teachings they had to offer. I didn't really mind the environment of drunk college idiots/ other students. To top this section off, I enjoyed my year of college.

After my first year of college, I enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves and thought it would be a great idea to continue my education further. Bootcamp was a breeze as I didn't really mind the hostile environment. Made a ton of friends that I can easily call family. Got done job school, and went back home to continue drill/school. 
When I got back home I tried to apply for different nursing schools/educational facilities but due to my bad test taking skills, all my plans had fallen through. I pretty much just chilled out for 2 months not really doing anything and decided to get a job at this factory.
Working at a factory was technically my first civilian type of employment. I stayed with them for 5 months until they decided to shaft me left and right so I quit. 
My area is nothing but factories and underpaid labor jobs. I'd love to go back to school and learn but I fear about how long id be in debt to loaning agencies and whatnot. 

So here I am, my question to you is do you have any advice about what I should look into or lean towards?
I loved the military and was contemplating going active duty but majority of people active duty that are my friends say not to do it. Its a waste of time/too much bullshit. 
If I was to avoid military, stay reserves, I wouldn't want to stay around home. I want to be active, travel, and do something as part of a team if I could. I just don't know how id go about it. If I left, I wouldn't know where to go.

290,"So backstory I guess: dated someone, mutually ended the relationship under the circumstances we were under, kept in touch for a year or so, hooked up a few times, everything between us was great and I personally was still attached to this person and was glad to just have them still in my life. Then randomly they completely stop speaking to me- no texts, no calls, no acknowledgement of my existence. We live in the same area and only have spoken once since then and I barely remember the conversation because I was kind of taken back that they were speaking to me and acting like nothing happened.. my question I guess is 1. Why the hell would someone randomly do that (went back to everything I said, did, etc, couldn’t think of something that would piss them off like that) 2.

I’ve talked to my girlfriend about the idea. She seems... not exactly open but not shutting it down. 

Her best friend is a male, and I’ve honestly fantasized about him for a while. The thought of him dominating me and my girlfriend really gets me going. 

Recently, he wanted to cuddle me and I shot it down. My girlfriend doesn’t want it to happen, but she wants me to try it. 

I am super terrified that this could open the doorway to my fantasy becoming a reality. (She has told him how I feel.) I don’t want to confront the possibility that I might be gay. I’ve always thought I was bisexual, but more and more I am convinced that I lean gay. 

I don’t know what I would do if I enjoyed being with a man more. The thought makes me want to cry. Not because I am afraid of being gay (I have gender dysphoria already) but I’m afraid that it could lead to the destruction of my relationship with the girl of my dreams. 

I’ve only been having sex for 7 or 8 months now. I was a virgin until just after I turned 21. My girlfriend was my first partner. I love her and I honestly want her to be my only partner. 

But this fantasy is so strong. I instantly get turned on when we discuss it with each other. Today I even shot a little just discussing having a foursome. 

But I feel so guilty. I don’t want these feelings. I want them to go away. I don’t know what to do. Please help.

301,"Today, I saw a random vehicle pull up to my neighbor's house, and grab a package at the front door. As he was bending down to pick up the package, he gave the door a quick knock, and walked back to his car and drove away. 

The neighbor was not home and I've never seen this car (sketchy old crown vic) at my neighbor's house before. I work from home and my office window is directed towards the neighbor's house, so I'm always aware of any traffic that goes by. *Creepy neighbor alert.* 

I do not know this neighbor very well; we've met maybe once or twice. He's never asked me to keep an eye out on his house or anything like that, but if I had a sketchy car pull up to my house, I would definitely want my neighbor to tell me, even if he didn't get out of his car. 

You may be asking yourself why would I not tell the neighbor.. well as stated before I don't know this guy to well, and another neighbor (which is the neighbor who I probably sound like) mentioned that she believes he sells (or used to sell) drugs. Keep in mind that she is the textbook definition of a one-woman-neighborhood-watch, so anything she tells me is normally over exaggerated and dismissed. She said that he has a lot of traffic which I 100% disagree with because in the past 7 or so month's I've lived here, I could recall 2-3 times at most that another car has stopped in and visited. He seems to be a quite guy if you ask me. 

So... This is where I'm at. I want to tell him because there have been quite a few packages reported missing on local facebook groups, and I myself would definitely want to know if this happened to me... I've actually had 2 packages come up missing, but I get 3-5 packages a week delivered so the ratio is small and it could have just been a fuck up on UPS' fault. 

But on the other hand, if it was a transaction that took place, I don't want to be that nosey neighbor that should mind his own business...

What would you do in this situation? 

**TL;DR** - Random came up and possibly stole a package from a neighbor's house. It could have been a drug exchange. Should I let the neighbor know about the person taking the package?

302,"As of late I've come to a realization that I have some bad communication issues when it comes to wanting to discuss personal issues with people I'm close to. I believe it has stemmed from bad relationships and friendships in the past as well as me not being able to realize and acknowledge it. I don't want this to be an issue for me or anybody I am close to any longer, so any advice would mean the world to me.

I get upset and frustrated very easily. I have a hard time trying to put my feelings into words, so much to the point that I feel it comes out as if I am grilling into only them for my ""issue"", which I see now is very much true.. I make it seem so one sided and like I've done nothing wrong because I get so focused on wanting them to understand my point that it becomes the only thing I want to see. I am the kind of person who wants to talk about an issue ASAP and wants to feel like we've come to some sort of agreement or resolution so I don't have it lingering in the back of my head. That also makes me feel like I rush into the conversation perhaps and it doesn't come out correctly..

308,"So the background is that I met a girl in late November and we began to go on dates and spend time together. I’m a pretty laid back guy and so is she. Therefore, our hanging out never seemed to be overwhelmingly serious at all. We would see each other either once a week or once every two weeks. We would watch shows and movies, go out to dinner, go to movies, go out to the bars with her friends and my friends. 

The first time we hung out she had told me that she had been in a 5 year relationship that ended just a month or two before the first time we hung out. I was pretty realistic in thinking I was a rebound. So I never wanted to seem like I was pressuring her to be in a serious relationship, but more just really enjoyed her company and had fun when we did things together. 

Fast forward to February 25th. It had began feeling like we were exclusively dating. Not in the sense that we were getting more and more serious, but that we pretty much included each other in plans and our thoughts and feelings about things. We had been texting some that day at work and then pretty out of no where she sent about 4 very long messages. In the messages she said that she’s feeling confused and that she doesn’t think she’s ready for a new relationship yet and that she thinks we needed to take a step back. She said that she thought she was ready to date again but now she doesn’t know. I didn’t want to seem abrasive or resistant since I knew she had been in a 5 year relationship. I told her I understand that if she is feeling that way I respect her and don’t want to be an issue in her sorting things out for herself. 

(I understand how when someone wants space if you pressure or suffocate them it will only lead to them resenting you)

I was very transparent and asked if she had began seeing her ex again and she assured me she had not. She said that she just was confused and didn’t thing she was ready and wanted to be open about it. So I wanted to be sure she wasn’t just playing a nice card to not hurt my feelings. I asked if she just had realized she didn’t have interest in me anymore. She again assured me she did really like me and that she just felt the timing is wrong. 

I wanted to give her space and told her that I understood and if she wanted to talk about things I am more than willing. And that she could reach out to me anytime. 

Now in the days passing it’s become evident to me that I really do have feelings for her. I haven’t stopped thinking about her for a second since this happened. It’s like a light switch was flipped and I was obsessed with her. I have been running so many scenarios in my head and my anxiety is running rampant. I can’t get a grip on why I feel so strongly about her but it wasn’t apparent to me originally. I feel like I have so much to say about how I feel about her and how I really care for her, but I don’t want this to hurt any chance with a future between us. And I’m also worried she is actually just uninterested in me and I’m holding onto nothing and hoping something will never happen will. 

I’m not sure if I should believe she’s working through feelings and isn’t ready emotionally or moved on from her ex. Or she was just Lieing to let me down easy. 



Now the next phase of events. 

Now since then I haven’t texted her but a few nights ago she tagged me in a meme on instagram (which we did very often to each other previously) I didn’t know if I should use this as an opportunity to spark a conversation or just let it be. I chose to like the message and not respond. 

Last night I saw a post of her favorite breed of dog ( looking cute as hell) so I sent it to her. She liked the message just like I had before. She then about 10 minutes later sent me a message. Saying she was adopting a puppy. It was a casual exchange of what breed and when she was getting it and how I was excited for her. We then had some short messages about her sisters baby shower she’s been planning and then that’s it. 

Of course my mind wanted me to think that this was a sign that she missed our conversations. 

Now I really can’t stop thinking about if there is something I can do or should do to let her know my feelings. Or is it best to just quit grasping onto this. I feel like I have so much to say about how I acted so casual about us dating because I assumed she was still getting over her ex but in reality I’ve developed a lot of feelings for her. I don’t know if it’s best to just open up or continue to let more time pass and hope that maybe she will begin to miss me. 

Any advice would be amazing as I have no effing clue what to do.... 

I can elaborate more if anything needs more details or doesn’t seem clear.


**TL;DR;** The girl I have been dating that was previously in a 5 year relationship told me she is confused and wants to take a step back. This has made me realize how strongly I have feelings for her and don’t know what is the best thing for me to do to let her know how I’m feeling without pushing her away.

309,"So after 2 years of no direction and struggling to find full time work, my dad got me a job at his work as a parts driver. This is my simplified job description:

Working outdoors as required 
Assisting in detail department
Outdoor maintenance
Parts driving (main duty)
Clean up
Assisting other workers
Any other duties from time to time

Basically, I'm supposed to pick up/delivery parts as required. And my secondary duty was supposed to be helping the detailer clean trucks and get them ready for customers in my down time. Big issue is... I hardly do any parts running, maybe 5 runs within my 8.5 hour shift, and rarely traveling more than 10 mins to each location. Therefor, I have a ton of downtime. When I got hired I was under the impression that I would be constantly running parts around. So when I'm not running parts, I'm supposed to go to the detail shop.

Turns out, the detailer doesn't want my help (tells me there's nothing I can do even though there is plenty of shit I could do and we could easily clear 2x as many trucks if he let me help).

So when he sends me off, I go to the parts room and do whatever shitty jobs no one else wants to do. Thing is, I'll do their job and then have nothing to do once I'm done, so I'll ask for another shitty job and do it without complaint. My first week was pretty much doing this every day.

I got tired of this pretty quickly. It not only sucks asking non stop for work to do, but also sucks doing the jobs because it's stuff that no one else wants to do. 

If I go to my supervisor and tell him that the detailer doesn't want help, and that I've helped out the parts room and have nothing to do now, he'll take me back to the parts room and get me another shit task. 

This summer, I'm going to be responsible for all yard work, and there are several acres to take care of so that will keep me quite busy. However due to the snow, I won't be doing that for another 2 months roughly. So I'm either pretending to be busy (literally doing nothing for hours until I'm sent out for a part) or I'm doing shitty jobs all day which aren't even my responsibility. 

I tried telling my supervisor that the detailer doesn't let me help him but he just shrugs it off and sends me to the parts room. I've told my dad all this but he doesn't want to get involved even though he's high up in the company but doesn't want to play favorites. 

So what can I do to improve this situation? I'm done asking for shitty tasks all day, but I'm also done trying to communicate with my supervisor since he doesn't seem to care that I have nothing to do all day. My job description gives the impression that I should be busy all day, always having something to do, but the opposite is actually true. I'm tempted to just do a few tasks everyday for people and then spend the rest of the day wasting time, until summer comes around and I get to work outside every day. But on the other hand, I WANT to be busy and hate being a lazy employee, however I'm getting tired of doing everyone's shitty jobs. 

Edit: I'm the lowest pay grade by far at the company, and I don't really have the personality to tell this detailer that he's supposed to let me help him",02Mar2018,2

My problem is this, now, she isn't the type to lie at all, it's her biggest pet-peeve, and we're great friends, so I trust that she's not lying, but after we had talked about the whole me liking her situation, she's been extremely friendly the past week and everything seems different. I don't understand how I should be taking this, if it's a good thing or if I'm gonna wind up sending myself into some sort of depression afterwards.. I need some advice on whether or not I should continue to pursue her or if I should stop and move on.",02Mar2018,2
313,"Since 2010, someone has been creating fake accounts and stalking every online profile I create, often sending messages just to try and get under my skin, usually from some version of candeegirl206. They just found me here on Reddit and texted me regarding a post I submitted a week or so ago. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance. ",02Mar2018,1
315,"I am currently a 19 year old working a minimum wage job at a grocery store.  It's my first job so I don't know exactly how to handle this situation.  I was late to work by 10 minutes and one of my bosses saw me clocking in. Instead of pulling me aside and talking to me he reprimanded me in front of other workers and a customer who was nearby.  I was humiliated and I regret every day I have to go to work.  Another situation that happened was when I was leaving for the day I overheard a different manager talking about my girlfriend and how I was too ugly for her.  I felt like the whole situation was inappropriate and no way a workplace should be ran.  I was wondering if I should talk to HR or just quit, and if I do if I should give a two weeks or just immediately leave?",02Mar2018,1
316,"This happens like once every two years, and it goes on for about three months or so. This is the third time it happened, I see a random girl on a street or even on the internet and I just get instantly emotionally attached, for no reason. 
It's not their looks, it's just something I can't grasp which makes me so attached to them, I can't study without thinking about her, can't sleep, not a minute goes by without thinking about it.

It happened again recently when I accidentally saw an olympic ice-skater on TV and instantly knew I'll be emotionally attached again.

How do I distract myself from this?

317,"Title.

I (19/F) was best friends with a girl (18/F) for about 10 years. We were family friends, and often spent great deals of time together, after school, vacations, etc. This obviously caused us to become close. Over the years, she's lost some friends and the main issue was bc she would gossip about these people behind their backs, and when they'd find out, they would cut her off. Her defence mechanism is acting like she does not care, and then struggling with it inside, but she does not change. At her previous job, a group of girls she was close with decided they did not want to be friends with her anymore bc of her behaviour and ended their relationship with her, which caused her to leave that job and seek employment elsewhere. When this was happening I did nothing to let her know that they did in fact have valid points, which I now regret. 

Another problem I had with her was that she would talk so badly about every single person she considers herself to be ""friends"" with. The only people she does not speak badly about are people that she isn't close with, and wants to be like, whether that be looks or personality wise (she told me this herself). I cannot think of a single person she has not talked poorly about, or told their secrets. Because of this behaviour, I know about all her friends sex lives, their grades, their family lives, with screenshots to go along w her stories! This makes me uncomfortable because I feel like if she can tell me everyone else's secrets, what's to stop her from spilling mine? 

She is very rude and manipulative to her mother, will never admit to her wrongs, and blames her mother for being ""crazy"" when she gets mad at her for not doing simple things, such as cleaning up after herself or doing basic household chores.

Other examples:
After a night out, she threw up all over the inside of my car. I did not get mad and cleaned it all up after her, took her back to my house, and put her to sleep after cleaning her. I did this out of love and because I thought that my best friend would do the same for me. Later, when sober she said to me that if I did that to her she would've ""left me on the side of the road"". I felt hurt when she said this because how am I supposed to be her closest friend but she'd say things like that. One of the most petty things she's said to me has been her statements after she buys my outfits head to toe after seeing me wear them. To me, I don't care if she copies them because at the end of the day, clothes are clothes, and if Im buying it from the mall I can guarantee 100 other girls have the same pieces as me. These are not special items by any means. When she tells me she bought my exact clothes, I've complimented her and said they were a good choice, and she would look good in them. She replied back to me by saying that she'd be ""so pissed"" if I did that to her and she would not speak to me. Over clothes? That's literally crazy to me. When I confronted her about these 2 situations she told me that I was taking those situations out of context, and that she would never actually do that stuff and was just saying in comparison to me she is more prone to anger and that is just who she is. 

On Monday, after a week of me ignoring some of her messages and not being my usual self I told her how I felt about her. I explained everything with examples, and told her that because of her behaviour I was finding it difficult to be friends with her. She responded with ""It's your opinion"" and when I told her I was being distant because of the reasons above she said, ""I noticed, I don't care"". I felt a little hurt because I expected an apology or something of the sort but instead she seemed indifferent. After Monday I have not gotten a single message from her. It hurts me to lose a friendship this long because we do have lots of fun memories together, and I would tell her everything, but I just cannot be friends with somebody like this.

318,"I was in a really bad place a few months ago and still am. I made a post on this forum and someone said to feel free to PM them any time I wanted for ""even better advice"". I did that and I enjoyed talking to them and they were really nice. It went on for about a month and reading through the messages again I see that they were hinting that we should stop messaging. It's really embarrassing the last thing I sent them was this big huge long thing with a link in it and then I didn't get anything back for a week. Then I got a message from them saying that they were trying to think how to respond now that I had found some support and that they didn't read my last message. They also said I could contact them again if any new concerns came up but that they advised we stopped messaging back and forth. It was a really soft let down and its humiliating. Anyway I followed through with the advice and it went horribly. Like worse than I could ever imagine. It's not their fault they just gave their opinion and that's what happens when you talk to an online stranger. They said things tho and really Pushed and they didn't have the authority or knowledge to say. 

I made another post on a throwaway account asking for advice on what to do know that this plan has gone really bad. They responded to the post. That was 2 months ago. Then 3 weeks ago they sent a message to both my Throwaway and main account.

I would like to go on and make another post. I attempted suicide again  and other shitty stuff has happened. But they are going to feel entitled to send me a message again when they see the post. I don't want them to feel that way, that is taking advantage of this online stranger. Should I just ignore it and look for another forum to post this stuff?",02Mar2018,1

He also would keep punching me (hard) when I'm tryna work. I've asked him to stop constantly, and he hasn't but still considers us friends. He does this all day and doesn't stop. Every time I go to actually, y'know, swing on him, he says it's all jokes and I'm not any of what he's sayin. The thing is, he gets in plenty of fights with guys twice my size, so I know he's not afraid to fight. The only thing that worked was getting him tf out of my life, now he says I'm the asshole.
