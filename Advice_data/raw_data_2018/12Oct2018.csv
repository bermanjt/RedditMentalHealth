0,"So I (16M) and this girl, let's call her Allie (16F) have been talking for some time, and we've been doing the normal stuff teen couple do when they don't know if they're dating; my arm on her shoulder whenever I can, us holding hands when we're alone, and after about a month, I only just hugged her. But the problem is, her sister is constantly telling me to back off, and stop being so ""physical and inappropriate"" with her. She never makes any hint that Allie doesn't like me, and has told me in the past that if it weren't for Allie, she would never speak to me. I just found out today that her and a friend have been sending pictures of the two of us to her parents, and showing them what we do. When I talked to one of her other friends, I found out that her parents don't like me, and they think I'll touch her inappropriately. I'm to scared to talk to Allie about this, because I feel like her parents will find out somehow. I'm too scared to talk to her sister, because I feel like she'll go directly to her parents. If I can just talk to them in person, I can explain how I'm a nice guy and we both really like each other. Any ideas on how I could get to them and get them to trust me?",12Oct2018,1
1,"(16M) My sister hates me with a passion. It’s a super long story that would take too long to explain but long story short I’ve never done anything bad to her, she just hates me and wants nothing to do with me she never talks to me, we just live at home and never talk and when we do she always finds a way to yell and get mad at me. What should I do? ",12Oct2018,1
2,"I’m 19 and my cousin is 23. We’ve been seeing each other for sex on-and-off for 7 months now. This isn’t a good excuse I know but it started right after my dad died so I was pretty vulnerable. I’ve always thought my cousin was handsome as everyone does but I swear I never had sexual feelings for him until this time. 

The thing that’s the most fucked up, is he isn’t new to this. He was caught in bed with our aunt a few years ago and it fucked things up for quite a bit. He confessed to me that he was sex abused by our other cousin from a really young age so it’s pretty apparent that he’s sick. I feel really guilty because I feel like I added to that (even though he 100% came into me). It’s just a mess. 

I can’t help but look inward at myself and wonder if there’s something deeply, deeply wrong with me. I feel like a monster or something that doesn’t belong in this world. I’ve always felt this way but this just solidified it. I have this huge secret that, if I told others, I’d be completely cast out. And no matter how bad I feel, I genuinely enjoy being with him. I feel like I want to end it all because I CLEARLY don’t belong here. ",12Oct2018,1
3,"Ok I know this is a bit weird, but please bear with me. My sister (31) has always had some mental issues due to a problematic upbringing. You know, abusive distant father, helpless overburdened mother and 4 ""little"" sisters and such.. 

Even though she's 4 years older than me, we had the same experience. But she turned out to be a wild, reckless, impulsive woman. She graduated University with high scores and met her boyfriend about 1,5 years ago. He's a successfull, seemingly intelligent man with an alcohol problem. Their relationship was shit to begin with, but it just got worse. Long story short, he cheated on her and she found out just a couple of weeks ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was mad as all hell, which is understandable.. but instead of leaving him or at least taking her time to think about stuff, she beat him so bad that she actually injured herself. She's a small woman (5'1, around 115lb) but man she rages like a motherfucker. When I first heard about it I was shocked, but I thought that being betrayed, she lost all control. But no, he keeps calling us almost every week to tell us that she's beaten him up again, or she's got hospitalized because she raged so damn much that she couldn't breath anymore and stuff like that. I'm really scared that she'll hurt him or herself in one of those situations.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what the actual fuck is happening to her. She's always been really unstable but never like this. The whole family is kinda scared to say anything cause she is really fucking destructive, but I love her nontheless. Does anybody have any suggestions how to handle her? I've tried talking to her and to her boyfriend, hell I've even convinced them both to see a psychiatrist but it didn't really help. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would y'all do? I realize that she's a grown ass woman but if something happens, I'll feel like a piece of shit if I don't do something now. Please help!

4," 

I haven't had friends throughout elementary school because I was a very introverted kid. I never wanted to socialize because I was to afraid of being judged and rejected by my peers, and so I ended up being an outcast in school. I never had an interest in sports nor was I athletic enough to play sports and I didn't really have a very cheerful personality so it was extremely hard f. There were times where I would just break down and cry in class randomly, get sent to the principal's office or guidance, and tell them that the reason I broke down was because I had no friends. Simply put, my life was very pitiful.

Towards the end of middle school however, on a bus ride home I made one of the closest friends I ever made, let's call him Friend A for convenience purposes. I overheard Friend A talking to someone on the bus that he was going to play minecraft on the way home from school and at that moment something sparked in me and I spoke to him. For the first time in my life (sadly) I had my first ever conversation, at my stop he said he'd invite me to a skype call and on my way out the bus into my door I was ecstatic. I logged onto my computer hopped onto minecraft and joined his server. He invited me into a call, and I joined feeling a bit anxious. That was when I met two other friends, one who i'd also grow to love, Friend B, the other i'd grow to resent to this day, Friend C.

I started off quiet in the skype call but, suddenly out of nowhere I had this impulse and started spewing funny things, consistently making Friend A, B, and C laugh throughout the call. I don't know how I did it but it just came naturally. They complimented me and called me hilarious. For the first time in my life I actually had friends I could connect to, people I can call my friends. It was a moment of pure happiness for me. Towards the end of the call, Friend C said he was going to play League of Legends, another game I played. I told I also play the game and then he invited me to play the game with him, in which I accepted. Over time I grew closer with Friend C then with Friend A and B as he'd always be on skype after school to play video games while Friend A and B had sports. Friend C eventually became my best friend and taught me how to speak to other people, he gave me the confidence to be myself in school and become outgoing.

As I became more and more outgoing I made more and more friends, becoming more and more grateful to Friend C. Soon my reputation throughout school was a funny outgoing guy and it became so easy to make friends. At that point my respect and loyalty to friend C was so high I would have given my life to him if commanded me to, leading to my tragedy in high school. The summer going from the last year of middle school to freshman year of high school was one of the best summers I had. I hung out with Friend A, B, and C outside of school for the first time, and made so many happy memories that I carry with me to this day. I had thought it'd be like this throughout high school and nothing could ruin our friendship. I was so, very wrong.

The first month of high school was great, I established a pretty good image of myself and was able to make friends. However one day, I decided to post something on Snapchat to try and get a few laughs. I won't go into what the post said but, while it was funny to a lot of people, it would also make me seem like a loser to a lot of people. After school when I had come home and gotten on skype like I usually did with Friend A, B, and C they brought up my post. At first they did laugh and I laughed with them but, then they started saying how that post would made me look like a loser. Friend A even told me that if he had posted that he'd have killed himself. This terrified me. It reminded me of the feeling of being and outcast, of not having friends. Thus began my spiral into a deep depression.

I had thought my friends hated me and detested me when they had said that so I tried to take refuge amongst the other friends I had made. I haven't spoken to my friends in 3 months during this time. However one day I had begun to reconnect with Friend A, B, and C. A lot had happened when I wasn't there, a lot of drama which had changed them. They had made a new friend group without me but, apparently some sort of fight had happened and the friend group dissipated. Friends A, B, and C had become more toxic and meaner than usual, especially Friend C, whom I still respected greatly, even after not speaking to for months. They've changed their type of humor to where they roast each other which at the time I didn't see it as that but, as bullying and each time they would ""roast"" me I felt hurt. I didn't know how to communicate my feelings properly as this was the first time experiencing this and so I just sponged it all up. Friend C would roast me the most which would really screw up my mind. I had thought he had hated me since he was doing it so much

Eventually I started going through this phase where I asked everyone if they hated me which annoyed every single one of my friends as well as Friends A, B, and C. I had developed this primarily because Friend C had kept screwing with me verbally to the point where I became traumatized and paranoid of what everyone thought of me. I eventually stopped asking, but at this point I had lost the ability to be consistently funny. There'd be times where I could still be funny but it wasn't as frequent as to when I was a middle schooler. My relationship wasn't as healthy with the 3 of them as it was before, I began to become more and more silent in skype calls, and Friend C would force me to try and be funny in which I couldn't.

There were a few times where I was able to spark up again and feel like my middle school self again, but they'd be quickly quashed by Friend C's ""roasts"" with me. Going into the summer of Freshman Year however, Friend A, and Friend B did something for me that made me respect them more than Friend C. They threw me a surprise birthday party. This meant so much to me as in all my other birthday parties I didn't have friends over, it was just my family. So having my first ever party, not even planned by me, but by my friends made me want to cry tears of joy. I had thought the spark that I had in middle school had lit up again, however Friend C had quashed it again with his what I took for insults towards me, again not being able to tell him about it as I was afraid of losing him. After that party I hadn't hung out with Friends A, B, or C until sophomore year.

The beginning of sophomore year ended up being the same trend throughout freshmen year, being quiet in class, not having the confidence to be my outgoing and funny self with the constant belittlement of Friend C. Then one day, while on the bus, I had told Friend A, I didn't like friend C anymore. To my surprise he said he didn't like friend C either and neither did Friend B. This awoken a side to me, a dark, evil side, one in where i'd begin feel happy that people hated Friend C, one where even though everyone was talking behind Friend C's back, I wouldn't talk about this to Friend C, one where i'd start talking bad about Friend C a lot behind Friend C's back.

I had also made friends with a new person during this time. Lets call him Friend D, I had deeply respected Friend D because I came to him to talk about my problems and my anxieties of dealing with Friend C. He soon became a part of the friend group and began talking with us over discord. I had a lot of classes with friend D so I was able to talk with him frequently and he soon became a really good friend, someone I could trust.

I'm truly ashamed of what i'm gonna say next, but this had sparked me to become funny again and feel free. I had felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders and I wasn't alone anymore. So from fall of last year to December, we'd take every opportunity to make fun of Friend C and hang out without him. At the peak of it, there was a party where friend C wasn't invited to but all of us were and we attended behind his back. However at the beginning of this year Friend C was able to somehow make up with friend C, and even Friend D who hated him because of me began to like him.

This made me anxious as I was scared of things going back to the way they were again. I tried talking to Friend D about Friend C and what his thoughts were and he became mad at me. He wouldn't talk to me anymore and this made me extremely sad. I had fallen into a depressive state and had stopped communicating with Friend's A, B, and C for awhile. Friend A started getting mad at me for cutting all communication with all my other friends. Friend C had also gone back to insulting me, however this time, he was actually bullying me. There were times where he asked someone to throw my backpack in the trash can, other times where he'd step on my shoes in order to make me fall, and times where he'd embarrass / insult me in front of others deliberately trying to make people stay away from me. My depression became so bad that I started skipping school, in order to avoid Friend D and Friend C. This led to me having to receive out treatment patient and being put on Prozac. I even had to go to summer school because I failed 2 classes. It also took away my sense of humor so I can't make people laugh as much anymore.

Friend A however, reached out to me and tried his very best to get me to come back to my old self. He tried extremely hard to help me with everything. At first he didn't believe my depression, but when he came to realize it, he did everything to help me. One time he text messaged me telling me how everyone of my friends were getting mad at me and I shouldn't push people away like this. One other time, when I had run away from my home, he went out looking for with his mom, he looked for 2 hours. It succeeded a few times, I was able to come out for a brief period, but Friend C would constantly put me back down in that state. Seeing Friend C be loved by Friend A, and D while treating me like dirt hurt me so badly that I kept going back down.

At this point you may think I got what I deserve and I agree with you, I am truly a scumbag person, but I wasn't getting put down because of jealousy from Friend C, I was getting put down because Friend C has done nothing but, bully me since Freshman year but, be nice to Friend A and B, which can be my fault for not talking to him about it, but even after he still bullied me. At this point I was just mutual friends with Friends A, B, C, and D. However, at the end of the summer, I decided to block all of them in order to get my head straight and reflect on what i've done. My plan was to come back to school and make friends again with Friends A, B, and D, again and start fresh.

Its Junior year now and i've been able to clear up the misunderstanding with Friend B so were friends again, and I plan on taking my time and slowly rebuild my friendship with him, and Friend D isn't mad at me anymore so were starting off as mutual friends. However I heard from Friend C that Friend A hates my guts now and that they've become great friends. I'm at a loss right now, I want to become friends with Friend A again like we used to be but, I don't know how to approach him. I don't know what to do with Friend C, I hate Friend C but, Friend C and Friend A are so close that if I figure if I decide to become friends with Friend A again then i'd have to accept Friend C again which I don't think I can do. Please tell me a way I can become great friends with Friend A again, I never truly realized how much he meant to me. He doesn't say hi to me in the halls or even acknowledges my existence. I don't know where else to go. Thank you so much for reading through this it really means a lot to me, as well as your input. ",12Oct2018,1
6,Earlier this year I was put on a moral ax regime because I get constipated very easily and I was at that time. The moral ax caused me to bloat. The problem is that I'm bloated if i take it and I'm bloated if I don't. I don't want it to control my life. I barely feel good about myself as it is but I also begin trying to lose weight but you can't see it under the bloat. I want help. but the doctor does not give a fuck.

7,"I've been out of work for a full year now. Technically I've worked within the year but not at legitimate places, just freelance stuff for my friends business that he doesn't do this time of year. I only helped him when he was short staffed, too. 

I had an interview with a place for a seasonal position recently and got the job. It only pays $10.40 an hour, their ad said $15.25 which is why I even went in but after the fact he told me the actual rate. I'm 23 going on 24. So that's pretty much nothing. In gas alone for the commute I'd be working for free for a few hours each shift. It's a basic customer service job too and we're in holiday season now so that means if I do take this job I'll have to consciously make an effort every day to not kill myself because of the over exposure to old, grumpy women and their 50 kids that all want to yell in my ears about how their coupons that expired in the late 90s should apply.


Should I take this position or tell them I got another offer and continue my search? See, I'm at a loss here though, I'm trying to get a decent job even though I've got no college education and all the skills I do have only ""work"" for the employer if I have a degree which I don't have. For example I'm really into computers, editing and the like but any company I apply to they don't give me the time of day since I don't have an official college education even though imo you don't need one for that kinda stuff. Save yourself the $500k and watch a YouTube video lol.

9,"I work in a small office as a medical provider. There’s been a debate here (and at other clinics I’ve worked in) about how to handle certain sticky situations. I’d like to know in general what your opinions are and as a patient/client how you would want things to be handled? I’d genuinely like to improve our office and since I’ve worked in this setting for a while I just don’t know some of these things. 
So first example-if a patient shows up late for an appointment who should be the one to make the call about whether or not they should be seen-the provider or reception? 
Who should be the one to break the news to them if they are not going to be seen-provider or reception? 
On this same subject, how late is too late? We’ve had people get upset with us that they couldn’t be seen after showing up 2 hours late. So what is the appropriate cut off time? I would really like for someone to weigh in on this if you have done this yourself. 
For phone calls-do you prefer the provider call you or reception? I think I know the answer to this one. But I was told at one point that they thought “the provider’s time could be better spent on other things.” Let’s  day you called your eye dr with a question. Would you expect or want the dr to call you back or expect or want reception to call you?
At what point would you start to feel that your wait time was TOO long? 
Do you prefer that medical providers spend a lot of time with you or do you value efficiency/speed more? I.e. would you like if your dental hygienist made small talk, asked about your kids, etc. or just get down to business and get you in and out quickly? 
Do you notice/care about what clothes the office wears? 
Do you notice/care about the look of the office? Like decor, coffee makers, TVs, etc. 
Thanks in advance for any input. ",12Oct2018,1
10,"Basically, the company I work for had an internal scandal over the summer, and a lot of employees were not pleased at how it was resolved and resigned. I work at a smaller branch of the company, and literally everyone at this branch but myself resigned. I felt conflicted, but I chose to stay because honestly this is the best job I've ever had and I would very much like to make a long lasting career out of it. So for a few months, I worked the jobs of multiple people and optimistically applied for the regional director job that had been left vacant as I was already covering the duties of the position. Well, they opted to go with an outside hire for the director position. This was remarkably frustrating, but I can understand it from a purely business perspective because the new hire is qualified. However, after that, it feels like they've been more and more blatantly disrespectful to me. They offered me no advancement whatsoever, despite the fact that I'm literally the only one in the office with any experience. They took me off all the calls and conferences I had enjoyed being a part of while working as interim director. They told me I would retain my previously negotiated salary, even though that figure was determined when I was part of a larger team working under people with more experience instead of the other way around. Now, it feels like they are just flaunting the budget in my face as they are about to hire an assistant to do the work I was already doing instead of just offering me a raise. It feels like they are outsourcing my work and muscling me out. I have tried to not allow myself to give into a conspiracy mindset, but it feels like they are trying to get me to quit on my own so they can start with a clean slate where no one in the office knows about the coverup.

17," 

I'm 20 years old and a sophomore in college.

I never had any experience with girls in high school, but started picking up confidence and developed a lot socially as college started up. I started expanding my social group little by little, talking to more girls, and lost some weight to find that I actually am kind of attractive under all of that fat. Things were looking great until literally everything fell apart one day.

I had a bad accident that was completely preventable a while back. It was totally my fault, but I reacted badly, made an embarrassment of myself, pointed fingers, and lost the respect of everyone in my social circle. I kept trying to fit myself back in with the same people frivolously and eventually came to realize that I've been in complete denial the whole time and things aren't the same as they were before.

This realization hit with full force. I fell into depression, used drugs as an escape route, and found myself isolated from everyone and doing nothing other than work and sitting around looking for anything that changed my conscious. I've cut down the drugs since this dark period of isolation, though I still use on occasion, but my social life and group of people I hang out with is still nonexistent and characterized by very, very few individuals that don't respect me, but dig deep into their hearts to let me chill despite their deep-rooted spite towards me.

A lot of my confidence derived from my looks. My face went through some development after my weight loss and high school. I saw myself as a good-looking person now and didn't let my no-longer-existing presumption of my bad looks as something that holds me back. The attitude change was incredible. However, the accident involved some blows to the face and head and saw the facial changes immediately after I left the ER.

I now have a dorsal hump on my nose, and my nose droops down more than it used to. My brow ridge protrudes A LOT more now--if I relax my eyebrows, I look very sad, ugly, and antisocial--very difficult to approach: girls and guys. My forehead is not as vertical as it used to be, and my hair isn't as full anymore. My top jaw looks like it expanded; I had dental treatment for an overbite as a kid, and it looks like the accident damaged my teeth and my overbite started forming again as time went on. This affects my speech, and I can no longer speak clearly as I used to or gather my thoughts together as efficiently for fear of stuttering or sounding stupid.

My story makes it sound like I went through severe facial trauma causing my face to be deformed. This isn't the case--my face is still 'me,' but with much uglier features. I get no attention from girls now and I get less respect from guys as my masculine facial features are gone. I look much younger; I get ID'd at places I know for sure wouldn't if I see a new employee. People constantly question my age. I'm constantly conscious of my overbite. I think my brain still remembers how my face used to be and keeps telling me something is 'wrong,' or 'off,' if you know what I mean.

I have no confidence now. I think if I still had my face, the social situation could be saved. I'm so bothered by my looks; I can't stand to look at my reflection anymore and my self-image is horrifyingly negative. I literally \*\*HAVEN'T HAD A SEX DRIVE IN SEVERAL MONTHS\*\*, and I think it's because I see myself as completely undesirable now.

I have no money to pay for any operation.

This is extremely disheartening. I see no way out of this and I feel like giving up. I have no self-respect anymore. I've lost literally everything on the surface that gave me confidence. I'm constantly depressed/anxious or both. It's so bad I've actually been having suicidal ideations for the first time in my life, and I feel like everyday is slightly closer to my end, even though I haven't actually planned anything.

To summarize, I've:

\--Lost my friends

\--Lost my looks

\--Lost my confidence

\--Lost my sex drive

\--Lost all respect for myself

My brain is constantly searching for solutions and it's finding nothing except for the occasional idea of suicide. I don't know what to do.",12Oct2018,1

20,"So I (22yrs old)have only been with a guy a couple of times and the times that I have been with a guy were not very enjoyable. But i only think that because i wasn’t attracted to them. I am also not open about even having feelings for guys. I have really only been with girls and i like girls but i think i have this thing for older guys. I don’t quite understand it. I don’t really want to tell anyone either. 
But now at work there is this manager that i think i have a crush on. I don’t know if he is gay. The only reason to even think he is gay is because this rumor went around that he was gay. He is 38 and single and hasn’t had a gf in a couple years. He doesn’t hit on girls. 
I want to tell him something because I can’t stop thinking about him. But he is my manager and if i tell him that i like him it could make the work environment really weird. he could reject me and say that he is straight. So I don’t know how to tell him or if i should even try. 
I really want to find out if he is gay though. So if anybody has an indirect way to find out that would be nice. Any advice helps.",12Oct2018,1
22,"So I'm in my final year of university and living on residence at my university. When I moved into residence everything was great! Good roommates, decently clean room, etc. But once it started to snow/get cold (I live in Calgary, Canada) I started to notice a hum during the day and at night.

At first I barely noticed it but as the weather got colder the humming started to get louder. Sometimes it's as loud as 60 decibels which really hurts my already sparse sleeping schedule (most nights I only have a 4-8 hour window in between working and classes to get some sleep). Even when I do get a full 8 hours I find that I'm incredibly tired and I never feel well rested. For reference last year I was running the same schedule and didn't have this problem.

I'm wondering if their is anything I can do about this problem. I've already tried earplugs but they feel uncomfortable and make it equally hard to sleep. I've already paid the deposit for my room and kind of like my roommates. Any and all advice is welcome and much needed!",12Oct2018,1

32,"I have $10,000 in medical debt, on top of $30,000 in student loans. I just started a good job, but I'm at the bottom. and with all these surprise deaths that keep popping up, I am thinking about filing bankruptcy in order to get rid of the medical debt. I know I won't be able to get rid of the student debt, but I'm working on paying that down. But with things so early in my life, I don't know how I'm going to be able to pay for my medical debt. I created over a period of two years and it's from PTSD and being run over. I don't know what to do.

If I pay $1,000, $10,000 in headache disappear. And I understand I have a few benefits that might also disappear with that 10 grand. Like my 401k that just hit 1000, but if the court tries to take the 1000 my company only allows 20% of it to be returned to me, or essentially to my debt. The only thing I own is a car, and it's from 2007. So it's not worth anything to them. I don't know what to do and I don't know how to go forward. I'm so lost right now and I'm so stressed out. On top of that, I find out that in the end of 2016 at my previous job they didn't give me benefits for 2016, when 2.1k and debt appeared. I don't even know what to do. I am just so thankful the state of Wisconsin isn't processing my debt as medical fraud- because that $2,100 was covered under state benefits even though I was employed full-time with no benefits.

I just want to get out of all the debt. I'm really trying hard to pay my student loans and that's literally all I can focus on. I live with my parents for now and I'm just trying to get by, they're going to be moving and so that means I'll have to move out which isn't a problem until we factor in the debt and the possibility of garnishment and my ability to physically have a place to live. Because I don't make enough to have a place to live right now...... 

I know it's $10,000, and compared to a lot of people that's not much when it comes to medical debt, but for me and my situation I'm literally at a loss for what to do. I need advice, because bankruptcy sounds like the perfect way out. I don't want to be using the system though, but if it means between me having my own apartment and being able to pay down my student loans easier I'm going to do it.

Sorry that this is long but I just wanted to give a background of why I am asking what I am asking...

Ok so my friend and I for the longest time have been overweight/obese practically our whole lives (middle school, high school, college). A few years ago, my friend found this extreme diet where it was no carbs and really low calories. She told me about it and even though the diet sounded insane, I decided to do it with her. This is pretty much where we both attempted to start our weight loss journey. 

I ended up not doing well. Sure I lost 20 pounds but I ended up gaining it back but not like right away. It actually took me probably a year later to gain it back because I was eating poorly and stress eating a lot. I ended up being my heaviest which is what I currently am right now because I gained more than 20 pounds back. These past few months I been stuck the same weight and just recently been eating more healthy. 

Meanwhile my friend lost a bunch of weight with the no carb diet. After that there were times where she might gain like 10-20 pounds, which she would understandably be upset about. And then she would go back to the strict diet back and fourth until she found a diet that wasn’t as strict but still didn’t allow more than 20 carbs or something like that.

So these past few months, she’s been very close to her goal weight. But she’s been stuck trying to loose the last 15 to 20 pounds. My dilemma has been that every single time I see her, she always has to mention that she needs to loose these last 20 pounds. Is been like this for several months. As someone who is insecure and struggles with their weight and loosing weight, it bothers me that she mentions that she needs to loose the last 20 whenever I see her. I don’t know how to explain the feeling. It kind of hurts to hear her say it. I understand that she is struggling and I get her obsession but I just wish she would stop saying it. She does other things too. 

I actually mentioned to her that I wish she would stop saying it but I don’t think she took it well that I said that. I don’t want to hurt her feelings but I don’t know how else to say it. I have very hard time articulating how I feel and I don’t think she gets how I feel because of that. 

How should I explain to her that I wish for her to stop saying she needs to loose the lost 20? ",12Oct2018,1

She looks through my phone and every time I’m out somewhere or at home and if she here a girl in the background it’s always 

“Who’s that ??” 
“Where are you ??” 
“There better not be no fuckin bitches with you...”

I’ve worked in banking at some level ever since I was 18. Teller, head teller, banker, loan officer, assistant manager, basically everything except an actual branch manager position. I currently make about $45,000 a year and am getting by just fine. Obviously more money is ideal and definitely necessary but I’m also not broke. I know I’m qualified for a manager position and could get one more than likely if I kept applying. Here’s the deal though, I fucking hate my job. Honestly I feel like Peter from Office Space when he says that every day is the worst day of his life. I want a job outside of customer service and that’s basically all I have ever done. I have no experience doing anything else. I sold cars for like 9 months at 18 and then took a bank job because of the hours and good pay.

I currently have an associates degree in general business and am in process of getting my bachelors in business administration. I’m about 1.5 - 2 yrs away depending on how many classes I can take each semester. My work helps with school so Ive been paying out of pocket with just 1-3 online classes each semester and luckily have no student loan debts. I’d be willing to sacrifice the tuition reimbursement to get out of the customer service industry.

38,"Today was weird. I woke up normally, greeted my mom, had breakfast, went to school. Everything was normal. Then in the middle of school my dad sent me a text saying my brother was in the hospital, don't worry. And the day resumed.

I though he fell down the stairs again because he did that a couple of days ago. I wasn't even thinking about his cancer coming back. Later I got home and saw the shower curtain was torn down. You'd probably think oh he slipped in the shower and maybe smacked his head. Whatever.

Then I saw my mom who wasn't too thrilled about anything, genuinely sad. I asked her what he was it the hospital for and he said he overdosed. My response was just ""oh.""

I am not very emotionally invested in my family, I hate them. My brother just dropped out of college for the second time and I generally see him as a loser.

42," So I asked this girl out to the school dance. Up until yesterday, I was led on to believe that she had interest in me. She decided to pay for the dance tickets (as well as pay back my dad for accidentally buying them), and she shows some little signs (body language, eye contact, interest in conversation). However, yesterday, she had to make something very clear to me (she didn't hint at this earlier). She needed to make sure that I knew that we weren't slow dancing (no big problem, it's a very casual dance) because she said romantic things make her uncomfy.

Go forward a couple of hours later, and she reveals to me over text why she gets uncomfy by romantic things. Throughout early high school, let's just say she made some mistakes when it came to relationships. These mistakes ended up in everyone viewing her as slutty or easy. Now, one of the main reasons (she specified main reason so there are more reasons) she doesn't like romance is because she seems worried about her reputation. Strangely enough, she hasn't mentioned anything about boys that makes her dislike romance. It's because of how people may view her. Now, we're seniors, and Idk if everyone still views her that way (I'm alot less social). I feel very bad for her because she said she's stuck in the past and this gets in the way alot.

After those mistakes, she seems to have changed negatively where social things seem to center around this. I'm left in a conundrum. I clearly have interest in her (especially now since we know each other alot better), but I am a little upset that her boundary is creating that divide between us. It limits all relations to her within school to friendships, and that's not good for her as far as I can tell (she is hurting herself and others cause of her hesitation). I've asked guys what I should do, and those idiots tell me to flirt cautiously. However, this boundary is extremely significant to her, and she hasn't gotten past it. My family members have all told me to just stay friends, but that limits possibility for more in our relationship in the future. They want me to stay friends with her until she becomes more comfortable. I understand both sides of the argument. Surprisingly, I'm not upset that she denied wanting to do anything romantic (I was kinda relieved actually), but I would be very sad if I don't maintain some degree of a close relationship with her. I think she's very interesting, and she is one of the few people I've met who share alot of things with me.

tl;dr - Do I push her boundaries when it comes to romance, or do I stay friends until she's more comfortable?",12Oct2018,1
43,"I guess I am going to start this by saying I am a 44 year old, male kindergarten teacher.  I am good at my job, and am well liked in my school, but I have spent my entire career being very careful around my students, because I know that there will always be eyes watching me carefully.  I know it would take just one misinterpretation of something I did to ruin my reputation, and no matter how well I could prove my innocence, my career would be over.  Who would want to let their 5 year old be in a class with a man accused of inappropriate conduct?

Despite all of that, when I found out my 3 year old daughter had a man for her after preschool care, I automatically felt suspicious.  But I quickly told myself I was over-reacting, and let it be.  And I have started to like ""Mr. T.""  He takes the kids outside on nature walks often, and lets them explore and get dirty.  I have watched him interacting with the kids and he does well with them.

But about a week ago, my daughter started talking about Mr. T. Being the tickle monster, and he chases them trying to tickle them.  A few days after that, i was able to see him through a window playing with the kids, and him saw pick up a girl and swoop her up in his arms.  When I went out to get my daughter, other kids were yelling for the tickle monster.  Why I didn't say anything at that time is beyond me, but I didn't, and I haven't heard anything again until tonight.  Whole we were playing, she said, ""Tickle me like Mr. T. does!""

So now I am going to say something, but I am not sure what, and to who.  I want to go to Mr. T. myself, let him know I am also a man who works with young children, that I have been hearing about the tickle monster, I am uncomfortable with it, and warn him that he could get himself into a lot of trouble if he is not more careful.  I would like to approach not as if he is a predator, but as someone who needs some advice.  Why I am hesitant to do this is because of potential backlash against my daughter.  I don't know that if he were angry that he would take it out her, but I also don't know that he WOULDN'T.  After all, I never thought there would be a tickle monster in the first place.  Even if he was not mad, he might become overly cautious, and avoid my daughter.  She may need help, like legitimate help with the bathroom, or a cut or scrape, and I don't want her left to fend for herself because her care-taker is afraid to go near her.

I considered contacting the people in charge of the daycare.  I know that they should keep things anonymous, but there is no guarantee.  And I could write an anonymous email.  But my gut is telling me this guy is not dangerous, but making stupid decisions.  I absolutely want him to stop tickling my daughter and be more aware of what is appropriate, but I don't know that I feel he needs to lose his job.

Between his job and my daughter's safety, she obviously wins.  I just want to handle it in the most fair and safest way for all involved.  So what would be my best way to approach this?

The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship.
The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see? Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room funny. I wonder why she would think it is funny.
My wife says bring her if she would like to and my daughter says she would like to but I don't know if it is a good idea. She hasn't gone yet so we can still discuss it together.",12Oct2018,1
53,"I've been making an effort towards befriending people I've met online. Like... say if I meet someone online, maybe from a forum for games or like some community of a shared interest. And if we seem to hit it off, I try to make friends with them, especially it if it seems like there's mutual interest.

&amp;#x200B;

But what I'm unsure of is when you actually start messaging each other privately, out of groups, out of public online spaces. I feel it's hard to keep a conversation going online. I'm pretty good at it IRL (off the net I mean)  and that's partly cos I get to read their reactions, I get to see their expressions, body language, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Like irl, if they say  ""I'm fine"" but they're really not, it's easy to tell cos their body language lies about it. But online? I don't get it. I feel like I have less information chatting online, but I really want to become better at it!

I'm an 18 year old guy from the UK  in his first few weeks of uni. I would like to know how to show my interest to girls in a club (I know this is a weird sounding sentence, but I'm not quite sure how to put this normally across in pure text). I'm used to going to house parties, which were much easier to approach people imo as I could actually have a conversation with people with having to shout and be succinct.

I know it sounds stupid, but I'm so tired of not knowing what the f*ck I'm doing in a club.

Another note is that I have not even been with a girl before. It seriously frustrates me that I'm the only guy in my friend group in this situation: it feels like I'm not as good as my mates. I hate having to approach girls in a club as I feel like a complete asshole, and I feel like everything I can possibly say is superficial in nature.

I want to just tell her and just end this by either getting rejected or starting to date, but I'm in a difficult situation to tell her. I'm really socially awkward to people I don't know, and struggle to make new friends, and I would consider her a really strong friend. We talk quite often and quite personally. She's one of the only people I know that deals with depression to the extent I do, and having someone to talk to is really helpful and important. I really value my friendship with her, and that's why I'm so hesitant to confess my feelings. I'm just infatuated by her though, I love everything about her, and I find little interest at all in most people. I'm in a better position with her than I would be with anyone else, as I already know that she at least enjoys my company and trusts me, where as with anyone else I would just be this weird creep. I like her like no one else, and I have better standing with her than anyone. It will be disastrous if I tell her and the feelings aren't mutual though, as that would make things awkward and potentially ruin one of my few good friendships. Fucking things up with her would be horrible for both of us, and I really don't want to do that. If I simply ignore this and never tell her, I doubt I'll ever get an opportunity as good as this and will regret it for a long time. What should I do, tell her and risk the friendship, or preserve the friendship and throw away an amazing opportunity? Does telling someone you have feelings for them even ruin your friendship with them? If I got rejected would it be possible for things to remain the way they are?

Hi Reddit,

I am pretty much at the end of my rope with my sibling and I’m not sure what to do at this point. I have an older sister who is married and has a child. We’ve never been super close growing up due to our age gap. She moved out of the house at a young age and right at my age where we would have maybe started to bond. Growing up, she usually would exclude me from her friends and activities due to me being so young. I often felt like an only child more than anything because of how distant we were, but we did have our moments at times. 

Nowadays, I’m engaged and finishing up my last year of graduate school. Meanwhile, she is unemployed and alone with her child while her husband works crazy shift work hours. Needless to say, I am pretty busy with night classes, my externship, and wanting to spend alone time with my fiancé while trying to make time for everything else in life. My fiancé and I still live at home while saving up to move out this coming Spring; Fortunately we live very close, so it isn’t a problem.  

Usually on weekends, my fiancé and I like to go out and have date nights together. We love spending time alone, but we also spend a fairly decent amount of time with our families. My sister and her family will come over 1-2 times a week to my parent’s house where we will have dinner together. I usually will consider this “time” spent with family. However, this is not good enough for her. Since she is left home alone with no hobbies, no company besides her son, and nothing to do – she is constantly wanting to come over to my parent’s house, calling my mother 10 times a day, and just needing attention. She is always picking fights with me that I don’t ask her to hang out enough. 

To avoid conflict, I decided to invite her to go out this weekend with my fiancé and I. This was fine at first, and then all hell broke loose today. The reason for this was we decided to go out to eat for dinner before he goes into work and didn’t invite her to come with us since she is home alone. From here on, I’ve been dealing with nothing but rude remarks and comments/text messages making me feel like a big POS. Not to mention, flipping out about me to my mother complaining about me. Yet, I'm expected to ask her to spend time with me.

I am not a perfect sister, I am sure I could have asked her to go out more. There are obviously more deeply rooted problems with her behavior, but personally I’m not sure what to do at this point. ",12Oct2018,1

70,"I recently left a 10 year relationship and am dealing with it fairly well. During our relationship, he pushed me to go back to school in order to advance my career. I enjoy my current position and it pays well enough to satisfy my wants in life. I can fully support myself and live a life I can be proud of. He wanted more though...He wanted mansions and nice cars. He wanted us to be a power couple. I never thought those things were important. I just wanted to live life and have great experiences with the people I love. My version of a happy life was much simpler than his.

71,"I work at big nationwide chain.
Here's what happened.  A corporate email with 300 employees' ID numbers was sent to managers nationwide. My GM forwarded it to my manager who forwarded the attachment to every single person at my branch including non relevant lower level staff. My manager addressed 20 of us to complete online training in the body of the email. However he attached the original document that included nationwide employees' full names, and ID numbers. 

IDs are not our social security numbers but it is still personal. My concern is that any one can call HR with the ID and they can change our address,  ask about payroll,  get immediate reset passwords where they can access every kind of personal info possible. All HR needs is the name and ID when you call. 

I am concerned for myself, staff here and also the  other 280 employees who are unaware their info has been compromised. I can call HR tomorrow to see if I can place a password or PIN on my account. I hesitate to email my 2 bosses not to email to all staff as this is unprofessional and a breach of privacy.  I feel that addressing them will hurt my career with the company in the long run.  I also think calling the ethics line will hurt my career. I have thought about emailing the rest of the 280 people as I have their entire name and therefore their email but maybe that is too much. 

I doubt it is in the interest of corporate to address this breach as it pertains to employees only and not any HIPPA violation.

I need to hear your advice and opinions as my coworkers involved thinks it's no big deal or explains it off as mistake by someone technically challenged. (My manager has a habit of forwarding our responses to him, and emailing All staff about every gripe he has with anyone)

72,"I have terrible eye sight. Simply atrocious! Things have to be at least three inches in front of me before I can see without corrective lenses!

Now, I prefer wearing my glasses because I like how I look best with them on. However, I cannot stand the finger prints and scratches. I despise getting stuck out and about with smudges and streaks that I can’t unsmudge or unstreak at that moment (like if I don’t have the right cloth or the Lens Lords just decide they want to be particularly unhelpful that day) It’s the worst!

So, I’ve started wearing my contacts lately, but I feel pretty naked and “meh” without my glasses. I’m thinking of buying a variety of cheap fake glasses and then wearing those *over* my contacts, purely for the aesthetics and comfort factor. I like the idea of having flexibility to wear glasses, but be able to take them off at home/in private or if they get smudgy and I can’t clean them right away. I’m also excited about the prospect of trying out more fun frame styles! I only have two prescription frames right now. I kept the styles pretty conservative even though the second was suppose to be my “fun” pair, it’s still pretty safe. 

I guess my reservations with this come from... obviously it’s redundant and a bit silly of me. My friends who need glasses complain (weirdly often) about people who wear fake glasses for fashion when *they* actually *need* them and wear them because they have to. I feel like... I’d be a weird vision poser, lol. Also, I’m probably just unnecessarily convoluting things and making a bigger hassle for myself.

How dumb is this idea? Are there alternatives I haven’t considered maybe? Should I just get over it and live a glassesless face life even though glasses are my preference?

(aside from cost, this is why I haven’t considered lasik ever... I don’t wanna give up my glasses!)

It doesn’t seem to matter who it is, they always ask me for money.

The thing is that all of them now make more than me and I don’t understand why it’s always me picking up that slack. I never ask for money from them and even if I did they would say they got nothing.

I say no, and get the bearded dragon's food out of the fridge. While i'm getting her out of her terrarium to eat and run around my stepfather says: ""I guess the programming has worked on you then..."" Immediately feeling insulted by this I bring up the fact that whenever my mother makes a prediction on something he doesn't want to hear, he'll call it cursing. He tries deny any of that happening recently, but then I bring up how my mother thought a tree limb could fall over outside since it was windy, that the limb itself was dead, and that it was heavy. He still denied that but, then I said he also call her a manipulative witch when she was trying to explain why the limb was about to fall over. After that he said it was still cursing even though the tree limb never actually fell over. After some more bickering and me telling him that he knows nothing about how cursing works, my mom walks in and asks what was going on. I told her it was about how she cursed the tree limb. My stepfather stuck to his cursing argument, while me and my mother said it was just drawing a conclusion or in this case, pointing out a potential safety hazard. I eventually say, that using his logic predictions and conclusions must be forms of cursing. He fires back with ""It depends on how the sentence is worded!"" *(He's also told my mother that she's going to hell on a few occasions too)* After saying that he decides to bring in god to change the subject and brings up how it's good to believe in him and that my mother doesn't *(Mother was raised in a staunch and devout catholic family)* After a moment, I say that you don't need to believe in god to be a good person and that just believing in god or saying that you do doesn't give you much moral high ground and that your actions and how you treat others has a big impact too. Says that still believing in god makes you a good person which means he's really contradicted himself (If you don't see where i'm coming from with this, refer to the words in italics please) My mother elaborates on what I had said and brought up a few incidents where he had really fucked up and how he put the blame on my mother.

79,"(This is really long and I apologize but I need help with this situation and I appreciate deeply if you stick around for this wild saga)

In short: I had a sexual and romantic relationship with a girl from tinder for months before she returned with her ex and I’m still in love with her. She seems to have reciprocated feelings but I’m not sure what to do.


So I met this girl off of tinder and we hit it off right away. We talked everyday straight for about a month before we met and instantly I felt like my soul was at home with her. Problem was that she had just gotten out of a really long relationship.. I don’t want to be too specific in case one of them sees this post and figures out it’s me. She didn’t know where it was going with the relationship but we hung out frequently on date like activities and sex. About 3 months into our almost relationship she told me that she was talking about getting back with her ex, and although I previously stated to her that we would remain friends but immediately after receiving that information I told her that I was sorry but I could no longer have contact with her because my feelings were too strong at that point. She did get upset and we talked a few times before we halted all contact. Cut to a few months later after constantly thinking about her she messaged me. The conversation was basically her saying she’s been waiting to be friends again and I responded with how I still have not gotten over her but I would push it aside in order to have her in my life again. She was okay with that and we’ve talked every day since. So recently we decided to go on a short trip 2 states away just us two and I had no intention of attempting anything towards her or indicating in any way that I still had feelings for her. Due to complications we had to subtract the first day from the trip and ended up spending the night at her and her girlfriends. Her girlfriend wasn’t coming home for a while and the girlfriends sister was also there. We exchanged multiple glances in a more than friendly way and we playfully teased each other in a flirtatious way when the sister was not around. When her girlfriend arrived any playful flirting or glances halted on both ends which I noticed immediately. So the next day we have the long drive and although we were both nervous as this was our first trip together but given our chemistry it was short lived nerves. We went back to playfully joking and I used any excuse to be able to look at her when she smiled  as she laughed at my jokes or playful teasing. Every time I looked at her it was if time had stopped and the way she looked in my eyes when I teased her or vise versa it was something I’ve never felt before. It was like every atom in my body was tugging me in her direction at all times even though I was fighting the magnetic attraction. The trip went extremely well and we continued to have the moments where I could tell there was something more than just a friendship. The first night we had gone to the hotel pool and I let her use my bathing suit as I did not want to swim. I went with her because she’s a petite beautiful girl and I did not want to let her go alone. When we got there we were pleasantly surprised to have the pool to ourselves. I made sure that I made it obvious that I was diverting my attention towards anything else other than her as she got into the pool. She continued to make conversation with me as she swam and made jokes about me joining her and how cold it was. I couldn’t help it at this point but to bring attention to her as she swam and made goofy noises because I was teasing her about them. She swam up to the entrance of the pool and invited me to feel the temperature of the water. I did hesitantly but when I got there she splashed me and I retaliated with the same. She again gave me a warm glance and swam back towards the middle of the pool. After some time she grew tired and we retreated back to the hotel room. The next day we ventured into outdoor activities and ended up talking about our past sexual relationship. I was redundant to continue the conversation as I was trying to fight my feelings for her but ended up continuing for a short bit. After our outdoor activities I realized how in love with her I still am. We enjoyed a movie together that night and we returned to the hotel room. After a bit she decided she was going to change into her night clothes and made a quick joke again about our past sexual relationship and I did the same. Short time and a couple of conversations after we fell asleep. The last morning before checkout she went to breakfast and returned later and went back to sleep. After waking up at roughly the same time her and I (separate beds) conversed about her dream she had about me and it gave me the excuse I needed to look at her for an extended amount of time and it was quite obvious that I was looking at her in a longing way and I didn’t even try to hide it at this point. We were on the edge of the beds closest to eachother and all I wanted to do is be next to her. We checked out of the hotel and went to another outdoor activity and continued our forbidden flirting before we had to head home. On the way back I had the deepest sadness because I want to be with her. I have had many flings since her and no one has ever compared to the way she makes me feel. I know it in my heart that there is something between us but I’m afraid that since she’s been with her girlfriend for many years and has established so much that I’ll never have a chance to be with her. I don’t want to cease contact with her but I know that remaining friends with her will drown me into a pool of hope that may or may not result into a romantic relationship with her.

88,"So I've decided after I graduate this year I'm moving to be with my LDR significant other. I've been to his house many times over the past 3 years we've been together. He unfortunately lives in a very high crime, notorious part of L.A.. It's not just perceived, it's crime I've actually experienced. His family's car was stolen out of their driveway when I was staying with them. There was another time a car was stolen too. And then today someone stole the tabs right off his car. That is next level ghetto!

I am concerned about moving into a high crime area after living in a low crime area my whole life. What can I do when I move there to protect my car/myself? A dash cam in the car? Security cameras? There isn't any wifi on the side of the house closest to the driveway. What security options without wifi are there? This is all completely new to me. Price range? I'm hoping for options that aren't super complex since I'm sure his family will be annoyed that they've lasted this long without it, but I'll waltz in demanding it.

89,"So, I have come to realization lately that I have a huge disdain for Native Americans. I don’t know any natives personally and they have never done anything to affect my life. A member from my mothers side of the family was in the Trail of tears and I’m told I’m like 1/32 Cherokee (so basically I’m not native myself ). 

Every year around Columbus Day or Thanksgiving, some of my more liberal friends talk bad on colonists and Americans (keep in mind we’re all American), how we committed genocide, and how we should give them their land back. To me, I don’t see the extermination of natives as that big of a deal since disease was the main cause. No matter how the Europeans went about making contact with the Americas, natives were going to die because of lack of immunity and eventually lack of technology.

I know I’m in the wrong, i know I probably shouldn’t think the way that I do but I do not know how to change my mind to be more sympathetic to what the natives have gone through. Keep in mind, when I call myself a racist, I don’t mean I go out and call any native I find an Injun or Redskin. If I were to met them, I’d be very polite like I naturally am. But inside my mind, I just don’t care at all about what they’ve been though. I’d say it’s more of an institutional racism than a personal one.

To keep it brief, for the past 5-6 years I've known a girl. When I met her we became good friends almost immediately. I couldn't put a finger on why, but we just clicked. We are and have been *incredibly* close. Even though I kept it under wraps, I was really attracted to her. Thats how it was for a solid 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Warp to only a year and a half ago

After a few years, our friendship shifted and we started to fool around. Eventually it got to the point where she was coming over ever few nights and would stay the night. I though it was going really great but after a few months things turned south. She - without any warning - just stopped hanging out (As in - full on ghosting me).  After one or two weeks, I was able to make contact and asked what went wrong. She dodged most questions I asked, the few answers she gave being very vague. It really did a number on my self esteem as I thought I did something horribly wrong. I grew depressed  (Probably? I dont exactly know what qualifies as depression, but i was super down for a long while) and gained some weight (Started a vicious cycle blah blah blah). 

&amp;#x200B;

Warp to a few months ago

She starts flirting with me again and I thought this was a second chance... fall for her again after getting over it over a half year ago... you get the idea. But this time something is different. She seemed really on and off when it came to knowing i existed and I couldn't really figure out why she was acting like that. I would outright ask her what shes feeling, but i dont know if I want to blow a second chance.

Today I found a book that she owns that goes into exactly how to manipulate people using seduction. Some text on the front cover even says : 1. Choose the right victim 2. Approach indirectly 3. Send extremely mixed signals 4. Create a need 5. Stir anxiety and self consciousness... etc

97,"Hi this is my first post so please bear with me. 

I have lived with roommate A for about 4 years now. We met as random roommates and it worked out well and now we are best friends. Roommate B moved in with us 3 years ago. Roommate A and Roommate B met in class and became friends quickly. Now the 3 of us are best friends and spend most of our free time on the weekends and sometimes during the week together. I'm more introverted and have a boyfriend, so during the week when I have free time I like to spend it alone or with him.

About a year ago I started to get suspicious that there was something more going on between them more than normal friends. They started sleeping in roommate A's bed together most of the time. They are in the same major, so they have all of their classes together. They also work at the same job. They also eat every meal together, go to the store together, and do just about everything together. I started picking up on things that they were trying to hide from me. They always close roommate B's door at night to make it seem like she is sleeping in there, but then I hear her cough in roommate A's room. Roommate B's phone charger has been plugged in next to roommate A's bed for the past few months. They have also made comments to overcompensate for such behavior which I felt was strange and unnecessary. I've occasionally walked into my house while they are sitting intimately. 

So tonight it was really bothering me. You know when you just know something is going on and your intuition is just telling you you're right? So, they were both gone and Roommate A left her laptop on the coffee table. I'm super ashamed of this and would normally never invade someone's privacy like this, but, obviously you can tell, I logged onto her laptop and opened her messages app. She disconnected her iCloud account sometime around July I guess because there were no recent messages, but there were messages from the summer. I scrolled up in the conversation between them just a little bit and quickly came across a video of one of them masturbating that they sent to the other. And the other responded in a way that clearly indicated to me what I had suspected. I didn't look for anything else and quickly logged out. 

So now I've confirmed that they are more than friends and have been for at least a while. They know that I am very open to loving who you love and they know I would never judge them for anything. However, they both have families that would probably be unsupportive of this. I only feel uncomfortable because of the position I am in. These are my best friends and I tell them pretty much everything. I understand that this is different for them and they don't even feel comfortable revealing this to me.

Now I'm stuck. I feel like if I confront them/try to get them to tell me I will make it even more uncomfortable. They will feel weird being out and I will feel weird for outing them. Or they may feel more comfortable around me and start to exclude me more. But if I don't then I have to carry around this burden of secretly knowing and kinda just feel weird. 

Hope this makes sense. Please let me know what you think I should do.

99,"(I posted this in AmITheAsshole a week ago, I've updated the situation so far)

Hello everyone, my sister[21F] and I[25F] are roommates. We have been pretty much the closest siblings I've ever known. We've always been best friends, have had the same circle of friends, and have had a great friendship. My sister has bipolar disorder, ADD, and has been known to use many different drugs. We haven't been seeing a lot of each other the past few months, as she spends her time outside of our place but when she is home and around me, she has been very prone to rage and takes her frustration out on me quite often. She tends to call me an idiot, lazy, worthless, and other things along those lines. I usually respond by saying ""I hate when you do this, stop it,"" and then I leave her by herself or she keeps going until I am in tears. I usually feel awful afterward as I take the things she says to heart. I struggle with my own self worth, but I try to keep it to myself. I know she struggles with many issues and I always forgive her and tell her it's okay.

Three weeks ago she told me she wanted to stop and be sober and I told her it would be a good idea. I gave her space and told her if she needed anything I'd help her. Last week she told me she was going to spend the week at her friend's house. When she came back last Thursday, I was excited to see her and asked if she wanted to play a video game with me. When we were about to start she started getting aggitated and telling me I was loud, annoying, and stupid. I kind of snapped in the moment and told her I couldn't take the verbal abuse anymore. I told her I have major self esteem issues and her berating me does not help. I asked her if she actually likes me as a person or if she just tolerates me because I am her sister. I said no one wants to be friends with someone who is annoying, lazy, and stupid so why does she tolerate me. She said ""I'm always angry"" and ""it's not about you."" I asked her if she could put more effort into not treating me so poorly and she said ""no, get out of my room."" I then told her I would no longer make an effort to spend time with her if she would not put effort into treating me with more respect. She said that's a good idea. Friday night she came into my room asking me for my cell phone because she gave it to me, she said ""I bought it, it's mine, and you're the one who wants to cut off ties with me."" She then told me she had sell things so that she could move out ASAP. I didn't know what to do. I was upset and told her I didn't want her take it and I also told her I was hoping she'd want to consider treating me better so that we could have a relationship like we did when we were younger. She told me she didn't want to consider it and that I am fucking annoying.

So that is all of it. We haven't spoken since. I told her that she could talk to me whenever, I just wanted to know she would be making an effort to treat me better, but she has refused to acknowledge me.

I don't believe she did drugs while away for the week. I was confident she would stay sober. I know she would be experiencing witdrawal symptoms the first week, but she was really horrible to me the night she came home and I couldn't take it.

I don't know what to say to her. I truly want to make up,but I don't want to go back to getting treated the way I was.

How should I go about fixing this situation?

100,"Hello Reddit,

Here's the situation.  I do some development work in a lab at my school.  I'm working on some game development in Unity, and am new to the platform and I am making some mistakes.  However, I've been working in programming for a few years, so I know my way around a StackOverflow post pretty well.  I am usually able to find solutions on my own.  Except there's a kid that comes into the lab.  He's a grade below me.  Whenever I'm in the lab, he'll hover behind me, watching what I'm working on, and giving me recommendations on how to write my program.  Keep in mind he has just as much, if not less, experience working in the platform that I am using.  Even when he does say something, it's sometimes a compromise to a feature that I'm working on, so I try to refrain from using it as I am currently working on something.

They were discussing his own clothing company and how his ads and social media posts haven’t gotten engagement. He started talking about how he needed more pictures of girls to get engagement. Eventually he said he needed to post “titties”. I looked up and said “excuse me, titties?” (I’m the only girl in the office.) He proceeds to tell me everyone likes titties, asked me if I had a problem with titties or if I could tell him who doesn’t like titties.

I am just ticked off because it was a blatant implication of objectification of women’s bodies and to use them as a marketing scheme. In my opinion, it was just wildly inappropriate and made me incredibly uncomfortable.

Could you guys give me your opinion based on these instances?

- He offers to drive me home and says it's on the way (even tho it adds 10 mins to his commute). Once he used his break time to drive me home

- He lights up when I see him and is really smiley and we have playful banter

- He gets grumpy/silent when I focus my attention on other coworkers (who are male)

- When I teased him to give me a compliment, he said I was beautiful (but I'm not sure if he was joking or being sarcastic)

- He mirrors my body language and I've seen him ""discreetly"" check out my ""assets""

- Something in his demeanour/personality chsnged after the first time he drove me home. He used to be so friendly but now he seems more moody, sometimes shy, and holding back and not telling me his true thoughts

- I overheard from a coworker that he was upset when he thought I left without saying goodbye (this I was shocked by, since I didn't know he cared about me)

- He doesn't wear his glasses when we work together but when I drop by the cafe as a surprise, he wears them

- He said I was one of his fav coworkers (after I told him he was one of my favs)

BUT here are signs that he might not like me:

- He is friends with a really pretty coworker who he's known for 2 years and he has a fun time talking to her and I assume he likes her but she is taken and he was friendzoned

- When he drove me home the first time, he said it's no prob because he's driven home loads of other coworkers before

- His fav celebrity is way prettier than me and I don't think I'm pretty enough for him. Once I saw a pic of a cute girl on his phone and he said it was just a pic his sister sent him (but I don't believe him)

- We sometimes brush our fingers/hands against each other but he never makes a move to try to touch me

- When my shift ends at 5:30 pm and he starts at 6 pm, he doesn't come early to see me (when I've stayed late to help/talk to him after my shift)

- He doesn't try to swap shifts with people to coordinate them with my shifts (when I do this secretly) so I assume he isn't making an effort to see me

- He doesn't ask me out on a date or for my phone number

110,"There's a lot going on with this, but I'll try to be brief. Up until a few days ago I was a highly dysfunctional relationship (see my other posts!) with a mentally ill man, but I finally broke up with him. I still have a lot of empathy for him, in spite of how it has gone down. He had lived at my apartment for 1.5 years, but he took off for another city as soon as we split. He is spiraling out right now, and constantly sends texts that are either abusive, suicidal, and occasionally ultra-sweet. At this moment in time he will not speak to me, except to send a text accusing me of cheating on him. (Which I have not. See? Dysfunctional!)

  
Anyway, he left almost everything he has here, including some really rare and important items, sentimental items, and things he needs for his career. He keeps telling me he doesn't care about it and his life is over. It is difficult for me to have his stuff in my house, (he was a sorta hoarder, and my place is quite small with no storage space), and right now he's in no place mentally or financially to plan anything like moving stuff. (Although I did lend him some money for him to get back on his feet.)

  
I was thinking of putting it in a storage unit until he regained some sanity, because right now he's bordering on delusional. However, in my city that will be around $150 a month. Also there is a ton of heavy stuff that I'm not keen on loading and unloading. As it is, his boxes take up a quarter half of my studio. So I feel like my choices are to keep it at my place (for how long??), or put it in storage at great cost to myself.

Literally as I'm typing this I am eating 3 slices of pizza and 2 burgers plus finishing off the 24 pack off coca cola i bought.

112,"Every time I start to feel happy or comfortable with someone in a relationship or a friendship, I get irrationally scared. I know being afraid of vulnerability is normal but it’s like once I feel that fear of opening up I’ll do anything to shake it. 99% of time that means burning the bridge and never looking back, and I always regret it deeply later on. At this point in my life, I feel like it’s inhibiting my happiness. I’ve fucked up so many good things",12Oct2018,1
113,"Long story short, I've been playing my boyfriend's favorite series when I'm at his place. It's not my style of game but I play it so we can share this thing he loves. Today, we got to a cutscenes where the main character is grabbed in the crotch because he was mistaken for a woman.

I've been sexually assaulted before just like that, not exactly in that way, but by a guy groping me multiple times like that. So seeing that scene just made me deeply uncomfortable (and it didn't even further the story line), and I know he can sense something is up. I haven't really told him the full story of how I was assaulted, just that I have been. And it's not a fun subject for me.

So yeah, any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",12Oct2018,1
114,"I am having a mental debate regarding my job. I am 24 y/o, have a great salary but I am unhappy.

I'll describe the scenario.
I am currently working as a cost estimator in a small construction company, they gave me a good salary from the start (compared to my other friends) but they have been overloading me with miscellaneous stuff at the office which I was not hired for. At first I was happy to help, I felt very grateful about the opportunity there, but slowly they began asking for more stuff like creating websites, becoming a marketing strategist, asking me to fix any software or hardware issues (computer only), organize meetings, design logos, designing ads, calling clients, post ads (they ask me this while I am working as a cost estimator and not as a favor). Also I have 3 bosses (they are Co-CEO and they all have assistants) who tell me to do stuff without informing their partners and they end up giving me totally opposite orders.

I was stressing about this and I was piling up anger and starting to get depressed to the point I fainted and even had emotional breakdown, I was starting to get unstable and spending a lot of money on drugs to cope with all that which in the end made it worse. I didn't quit before because it was good salary and had been saving money but it all went away after all that. I had to go to therapy immediately because I felt I wasted all my money, had to start over and suicidal thoughts coursed through my mind.

I realized I coulnt keep up with that and decided to quit and give a 2 week notice to my direct supervisor, one of my many bosses' assistant (which means I am informing them with anticipation about my leave). My supervisor asked me why did I want to quit and I told him exactly what I just described. Then he talked to me, convinced me to stay in exchange for a raise because he said without me the company would crumble since he said I was essential to the team and bla bla bla. (He also didn't want my bosses to know that I wanted to quit)

I was happy for a week, then everyone (my bosses and assistants) started to ask for even more miscellaneous stuff and I am in the same spot only making a few bucks extra which I feel is not worth it. But I have no money saved in my account and I am scared I am going back to my instability 

What should I do? What are your opinions? What other options can you see on the scenario? Your answers would be very appreciated.",12Oct2018,1

I've known I've had a crush on her for at least a month, but at this point I think it's more than that. My feelings for her absolutely dwarf anything I've felt before. 

She's incredibly affectionate (constantly hugging, kissing my forehead, and cuddling me) and I don't want this to stop. I love being close with her and I don't want to distance myself from her. She's one of the best friend's I've ever had. It does feed into the false hope that I have that she may feel some of what I feel. This is despite the fact that she now has a girlfriend. A girlfriend that she is absolutely infatuated with. Who I must hear about all the time.

I haven't been in a relationship for almost two years now but over this last 6 months or so I've gotten very close with this girl. We both have strong feelings for each other and would like to date each other, the only problem is that we are both College Students in rigorous majors at different schools (about a 13 hour drive). We decided it would be better to do hold off dating for now and see if we would be able to keep up the current relationship while at school first.

She goes on camping trips once or twice a month with friends for about a day or two just for fun. The only thing about it that I'm having trouble with is that the group she goes with is usually no bigger than 3 or 4 people and it almost always includes the same guy. My problem isn't that hes going with them, honestly I'd rather him be there just for safety, but whenever she goes on these trips I find myself getting really jealous that he gets to spend all of that time with her. 

I'm not really worried that she's going to sleep with him or fall for him while I'm not there (maybe a little bit that one), I just hate that I don't get to be the one taking a road trip with her, getting to go camping with her, or stare at the stars and talk for a while. I just wish I was the one getting to do that with her and getting to know her that deeply rather than this guy.

We reconnected a few days ago and no hard feelings were present during our conversation. She came and told me about how she was depressed and I was there to talk to her about it. We talked for 2 days until I stopped for a short period. 

I take it seriously as from a young age I saw my own mother take her life because of depression. I was too little to grasp the mental and emotional stress that she was in. I still have mental breakdowns and emotional moments whenever I think of the event. 

THAT IS WHY i need to help her if I can. Because now I realize what depression can do to a person. I care about her very much and I know if something happens to her and I could've done something but didn't, it would haunt me forever. 

During the time we reconnected we openly talked about our relationship and how it could've gone better.  She said she thought about me and wanted to reconnect too. We had hour long conversations for about 2 days until I became busy.

I have no idea but I think she is mad at me because she responded relativity fast to me.

132,"So I'll try to keep this concise while giving all the details to ensure accurate responses. 

I matched with someone I know on a dating app last week. Actually, him and I used to go on double dates with our ex's (him and my ex are friends). We briefly caught up as we haven't seen each other in probably 7 years. He then asked if I was into grabbing drinks on Tuesday night and I said yes.

We meet at a bar in walking distance of my house. We're chatting and the convo is going great, I knew it wouldn't be awkward by any means. We talked about a ton of stuff including what happened to our significant others that we are both no longer with (and haven't been in years). It wasn't weird, and it wouldn't be an issue as those people are both so far in our past.

There was a hockey game on and the screen was behind him so he eventually came and sat beside me and had his hand on my leg under the table, the flirting was escalating. I hadn't eaten that day due to the nerves and everytime the waitress came over we both obliged to more rounds. He had work the next day so I assumed he would call it if he needed to go/wasn't feeling it. 

This is where it gets a little blurry, but stay with me. I don't remember paying the bill (after checking the next morning can confirm we likely split it as cash was missing and we had both drank a lot so I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving him with the entire bill) or leaving the bar. By this point we had been there for 5 hours drinking. I remember him walking me home (again, something he didn't have to do if he wasn't into it, I could have taken an Uber). I remember bits and pieces but we were holding hands, making out and he was twirling me around the streets. It was a lot of fun.

I don't think anything would have happened on our walk home to deter him from contacting me further but again, blurred memory. As far as I remember it, it was all good and I even have texts messages on my phone of texts I sent to friends gushing about how amazing the date was, and how cute our walk home was. Even if I didn't remember the next day I'm sure that night I would have mentioned to the girls chat if anything had happened.

Regardless, I text him when I get into bed saying ""I had a really good time, hopefully we can do it again soon"". He's on iMessage but it sent as a text so I assumed his phone died or he lost service for a hot minute. Who knows. 

He never replied! Now I'm driving myself absolutely nuts wondering if a) I did something wrong or b) he didn't get the text. I don't want to reach out again and seem like I'm being desperate if he ignored me. But I also don't want him to have not gotten it and thinks I'm just ghosting. 

What would you do? My friend essentially said I have three options
a) wait it out, see if he texts me this weekend
b) contact him saying I didn't intend to get that drunk and am sorry
c) assume he never got my text and just check in with him this weekend/next week

Sorry for the longevity of the post, I just want to make it clear that it was a) a fun time, b) reciprocated flirting and c) that he had outs if he wasn't into it at the time. I feel like if he wasn't into it, it would have been easy to say he wasn't comfortable seeing me as he's still friends with my ex. There's so many easy ways out and he didn't take them so I'm pretty confused. He's just super cool and I wouldn't mind seeing him again. ",12Oct2018,1

I am fuming right now because I just found out that my dad is $2550 (3 months) behind on rent. He swears he has ""talked"" to our landlord, but she has every right to evict him and I am counting it as a very real option. There are a few things influencing our current situation.

1. I (20 year old) am a full time student (junior) at a university in AZ. My is an lower level employee in HR at my university in AZ, and because of this I depend on him for qualified tuition reduction (QTR). If I make more than 4k a year I lose QTR and will have to take out 13k in loans per school year to make up for it. Also me getting a job is really not an option logistically. I can't drive, and my bf (who lives with us to help with rent) is using my car to get to his internship this semester
2. My bf lives with us to help with rent. He has been paying his share and we just found out that it has not  in fact been going to rent, but instead to fuck knows what. My bf is also a student at my university and he is in his last semester.
3. I have a dog who is really important for my emotional wellbeing (my therapist has said she will write a letter to certify him as an emotional support animal if necessary). We adopted a large dog (pitbull) last semester and I am worried about what will happen to him when my dad gets evicted. I have a family friend who could probably take him for a month or two, but then what???
4. My dad is actually a hoarder. I keep asking him to move, but he doesn't want to downsize and clean up his shit and I guess it's too late for that anyway
5. His car just broke down so he is getting dropped off at work by my bf.
6. I just tore 3 out of 4 ligaments in my knee and I can't really walk and I am just frustrated and scared right now.

I recently started a new job and almost immediately my coworker started to take an interest in me. He's aggressively flirtatious and I'm an anxious and awkward person in new environments so I haven't yet navigated my full personality into these interactions.

I think I low-key enabled it by answering his questions transparently and throwing them back to him so it wasn't so one sided because it hadn't registered that it was anything but questions.

138,"When I get stressed out or overly emotional about something, I get prone to bouts of binge eating. I eat so much junk I feel sick and I just feel regretful afterwards.

I tried not buying any junk food, and that worked pretty well for the most part while my room mates were travelling, but when they're home they always buy junk food and keep it in the fridge and they don't care if I eat it.

It makes it hard because when it's right there and available often I'll have eaten a fair amount of junk food before I can even stop myself. I've had thoughts of making myself vomit it up, but I know that is not the way to go and I'm firm in stopping myself from going that far.

Anyway I'm writing this because it happened again last night. I ate 4 ice cream cones, a packet of lollies and 2 large chocolate muffins. I hate that I did that.

I don't hate myself or the way I look, but I just feel so powerless sometimes against these impulses that want me to take on all that extra trash food for some fleeting good feelings. It's partly what I don't get about it. Why do I do this? I never used to and I just feel like I can't get help for it. I tried talking to my family but I really don't think they take it seriously enough because I'm in good shape still so they haven't offered much support. There aren't any support groups I could find for binge eating in my area. I don't have friends that I could open up about this sort of stuff just because we don't have that kind of friendship. I've tried talking to my room mates about it but they took it as me trying to say their lifestyle is unhealthy and said it's none of my business.

139,"Sorry for the grab-y title. My grandfather is absolutely dying soon, and I’ve known he was in rough shape for a while.

I informed my boss when I got the news a month ago. I explained the nature of our relationship (that’s he’s across the country, where my parents live with him, and that I grew up very very close to my grandpa). He was very sympathetic and understanding. He’s kind of new in his role and he’s really not great at his job, but he was cool and understanding. I took a trip home to visit him where he was able to muster out one final “I love you” 

Since then, my grandpa has been stable but in end-of-life care. The doctors said it would only be a few days max, but it’s been well over a month and I’ve kind of been neutral and ok about it all. But today, before work, my mom and dad called me saying they were driving up the &gt;1 hour drive because the doctors said it was going downhill fast. They said they didn’t think they’d make it. I was really distraught and didn’t feel comfortable going to work until I new more. 

So I called my boss and simply said I got news from my family about my grandfather and didn’t think I could come in today. Which is true, I was really upset and worried and I’m 22 and perhaps a bit emotionally immature. I knew my job would be covered for today in particular, as another person would be present to help fill my role. I’m typically very necessary to the flow of my job. 

He asked if my grandfather had passed, and I said “yes.” And used a day of my 3 days of bereavement. And now I’ve had awful guilt the whole day because I’m worried about the ramifications of this. And I’m disappointed in my dishonesty. Because I will have to use the other bereavement days to fly back to my home state where he is for a service. And what if that’s in a month? Or two? 

I guess any advice is helpful. Whether it’s sympathy, pragmatic solutions, scolding. I’m not sure what will help, but I want to move forward the best direction possible. 

I know my grandpa will not recover, and I know they are now saying with greater confidence he will pass soon. But I’m just mostly upset about what this will mean for my father (his son- they are very close and so are my father and I). And I’m ashamed of how i handled the situation. ",12Oct2018,1

He believes that women only want men for their money, and that the reason he doesn’t have a girlfriend is that he’s “short” (5’’8) when in actuality it’s because he overshares all the details of his life with them on the first date, including talking about exes who have gotten restraining orders against him.

148,"Hello, I'm extremely stressed out and feeling depressed even which is rare for me. I am looking for answers or anything. I'm overwhelmed 

Basically, this summer has been very turbulent. My cousin died, I lost health insurance, mom lost her job, and to top it off I got so ill in July it made me bedridden. I was in the hospital for over a month. I'm still recovering and haven't been to work since. I'm not even getting paid time off or anything. Also can't get temporary state disability since I work for a private company. Overall I'm suffering due to lack of money, energy, support, and my family is the absolute worst for any kind of support. It's like they don't care about mental health and I'm arguing constantly with my parents. I also have to leave my apartment this weekend due to no money for upcoming rent.

I'm kinda lost right now. Not exactly sure what to do. Just before all of this I was working out often, traveling, working an ok job, studying, and pursuing a modeling career. Now I'm not even sure if I should. I was offered to stay at my uncle's house for a little bit. The only thing is my car is broken down, no money, and I don't want to impose...should I just take him up on his offer?

Also, it just sucks because usually, I'm really ambitious and happy. But, now I'm lost, broken down, and ready to quit. This summer I seen my mother lose it all and that doesn't help either seeing her suffer. Knowing I can't do anything right now to help her. I feel powerless. ",12Oct2018,1

151,"I'd been in the most amazing long term, drama free relationship when I met this man nearly 15 years older then me. I met him through work and he very quickly became obsessive. At first I thought he was my friend until he took my phone while I was working and texted my fiance on my behalf to tell him that I was having an affair and to fuck off. He then blocked my fiance's number, stole numerous intimate and non intimate photos from my phone and wrote down some of my passwords to things. I didn't know any of this yet. When I got home I couldn't get in touch with my fiance and when I finally did we discovered what happened. it was awful but we quickly recovered. I didn't know this guy had taken my photos or passwords yet. 

I dropped the man as a work client and stopped seeing him entirely. one day there was a note left on my desk saying ""I'm gonna make you mine yet."". I reported it to my boss who did nothing. A month after the initial messages I was on my way to visit my fiance who lived quite far away. so I'm on the plane and my fiance gets a call from this guy, lets call him Ahmed. Ahmed tells him we're having this intense affair and gives him all kinds of details and sends him the intimate photos of me. 

My fiance, John came to pick me up at the airport and this were insane. I was able to prove that many things were bullshit. But some of the things Ahmed had learned from reading private conversations with both John as well as my friends dating back years and years.

John told me that we could focus on working things out if I quit that job and moved to where he was. I agreed and when I returned home I quit my job and began to plan the move but John let Ahmed get to him and told me he wants space. During that time Ahmed severely assaulted me and showed up at my home 4 times, he was arrested twice and I took him to court to get a restraining order.  He called John and told him that we're having a relationship again and he hangs out with my family all the time. After getting my restraining order I just said fuckit and packed a bag to be with John, we lived together for 3.5 months and Ahmed still tried to make contact with me during that time.  I was able to prove numerous things Ahmed said were lies, like that he hangs out with my family and whatnot. John and I had an amazing time living together and I fell more in love with him every day, he expressed he felt the same. I never told him about the court or restraining order, and I only briefly told him about the assault.  I had to return home after the few months and shortly after John and I broke up, it's been nearly 2 months since we broke up and we speak every day still. sometimes it's long loving conversations and other times it's just checking in. He was expressing that he misses me, he would tell me he still loved me and that he regretted not marrying me a year ago until I asked him not to shove my face in these things exactly a month ago.  He told me that he still does feel these things but he's upset about what happened. (he still believes I had an affair)

Since we broke up I've gone on an insane goosechase collecting every document, 911 transcript, hospital report, police report, court transcript and lawyer letter to prove that this affair didn't happen. In the court transcript when Ahmed was charged with assault and harassment he admits having not slept with me. I've now got nearly 60 pages of official reports and even photographs of Ahmed being arrested outside my home.

I want to show John these to prove that what I told him was the truth but I don't know how. We live far away now and I've thought about mailing them but don't know how to not be weird about it, he seems to shut down whenever this guys name is brought up. Perhaps having my father mail them (we're close but he loved john too) and tell him he thinks he needs to see these? I thought about just waiting until its brought up again and just saying ""you know I can prove once and for all that it didn't happen, right?"" but every day that goes by feels like 10 years. I don't blame john for believing Ahmed's lies because he was extremely convincing but I desperately want my life back.

Does anybody have any ideas of creative ways to get these documents in his hands? Any ideas help! Thank you so much! xoxo",12Oct2018,1
152,"ok so.... I'm 17 and I'm in my second-last year of secondary school.  I go to a boys school and tbh it's a pretty shit place.  It's not so bad for me, I'm just a guy, but for the smart kids and the asians and the gays its pretty bad.  it's worst for the gay guys.  There's only half dozen gay guys in the school (we have about 400 sudentsI think) and they get beat on pretty bad.  one of them has a lot of sport friends and stuff so he's pretty popular so people leave him alone but the other two have it pretty rough.  


i'm not proud of it, but i join in sometimes on giving them a hard time.  it's almost like... I dunno, almost a bonding experience with the other guys at school.  if you're giving the gay kids or the nerds shit then it means you're not part of their group, which puts you above them, you know?  so if everyone knocks their books out of their hands together, or graffitis their locker, or hides their clothes during phys ed, then it means everyone who isn't them is part of one big group that's better, and they're part of a small group that we can all sort of be above.

&amp;#x200B;

i never really thought about what it must be like for them because I figured it wasn't that they weren't dealing with a whole lot.  like okay, shoulder checks in the hallway and putting gum on their chairs, it wasn't that big a deal.  but something happened a couple of weeks back that sort of... I don't know, I guess made something click in my head?  so what happened was one of the gay guys has been sort of fighting back.  like someone stole one of his textbooks, so he put gum in the guy's locker mechanism thingy to jam it up, and he's started shoving people back when they shove him in the corridor.  so a few of my friends decided to escalate it and they were gonna tie him to the chain link fence around our school's tennis court with his pants down.  we didn't think it was a big deal, just basic like... jock stuff.  people get worse done to them on their bachelor parties.  but when we were tying his arms, he looked really scared, like actually frightened.  you always read about people going white, like in books and stuff?  i Always thought it was just a figure of speech but he acutally went white when he realised what we were doing.  and he went real quiet.  like when we were pulling him out there he was kicking us and spitting but he just went completely quiet and he looked so scared.  and that sort of sank into my head a bit, and i realised that we were hurting him.  when you frighten someone that badly, it's not just teasing them, I think it's hurting them.  and I can't stop thinking about it.  I feel really bad about what I've been doing and my friends too, but i don't KNow how to fix it.  like I tried to talk to the guy and apologise but he wouldn't even look at me and kept walking pass, so I've been thinking of messaging him on Facebook to say sorry.

I have a phobia of rejection so I have never got around to asking her any questions where the answer could be no (at least questions where I hope for a yes answer). Like phone number, date, stuff like that

I was talking to some friends today after my phobia became real recognizable (self). I had the perfect opportunity to ask her is she would like to get some coffee and didn’t (cause of phobia). Based the schedule for next week, it seems the new hire will work Thursday’s and my crushes will be Sunday (one of the days my whole department has off). 

My friends suggested I go in on a Sunday (intentionally leave something at work and remember on Sunday). It doesn’t seem like a terrible idea but compared to having our 4-5 hour shifts together, where I can try to control my phobia it’s a downgrade. 

My other plan is to hope that we get scheduled for the same shift, but doesn’t seem likely since the only times our schedule could conflict are Thursday and Saturday.

156,"I've always like to watch people playing games on Twitch/YouTube, and I know that is a difficult thing to do, to gain popularity, to entertain... etc

I'm going to be 20 this October, currently studying in university. There are only 3 years left for me to be a student, after that, I'll have to get a job.

I've been thinking about doing Twitch/YouTube from now, and see what happens. But it just seems so hard to actually get started, maybe I'm just too afraid to. So I hope I can get some advice on whether I should do this or how to do this.


Here are the two main concerns:

1. I'm not anywhere ready to put my face on the Internet. But if I do it without facecam, it's way harder to entertain and interact with audiences. I think the few people that got famous without facecam are only because they are pretty good at the specific game they are playing, so their audiences don't really care about the entertain/interact.

2. What if I failed and ended up embarrassing myself on the Internet for months? It's impossible to secretly do this... if I do well then it's fine but if I fail, all of the people I know will be thinking me as ""that guy trying to be popular on the Internet but failed"".


Weirdly, I don't really concern too much about the content, I have so many ideas. Maybe I'm stupid to think so but those two above are the big worries I have. It's really hard to put yourself on the Internet, you are no longer a username or an ID when you decide to do this, right?

157,"I'm 20(m) and I pay £45 a week on rent to live here. I totally understand that it is not nearly as much as I would be paying living somewhere else, but at the same time the job I was at gave me around 15 hours a week at minimum wage and I could barely afford it and she knew that. My GF never liked how much I paid and we would always talk about how ridiculous it was purely because my mother said when she upped the rent from 20 to 45 a week she said "" If I didn't have to take the money I wouldn't"" and yet she has a gym membership and she doesn't even go anymore. She bought so much useless Halloween decorations that are again a waste of money. I'm good with money so it always felt like a waste giving her rent because of the stuff she buys.

Now my sister has just found a place and is moving out, and my mother told me that my rent is now going to 80 a month. My GF and I were really pissed at this because I literally am 2 weeks into a new job that's full time hours and pays more (literally double what I was getting) but now she's taking double I'm right back in the same place . My GF was getting really upset saying I need to stand up for myself and say no I won't pay but I can't exactly say no to my mother? 

My mother and I had a long chat last night and she seemed very hurt at the fact that i felt very ungrateful and seemed like i didn't want to help her. I didn't mean to come across that way but I couldn't help feel it with what she pays for and buys, we could save so much money and like she said ""dont want to take it but I have to"" really feels like she doesn't have to. So after a 2 hour chat I tried to negotiate the price but gave up because I struggle to argue with her about it as she makes me feel awful for the way I was acting. I told my GF this and she really isn't happy and when I said about my mother crying she said ""so anyone can cry"" and it really hurt me.

I just feel very stuck at the moment because I can't exactly not pay my mother but I don't want to be paying more than I need to be and it feels like I will be. Then my GF gets really upset because she feels like I'm being taken advantage of but considering my father is a failure and she raised me pretty well I feel I should be willing to help and feeling selfless towards family but I just don't.

Please anyone any advice about the situation I would really really appreciate as it's starting to affect my sleep as I woke up at 4:30 This morning and I've been working such long hours now I'm so tired.

159,"Ok so my anxiety has always been bad but I used to have control over it, for the most part. The last four/five years have been so hectic and just all over the place. Before I met my fiancé I was in a very abusive relationship where I wasn’t allowed to have social media, I couldn’t use my phone unless he was at work, I couldn’t stay over night with friends, and barely even got to see them at all, I wasn’t allowed to leave his house without him... just completely physically and mentally abusive that I never thought I’d make it out of... and I think that relationship really had a toll on my mental health.

Since I was with him I found someone else who treats me well, we have two kids together and my love life of pretty great. In my eyes is it. But I don’t leave. I’m a stay at home mom and that’s what I want... but being home for the last three years with my kids and ya know the year and a half almost two years I was with the abuser I have became a agoraphobic... I can’t leave my house alone. I’m so scared when I’m somewhere there are a lot of people, I can’t go to bars or malls, unless it’s a week day and they aren’t busy. 

But anyway I have just put this all off as normal, or even if not normal that there’s nothing to fix it. I cope. I do the best I can to try to work around it all or make it better. 

This last weekend my fiancé and I went to a good friend of ours wedding. I was so excited, we were going to stay in a hotel over night since it’s a couple hours from home and it was our first night ALONE since having our one year old. He have not had any alone time in a year and that’s really been hurting our relationship lately. 

Anyway, I had to drive to the wedding on Saturday since my fiancé had to be there the day before for the rehearsal since he was the best man. I get there and am anxious but a normal anxious I would say, I sit with my grooms mother as she’s very close to us, everything’s fine during the ceremony. Then after that they did more group pictures and such and I couldn’t find anywhere to sit in the reception while hey did that so I started to get hot and panicky. My breast were swollen because I needed to use my breast pump so I used that as my excuse to go to the truck. So i sat in the truck trying to calm myself down. 45 minutes later my SO finally comes out and says he’s been looking for me. I tried going back in with him but I panicked and ran out again. I tried going back in FIVE more times and it just made it worst. I sat in the truck crying and screaming and kicking my feet completely panicking, it made me hate myself. It made me wish I wasn’t on this earth. I hate this part of me. I hate it more than anything. 

Idk what I can do about this. I’m on medicine, it’s been switched around four times since having our younger son and it just seems like it won’t go away. I want to be able to do things, I want to be able to get married... I just want to feel somewhat normal. 

Everyone thinks I just blow them off and shit all the time but I just can’t do the stuff they like to do. Idk what will help it or if anything will... I just don’t want to feel like this anymore.... if anyone has any advice or even just some kind words that would be great. I just really don’t know what to do anymore.",12Oct2018,1

My mom started pressuring me into studying even though I wasn't mentally ready to start something so big. Usually people go travelling for about 6 months after the army to loosen up and get some headspace. Instead of chilling for a while I started intensely studying for our version of the SATs, then for half a year I re-did high school math because I messed it up in high school. Then some more studying to get a better score in the SAT. All of this took me about a year and a half, and all of this without even knowing what the fuck do I want to major in. I wasn't even sure that I wanted to major in something.

it can be everything from ordering me to do things for her to trying to manipulate me into staying home from school. it’s particularly tricky because sometimes she actively tries to make me feel like I’m in total control, and I think she does this because it satisies her to decide whether I have control or not.

However, because I had involved myself in heated internet debates, my at-then ""opponents"" had tagged my name with their criticism toward me, which leaves a permanent record. Due to those tags, people would be able to find out I was in those groups, debating and arguing on controversial and sensitive issues.

1. I’m younger than her 
2. I’m not the best looking ( 5’9 , chubby) 
3. Don’t have a job (just quit CVS to focus on my art)

173,"I know ‘wise’ people say stuff like “happiness comes from not caring about what others think” or something along those lines, but I find it really damn hard to do that.
Maybe I just have a shallow perception of myself but I find the days where I feel/am told I’m attractive, I just feel so much happier. I enjoy being in public and notice people staring. It just feels like I’m living life properly and it makes me feel so much more energetic willing to go out and enjoy the world.

On the other hand, if I don’t like the way I look, it’ll ruin the day for me. I won’t be able to focus and I’ll avoid being social at all costs.

I really wish I didn’t care about my appearance, and in a lot of ways I really don’t. How do I get rid of this shitty mind set and start placing more value on the things that really matter?

My husband and I had had lived with another couple for a year. We decided we all can't live together, so once the lease was up we moved.  We moved out the 26th of August, and the 31st was our last day allowed there.  

I notified the landlord a month beforehand via email, as they don't have any other means of contact. I told them that JUST the two of us were going to the new address, and that we had been the only two to pay the deposit.  

Fast forward to now, October 12th. It's been almost a month and a half, and no correspondence whatsoever. I texted the landlord (they primarily used text) and asked them, and they just asked if we sent a forwarding address... Um, yeah...  A few days later I asked about the deposit again, we tried calling, and no response.  

I looked online, and they have 30 days, some sites said up to 60, and after that they may have to give back DOUBLE. I don't know what to do.

177,"Really nervous about posting this but I really feel like I need an outside opinion. I am a 22F. Last summer, my long-term boyfriend and I broke up (we had been together for 2 years). He was the only person I’d ever had sex with. After we broke up, I went a little wild (drinking and partying more than I should’ve). Anyways, I met this guy who I was super into. He was very kind, sweet, and charming. Sadly, he wasn’t from around here. He went back home, and we continued to talk for a few weeks before I decided to go visit. I stayed for 3 nights. We did not have sex any of those nights (even the night we went out and got super drunk). Admittedly, we did some other things. Anyways, the morning I was leaving, things were getting pretty heated but I knew I didn’t want to go all the way. I kept saying no, several times, and kind of “wiggled” my way out of that position until at one point he stuck his penis inside me (even though I said no). He wasn’t physically holding me down and forcing it in, but I truly did not want it. I froze. I was so scared. It lasted maybe 15 seconds max before I got up and put my clothes on. 

Yes, we were naked in bed. Yes, we were getting hot and doing oral. But I verbally said “no” and “stop” over and over. Unfortunately I guess I “gave in.” Had I really wanted it it, I had 3 whole nights to get it as much as I want. I wouldn’t have waited until the morning I was leaving. 

I feel very scared to share this because in today’s culture I don’t want to be told I am crying wolf, or “You just regret it so you’re calling it rape” or “you weren’t even drunk, you were sober” or “you asked for it by getting in bed naked and doing other things” but I also don’t feel like I yelled or screamed for him to stop, so i feel like it’s my fault.

179,"This feels like far too much to write. I don't even know where to begin. 

I met my current wife ten years ago. She was 18 and I was 26. She was a hot punk emo girl. Thinking back to that night that I first met her is quite surreal. Ten years ago was such a weird point in my life. I had barely been living in the USA for a year. I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, but I lived from the ages 22-25 in Europe. The end of another relationship forced me off the continent and back home to the PNW. Very sorry after moving back, I met her because I answered her Craigslist ad. We met and had a nice night. Met again as friends many times over the next several months. Two months after she turned 19, we were dating. 

At one point, about two years into the relationship, I broke up with her. This lasted a day before I let her back in after she begged me. 

Shortly after that point, she's pregnant. There's a miscarriage fairly early. But we are both pretty shook up and maybe a bit relieved. Things generally do not feel great after this point. 

I'm unhappy. I decide to end it. I don't know when I will. We live together renting an expensive place that I can't pay for alone. I delay. She becomes pregnant again. 

She essentially admits to me that she deliberately skipped a birth control pill. She says I can make a decision on if she's going to have an abortion. Never have I felt more regret than saying I wanted her to have an abortion. 

Shortly after I said that (literally later that day) I was struck with how unfair it was to tell a woman what she should do with her own body. I for a moment became a republican (though reversed on their abortion stance). I told her that I couldn't make that decision.  I told her that I refused to make the decision of what to do with her body but that o would support wholeheartedly any decision she makes. 

She has the baby. I now have a five year old daughter who means more to me than life itself. I adore my daughter and believe that no one can spend a minute with her and not fall in love. She's magnificent. 

But I knew this was never going to be my happiness with the woman who is the mother of my child. We had a lot of fun, and even though we'd been together for three years by the time our daughter was born, we didn't really know each other. 

I don't want to go into details over the things she's done, or the things that I've done. I've done a lot in this relationship that has hurt her and that has been unfair of me. I absolutely own that. But I am not happy with her. 

But I do care about her. For the sake of our daughter and the sake of the undeniable bond I do have with my wife, I want her to be happy and healthy. But I don't want to be in a romantic relationship with her. 

But two years ago, life threw us another curve ball as her mother became diagnosed with cervical cancer. Unfortunately my mother in law decided to refuse conventional cancer treatment and do a holistic exclusive approach to cancer treatment. 

But during Xmas 2017, we finally saw that this has been a failure. Now MIL has stage IIIb cancer. In January of 2018, my wife and daughter start spending more time out of town to be with my MIL. This seems fine to me. 
By March, this has become their home. Occasionally I can see my daughter on weekends, but for the most part, the two of them are away from me almost full time so my wife can be the caregiver to my MIL. 

So since then, I've been living on my own. I have to stay here for work and I've been going to school. I realize that I am immensely happier when I'm by myself. The most pain I have is being separated from my daughter. 

Fast forward to September, and my wife and daughter have moved back with me because our daughter has to go to kindergarten. School starts and things seem okay. I'm used to the role of being the person who works and makes the entire income for the three of us. But I notice that my wife can't even seem to get my daughter ready for school or pick her up because I'm at work and that's her job we've agreed. 

And tonight, things start to make sense. For the past week, my wife has seemed sick. Vomit, fever, etc. She's been nodding off. Tonight she tells me that she's been taking oxycodone and oxymorphone that has been prescribed for her mother's pain. She just ran out today. 

So I feel trapped. I want out of my relationship and I want to focus my attention on raising my daughter, completing school, and building a better life. 

But I don't want to just dump my wife on the street. She hasn't had a job in six years. My daughter loves her mommy, but I feel so much anger towards my wife right now. How did I not see this? How did I allow my daughter to potentially be in harm's way? I thought that toughing out this relationship wouldn't be harmful to my daughter, but only to my own self. 

I've let a whole lot of people down. I'm not sure how to recover from this, but I have to do something. My daughter deserves much better, and frankly, so do I. And so does my wife. Ideally, there's a way out of this that has us all happier on the other side where we can be coparents but not romantic partners. 

Thanks for listening. Any help or advice is much appreciated. ",12Oct2018,1

184,"Sorry in advance, but I've had so much emotion pent up and I just want to get it all off my chest.

Im a 19 year old university student who recently got dumped by a girl that I had fallen for hard, and since then my life has just been deteriorating.

When I first met her, I was feeling confident, motivated and comfortable being single. I didn't initially have any intention of pursuing her, but she admitted she had feelings for me and the first time we met up we ended up kissing, and then the next day we had sex. However, she made a point to say that she wasn't ready to date me because she had just come out of a relationship, and she also was scared of how her parents would react if she admitted she was seeing someone. 

&amp;#x200B;

So for the couple months that we dated, we sneaked around to see eachother and we made plans about our lives for after she told her parents. And for most of that time, I was okay with that. However, more and more it felt like I was not as important to her and I was just her dirty secret. Even then I persisted thinking that it would get better eventually. When she went on exams and I tried to support her, she kept pushing me away further and further becoming cold and distant. One night when she admitted that she was doing it on purpose, I asked why and she broke down in tears telling me how stressed and scared she was about everything in her life. I was really hurt at the time but I thought I understood why she was doing it so I comforted her and asked her not to cut me out of her life like that. She agreed that she wouldn't. But she kept doing it and she kept being cold and distant. Then one night when I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal I got upset at her and confronted her asking what I was to her and why she was being so cold and distant towards me. She blew up at me, and refused to talk to me all week. I was panicking and I tried to reach out to her and talk to her because I was living away at the time and had no way to talk to her apart from text. Finally at the end of the week, she texted me saying she couldn't be my girlfriend and then left. Since then she has blocked me on everything possible, deleted every memory of us together and made it clear that I am dead to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the breakup, I have been cycling between depression, thoughts of suicide and a constant feeling of loneliness and isolation. My self image and confidence have just been shattered and my motivation to go to the gym or even be social or attend uni have just disappeared. Everywhere i go, I am just reminded of her and it takes everything I have not to break down in tears. I have been constantly avoiding eating, I have bouts of insomnia and I just can't concentrate. It feels like my social life is in tatters, I am scared to even go out and try to meet new people, most days I will just sit in my room and try not to cry because thinking about the hole she left in my heart is enough to send me into thoughts of suicide and ending it all.

  
I never wanted any of this, I tried my best to be careful with her, but she broke down the walls I had built up from the numerous times I've been hurt and in the past and hurt me anyway. It feels like everything I had built up before I started dating her has just been torn down. I am scared to talk to new people, scared to leave my room, scared to look at my own face in the mirror because all I can see is just scars and ugliness. Even the antidepressants I am on and the counselling I am doing is not helping at all. I just want to die because I can't see myself loving anyone ever again or trusting anyone. I am sick of this cycle of getting attached to people only to be hurt over and over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was the first person I ever had a sexual relationship with, and only the 3rd person that I fell in love with. I am struggling to move on and its scaring me because even my friends have noticed a significant change in my personality and even my body.

187,"I’m going to make this as short as possible. 

Over the span of the summer, this “friend” who is part of our “summer gang”, has been acting like a child - even though he’s 40 and has two kids. 

We all live in this small village, and most of us have known eachother for decades (age range is 18-30). 

This summer he’s been really disagreeable, in particular during August, and these are things to note:

1) One of the girls of the groups, who works at the pool has allowed him to use his car for shopping, etc... However, one day she said she didn’t want him to drive it because he’s an irrational driver and she would rather her brother drive it. He was livid and shouted “You only let me drive it when it suits you” (wtf). He then went off in a huff and he stopped speaking to her. 

2) My best friend, incidentally the aforementioned girl’s brother, had a really hard time this summer. He had fallen for a girl who worked at the same pool in July. The feelings weren’t reciprocated. This “friend” in question, starts flirting with her right in front of my best friend - clearly on purpose, and makes out with her. 

I guess you could say this isn’t a huge deal, but you’d have to have been here to see how much of a dick he was. 

3) I own the bar in the village. It’s 50m away from the pool. Every once in a while someone from our group would come over to tell me what was going on. This “friend” had his eyes on a fridge that was broken and I wasn’t going to use. He asked me about it and if I could give it. I told him I would think about it. 

Two weeks later, after not speaking to me because I didn’t invite him to my dad’s birthday party, he shows up in a truck looking to get the fridge. I tell him I won’t give it, but he says “Your brother said I could” (it’s my fridge). 


The guy is insufferable. 

Lastly, my GF got in touch yesterday saying she had spoken to him. He’s been to hospital because of a hernia. Apparently he’s “disappointed” no one has asked about him and no one offered to bring him 100km to this other hospital. 

Everyone in the group works full time, and besides towards the end of August he said he didn’t want to see anyone, thought we were all traitors and children. 

This guy has had sexual interactions with a 13-year old (or so I’ve heard) and this summer he got with a 17-year old and tried to push her into choosing him over her family. 


What to make of him?

About two months ago we told him that we were annoyed about the stuff he was doing and that we didn’t want to be friends with someone who we couldn’t trust. He came and apologised to all of us and left us alone for a few days. But now he thinks we’ve all forgiven him,

200,"Hi /r/advice. I'm in a very tough spot right now. I'm from Sweden and grew up in relatively normal conditions, nothing out of the ordinary. I'm almost 18 now and in my last year of high school. However, for some reason, I fell into a state of zero motivation and almost depression where I didn't want to go to school. 2,5 weeks of total absence of school (I reported myself sick) and of course my conservative parents not knowing this. Inevitably, I got an F warning in one of my courses, without specifiying the reason. My mom found out and was very angry at me, threatening all sorts of consequenses like kicking me out of the house and stuff. So I lied my way out of trouble and sort of got myself out of that debacle. Then, today, on this friday, after being back in school for two days and thinking I would sort this mess out by studying properly (not with new found motivation but more like a survival tactic), my mom calls my head teacher and finds out the truth. That I have been absent for a large portion of this semester and reported myself absent. I'm shaking and don't have the courage to face her in this hot mess. It's all my fault for skipping school and lying to her. I don't know what to do. I was thinking of running away but I realize that it's something weak people do.

I have known him since 2012. We met each other through a website for alternative people from my country. We quite instantly connected and even though I was in a very bad period of my life quite soon after meeting, he was one of the only people to stand by me. Since then we have never actually met face to face, but we have talked pretty much every day. He lives on the other side of my country and somehow it just never happened to meet him. It didn't matter, he meant a lot to me.

3 or 4 years ago suddenly his girlfriend started talking to me through whatsapp on his phone. She kind of came out of the blue, but we had a period of being less close so whatever.

He did have a picture of her, and I recognised the picture as someone my other friend (now boyfriend) had ran into on some dating app. So eventually, I believed him. We talked a lot about her and their relationship for the last few years. I also talked quite a lot to her, always through whatsapp. 

About 6 months ago I started getting suspicious. I don't know why, but I suddenly started feeling like she wasn't real. I surpressed it, and kept being friends with him. I wrote it off as a ""well why would he lie about that"". 

I don't know why, but last week I said that I sometimes wonder if she is even real. That she is too perfect, and that it's freaking suspicious that she doesn't have social media. He kind of glossed over it, saying they were in some hard weather and that he had to come clean. Suddenly some crisis popped up, which also sounded suspicious to me, but I let it be. Since then he hadn't talked to me about her once. So last night I brought it up again. This morning he admitted that ""it was real at first, but not anymore and he feared admitting that and he was too deep in"". I have a hard time even believing that anymore. How can I ever believe anything he says anymore? He quite possibly litterally invented another person just to lie to me, manipulate me. He said he gets I feel miffed but was generally very wry about it all. I snapped and kicked him off Facebook, and blocked him on both Whatsapp and Facebook. 

I feel terrible. Sometimes he understands me better than my own boyfriend. But I feel so horribly manipulated. He means a lot to me, but how could anyone ever do this? Did I overreact in blocking him and not talking this over more? I feel horrible throwing away a six year friendship, but this makes me doubt everything he has ever said...",12Oct2018,1
204,Hey guys! Got a dance audition coming up this weekend around noon. I think I got the dance down pretty well. I’m just continuously practicing it over and over. Do you guys think it’s worthwhile to practice before the audition? If so when and how long? I feel like I want to be fresh but at the same time not be rusty from a nights sleep or something. ,12Oct2018,1
205,"Hi, this is going to be pretty long. 

I've had a pretty energetic, immature personality since I was a kid, and this became really apparent during highschool, especially at the start of high school. I didn't want to be a loner like I was during elementary/middle school, I wanted friends and girlfriends, I was determined to have that. I tried being funny, cracking immature jokes, talking to everyone. 

I think depression started to kick in a little more at the end of sophomore year, and by the end of Junior year it was on my mind most of the time, problems with my family and with my friendships. 

I moved to a really small town at start of senior year [Sept 2017], I finally got a chance to change, and change I did, I left a more mature impression on people, I stopped caring about trying to be cool, stopped putting the effort of getting people to like me, I felt calm, I finally felt like me. 

I was still annoying with the only friends I had, I was still pretty immature. I realized how annoying I really was around the last week of December 2017, and by mid January I felt like a new person, I wasn't childish anymore, I think it was mostly my depression which has been in top gear since then, I didn't have the need to try and be funny, just me and my skating. 

I finally felt calm, although really depressed and in auto pilot for a majority of the second semester to the point where some where there are consecutive weeks that are a blur in my mind. I somehow came to the realization that the only person I talked to only talked to me when they were bored, and the worse part was that they were the only person I really talked to, and they lived in my previous town. I felt pretty alone.  

A bit before school ended, I decided to talk to this one girl I had a crush on for a while. We talked for a while, but in the end nothing happened, when we stopped talking she told me I deserved everything for being so kind and generous, but that she didn't feel like dating after a recent break up she had, understandable, and she did admit that for a while it did seem like she led me on... pretty bummed out about that, I was back in auto pilot mode for most of the first half of my summer. 

A week or so before school ended I got introduced to the most important people in my life besides my family, 6 other people, through my close friend who I met during January thanks to skate boarding. I finally had friends, people to do stuff with other than skate. 

There is a girl in that friend group who is a major factor in my writing this, we shall call her E. E and I started getting really close over the summer, we talked day and night, as friends though, I felt like she was basically my best friend, I didn't want to like someone again so soon, dating wasn't on my mind anymore, even though I knew she liked me. Around the beginning of august we told each other that we both liked each other, it felt nice.

We started ""talking"" around the start of September, we were basically dating without the label. As the month went on I could feel that she didn't like me anymore, at least not how she used to. I felt like she only kept me around to make out with someone, but I really like her, I've never been so real with someone about my feelings, I showed her all my love and all my support, I can't explain it.

I finally asked her what she saw between us a couple days ago, she said she didn't feel like it would be a good idea to have something serious. She explained she had a lot going on, which she does, she does so much and I'm so proud of her, but her explanation didn't feel genuine. She called me sweet and caring and genuine, and said that she didn't want it to seem like she led me on because at a point she thought she did want to date. 

All of this comes down to this question I've been thinking about. What's wrong with my personality? How did I manage to make 2 girls who really liked me lose interest in me? Why did i have the need to put a label over us? complaining about getting free kisses? Old me would have loved that! Why do I always feel like I'm being used by my friends, under appreciated, by everyone including my family, who have now told me they think I'm an asshole.

Whats wrong with this personality? Why can't I just feel happy why have I been breaking down in tears every night for the last couple of weeks? Why is everything my fault?

207,"So. I need some advice..
I started developing feelings for my friends neighbor in the beginning of the year. I spent a lot of time getting to know him and then I fell in love with him over the summer as we spent more time together. A month of trying to fight how I felt (because I was scared of the outcome). I finally confessed my feelings for this man, and surprisingly, he had feelings too. We acted upon our feelings that night. My friend got upset,  and me and him got overly stressed with the Drama and we didn't want her to be angry anymore and we decided to just stay friends. It still really hurts even after it's been so long.. I'm not content with it as much as I want to be. I miss him and all the happiness he gave me.. how can I be content with this..? ",12Oct2018,1
208,"I recently had some stuff happen that has affected my relationship with my SO. I’ve always had irregular sleeping patterns but not this bad. In the last 3 days I’ve slept maybe at most 5 hours. A lot of it is definitely anxiety. I’m barely functioning at this point and have to work the next couple days. I began to reach a point where I feel like I’m high or almost hallucinating. 

I have tried melatonin and Benadryl to help me but that didn’t work. I’m prescribed ambien but my anxiety makes me stay awake.  I’ve also smoked some weed because it usually makes me tired but no luck. I should also mention I’m on Luvox for ocd and anxiety. 

I’ve also reached a point where I can’t eat. I haven’t eaten in a couple days due to nausea from anxiety. The most I can keep down is water and Gatorade. This happened before a couple months back, lasted a month or so and I lost 40lbs. Today I’m down 6lbs. The beginning of the year I was 205ish now I’m 159 (not that I’m complaining about losing weight but the rate it’s at isn’t healthy) 

So I guess I’m just looking for advice on setting aside my anxiety so I can take care of myself. I’m supposed to work in a few and my job is strenuous (can’t call out) and I just feel dizzy from all of this.

I got a two bedroom apartment and found a roommate. We were cool and in good terms. I went to work one day and got a text of her saying sorry. I didn’t know why she was saying sorry till I got home.

She didn’t pay her half of the rent so now I’m left with her half which is $750 and I don’t know what to do.

210,"So I [21f] hung out with a married couple [late20s] maybe a month ago. We have two mutual friends and they brought me to their house. I almost immediately was swept up into their marital issues upon meeting. I was told they ""had problems"" and it was apparent through the night. It was really just annoying.

Me and the husband were left to ourselves for a few minutes and naturally started talking, as friendly as could be, so I didn't think it was weird or out of place when he sent me a friend request the next day. Then he asked me on a date. I reminded him of his wife and told him that its not a situation I care to put myself in. I let him down gently in a way that kind of danced around me actually saying no, I guess. He hasn't messaged me since.

Now his wife is messaging me. She asked me if we ever talked to each other after that night. I feel like she definitely knows about his messages to me. So I don't want to lie for him but I don't want to rat on him. My friends would likely want to take me back there, so I'm trying to think of a way to respond that wouldn't bar me from ever going back. Is there any way I could approach this that would make everybody ""happy""? Or just not opposed to me?

211,"I don't know if this is a shared feeling, at least for how I feel it. 

I'm 25. I got out of school with a good grade, then got a Bachelor and then a Master's degree in Physics, which took me the minimum possible time for taking it and even got me a publication. Now, I've been working as a developer in a company which provides software for insurance companies. Next week will be my last week and in November I'm going to attend a school of Videogame Programming.
In my free time I've been (without being particularly excellent in any of them) a writer, a reader, a videomaker and editor, a musicist, a gamer, a bingewatcher, an artist, a volunteer educator/animator for kids, a teacher (in a way), a TCG player,... I've worked on projects, either mine or others', I've travelled, practiced various sports, I've made and lost friends, relationships,...
and yet, I'm still overwhelmed by the infinite amount of possibilities I have in front of me. It's not just a matter of 'being able to', or 'can afford to', but just 'might do'. There are so many books to read, movies to watch, games to play, careers to pursue, things to learn, places to be,...

But I know I can't do everything, nobody can. This crushes me.

I always had this feeling, but I always looked at it with a smile: it just meant I would never get bored because there are so many things to do.
But then, a year ago, I got this job. I got stuck into a job I  don't like (I love programming, but I feel each minute I spend on insurance software is wasted time) that takes me 8+ hours a day. Get home, chores, then a little free time, too tired to do anything productive though. You might say ""that's adult life man"", I know: it's not the life thar bothers me, but this feeling of not being able to do everything.

The final hit came little more than a month ago. One of my cousins passed away at the age of 17. Besides the sorrow of this loss, the idea that he will never be able to do the things he wanted to do made me reconsider my own life, but also made the feeling worse.

Now the idea of not being able to do everything is crushing me. Every second I spend doing nothing - because I'm tired, or waiting,... - feels like a second I could spend doing something. I force myself to go to bed in order to sleep a kinda normal amount hours (despite often failing to) because it feels like I'm wasting time while I'm asleep. This feeling is really frustrating, and often anguishes and stops me from actually doing things because I feel like I'm not optimizing enough. It's getting unhealthy, both physically (for the lack of sleep mainly) and mentally. 

Does anybody feel something similar and/or has any advice in dealing with it? ",12Oct2018,1

215,"tl;dr got depressed, suicide, started missing school and councillors/help haven’t done anything to make me think differently



ok, so i’ll only put important details here, and the rest i’ll leave out because i’m tired.

when i was 12 years old i became friends with at the time, a funny, charismatic kid. he was new to the school, and i wanted to make a good impression. i didn’t realise he was taking advantage of me. he walked all over me, ignored me, used me to get connections to other friends and all sorts of stuff. 

in year 7, i realised this and called him out on it. he wasn’t impressed. since he was the popular kid in high school already, he made a bad name for me and made up rumours about me within the first few weeks of school. i didn’t make any friends.

i became severely depressed, and my anxiety from being bullied started to stop me from going to school. eventually i was skipping days and days, sometimes weeks at a time. i was the most hated kid in my class, in the whole year level and lots of kids liked to tell me that.

in november 2017 i had enough. i went into my room, took off my pillowcase and tried to tie it around my neck to strangle myself. as i was tightening it my mum came in to check on me. i was 13, i turned 14 about a week ago.

at this point i was already in intense councilling, but it wasn’t helping. i didn’t know how to handle my depression, my anxiety, or my social stupidity. i have since found out i am extremely likely to have Asperger’s syndrome.

i am currently in the process of getting antidepressants, but i have to wait until november. 

since i don’t go to school much still, i don’t get much work, so i don’t do much, so i keep telling myself ill never get a job and will likely be homeless. i keep being told i am smart, but when i do work i can’t concentrate and when i read it takes me a few times to comprehend it.

i am looking for advice, but also generally to vent. if anyone has any tips on how to deal with anxiety, what to do in social situations or the like, please let me know. 

thanks everyone.",12Oct2018,1

217," This isn't humble brag, please don't mistake. I have an issue.

To put it simply, my heart is too soft. I give my entire paycheck to my family and friends. I do not love money at all. I like to have money but when someone asks me for cash, even large amounts, I force them to agree to not pay it back. I am disgusted by how people will ruin and be mean to people over cash.

I cry at the thought of people going through hard times, even now I'm a touch teary eyed... I kiss all my family on the lips and I be as loving as I can. Not forceful, I was raised with a lot of affection.

I like being this way, all I want is for people to be happy in this life.

What I want help with is... I am very disrespected by everyone. Even my girlfriend (who my brother and I share) didn't put my name on a card and only his. I was very hurt, not jealous. Because after how I treat everyone they just treat me bad. My family talks behind my back.
Not my mother or brother, they are very loving.

I do not want to be a bad person, I just want to be loved and respected like I respect and love them.
I fear I'll never be treated right because I'm too loving.

Don't get me wrong, I can be an asshole when I'm mad, but I would never hurt the feelings of ANYONE.

How do I have people respect and love me like I do them? Also, is this a mental illness I'm having??

222,"I didn't notice a rule against linking to porn, unlike /r/sex, where I first considered asking this question, which is a bit related to porn.

I got the idea that *maybe* my own standards were skewed when I saw [this figure](https://i.imgur.com/LfVnFRs.jpg) in a study about men's breast-size preference (DOI 10.1007/s10508-013-0081-5); below is a description of the five images used in the study, excerpted from its own ""Measures"" section:

&gt; The stimuli were created in an interactive three-dimensional
(3D) modeling software, Daz Studio 3.1 [...], which allows the creation of photo-realistic 3D models. [...] The
breast was modified using the breast size dimension on the
Body morphs++ add-on package. The bust size was set at
5-levels, &amp;minus;100, &amp;minus;50, 0, 50, and 100 on the breast size slider. The body rotated through 360&amp;deg; in 5&amp;deg; steps [...]. The animation was rendered in 24-bit color and in 685&amp;times;895 pixel resolution. It was exported as a 30-frames-per-second AVI. The stimuli were then presented concurrently and simultaneously on 13-inch laptop computers in ascending order (see Fig. 1). Participants were asked to rate the figure that they found most physically attractive, where 1 represented the figure with very small breasts and 5 represented the figure with very large breasts.

I'm sorry for the wall of text there, but even the full quote was one paragraph; the image I linked earlier was ""Fig. 1""), and clearly it was static, greyscale, and in a single pose in the article itself because of the limitations of journal articles (maybe some allow color but that's about it).

My main issue is referring to figure 5 as having ""very large"" breasts; maybe it's because I only saw them in greyscale and from an angle that doesn't make clear how far forward the models project (and if I bothered to pay for Daz Studio and the relevant add-ons and assets, I could replicate this for myself), but here's how the models looked to me (compared to how the study labelled them):

1. very very small (very small)
2. very small (small)
3. medium-small (medium)
4. medium (large)
5. medium-large (very large)

(FWIW the responses were heavily skewed toward the large side, with 3 being the most-preferred size, followed by 4, 5, 2, and 1; maybe something akin to a 6 actually would have shown substantial preference for that size, or maybe the model just couldn't be made that busty.)

This got me thinking about some of the porn that I had seen where the woman was described as having ""big boobs"" but they just didn't seem that big to me; I mean they look big *for her frame* but not enough to make it a major point of the video, stuff like this (NSFW links):

* [KBJ ARIN - Hot Big Tit Tease 2](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5635846d87a6f)
 * She looks almost as busty as the 4 figure and she can do a handbra with one hand.
* [KOREAN CUTIE WITH BIG TITS AND GREAT ASS WEBCAM 3](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=733662504)
 * Bagel Soo here looks somewhere between the 4 and the 5 in size and can also do a one-handed handbra, but not as easily as Arin.
* [Korean Big Tits Han Ye-In Full Ver. 한예인 누드 완전판 (1/2)](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=1327954478)
 * She looks a bit bigger than a 4.
* [2018小果酱半乳校服](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5aee7c9882901) (tagged into the ""Big Tits"" category)
 * Kotori looks about 4 size and it's a shame the rest of the video takes the focus off her boobs.

I realize all four of them are East Asian, but that's partly the point: I had thought that when they were said to have big breasts that a sort of racial handicap was involved; I am aware, of course, of the many JAV and gravure actresses with boobs that are undeniably big, well above the 5 model, but they're irrelevant to the question I'm trying to ask.

Then I remembered some of the [Omegle vid-caps](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph59dfd34f95e39) (NSFW), where nearly all of the finds were White and some looked like 3s but were still said to have ""big tits"" (as in the linked compilation video), among others whose boobs were unquestionably large or even huge; I also remembered some celebrities (mostly White American) considered to have ""large"" breasts, like Scarlett Johansson, who is a bit over 3, and Emily Ratajkowski, who is about a 4, but I thought maybe it was just the same sort of Hollywood bias that treats normal-sized women as fat, not just ""American average"" but actually not overweight (no links here, you can find them easily enough yourself).

I'm also fairly sure it's not a matter of getting de-sensitized and needing ever-bigger racks just to get off (I *am* active in big-boob communities around the Web, just not so much on Reddit); in particular, I *have* regularly wanked to the first two videos I linked to, and when I looked up some sources of ""inspiration"" from my younger years to refresh my memory, I mostly found women who were definitely more stacked than the 5 model (Kelly Brook, Sof&amp;iacute;a Vergara, Maria Grazia Cucinotta, Diora Baird a bit later), with a few who were less well-endowed, but not by much (like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Nikki Cox), and I could still get off today to the pix and vidz from that first list that I had first seen about 15 years ago (as for the last two, it looks like they were just very skilled with the push-ups in basically every scene I found particularly stimulating; let's just say I was disappointed to see how Cox looked in *Run Ronnie Run!* after jerking to many an *Unhappily Ever After* rerun).

---
With that said, __*are* my perceptions of breast size seriously skewed here__, compared to a typical man? Do the models in the study I just referenced *really* correspond to what typical men would call ""medium"" and ""very large"" and so on? Where would you draw the line?

On a slightly related note, I found [this useful chart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra_size#Calculating_cup_volume_and_breast_weight) that will leave some curious horndogs trying to estimate how big a woman's hands are, because it relates cup diameter to underwire size, which is the same for all ""sister sizes"" and so can be used to infer bra sizes; with that said, *I'd* consider ""very large"" breasts to start at underwire size 42, or what the old Italian system called a size VII (like a 32G or a 34F), and even the women I've fapped to the most (like the old ""Snorg-tees Girl"" and Becca-dex) aren't quite that stacked (both 32F at their prime, I think the latter one still is).

I didn't want to post this question on a sub or forum for big-boob fans, because the responses would be unrepresentative to say the least, and on something like bigboobproblems, I'm well aware that even boobs like the 5 model has, while not rush-to-jerk-in-restroom impressive, can legitimately cause problems in daily life, and also their FAQ says there's no lower limit on what counts as ""big"" (also that sub bans porn).

I also first posted this in /r/AskMen but it was auto-deleted because of a moratorium on all boob-related threads that I wasn't aware of and wasn't in the FAQ or the rules at the time (although it *is* understandable).",12Oct2018,1

Now I am feeling the effects of another medication I have been on for years that made it so I couldn’t fucking sleep.

I think I am gonna die if I keep not getting sleep.

What do I do?

224,"A couple months ago I was hired as a salesperson at a good-sized company. Employees here normally start with $8/hour plus commission, but I got to start with $9/hour for being fluent in a foreign language. 

I am the only one in the whole company that's literate in this language and is culturally native. 

Three days ago, a higher-up person asked me to translate a sidewalk sign at my store. The sign was small and didn't have many words and phrases so I was happy to help. 

Today the same person suddenly informed me that I am to do wayyy more translations, not only for my store, but for the entire region. (Where I live heavily relies on tourism, and more than half of the tourists speak my language) 

Due to the nature of the company I'm assuming that they would be paying me just the usual $9/hour as they said I'd be paid for my ""time"". I don't want to miss out on commission, specially for doing more work. 

They've already scheduled a meeting for me to come in next month to translate anything they need and to share cultural sales tactics for the whole region to use. I'm sure this is super valuable to the company. 

Always happy to help out a bit, but I feel like they're asking me a lot this time around... Any suggestions?

Also worth noting: The best commissions come from something employees have to be taught first, which I haven't been after months of employment. Coworkers make twice as much in commission compared to me.",12Oct2018,1
225,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 4 years and I feel like we are in the exact same place now as we were 4 years ago. I have been out of home for 2 years now and we live half an hour away from each other. After so long I am 100% ready to live with him and it would solve so many of our scheduling and commute problems while also allowing us to build something together. His reasoning for not wanting to was he couldn’t afford it and he is comfortable where he is. I will note that I work in Real Estate so I understand the costs and know where to find the affordable and decent places. He is still living with his parents but pays a certain amount in board per week + the internet bill. I am currently sharing and pay a certain amount per week comfortably. I worked out if we were to move in together to just a 1 bedroom he would actually be paying LESS money than he is currently paying as I am happy to continue paying around what I am paying a week and he will only have to make up the rest. I presented this to him, proud of my findings and he still managed to shut the idea down by coming up with some new excuse. It’s really hurting me and making me feel like we are staying stagnant and not moving forward in our relationship. I’m getting tired of having sleepovers like a child and want to have a life of our own together. He knows it is important to me and I really feel like our relationship will just get better by doing it but he refuses to even consider it.

227,"(This is going to be a long post so sorry)

I know a girl through my friend, and we dated and broke up about a week ago, and while we were dating and even now, she tells me stuff about her family life and trying to cope.

It's pretty fucking bad.

Her mother lives with her (the girl's) grandmother, and they share a house with three kids. Her older sister lives with her boyfriend nearby and comes round often. Her mother is the root of all these problems. She is abusive and has been to rehab several times and has sought professional help. None of this has helped. She also told me that there has been several suicide attempts in the family, usually from her grandmother or her mother, and her mother does drugs and shit like that.

She says that because her mother and her older sister never had a chance to have a proper education (pregnancy and drugs and being with the wrong people ruined that apparently), so she is the 'hope' of the family. She feels as if she has this burden on her shoulders which means she has to stop her mother from doing anything to herself, or the three young children in the house (Aged six, one, and a few months old).

The thing with her is that I can't help her. And that's the worst thing. Because I want to help her and I want her to feel okay but all of this shit makes me feel like I can't. And I want to offer support and help but I physically can't. She lives ages away from me, her family restrict her movements and she said herself that if she seeks help, her family will see that she 'can't function' and they'll spiral even further into depression and she is even more scared that these attempts at suicide will get even worse and the domestic fights will get more violent and that someone will end up seriously hurt or killed. Her parents won't let the small children be adopted, because the mum feels like she needs the smallest child. 

What I'm asking for is some way to help. Something to say, or something to do that will make things better. So in a recap:

* She cannot seek professional help outside of school (where she feels as if the social worker there does not help)
* She needs to stay strong and in the house so that fights and other stuff doesn't happen when she's not around.
* Her mother cannot seek help as it 'does not help' and it only results in her getting more violent.
* The police, when called, do nothing to help or intervene in the situation.

I really need advice on what to do. Any kind of advice, or things to say is fully and openly welcomed.",12Oct2018,1

 I want to keep this short because it features things that span across at least 10 years. With that being said, most of the things are the gist but I can expand if necessary.


 I am 16 and a Junior in high school. I have chronic mental issues, with a diagnosis of two illnesses (psychotic depression, uncategorized anxiety), but I doubt this is all I experience as I had a boatload of evaluated tendencies as well. I no longer go to therapy for reasons unrelated to things mentioned below.


 I live with one of my guardians (G1) that has practically been my sole proivder for all of my life. Both of my parents separated a couple of years ago (4-5yrs), but they are not divorced. I opted to stay with G1 by my own will, as they're the only one I see as a parental figure. The other (G2) is the complete opposite. I don't want to come across as a bratty teen, but as a child they basically used me and my other (much older) siblings as servants.


 They would also single me out for punishments, believe things my siblings said I did (that I had no way of doing), and manipulate me constantly. Their behavior has caused a lot of psychological/mental trauma that I don't think I'll ever get over. In recent years, they haven't stopped there. They've threatened to beat me because of my lack of religion, has said absolute trash about G1 in front of me, as well as say cruel remarks about my sexuality. 


 The only time they're nice to me is when they can use me for money (taxes) or to brag to their friends. They're just overall a fake, abusive, manipulative person. 


 Recently, me and G2 got into an argument that led to me having a breakdown. I don't want to go into specifics, but in it they knowingly brought up a part of my identity I'm insecure about as a means to attack me. I have come to the conclusion that I absolutely cannot deal with them in my life anymore. Though, this is complicated because of numerous reasons:


 1.) I don't think G1 can fight for custody of me even if they got a divorce. Half a year ago they got disabled, and is still waiting on payment for it. Plus their condition is constantly wavering, so even if they wanted to, I don't think they could stand in court. I say this because I haven't disclosed the history of abuse to G1 (they weren't home often when it occured, and more recent issues G2 made sure they weren't around) and unsure if now is the best time.


 2.) G2 is my only transportation to school. I don't want to drop out. I've thought of taking the public bus, but this leads to...


 3.) As I'm the only person taking care of G1, I don't have a job. I probably have enough to pay for just a few trips. I have a relative that lives close to the school who'd be willing to take me in (well, 30mins to an 1hr walking distance), although I'm open to walking, nobody would be left to care for G1.


 4.) I say 'grasp' because besides me living with G1, G2 basically has control of everything else important a.k.a documentation. This means me and G1 don't have access to stuff like my birth certificate, ss card (though G2 lost my card, I do know my #, but refuse to give it to them because of stuff in the past), medcal records and health care, and school documents/registration.


 I'm just in an overall stuck situation and I don't know what to do. I'm sick of carrying burdens or forced to put up with someone like G2. I seriously don't think I can last the next 2yrs, because it seems as the years go on things just get worse and worse. I don't know who to talk to or what to do.

Honestly lately I’ve been lonely as fuck, my circle is getting smaller by the day, soon it will be non existent.

I used to have 30 people that called themselves my friends and I would see them daily, they would act like my friend they would come to my birthdays and I would go to theirs.

For years this is how it was, daily chill sessions smoking up a storm at my house and blazing till the AM.

Then I stopped dealing.

Now not everybody left but a few stuck around maybe like 5 until they found another person to smoke with and now they are gone and I’m writing this in a Saturday night drunk and by myself in my room.

Some days I don’t know how I was so stupid to let them take advantage of me and every other day I fucking hate humanity.

My last 3 friends stuck around until my aunty dies and I needed to talk to them and for them to listen much like I had done for them over the years but no all I got was my number blocked.

And many times we have questions for each other , and they are country/race specific but we find all those questions interesting and chat about those in a really positive matter. But questions are rather light, like: ""why French put so much butter on everything"", ""why Brazilians love football so much"" ""why India has a huge amount of IT people"", or sometimes maybe little bit more provoking like ""Why French use so much parfume"" , ""Why Greeks says X food is Greek but Turkish say its Turkish"" etc. But we are all quite open and respecting so we never even really have negative-arguements about this. It is just curiosity and we are all happy we get these questions asked, it gives everyone an insight rather than follow the stereotypical answer which is wrong quite often.

TL;DR a creepy guy disappeared after being creepy with me, and is now back and still being creepy. Cops don’t care. What can i do? 



I worked until midnight a couple years ago so it was common for me to do my grocery store runs after work when I got into my town. Customer parking lot was empty save for one van in the back. Whatever, I parked in the front. 

In the store I start noticing a guy has been in every aisle I have been in. Whatever. I go to check out. He goes outside to the front of the store where the soda machines are and starts buying a soda. When I start to head to the door, the van is parked next to my car. And he’s there still at the soda machine, getting his 3rd-4th can of soda. 

I pretend to forget something and turn around. I stayed in the store for 30 minutes calling friends that were saying I was being “paranoid” and “dramatic”.

“You’re not in DC anymore. Just go to your car.”

“You watch too much ID channel.”

But after 30 minutes he was still there by the soda machine, and the silver van with black windows was still by my car. Only person in the store was an elderly floor buffer with headphones on and an old lady to watch the self check out lanes. I ultimately was able to leave the store when a cop car came into the parking lot to the use the grocery stores gas station. The van was gone. 

I ran out to my car, threw my stuff in and pulled my car over to where the cop was and explained what happened. He says unfortunately it’s a public space and someone just making me uncomfortable isn’t really enough to do anything about. He never approached me, or spoke to me. 

The next time I decide to go to the Walmart in my town instead. Few more cars than the grocery store and a bit more lighting, and more employees. When I come out, that same van is next to my car. I get a male employee I’m familiar with to walk me out. Again, I spoke to the police and they said the same thing. 

My work schedule changed and I got a new car, didn’t see the van again. Until last night. 

We flooded bad from Hurricane Michael so I went to the store around 3am when the rains stopped to pick up a couple fans. 

In the store I notice a guy and can’t figure out why he looks familiar. I keep seeing him in every aisle I’m in. And when I go outside, that same silver/dark gray van with black windows is next to my car. 

Maybe I am being paranoid, I don’t live in a huge area. And this guy could very well work late like I did and run errands at night. But I always trust my gut, and it just doesn’t feel right. And yes I have been victim to sexual assault before, so I know that can definitely make me paranoid.

We've been together for 2.5 years, lived together for about 7 months. Can't help but seriously notice that I am genuinely less and less happy the longer we stay together... And until today I thought it couldn't get any worse... But it did.

I love her. Most of the daily things we are perfect match for each other, i.e. she's happy to do the laundry and I love cooking kinda deal. Even though she is vegan i am not, I absolutely don't mind eating vegan and prepare meals for her. There are good moments in our relationships even though it's mostly when I push myself out there to do fun things with her, i.e. traveling, going to concerts and movies etc. However when it comes to personal growth she is the absolute opposite. Her inability to recognize how many things from childhood to adulthood are affecting her and that she had not dealt with, is majorly projected onto me (daddy's issue and etc.). At the same time she only comes to me for whenever she's exhausted from friends, work, life. It's not until this year that I talked to her friends about it that she started to tell them more about these things. Worse is when sometimes I am exhausted and all i need is someone else to hear me out, tell me I will be fine, she then will get overly empathetic and start crying and get depressed for me. In return 150% of the time I have to console her.  I stopped telling her my concerns months ago.

I wish to say our values align but frankly speaking besides our family habits, although we sound like an old couple, the only thing she is pushing me to grow is patience, submission and faith.

\- **2)**

What started confusing me was when my SO's friend treated me a dinner 1-on-1 because she couldn't make it to me birthday BBQ this summer. We hit off like Marshall and Lily from HIMYM. She knows her issues and are honest, transparent to acknowledge them and are working hard to grow herself. We have quite a few common interests/hobby and she shows off a lot of deeper philosophical thoughts and psychological resilience that not only I admire, but we also expressed our likeness and admiration to each other. Every time we hung out for a meal in a group and esp. 1-on-1, it was always good and fun times. Although nothing romantic has ever happened, but flirting and teasing is our normal and i can feel the tension. She genuinely made me feel happy that someone else finally speaks my language, not afraid to raise difficult questions and are confrontational. Which I am very saddened to say that the only i see what keep my current SO and I lasting / happy is the loyalty, commitment and the unwillingness to give up trying to be together. They are not bad things. Matter of fact they are very important, but i just don't wanna be her emotional balloon anymore.

About my SO's friend, i think I'm going to see it out in the long run as negative aspects of a person often comes with time. 

Yet about my SO, today my dream job offer from my home church came back and told me that i cannot have the position they offered me originally because they overheard that i live with my SO. My heart sank miles deep as I am so disappointed at myself to have let the reason to save money overruled how it might possibly affect applications and offers such as this. Needless to say my SO is once again more depressed than me and I had to turnt myself around and made sure she was okay first. She is now currently at her friend's house have a girls' night sleepover and now I am at the house on my own not knowing what I should say, feel or do. I want to break up with her to end this emotional turmoil, get my dream job offer and pick my growth track back up. But at the same time I love her and all i want is the best for her and i don't want to hurt her.

And I don't know which friend I can talk about this anymore so the only way I have left is here...

I’ve been working and paying rent on my own and everything has been fine and I do have every intention of going back to school when I’ve saved up enough.

265,"Just to provide some background info on myself: I'm a 20 year old male, and a sophomore at a university which is a 10 mile drive away from my house. I live with my parents, in a middle-class suburban community in South Florida. Both work, and both are respected by their business friends. 

My father is a workaholic of sorts. He has a short fuse himself, but I rarely see it because he's always at work. When I DO see him, he usually has a passive relationship with me, sometimes he ""speaks down"" to me but he rarely lays a finger on me and the very few times he did, it was with good reason.

My mother, on the other hand, she's a fireball of emotions. SOMETIMES, she is sweet and gentle and speaks to me on the same level. But when she suffers from a shitty mood, she has a tendency to take it out on other people. Typically, I am the first to be subjected to her wrath. Take this morning, for example. I wake up and the first thing I do is call for the family friend who babysits my youngest sister, because I need to ask her a question. Let's call her Tammy (not her real name, just an alias). ""TAMMY!!!"", I yell out because I don't see her. It turns out she's in the master bedroom, which is where my mother is. My mother barges out and just totally erupts into a hysterical bout of yelling and mocking. I try to be cool, but me being calm seems to provoke my mother's anger even more. She won't calm down until' she sees that she has provoked an intense reaction from me, and she revels in it with an almost sadistic sense of pride. 

I have a tendency to slack off. She exploits that, and calls me a ""bum"". I agree with her, that sloth is one of my fatal flaws. It's also why I haven't moved into my dorm yet, nor do I hold a steady job. She continues her tirade for a few minutes, and I play nice, then she threatens to ground me. The tirade continues, and eventually I start yelling back. The moment I do this, she suddenly shuts up and smacks me. Not too hard, but you get the point. The argument dies down, and we might be on speaking terms now. 

But this wasn't just one incident. This kind of unhealthy altercation happens twice a month, and always seems to play out in the same exact way. She wakes up in a shitty mood, I come in with my hair a mess or wearing the same clothes as yesterday (hey, I just woke up myself, give me 10 minutes to get my act together), she erupts into a hysterical frenzy and I admit that I kind of deserve it, but the calmer I am, the angrier she gets. God forbid I try to avoid confrontation, then she gets physical. I'm kind of used to this relationship and I probably should not be, because I don't think it is particularly healthy. But I have the opportunity to move into a dorm. Should I take any opportunity to leave? I have a learner's permit and I'm in the process of finally obtaining my license. Should I just flee the moment I have a steady job and a driver's license, or should I stick around?",12Oct2018,1

270,"As stated in the title I am receiving scam calls from people that pretend to work for Microsoft starting 3 days ago. They call me twice in short succession every two hours and hang up after the third ring if I don’t answer the phone. They use a fluctuating number so every call has a different number assigned to the people calling. So far I have only had two people on the phone. Neither of them speaking the common language used in my country (Germany)

The want to make me believe that I have to do sth with my computer by following their instructions as it is sending Data towards Microsoft, which causes there Service to have problems. Now you‘d have to be a huge dumbass to believe that alone for several reasons.

However today I got a call which ended less pleasantly, which is why I am asking for advice.

So I ignore most of their calls and yesterday I told them if they‘d call and harass me again I‘d call the police on them.

They still called me thrice today and the following happened. So in the beginning of the call I told the guy I would be recording this call for future evidence and if he was on with that. He agreed (which is strange to me but ok) and wanted to take me through the exact same procedure as the people before him. So I quickly turned the tables and told him what he was about to tell me. He even acknowledged that I was right about the things he was about to say. I repeatedly said to him that I don’t want any further calls of this manner and that’s when he told me that windows is going to shut my computer down, he‘s going to call the cops on me and they will confiscate my PC tomorrow. 

Now I don’t believe any of this bullshit and I won’t answer the phone if I don’t see a number I know for sure anymore. However in the last call the guy seemed close to snapping and threatening me, which is the reason I am asking for advice on how to deal with this matter.

Should I go to the police and inform them about this matter, should I just ignore it for a week and hope they stop bothering, or any other steps.

277,"So I gave a friend that I’ve known for quite a few years now. She has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which can cause someone to have extremely unstable relationships. I have OCD so we’ve always kind of bonded over being fucked up &amp; made sure to be there for one another. 

She’s a great friend &amp; up until recently I had no complaints. She moved into a new apartment at the end of summer. Since then, I found out she has been telling me a lot of tiny lies. Like ‘oh I can’t hang out today, my mom is coming into town’ and then posting pictures of her with other friends all over social media. This happened quite a few times so I told her if she had plans, to just tell me she had plans. There’s no need to lie about it. She brushed t off with a ‘sorry, after everything that’s happened in my life that’s the way I am.’ Eventually we made up &amp; became friends again. 

About a month ago she left in the middle of downtown without a way to get home as she drove, so she could hook up with some guy from tinder. She told me I wasn’t able to go with them because it was a ‘just them’ thing. I don’t live near downtown &amp; didn’t have much money on me so I had to have someone else come get me. She was very unapologetic and basically blamed me for ruining her night because she felt bad about it. 

We stopped talking for a little while &amp; it took me apologizing for us to be friends again. She was a great friend I didn’t want to lose over something silly. We made up but I still felt a little uneasy around her. 

Last week, I had invited her to come to the park with me &amp; my dogs. She declined, saying she had to work all day. After the park, I was nearby her work so I decided to pop in to say hello &amp; maybe pick up my pups some treats since she works at a pet store. When I went, they told me she was off that day. I confronted her &amp; she said she got her times mixed up on her schedule and didn’t work until later. I noticed on Snapchat that she was home all day, as she was very active on social media. 

Its starting to drain me. I feel like I’m not wanted around her anymore and she won’t tell me. We haven’t spoken since, but I feel kind of bad because I know this might not be her, it may just be her BPD.

280,"Hey reddit,

So I’m trying to figure out what to make of a situation that happened at work today. I work in a small department of a huge company processing paperwork for clients. Our job doesn’t require that we work together directly but our desks are still in one general location so we still interact daily. 

On Wednesday towards the end of the day, I left work early because I felt like I was about to have a panic attack. I have a pretty severe/moderate anxiety disorder but I’ve gotten to the point where I can manage it pretty well. I occasionally have to take a day off of my mental health but I have a lot of PTO so it’s never been an issue. I didn’t make a scene in any way and when I left I just told my coworkers I had a headache. My boss was totally fine with it and I have a ton of PTO left for the year so I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal. 

I didn’t even really think anyone noticed because before I left I had my head down, then talked to my boss and left.

Anyways, that brings us to today. I came into work and a few coworkers were asking how I was. A lot of people have been calling off so we were chatting about that. One of my coworkers joined the conversation and mentioned to everyone that the last girl that had my desk, quit because she had a huge panic attack at work and had to be carried out on a stretcher. After she said it, it kind of seemed like she was really trying to get my reaction or thoughts on it. It really make me uncomfortable for a lot of reasons but It just laughed it off and went about my day. It really threw me off though. I very well could be looking into it way too much, but it seemed a bit off to me. I’ve been at this job for around 7 months and have over heard plenty of office gossip but never anything about that. 

My question is, was she trying to embarrass me for calling off or was it just her trying to make conversation? Also, how should I proceed? She’s had issues with other employees in the past and I really don’t want to get involved with office drama. It could all be by coincidence though, so I wanted to see what reddit thought.

He knows I'm using this app and my profile is public and so is his but I'm here to ask - should I just send him a message there? Should I just like one of his pics and then send a message and say his pics are nice?

290,"I just created this throwaway for a concerning email I just read and would like some any possible advice on if it's something I need to be concerned with or not, or just someone phishing.  


So I, like I'm sure most single people have done, was watching porn for a bit on my phone last weekend. Nothing unusual has ever happened  in the past but about an hour afterwards that night, I noticed that I got a missed call from AT&amp;T customer service.  Obviously, I couldn't find out exactly they would be calling me about at 9 o clock. It made me extremely nervous (I'm a pretty paranoid dude anyway) so I deleted my phone's browser history  and  decided that was a good reason  not to use my phone to watch porn anymore.  Which really means no porn in general since I won't use my home PC either.  (I watch weird fucked up things like everyone,  but nothing illegal and I only stick to the usual sites like Pornhub, Xvideos, etc)  I'm legitimately trying to go clean now, honestly.   


Anyways, fast forward to today, and I was checking my emails and noticed I got a spam message from someone claiming they used tracking from the site to collect all my personal data, passwords,  contacts, pictures, etc and is threatening to release porn stuff and videos of me from my phone unless I pay them in bitcoin. They said if I needed ""proof"" to click on a link which obviously, I wasn't about to do. They claim it's pointless to go to the police but if I don't pay soon, they'll be releasing everything. If anything else, it looks like a pretty serious email, I'll give them that.   


I'm not ashamed of the fact that I watch porn but I'd be concerned if this is a real threat I need to take seriously or someone is just trying to fuck with me to get me to pay them like one of those tax scammers. Anyone have any advice to offer? (Besides staying away from porn sites, I'm completely aware of that)

291,"I sleep through my alarm probably 1% of the time. That's about once every other month or around 4 times a year or so. One percent doesn't sound like something I should be worried about, but being an hour or more late for work that often will most certainly get me fired from most places within a year. Luckily, I work a retail job where they are very tolerant of my problem.

I've read/tried all the things save for actually seeking medical help. I can sleep for four or eight hours and wake up fine, do any drug before sleep (weed, alcohol, or coffee, I'm not a degenerate, haha), have the craziest sleep schedule, eat or not eat before bed, I always drink lots of water and have to pee in the morning. I have 2 alarms set, one of which is my phone and one of which is my computer, both of which are offset by a minute or so and I have to get out of bed to snooze, and I usually wake up just fine. I've tried sleeping with the lights on and with the lights off. I've tried changing the sounds that my alarms make.

The point I'm trying to make here is that I've tried every conceivable thing to fix this problem and I still sleep through my alarms on occasion. Not only this, but I can be having a totally normal day/night, get enough sleep, etc. etc. and boom it just happens without warning. The fact that it happens so ""rarely"" makes it difficult to find a pattern if there is one. 

On top of this, I have a pretty normal sleep schedule. Granted, it is not perfect, but I am up and out of bed between 6AM and 8AM everyday, even when I have no obligations in the morning. When I sleep through my alarm, it's between those times when I wake up, regardless of how much sleep I got. The problem is that some days I have to be in work as early as 7:00. 

Maybe I should just tell them I can't come in so early anymore because it messes with my sleep schedule. Though, I'm not certain whether that will fix my problem.

Is anyone else in a similar situation? I know lots of people have trouble waking up in the morning, but I feel like my situation is a little different that what I've seen written about.",12Oct2018,1
292,"I  have OCD and Depression and I have been  told by my psychotherapist to  write down my thoughts and issues in a  small notebook soon after they  happen. This helps me process my symptoms  and manage them better in  daily life. Basically it keeps me sane. The  writings are obviously by  their very nature, deeply personal and  private. The writing takes only  10 minutes cumulatively throughout a  day, 1-2 minutes each time.

I  work at  customer service and They have set up a rule where I can't use  the phone  or use the diary. Even though other co-workers are okay to  do so.

Now for the past two days, my  manager has rebuked me in front of everyone for using the mobile for 10  minutes. He says he zoomed in and saw everything on my mobile and that I  was on Chrome. He has been doing this everyday now.

There  is a half-spherical camera right above my desk in the ceiling and all  the cameras are recorded 24/7 and the record is kept for 4 years. There  are no blind spots in my desk and I am covered by the main cam, and at  least two others. I am not allowed to leave the desk. The whole floor is  covered by cameras.

I need a way to  journal without the cameras seeing. I can't use the phone since getting  it out is now a crime and then there's the risks of hacking. I also  can't leave the job since here in Asia jobs are *very rare*.  Also, outing oneself as a mental illness has severe social, legal and  work consequences. I did tell them about the difficulties I faced like I  may not be able to handle certain stresses or be good at certain things  but they laughed, insulted me and put up the pressure even more to  ""harden me out"" (forge by the fire). So talking about mental illness is  an absolute no.

Anyways, can anyone suggest how I can journal privately? Like any techniques, strategies, processes, DIY solutions etc?

294,"This isn't about a relationship as you might have thought, but about losing my dream job. I was lucky enough to pretty much nail my dream job fresh out of university and was in it for 3 years until there were mass layoffs. I actually left on my own because it was clear the department would be dissolved soon, and a month after I left it was, so either way I wouldn't be working there anymore.

My current job is not bad at all, but doesn't measure up to that previous job. It's not in the industry I really want to be in, and the atmosphere and coworkers do not compare at all. I really tried to make it work but after about 6 months it was clear this just doesn't measure up to the old job and I kinda shut down. I'm probably depressed to some degree, and spend a lot of time thinking about how much happier I was when I still had the other job and all the things I miss about it. I do have good things going on for me, but still I am not nearly as happy as I used to be and having a job I feel somewhat passionate for is important to me.

I've been trying to get back into a similar job, but no luck so far. Plus I've been getting this feeling that what I had was a unique thing that will never happen again, basically that it was the ultimate dream job and now I've lost it and nothing will ever compare again.

302,"Hey guys.  
Recently I realized that I am a toxic person and I pretty much had all the signs of someone who would be toxic, although I wouldn't project my negativity and make someone feel like shit willingly, it's more out of spite for what happened in my past. However when I came to that realization, everything felt more easier because I started blaming myself for situations that I was involved in after taking a step back and just analyzing things. I feel a lot more aware of what I say, do and basically think so essentially I have started feeling happier, albeit it being little, it is still something, it's a step.  


I have this mental ""thing"" that I don't have a name for where I just have such laziness, I wait for things to happen rather than getting out there and making it happen for me, I just don't want to work and the shittest thing about this is I'm AWARE of it, that thought constantly sits there but I can't seem to find the motivation to completely change my perspective of things.  
I've written up a list of the things that I've done since realizing that I was toxic, and things that I want to accomplish, but just can't find the drive to do it.. I've watched motivational speakers like GaryVee, their thinking process is amazing however it's so hard to adopt and keep strong with it.

The list of things I have done and want to do but can't figure out what to start off with;

* I've gotten rid of the people who I deemed to be toxic out of my life, purely from general attitude and outlook towards life and things that it offers.
* Lessened my time significantly on social media.
* Apply for Business Administration Diploma branching into a Business Bachelor with an Accounting Major.
* Want to start going to the gym to get fit and stay healthy.
* I want to find a job that doesn't require qualifications (even though i'll be studying next year), I have this very stubborn dislike towards manual labor work but it's literally the only thing that someone like me can get at 24 with no qualifications.
* Make new friends who have positive outlooks and are successful.

**TL;DR - I'm a 24 year old and I've basically done fuck all with my life, realized that I was toxic rather than the people around me and have had a major attitude shift in realizing so, realized what I need to do and get done but don't know where to start and don't know how to push my stubbornness away.**",12Oct2018,1
303,"So, my friend is going through some serious issues at his workplace. He works as a sales rep for one of the Fortune 500 companies (food and beverage), and has been with them for 10 years. About 1.5 yrs ago the management in his zone (one city in Midwest) decided to change the system. The system didn't work from the launch, because the management has put waaaay too much pressure on the front line employees. Their zone business manager will not admit that the new system is failure and just keeps on ignoring all the actual problems that arose since the implementation of this new system, and he is blaming front line employees for absolutely everything. Because of that, the turn over rate is through the roof (about 35-40%). Employees are coming and going like it's a drive- through. All of this is being hidden from upper management (regional).
What I want to know is that if my friend sat down and wrote letters to upper management and let them know about everything that's been going on, and if he sent these letters without ""from"" address, how high are the chances for these letters reaching their destination? Who would be the best person to send these letters to (HR manager, customer service manager, regional manager himself, or someone else). 
Now keep in mind that multiple employees have already had meetings and conversations with the local zone manager, as well as HR, and absolutely nothing has been done to improve the situation; all they ever say is: ""If you don't think you can do this job, there's the door, just leave and find another job.""

308,"I'm the manager at a small company. There's no HR. It's just my boss and two managers, including myself, but one manager works at a time.

A few months ago we hired a new employee. When he got hired he would show up an hour or two before scheduled and just sit there on his phone. I would often be the only person working. When I told him he didnt have to get there so early he said he gets there early to avoid traffic. This behavior was eventually accepted by my boss. (He doesn't clock in until his scheduled time). 

Maybe a week or two after being hired and with minimal conversation between us two, he added me on Facebook. My name isnt common so I understand I'm easy to find, but I thought it was weird because I never told him my last name so he must have looked at our time sheets to find out my full name. I didnt think much of it at the time so I just accepted the request. He occasionally asks me work related questions, but a lot of it are questions he should ask our boss, not me because i have no control over it, and I've repeatedly told him. I've also seen that he has looked at my Instagram stories, but he doesnt follow me on instagram.

I dont know him very well and we havent become close, but I am polite and friendly at work. Yesterday he asked me to borrow $100 for an emergency. I felt bad, but I'm a student and I dont know him very well. Not even my boyfriend of 5 years would ask me for $100. I told him I'm really sorry but I have my own bill's and tuition to pay so I dont have an extra $100 to give.

I'm just really shocked that he would think it's ok to ask me, someone he doesnt know very well, for so much money (to me).

The Facebook adding, coming early, and Instagram stalking I can deal with. But asking me for $100 has made me even more uncomfortable at work. 

I dont know if I should bother telling my boss that he makes me uncomfortable or if I should just ignore it and move on. I dont know if I'm overreacting, but as a female I'm extra paranoid about odd situations. Will telling my boss what happened seem unprofessional?

So I have an opportunity to go to college to get a certificate for free. But I have a ton of fields to choose from. 

I can do HVAC, I can do accounting, i can do electrical, I can get a certificate in my current field which is warehouse, I can do nursing programs. 

I'm 26 female, average build, no kids, and I like working. Last year I fractured my dominant at work so I physically cant do everything I could be without my hand killing me. 

At the moment my job is easy, air conditioned, and it pays okay at 15 an hour. 

I am interested in HVAC because it pays at entry $20 and since I'm a female I think I'll get hired in this field pretty easily.  I dont want to do HVAC because it shows here and I really don't want to be outside during the snow or really cold weather for extended periods of time. Short periods are okay. And lifting extremely heavy objects could possibly hurt my hand. It appeals to me because theres job security and freedom, plus I get to learn something new. 

I always wanted to be an accountant because I think I'm good with numbers and I was looking into it prior to this opportunity. But I think theres a lot less demand for an accountant, for a new employee I feel like I wont get fulltime hours, theres more competition with people who actually have degrees vs a certificate, and they start out at about what I'm making now, $15. But the plus side is I will be inside I wont physically injury myself and the longer I do it the more secure my job will be.

I live in a 3rd world country, my family is dirt poor but my father has a somehow nice job (and good connections), but he spends most of his money on his hobbies while leaving us hungry. He also never takes responsibility for the fact that he gave birth to more than 5 children.

I'm 21 and I was studying engineering before I was forced to leave college because I could no longer afford it. In my last year, I even started walking miles daily instead of taking the bus but I eventually had to leave. I also had a lot of years ahead of me and despite being a good student (Top 3 in my highschool) I knew that I'll not be able to finish college.

My specific problem is that my family is highly abusive towards me, I'm basically an adult but I still get beaten regularly by my angry father (Serious violence) and my mother who used to be kind, started doing the same after being his wife for decades. 2 of my siblings managed to leave, but only due to luck. My parents treats me the worse and my other siblings actively try to make my life a living hell all because my parents regretted giving birth to me, so I'm living like I'm adopted. My community is also highly religious, and they also believe in extreme obedience to your parents, and I just can't do anything or fight back the physical abuse without being labeled as the wrong one, so I'll get kicked or and shunned from my neighborhood or worse, my family could kill me. I'm also abused emotionally daily by everyone in my family, not to mention how my siblings tell me to kill myself almost daily.

Being homeless is not an option, I'll either get killed by some random thug or gang (violence is rampant) or I'll die of hunger.

I used to work as a kid, but it was child labor and my father got paid, not me. Right now I'm working hard labor helping my father, but it's for free.

I also tried selling my blood or plasma, but you can only donate. I'd sell my kidney if I could leave my parents house and be independent, anything...

I've been also diagnosed with severe depression and I can't afford meds, I thought about resorting to crime, but it's highly immoral and wrong, and I can't hurt others who have nothing to do with my problems. My last resort was killing myself and I tried to a few times but I failed and I eventually gave up because I'm too scared. 

I haven't eaten in 3 days now and the only friend I got is gone, my post is just basically a last cry for help and advice on what to do.

I didn't came here to ask for money or anything, and I'm sorry if my post is wrong or if I bothered other people. I'm really sorry.",12Oct2018,1

My parents have been separated since I was 9 because he had an affair. Since then, I've pretty much only seen him on my birthday and Christmas every year with a few other visits in between. He's been with his ""mistress"" (I'll call her B) ever since. He's lied a lot before and I have minimal trust left as is. A few weeks ago he called my mom, crying, saying ""It's over. I can't live without you guys anymore. I've made up my mind and i'm calling it off with B."" My mom came home early and forced me to go with her to see him. When we got there he was completely fine and we didn't talk about it at all. At one point my mom and I both had to use the restroom and he took a phone call with his friend. I overheard him (he wasn't trying to be quiet or anything) talking about what happened. Apparently B was in Houston at the time with some other guy she had been talking to on Facebook (explicit/graphic conversations) and my dad said ""I've been lied to so many times, I don't know what to tell you."" Later he told us he was having the locks changed and that he had gotten his own bank account separate from hers. The rest of our evening was just us all hanging out. The other day my mom told me the last time she talked to him was about a week ago (they usually text almost every day) and he said B got back home 2 days after we went over there and she's been there ever since (about 2 weeks). So I don't know how to feel or if he lied or changed his mind? Why'd he make it out to be something it isn't (him missing us rather than B cheating)? My dad has a lot of health issues and is currently on dialysis which makes me feel bad, like I can't be mad at him or ask him about what happened/put any stress on him...If anyone reads this I'd love to know your thoughts and/or advice.",12Oct2018,1

Having a debt is a bad thing and people with debts on their financials are unable to manage their expenses effectively. There can be many reasons people stay in debt. Even in most cases, people realize that they are in debts and still don’t make effort to improve their financial positions.

**Keeping their Image:**

The most pertaining reason why people put up so much of debt is their need to keep up their image of a healthy and luxurious lifestyle. This is the foremost reason that shackles the person into the urge of keeping up his repute.

This results in people buying more than they can spend in terms of buying branded clothes, expensive housing, luxurious cars and other extravagant items. Moreover, people like this live their lives in the dilemma of impressing others with their outlook no matter what price they pay.

&amp;#x200B;

**Budget Mismanagement:**

Another issue for the people to stay in debt is their mismanagement for budgeting. Most of the time, it is their inability to focus on the budget they have formed, which results in excessive expenditures.

Moreover, people end up buying more than they are supposed to, think they will cover up with the next salary. However, with each month, the lag in the budget coordination increases and people end up in debts. If you want to know how to create an effective budget you can visit [**Free Debt Helpline**](http://www.freedebthelpline.org/) and get their services in managing your income and debts.

**The lack of Will to Compromise:**

We all are attracted to the luxuries. There is no denying that we usually end up spending more than our budget allows. But for the people who are in debts, they have a hard time compromising on spending more.

People are unable to resist the charms of the world and this affects their lifestyle as well. They focus on enjoying the current rather than building the future. This thinking and the inability to resist the expenses leads them to debts

In addition, people are often unable to compromise due to the pertaining wishes of the loved ones. A spouse or children may ask for an expensive gift this holiday, which makes it a priority over financial management.

**Incompetent Debt Planning:**

Another common problem is the ineffective management of the circumstances by the people when in debts. They are unable to stay calm during the situation, which results in further problems.

People lose hope when they see no results during their monthly payments, which makes them surrender to even more debts, ultimately ending in bankruptcy. Ineffective budget management can be more dangerous than taking up debts.

Which is why many debt management firms such as [**Free Debt Helpline**](http://www.freedebthelpline.org/) offer exceptional debt management services to help people organize their financials and get rid of the debts.

**Fruitless Management of Money:**

When in debts people are unable to make effective management for their money. They are unable to accept the fact that they should save because they are in debts, which results in their mismanagement due to the financial pressure.

In addition, people are unable to track their expenses as well as stay detracted from their budget. Their ineffective segregation of the expenses results in creating more financial pressure, resulting in more debts",12Oct2018,1
324,"I did pretty well on the first test but absolutely bombed the second one and I don’t know why. (Let’s just say it was ‘bathroom cry’ material)

It’s really bumming me out and I don’t know what to do about it. I guess I don’t know how to study for tests, I don’t know how to memorize stuff, and I thought I was completely prepared. This was a pretty hard slap in the face. 

I don’t know how to make myself feel better and “buckle up kiddo” probably won’t make it much better. 

I can’t fail my class or get a C in my major. That’s completely embarrassing. I’m already doing pretty poorly in physics (most hated subject, no joke) and so this will kill my GPA and therefore kill my scholarship. (Gotta keep a 3.0)

It’s giving me pretty hard panic attack fodder. This is basic chem 1341 and so if I can’t even get the basics right, how will I even get the rest right? I can’t teach (wanna be a teacher for chem) a subject I’m horrible at. 

What am I supposed to do besides “get good”? Maybe I’m mostly just looking for justification in my sadness but also knowing how to study is pretty important. I’ve tried flash cards, I’ve tried redoing the problems, I’ve tried watching videos but nothing works. I’m so confused. 

Thank you for basically reading a rant. I’m trying hard to stay positive but it’s still pretty hard to do so.

326,"Also posted to r/workadvice but I need as much input as I can get

tl;dr - I'm quitting my job with nothing lined up, I have 15k in savings, am I doing the right thing because of how bad I'm suffering?

Back story: I work in insurance. Our company has made severe cuts to associates working field claims, and centralizing everything into our department. We have about 200 people handling claims for all 46 states that we write policies in. We have been working 12 hour days, 6 days a week, 6-8 months of the year for the last three years. We are required to work these hours because it's ""in our contract"" technically. We've had two HR investigations into our working conditions; the second starting up about two weeks ago. They are the only ones that are explicit with us with what's going on behind the scenes. We were informed more cuts are coming, which means next year our work load is going to double, yet again.

I can't take the stress of this job anymore. Our expectations are unreachable. My health has taken such a severe hit. If I don't leave this company, I'll have a heart attack before I'm 30 (26 now).

I don't have another career lined up. I'm walking away from a 59k a year job with benefits, Plus 600-1,100 weekly bonus with all of the overtime we put it, but to hell with this fucking money. I have about 15k saved that I wanted to use for a house, but can't stand this fucking place for one more day.

328,"My sister has been dating this guy for about six months now.

I am absolutely disgusted by this situation. I have no idea what to do. I've told her to leave a million times, that she doesn't deserve this, but she keeps going back.

329,"  

I can’t tell if I’m going through some stupid impulsive I'm-in-my-twenties-phase or not. I am currently in my 4th year at school for music performance (I’m looking at about another 1.5-2 years). There's a TL;DR at the end! 

BACKGROUND: My mother gave birth to me when she was 15 years old and my dad was shithead so he was not in my life (until about 2 years ago, which, he is gone yet again). My grandparents raised me overseas in Japan so my mom could get her life together. I had a rough childhood, my grandmother was severely physically/emotionally abusive. I was bullied and I had NO friends. Child Protective Services got wind of the abuse and put a mandatory restraining order on my grandmother, so I was forced to live with my mom and step-dad. Turned out they were cocaine addicts and alcoholics and they too were abusive. I struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts throughout all of my childhood. We moved to Louisiana my junior year of high school, and things got even worse. Every day, I feared for my life coming home. I started dating a guy and his family helped me escape my abusive situation by getting me to move back to Colorado to live with my Dad’s side of the family.  I spent my senior year of high school working majority of the time for my own food, clothes, necessities, etc. I surprisingly graduated, my boyfriend proposed to me, convinced me to move back to Louisiana to go to school for music. LITTLE DID I KNOW that I was going to be engaged to an abusive/controlling narcissist for 4 years just to be discarded 6 months ago.

CURRENT SITUATION: 

I’ve gone through so much therapy and I’m BETTER but I feel out of place. I feel like I made mistake moving here with my ex-fiance. I love playing trombone but I feel like I’m just going through the motions just to get a degree. I want to teach and perform but the music building here is SO toxic. I see my ex every day, he’s still an asshole to me. The music building is notorious for being toxic/dramatic.  We have gone through a change of faculty and majority of our older musicians have transferred, dropped out, or failed. I don’t feel like I am getting better as a musician, I don’t feel challenged, everyone wants to watch someone else fail. I went from being excited to perform in every group to dropping all but 1 ensemble (and I’m only in that because I need it for scholarship). I’m considered one of the senior members at the music building but because I made a switch to the trombone so late, I feel behind. I’m on track academically but not with my skill so I 100% do not feel I will be ready for a graduate audition by the time I graduate. Of course anyone would love to play in a huge Philharmonic Orchestra but even my own professors told me they didn’t have a chance. Louisiana is all about jazz, my instrument is specifically for jazz or orchestra, and I don’t like playing jazz. I love teaching younger students but it is rare finding teaching gigs (not many children want to play a band instrument). The music I LOVE to listen to and would dream of playing doesn't match what I am studying. I want to pack up and move but I'm not sure if I should just finish out my degree (since I've already pulled $35,000 in loans). 

TL;DR: lived in abusive household, escaped to another abusive household, escaped that to be in another abusive household and go to school with my (ex)fiancé. I'm 1300 miles from my closest family member. 4 years into college with another 1.5-2 years left and now I can’t tell if I made the right/wrong choice coming here. Not sure what I want to do after I graduate anyway. I want to pack up and leave because of a “gut” feeling, but can’t tell if that gut feeling is just me having my 1st 21-year-old impulsive moment. Not sure if I should try to stick through the negativity for the next 2 years and get my degree then leave, or not. Can't tell if I'm depressed/feeling unfulfilled or this is what its like to be an adult. Part of me feels if I left/transferred, I wasted went through all this HELL in my life for nothing.

331,"I stumbled over this guy on insta and he lives in Berlin, like me. First I thought he was just a random pea-brained instagram hottie.

He is tall, sculpted body, gorgeous face with striking blue eyes, nice hair, sexy tasteful tattoos, trendy Berlin kinda sense of style. Basically looks like he was bred in a laboratory.

Then I went through his feed and saw a pic in scrubs, so I thought ""ah must be a nurse"", but when I read the caption I thought I was tripping. It said he's a **neurosurgeon.** *What????* How do you look like that and are a neurosurgeon on top of that?? How is that fair???

Suddenly I was overcome by this feeling of raging jealousy, I turned greeeen with envy. I usually don't care for these insta models and celebs, because they don't threaten me by merely being beautiful. In med school and since I can remember my parents have ingrained in me to always gun for academic excellence, so that's what I value first and foremost, everything else comes second.

The problem is when I see guys, especially gay ones, that trump me in both looks and success, I become miserable and feel like a failure in comparison. It's not that I begrudge them their luck, I just want what they have, too. Seeing this perfect guy embody everything I ever wanted makes me feel like total crap, because I'm not there and might never be if I fail.

I would definitely need to bulk up big time (instead of looking twinky) and put a shit ton of effort into my appearance to even remotely match his beauty and I'm still in school while he's already a fucking neurosurgeon that looks like he jumped out of a Grey's Anatomy episode.

332,"Help. I need advice. Here’s a brief backstory - I was with my girlfriend for just over 3 years. I was pretty confident she was the one that I’d spend the rest of my life with. We were inseparable. Lovers &amp; best friends. 6 months before we split up we had a serious car accident where we could’ve lost our lives. After that day my anxiety went through the roof. I was crippled with anxiety everywhere I went. We stopped doing things together because I was too anxious to leave the house. She started staying out most nights, all night drinking with her friends from work. I don’t think she cheated on me. She’s always been a heavy drinker. It just got worse after the accident. I lost my patience with it as my anxiety worsened. She would drink every day, sometimes starting in the afternoon. She’d wet the bed etc. Ultimately the day we broke up I was getting ready for work &amp; she started drinking gin at 2pm. I shouted down to her “are you drinking already?” She shouted back up “it’s fine babe” anyway, I came down to leave for work &amp; we had an argument about it. I went to work seriously upset because I’d had enough of her drinking. We were no longer intimate because her being drunk was a turn off. I never stopped wanting her. I just wanted her to stop. I got sent home from work &amp; I told her I thought she had a serious alcohol problem. At that moment she turned around &amp; told me she wasn’t happy anymore, that she wanted to break up. I was shocked, broken. Heartbroken. I never expected her to break up with me. After a messy break up in January we have been on/off in contact throughout the months. We have seen one another &amp; talked about everything. I’ve made it clear throughout that I wanted to work things out. Since January she has been so hot &amp; cold. One day I get so much false hope, the next day she’s cold as ice. She’s blocked/unblocked me about 4 times this year. I had my Birthday on Tuesday. She sent me a shitty Happy Birthday GIF &amp; it ruined my day. I expected more. It upset me the whole day. Next day I asked her about a guy friend she’d been taking to Family parties (she’s a lesbian, we were a lesbian couple) I asked if he was gay &amp; she said “wtf, why does it matter if he’s gay or not” next thing I know, before I could reply, I’d been blocked. Again. I was destroyed. I’ve had my emotions played with since we broke up in January &amp; I can’t take it anymore. I’m so depressed that she’s blocked me again.

333,"Hello reddit,

I just started art school this week. I was looking forward to it and am still pretty exited about going there every day. I just have a hard time fitting in. Sometimes I feel like I only got there by accident.

First of all I'm at least 2 years younger than most of the other freshmen. I have less life experience and just came out of highschool, while some of the others have been active in the underground art scene for years.

The major issue I have is lack of knowledge. I don't know anything about art history or theory. I went to a tech-oriented highschool and only started painting because of a depression counseling-group I was forced to visit in my teens. The therapist suggested to find purpose in the activities one enjoyed as a kid. After that I painted stuff for myself and made little sculptures from thrash. Most guys I met here so far, went to an art-orientated high school and are more of the hipster type. They know so many exhibitions and constantly geek about artists. Nothing wrong with that, but I feel sad and dumb in comparison.

I know I need to increase my knowledge and I'm reading a book about art history to make up for my lack of scholar experience. I'm trying to see as many exhibitions as I can, but I still need to get used to it. I come from a sad little town where nothing ever happened, so I'm a bit overwhelmed by the lush culture of my new city.

Does anyone understand me? Can I even make it? It's the first week and I'm struggling, but it's also too early to draw hard conclusions, right?",12Oct2018,1

343," 

I was very recently terminated from my job during the probationary period. Their reasoning behind it was I wasn’t meeting perforce standards and lacked engagment with my work and other people. I know for a fact this is false, as the day before I had a one-on-one with my boss and everything seemed ok. She was planning on setting me up with a company phone and was talking about what was happening in the coming weeks. But I’m positive that the real reason was because they knew I was very unhappy working there. My boss consistently asked me if I liked my job to the point where I just told her the truth. She brought in HR which brought everything to light about it with them. I told HR the same thing, that I was unhappy, etc... I shouldn’t have told them that if I wanted to keep my job, but I wasn’t planning on keeping it. I was constantly searching job boards and sending out resumes to get out of there. I was even highly considering just quitting and getting a retail job during the holidays and continuing to look for a more long-term solution. To me it seems like they pulled a “you can’t quit, you’re fired”, or just didn’t want to waste and more time/money on me.

Main problem is, I just got a phone call from a company that I’ve been wanting to be at for a while now. I have an interview there next week and everything seems great. Except the fact that they still think I work at the place that just fired me. I’m really debating if I should just say that I quit. It is true that I was going to leave any day any way. They just expedited the process and lied about the real reason. I was also just not mentally myself either and working there was really messing with me. This situation is my fault, I already have taken a lot out from it. But I’m honestly glad that I don’t work there anymore.

Is saying I quit because I was extremely unhappy the right way to go? Should I take a different approach? I didn't sign anything about the termination so does that mean I can still technically quit? Any advice is welcomed.",12Oct2018,1
344,"Hi all,

I recently got taken into a sort of leadership post in university that organises a raft race each year.

There is a hut trip with the approximately 15 that are both the old team and the new one (renews each year) over the weekend starting the 2nd November.

About 10 minutes after I sent an email confirming I would take the post I found out that there is a Christmas thing then with the swing dancing group I have become part of and I am now really regretting both not checking an hour earlier and often get that sort of sinking, wrenching feeling of regret in my stomach. This seems to be souring the interest I had for the leader post in the short term.

I was just wondering if I'd be an asshole to ask to change the date of the hut trip or ask if I can go a bit earlier?
Or even just go for a single night.

I really would like to go to the swing ball because it's with all the people I know from the beginner course and I feel like it's something I'll miss out on terribly if I don't go and regret a lot.

I'm also wondering if I'm just going to have to think that I said I'd go there before I said I'd go to the swing ball.

Is there a way to explain that I have a very big interest in the committee but it's really important to me to go to this ball without coming off as a blow-off douche?

If so, how should I go about this all?",12Oct2018,1
345,"So I'm at a point in my life where I chnaged from being very a very negative outlook kinda guy to doing a 180 degree switch to living my best life by taking a summer to reflect on my self and what I want because I was so tired of complaining about all that has gone wrong in my life. Now I have a really strong and close circle of friends I'm getting good grades I'm in a good school my family life is relatively stable compared to what it was and I've found an amazing girl that I'm seeing currently. But I constantly don't feel like I'm doing enough and when I get some down time on my own, I get stressed and tired and I feel so drained all of a sudden. The time alone that I used to value so much now just gives me more stress because I always feel like I should be doing more (I'm prone to worrying about alot) and at the same time I'm tired and feeling drained.

&amp;#x200B;

So it started 2 weeks ago, an old friend of mine got into our group. To describe him he is good looking with loads of money and a very nice car. My best friend sees him as a threat and tries to keep him away from his girlfriend. 

He got jelous because they are sending eachother texts and saw them together in a car. The story behind is that she was waiting for me to drink a coffee and have a talk, while waiting for me she sit in his car because she was cold. Best friend was working and saw them in the car as he passed them and felt treason. Currently they are fighting because of him and she tries to calmly explain the situation to him but he doesn't listen and he is calling her a liar.

Unbeknownst to me, it ended up in my medical records. I recently gave birth to another child and a social worker visited me in the hospital to check how things are. I told the truth; things are good now, nothing further has happened and my children were not present for that one incident. She seemed satisfied and left.

He's always been like this ever since he was a small child. He's very quiet in school (His teachers have told us that he's quiet) and around relatives he doesn't see very often, but he's very talkative at home and around his cousins that he's close to.

I wish he was this talkative around everyone. I've told him, ""As much as you talk around us, you can do the same with everyone else."" He listens, but doesn't say anything.

I always ask him who do you hang out with in school? He tells me he has friends in school. I don't understand why he doesn't see them or talk to them outside of school.

I've always tried to encourage him to get to know the kids in our neighborhood, but he always refused.

No one except for his cousins come over to visit him.

I want him to have relationships with people outside of his family. I don't want him growing up becoming a recluse or alone. It can be a very miserable way to live.

- Throughout my school and college career, I’ve always been an on and off person when it comes to attendance, but that’s because I just didn’t care.

Now, I have a amazing opportunity to get my DREAM JOB, which I’ll be doing training and based of my performance, attendance and behaviour will all dictate if I get it or not.

I want this... I’ve wanted this so bad and have been enthusiastic since this opportunity arose. (Time really does go slow down when you’re looking forward to something haha :,))

351,"My best friend's mother has stage 4 ovarian cancer. Lucky she is so far responding well enough to chemo and is a strong woman over all, but the 5 year percentage survival rate of people with stage 4 ovarian cancer leads me to believe it wouldn't hurt for me to be ready for anything.

Her mother is the most important person in her life, but she doesn't really get along with the rest of her family, so I may be among her only support. My friend is quite emotional over all and has responded poorly to other emotional issues in the past. (break-ups, stress of college, ect.)

To make matters worse, since cancer treatment is quite expensive, as well as the worst would mean the family would lose the income the mother brings in, it's unlikely that she would be able to afford a professional therapist for some time.

Is there something that could help me to be as helpful as possible if the worst happens? Can you give me tips on how to be a good friend to someone grieving? What are some things to avoid or watch out for? Really any advice in general would be appreciated. Thanks  ",12Oct2018,1

354,"There's a long backstory that I've posted before (under this account, so you can look at my limited post history if you want it). TL;DR: I've had a crush on this girl since around May and we've been pretty much best friends since around April. I told her I liked her, she was fine with it and we stayed best friends. On three separate occasions, I asked her if she wanted to hang out with me, each time she ignored me. Finally, she told me she wanted to hang out with me but would never find time to actually hang out with me, despite finding time to hang out with other people who ended up treating her like shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I put misunderstanding in the title because he wasn't really an argument, at least I don't think so. Basically, I texted her exactly how I was feeling and that I felt like sometimes she didn't care about me, that I just wanted to get to know her better (honest to God truth).  I told her in the text that it seemed like she didn't really have any intention to hang out with me, and she said that she didn't have intentions to hang out with any coworkers and that it just happens. According to someone else that she told, she thought I was being jealous and angry at her. Therefore, she was pissed off at me. Honestly, I may have been a tad jealous, but I know for sure I wasn't angry. I would never get angry at her.

That was on Monday. On Tuesday, we worked together and she literally said nothing to me all day. She made a point of ignoring me and walking away from me whenever I went anywhere near her (and I was not trying to follow her around or anything, but, being that we work in the same department, our paths cross quite often). That night I texted her a long apology without trying to make it sound like I blamed her and she didn't even respond to it. Wednesday she texted me that she needed to ask me something work related, then called me because I apparently didn't answer fast enough (honestly, I was going to respond to it, I was just letting it go for a little bit before answering so she didn't think that I was just sitting around waiting for her to text me). She said something about me not answering her text but answering her call, and I just immediately thought about how she ignored my text the night before but didn't say anything. Then, she texts me later to do something for her at work since she didn't work that day. Yesterday, she doesn't text me and I was just letting her have some space to calm down a little bit. Today, I texted her asking how she's feeling (just in a general way, which I do all the time), and she hasn't answered me after almost 3 hours, so I'm taking it she doesn't want to talk to me still.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, I talk to someone else about this that lives 2000 miles away, and she says that I'm better off without this girl and that I deserve better, etc. Deep down, I know that she's right. On the other hand, I've talked to this girl the last 6 months almost every single day and we've been best friends. Now, after this one stupid little 'argument,' she's willing to just throw away all we've been through. Should I just move on and just not care about her anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short me and this guy that were in the same class in highschool (but didn't hang out much) got into the same college. We have the same classes.

All was well until a while ago but today it got worse. I went in the classroom and he was already sitting there with this girl that tags along with our group. No problem, i sit alone and some girl I don't know sits down next to me.

The next class the tables had only 4 seats. They all sat down and my friend told me to sit behind them. I got a little pissed because the day before one of the girls of the group came late and her friend sat with her so she won't sit alone. But my friend didn't do that with me. 

I asked him why he just left me like that and he openly admit he sees all of us the same (even though he barely knows 2 of them) and openly admit he doesn't care about anyone. A while ago he told me he was only polite to people so they can see him as nice and friendly when really, he only has interest in you when he needs something.

He also told me ""i've never texted this much with anyone"" and we exchanged like 10 texts or something. He said he's ok with whatever, whether we talk or not.

365,"So I got a puppy a week ago and it was okay with all my roommates. However one of my roommates, let’s call her Tia is really overstepping my boundaries. 

A little background info: Tia has been wanting to get a puppy but can’t really afford it. She also worked in a kennel for a short time period, so she thinks she’s an expert on all things puppies. She also doesn’t have a job and from what I seen isn’t great with any money she does have. 

Now to the problem. She took my puppy to a free vet while I was at work. I asked her not to buy anything. I appreciated her taking my dog to the vet but she ended up spending 35 dollars on a shot she did NOT need and another 30 on a harness when I already bought her one. I found this super annoying but was just going to pay her back for it later and not make it an issue. 

However now she has decided she NEEDS the money tonight for some very last minute thing. I honestly don’t have the money to give her. I budgeted for the dog and knew this month would be a little tight. I did not plan for her spending extra money on not needed things and expecting money back. I’ll pay her back eventually (in a few days when I can). But I feel like I’m not in the wrong here, how do I handle this? 

To add to some knowledge around the situation, she’s already pushed me into buying tons of things the dog doesn’t need. When we were at petco she literally was throwing stuff in the cart. I haven’t really confronted her yet and I don’t want to hurt her feelings or ruin plans. But it really was her choice to buy things when I said not to. ",12Oct2018,1
367,"Heya fellas, it's your average sausage fingers broadcasting live from the middle of nowhere yet again. 

This time my request is a bit different though. I basically just started college and I have to say that I already feel extremely uncomfortable. But alas, let's start with the main issue here. I'm fat. I weigh around 93kg(205 pounds) and I'm around 1.82m (6ft) tall. I worked on losing weight and all of that and I did manage to change quite a bit over the course of 5 hard earned months working in retail(I lost around 10kg), but I still felt extremely uncomfortable around people and all of that. I've never been a sociable person, I legit spent 4 years of high school looking at people rather than talking to em. So, I decided that once I got into college I would change that. 

Fast forward to about two weeks ago when college did start and I completely changed my attitude. I talk with everyone that even bats an eye at me and every time I say I'm socially awkward they dismiss my comment as a joke and say that I'm extremely extroverted. 

So, now I'm dealing with another problem. A lot of attention from girls. Now, the real problem is that I've never been a flirter or anything remote to that, and I do own a position of power (I write the list of attendees and all of that) and a lot of the time I laugh and make jokes with the girls in my class. 2 of them, to be precise, have been acting a bit too friendly, but I legit cant tell if they're a) doing it because they actually are interested in me b) doing it because they want to be nice to me to take advantage of me or c) they're just mocking me.

It may sound stupid but I legit cant tell since I've been a basement dweller for most of my childhood. So how can I really tell without actually coming off as a creep?

Here is a pic of me from around 6 months ago and one I took 2 days ago (the recent one is the one in which I'm wearing my glasses). https://imgur.com/a/MmeEFPs 

I hope this is allowed and that I dont seem too weird. The 2 girls that I'm talking about have even made references about how ""oh boys from this town dont get it when you're flirting with them"" and I sort of dismissively ignored the awkwardness by going ""yeah I know. I've been trying for ages now"" and such.

369,"Hello all, this is long, but please bear with me. I need your advice.

I’m (25) currently working at a job where I’ve been for almost 9 years. During this time I studied and was mostly in a part time position. About a year ago I wanted to get a full time offer at this company, but seeing as it never came I started planning to continue studying and going somewhere else to live (change of atmosphere was/is important for me). 

Fast forward to now, my part time contract is up in January and I already have plans to travel for about 2-3 months at least to be able to find a place where I want to live and stay in as well as to “find myself” with some fresh experiences.  Now as my contract is ending they have offered me a full time position. One year ago this would have been amazing news, now it’s causing internal conflict for me and I’m feeling sad to give up my travel time.

I feel dumb to think that I might consider declining their job offer when jobs are hard to come by and I would like a job as well. I just feel that the timing is off and need a change in my life.

I’d like to note that I had left a rocky relationship recently was actually wanting and looking forward to a change in atmosphere and people. I was getting used to the idea of leaving and have been preparing my “goodbye” for a while now.

I’m very confused not as to what I should do. On one hand I’m being offered a nice job at a place that I already know I like with decent pay. However, on the other hand emotionally I need a change in my life and don’t want to stay in this company forever.

I also don’t want to stay in my current city and that’s why I want to travel to find a “new” place to live/work.

I’m young and don’t want to waste anymore time. Every decision I make now I feel is important.
I’m an apprehensive person and change is hard for me, so with my contract ending I was looking forward to being forced to change.

Any advice is appreciated.",12Oct2018,1

We talked, we laughed, drank some more, I got her name (FB contact) ... Then I left to the toilet and a smoke (15 min), and after that I don't remember much ...

So the next day, yes there was a hangover :) And in the afternoon I opened my phone and I saw a note with her name ... I added her on FB and she responded almost instantly... I also had a strange feeling that I saw her kissing with some dude, but as I said, I was drunk as fuck, so I said to myself, myNAME you were wasted AF and you cant be 100% sure, so leave it.

OK, so the long story short, we immediately connected, FB chat was great, so we went for a couple of really long walks (3-4h), talking to her is amazing, she is cute and funny, we are constantly texting ....

BUT, BUT:) on our last walk the old bug was really bothering me, so I asked her: Did you kiss with some dude after I went out the night we met? And she replied: ""YES, I tough you were gone, I was drunk and ...""

So, what would you do?

Would you erase her from your life?

Would you still see her and try to get her in a bed and then dump her?

Would you completely ignore that kiss and try to have a normal relationship with her?

The 8:30 goes to the lead and basically just talks with her friends a day walking around complaining that the 3 11:30s aren’t doing well enough


The 3 11:30s do literally everything
Restock everything, clean everything 

I feel like morning crew could absolutely do some more stuff but the evening crew never seems to have a say.. 
8:30 is now micromanaging and telling some of the morning crew to “check that we have done stuff and tell us to do it” 

She is constantly texting a few select people asking them “how the day is going and how the other people are doing” and if the answer doesn’t please her she starts texting then”others” asking why they aren’t doing as told(note:person 1 isn’t the boss) and example is:

I was working with A on a Sunday, it’s only us two and 8:30 texts A (I don’t know what) and suddenly I get an angry text as to why I’m not following As orders and how the weekends have not been doing well enough. A has been there way less time than I, A is in no way shape or form my boss, lead or anyone in a position that should be telling me what to do. (I didn’t even work those weekends) 

At this point I want to quit. That manager is making working there a misery.. she gets to sit around chatting with her friends and yells at me when I ask an employee a question.

Being back home is making me feel really lonely and I miss my friends I left back in my last city.

As I’ve gotten to know more and more about her I tend to compliment her but she doesn’t really like it because it makes her feel awkward so I’ve tried my best to control the amount I do. We would talk almost daily, for long periods of time (the longest we’ve had was about 14 hours). 

Anyways we have been talking for what is almost three months and for the past three weeks we have grown rather distant. I have a terrible issue where I get attached to someone very easily so I’ve been trying to control myself. I sometimes have to this urge to make a confession to her which I know would put her off me forever. 

How can I control these urges of attention from her? What is my best approach to this as I don’t want to let her get away?

406,"Hey guys. So I'm your classic 22 year old friendless male virgin. I am/was an incel / foreveralone/ loveshy/ whatever other term you want to use. 

I met a girl recently and things are progressing. I'm trying to not get too optimistic but there is a chance that she likes me back. 

I have some questions about sex. We went on two dates already and we got intimate-ish (cuddling) and I feel like I could be losing my virginity soon and I don't want to mess it up so I have some questions. First how should I be for the first time? We talked a bit and she told me she likes it a bit rough with choking, slapping, pulling etc. However, when I am envisioning being in bed with her, I just want to be really nice and gentle with her. Like kissing her everywhere and slowly, making sure to eat her out, making sure to embrace her, etc. Is this a bad idea? I think I also would like to be rough to a girl, but for the first time, I want to treat her very gently since I like her a lot. Is this going to be a turn off? I know variety is very important and if we ever get into a successful relationship, we will probably have a lot of sex, some rough some gently, I'm just afraid that if for the first time I am really caring to her it's like I'll lock myself in that beta role and she will be very turned off (even if it's subconsciously).  Should I ask her if she has ever orgasmed before? I know a lot of girls haven't, but I don't know if its a good question to ask since if she says yes I would be like oh &lt;.&lt; and then if I can't make her orgasm I will feel very emasculated, and if she says no, I don't want it to become this weird thing where I am trying to be the first person she has an orgasm with and it turns it into an obstacle course rather than an experience. 

Here is my full plan for the first time. First I want to start by making out with her. We will do that for a few minutes until the anxiety wears off and we feel comfortable with each other. Then I will continue my kissing down along her body, kissing her neck, collarbone, shoulders, breasts, stomach, thighs, etc. How long should I spend kissing random parts of her body? I think the important thing about this part is to really be in the moment and try to enjoy it and not think about what body part I should be kissing next because that would make it feel rushed. Eventually I would reach her vagina and start eating her out. At some point, hopefully when she is turned on enough, we will transition to actual intercourse. This is the plan I have come up with after watching a ton of porn and never interacting with real girls so tell me if its bad. I've also only really planned out the first half. Am I already messing everything up by overanalyzing everything and trying to come up with a minute by minute plan days/weeks in advance? I wish I could take a chill pill... but this is just how I'm built.  

I have some questions about kissing. When we went on our most recent date, we tried kissing for the first time, keyword being tried. I am really bad at it. Like we both could tell I was bad at it and we kept trying to restart but I could not get the hang of it. She even told me I was really bad, but she said she would help me practice. How do you kiss? It wasn't coming naturally to me at all. Maybe I was too nervous. She said I was going too fast. Does anybody have any pointers? I just don't know what to do at all. 

I have some questions about girls.  I really just mostly don't understand them. From my very tiny experience with girls, I think I finally understand what people mean when they say ""just be confident, brah"". People like people who are in control (or at-least who look like they are in control) everyone is lost and wandering through life and if they see someone who appears to have a grasp on himself and his surroundings, they will be attracted to that. So what that means is that everyone will match you. If you sit next to a girl and act meek and scared because you are not sure if she finds you attractive, she will reciprocate. If you act warm and confident and put your hand around her and bring her in closer, she will reciprocate. But there are still so much I don't understand about girls. I have so many questions.

Like do girls secretly (subconsciously) dislike it when you are nice or caring? Do they want you to be constantly aloof? Do girls like having a feeling that you wont cheat on them, but you could? I've been giving off a lot of lovely vibes and I don't know if its hurting or helping. Like I think she knows I won't cheat on her, but only because I can't since I don't talk to other girls. Will she secretly like it if I talk flirt with other girls? How can I tell if a girl is physically attracted to me? Do girls like it when you call them beautiful? I just don't know if I should be genuine and shower her with all my love and affection or if I should be a bit reserved and try to be a bit mysterious? I feel like even though we got really close, we still aren't really comfortable with each other, and a lot of that is my fault since I am not comfortable with myself inside my own skin and people match whatever vibe you put out (the whole confidence thing). 

One big problem for me is that I'm a much better person over the internet then I am in real life. In real life I am very nervous and anxious and a lot of times the words come out all wrong but on the internet I can be funny and witty and interesting. One big problem for me is that my brain is constantly spinning, so leading up to whenever we hang out I have all these elaborate conversations with funny jokes in my head between me and her to try to find things to talk about and so that there isn't any awkward silence. But then in real life  when we meet a few hours later, it doesn't really happen... I don't know if it's because I get nervous or its because I already talked to her for like 2 hours, just in my head, so all the conversation is ""used up"" if you know what I mean. How do I always have something to talk with her about? Sometimes I ask her how her day went or if she did anything interesting this past day/week but those aren't really fruit-full. Maybe the reason why we can't like find a conversational common ground is because there are some things between us that are unsaid so like I am always thinking about the unsaid thing instead of thinking up interesting topics of conversation. And since I can't really talk to her about the unsaid things since they are unsaid for a reason, it leads to awkward convos. Should I just ask her all the unsaid questions I have for her? It's very insecure stuff like does she find me physically attractive, does she like hanging out with me, **why did she keep ghosting me all those times**, does she really want to hang out with me or is she doing it out of pity/niceness, what does she really think about me. It's really hard for me to read her and understand what she is really feeling deep inside. I think the best course of action is to banish all these thought gremlins from my head and just assume she is into me and she wants to be here, but it is easier said than done. I am worried that there is a chance I already fucked it all up by being super weird on the first two dates and over text, but if she gives me more chances I will try to me a lot more cool, calm, and collected, and most importantly, confident. How often should we be texting in between meet ups? Is every two people different?Should I try to be showing her that I really like her or should I play it a little easy for a while?


Sorry I know this is a lot, if anybody could help with any of it, I would greatly appreciate it. How do I navigate these waters? ",12Oct2018,1

411,"Hello. Hopefully I am posting this in the right place but I don’t see how I couldn’t be. Sorry if this is all over the place I can’t collect my thoughts. 

I (19F) recently (as of this past week) started working for a lady (73F) because she needed help organizing her new apartment in a senior care facility to look nice for a “TV interview” she has coming up. 

At first, I didn’t really question anything because she has a PhD and works on many books in her free time. However, the more time I spent with her, the more I realized she is kind of looney. First she tried to get me to invest in some pyramid scheme for CBD oil and from then on out she has just been showing signs of not being all there. 

Yesterday she was talking to me about how her face will be on the cover of every magazine and she will receive millions because of this interview so I decided to do a little research. It’s a huge scam by people who claim to be CUTV News producers in NY(Doug Llewelyn and some Tom guy) but are really just scammers.  

I don’t know what to do. She won’t listen to anyone who tells her to be careful, she gets mad when other people try to help her.  Can I call the police? Any lawyers know anything? She has already sent about $5000 and signed a contract this morning. 

I spoke to the manager at the senior home and she said it’s an independent living facility so she doesn’t have to get involved - but did try to talk to this lady who ended up getting very defensive and mad.

413,"(I'm M, 17) Why is literally every single woman is indecisive? Never knowing who to want, when to want, what to want... it can be so frustrating. All girls want to do is be ignored and have their opinions validated. It's nonsensical. Why is that somehow the best trait in a guy? He can be really funny, random, handsome, and just all and all fun to be around... but if he doesn't place something else like hanging out with friends, skateboarding, studying, working, etc. above you then he's not attractive. 

If you are the first thing on his mind, he treats you well, he wants to hang out, he wants to do things, etc. then he's not worth your time. How is idolizing someone else healthy? Idolizing them for the wrong reasons too... the more you act like you don't care about a girl the more intruiged she becomes and the more her emotions just go wild for you. You have to play these bullshit games in order to actually get a girl interested and I can't stand it.

What happened to decency? Girls used to love when guys pursued them but now it's all like a game. There is no actual intentions or interest until someone is rude to you. Whether that is ignoring them, acting like you don't care about them/not focusing on them when you're together, or just being blatantly disrespectful. ""Oh my god that's so hot"". Since when? Why? Why is unattractive for 2 people to actually just like one another and be plain about it? 

Some of you are bound to say, ""Oh that's just high school"". It's not. If it is then explain the ever-growing hookup culture, explain the highest divorce rate ever (Around 56% I believe), explain the record depression numbers, explain those who stay together simply because of children, explain those who simply don't want to be lonley... There is no explanation other than a failing society. What'll be great for the U.S.? Aha I know it, no societal standards so everyone can just be an asshole and get praised for it. 

It seems like the game never changes. In order to gain any traction and actually have something substantial you have to hold in your own feelings, or be fake, or just ignore the fucking person which isn't okay. Why have we come to this place where it's more common to be a ""thing"" than have an actual relationship? Why is that just brushed off as if it's okay? It's not okay. People think that you need to get into all these relationships/things/fwb that you know aren't going to work out simply to find out later it didn't fucking work out and feel that pain. That's the thing most of us know this shit so why do we subject ourselves to the pain? 

Why do we continue to play the game when we know it's wrong and we're wrong for doing it? Because it's normal. If people are up front about themselves it's deemed as weird and unattractive. Ughhh... I just Idek anymore.

I'm sorry to whoever reads this... I have just been really into this girl lately. She has this curly brown hair that I swear glows. When she smiles at me it literally makes it hard for me to think... She's gorgeous. Even better she has this great personality. She's usually random and fun to be with because she's funny, kind, and just sorta calm yet energized. I don't know, she's hard to explain. Especially since she's bipolar and can be the happiest person you've ever met one day and the saddest the next. She told me she likes me but ""isn't ready for a relationship yet"". She supposedly loves someone who gives her little to no attention though (no they're not dating). 

I don't know when to quit I suppose... It feels like I'm being led on half the time and the other half it feels like we should be together. I feel like I'm on the backburner though. l'll just be cooking if she decides she's still hungry, wants something else after all, or just messed up the first meal (analogies am I right?). It's fucking awful. I don't know what I should do, I don't want to just leave her be because she has all these problems and that eats at me because I want to help her. She acts dumb but is actually really smart and so it pains me when I see her drinking herself to death and cutting. Yeah, Idk. I'm sure all of you will tell me it's not healthy, it's not my burden, etc. but I truly care about her and sort of feel an obligation to help those I care for. So, fuck my happiness I guess.

414,"I'm a doctor. I'm finishing my residency now. It has been a dream for a long, long time. I'm about to pursue further training called a fellowship, and have reached a fork in the road. So we're all on the same page, the path of doctorhood in the US goes like this:

College-&gt;Med school-&gt;Residency-&gt;Fellowship (optional)

For fellowship I have been interviewing at some places with VERY high prestige factor. Ivy league institutions. The kinds of places that if their name is associated with your name, doors magically open for you in the future (trust me, it's like that). And of course they have excellent funding so you can do cool research, mentioning nothing of the training to make you become the kind of doctor you want to be. So that's choice number one.

Choice number two is a non ivy, but still very well funded with excellent training (does have SOME recognition). Choice two offers a unique opportunity to get in at the ground level of a new technology, something I have been aware of for years and years that has only now been gaining speed. My interest in this technology blossomed when I first decided to pursue med school, that's how long it's been. And it's a strange coincidence -fate?- that the year I am applying for fellowship is also the very year this is finally getting off the ground. There is funding, there are faculty who will do the research. So I could be one of the guys that ends up knowing the most about this and be in a very nice position if it takes off in the future.

The risks: if I go with choice one, it's a safer bet. I get the name, I finish the training, and I basically do whatever I want. But I miss the opportunity on being involved with my tech because none of the ivies are doing it (yet). I miss the opportunity of basically godfathering it.

If I go with choice two, I take the risk. I do research in this new field, but if it doesn't take off in the future then I will have bypassed an ivy for no good reason.

419,"Hi,

I try to keep this short, but it's a pretty complicated story - I'd appreciate any kind of advice. Backstory: My sister (now 35) never got along with my mom. She dropped out of school at 18, moved to another country and lived there for several years. She always blamed my mom for her failures and said that she made many mistakes in her parenting. They would get along quite well with each other but once in a while they'd have their indifferences. A few years later, my sister moved back to her home country but still quite far from home. She saw my parents maybe 1 or sometimes 2 times a year. My mom always dreamed of having a grandchild, but had low hopes because my sister hated children and always made it clear that never ever would she get children, and I can't get children for different reasons.

My mom was overwhelmed with joy when my sister got pregnant at the end of last year. I thought she would get an abortion for sure, but in the end she gave birth to a healthy child 2 months ago. Of course, my parents immediately drove there (4 hour drive) after birth to see their grandchild. It turned out that my sister was VERY protective of her baby and didn't even want to let my parents hold her in their arms at first. After a few hours, they were allowed to briefly hold her though.

We both grew up in a very small town, but my sister was never really happy there and thus lived in large cities. In the last few years, she slowly transformed her lifestyle and started eating organic food almost exclusively, learned to love nature, avoided flying with airplanes because of the pollution, etc. Long story short, they moved to the countryside 3 weeks ago. This was when my parents saw her baby for the second time, as they drove to them again to help with their relocation for 2 days.

Unfortunately, they had a water damage in their new home and thus had to stay at my parents' home (where they've now been since 3 weeks). As always, they got along quite well with each other, apart from some minor indifferences. For example, overly protective as my sister is, she never lets her baby alone - my mom wasn't allowed to take her for a walk alone, for example.

Today, my mom called me today crying, asking if I could pick her up (I live a 30 minute car ride away from her). Turns out that they had a pretty bad fight today. The baby always slept relatively well but last night, she was crying a lot. In the morning, my Mom asked her what was wrong with her and my sister said that her baby had digestion issues because she wasn't eating purely organic food. While my mom tried to exclusively buy organic food, some spices and oils were not organic. However, when they still lived in their old apartment, my sister would sometimes order food online which wasn't always fully organic either. My mom tried to argue about this with my sister and the fight escalated. My sister then said that they would drive to their new home tomorrow and that my parents could then never see their grandchild again.

As my mom is extremely sensitive, she started crying. My sister then said that she just wanted to play the victim now and told her boyfriend how she was often doing this. This is when she left the home and called me. My mom threatened to kill herself before and suffers from depression (as does my sister) so I obviously picked her up. She is now sleeping at my home for a night and luckily, I was able to calm her down at least a little bit. She told me about several problems that she had with my sister in the past days:

 \- My mom wasn't allowed to use any cleaning agents, the vacuum or hairspray

 \- She is super sad that my sister never asks her for advice or if she gives advice, that she says it's wrong

 \- My sister again blamed her that she failed at parenting of her and me 

I don't know how I can help any further now. I sincerely wish that my mom and sister could get along with each other and that my mom is able to see her grandchild grow up. Does anybody have any advice for me?",12Oct2018,1

423,"A bit of backstory; I'm currently 21 years old and grew up and lived my whole life in a fairly middle-class area of SoCal. I graduated from HS in 2015 and spent the next 3 years at a community college where I ended up getting my Associates Degree in Business earlier this Spring. I applied to other schools in California to pursue a Bachelors in Data Science, and did get into a few schools, but they were pretty basic public colleges.

At the time, the thought of going to a regular C-tier college and getting my degree and doing the same thing as everyone else didn't seem to interest me too much, so I started looking at other options. Coincidentally, at this time, one of my friends who lived in Pennsylvania was looking for a roommate and it intrigued me, so I decided to look up if there were any decent schools near him. Eventually, I applied and was accepted to one near him and we got a house out there. 

My current situation right now is that I am rooming with him and going to this college pursuing my Bachelor's degree. This doesn't sound all bad, but I am absolutely losing my mind out here. My friend is not the problem, we actually get along very well; however, the town we live in, the dangerous city my school is in, the commute to school, the amount of farmland, the weather, the people, and pretty much every other discernible socioeconomic difference that exists between here and SoCal is just too much for me to handle. I absolutely cannot stand it here. 

So, I ask, what the hell do I do? I am still enrolled in the school and I 100% plan to complete the school year (the lease is until next summer anyways), but after that I need to get out of this state. The problem is that I just don't know where to go. I have three options in mind that I can think of. The first would be to go back to California and go to school there, but I got my driver's license in PA and changed my address and everything and I'm not sure if that's considered a forfeiture of CA residence to the point where I can't get a residence discount on tuition. My mom and my brother were my only family in CA, but my mom is moving to Florida this Winter and my brother is off doing his own thing now in college, so I would be on my own.

My second option would be to possibly move to Florida with my mom and go to school out there. This is not a bad option I feel but one of the reasons I came out to PA in the first place was because I wanted to be independent, but if I had to live with her, then I would. 

My last option (that I see) is to see if I can live with my uncle in Manhattan who owns a small apartment. His apartment is really close to NYU, but I'm not sure I would get accepted and am not sure how much it would cost. This is the ideal scenario I feel personally because I think NYC is a city I can grow as a person in.

I guess my main overarching concern is how practical is it to move states and colleges? I did it with this school in PA but I think I got pretty lucky with how many credits got transferred and how little tuition was. Will the classes I'm taking this year be credible even though I was only there for a year? I'm worried about having to repeat classes and wasting the time that I had already spent in college up until this point.

I definitely am not as educated about life and being an adult as I should be, but I am not stupid. I did make a stupid decision, but I really appreciate anyone who could give me some advice and steer me in the right direction.

425,"I find myself reaching out as I have exhausted every avenue available I can think of. I'm a single mother, retired combat veteran and special needs teacher. Recently a freak accident on the interstate totalled my car. I paid a friend to assist with transportation, this person took my money and went on vacation instead of keeping their word. I attempted to reach out one more time to another friend a similar thing happened. Due to a long, nasty custody battle and malicious lies that cost me my job, I have terrible credit and no money. I've tried payday loans, every car dealership I can and have checked fb, Craigslist and several other places to find transportation. Due to the location of my kids school and my new job I started this week I've been using a ride share service for the kids and walking 4 miles one way to work. This is a temporary solution. Not having a vehicle will prevent me from picking up my daughter this weekend and could give her father an excuse to try and take her from me. He already lost my son to me he is looking for and even making up reasons to take her away.

I take full responsibility for trusting the wrong people and trying to help people I knew needed it instead of putting myself first. It has brought me to a place where I can't pay my bills or even get to the store for things like toilet paper and milk.

434,"This might be kinda a long post, and I apologize  if it's jumbled. So I'm a 20 year old guy, and I'm friends with this 19 year old girl. She had a fairly traumatic childhood full of physical abuse, and she was raped several times at a very young age, so she definitely has a lot of trauma. She is also autistic, but she's high functioning, and most people probably couldn't tell she is autistic because she wasn't diagnosed until a couple of years ago. She has a lot of the sensory symptoms that come with it though. 

Her current situation is she's living on her own in a house she bought with part of what she got from her dad's life insurance money. He passed when she was 12, and the money was in a trust until she turned 18. She works constantly as a waitress despite how it puts too much pressure on her body because she has a couple different heart conditions. I told her she should just take a break from work for now because she's starting online college in the fall of next year, so I think she should just use this year to tend to her mental health a bit more because she has a couple hundred thousand in her bank account from the life insurance policy that she wouldn't have to dip into very much because she already paid outright for her house, and her bills are pretty minimal. 

I don't think she is suicidal from what she says, so I can't suggest she go to a psychiatric hospital. I tell her she needs to go back to therapy, but she says she went for 6 years in total off and on and that it did all it could for her. I tell her maybe she should consider medication, but she says they have tried almost every major depression drug for her. I don't really know what to do or say to help get her on the right track. She says nothing makes her happy, and she constantly feels like life is pointless. I know that's a semi normal feeling to have sometimes at her age, but with her history of trauma and abuse, I take it a lot more seriously. 

At this point I'm her only friend because she stopped talking to her other friends because they were kinda shitty. Her mother isn't really good support for her because she's caught up in her boyfriend, and her older brother isn't good support either because he is more severely autistic and still very unstable himself and used to beat her badly as a child. 

I know this isn't something I should just bear the weight of completely, but I'm not taking on more than I can handle. I just want to help her get things started in the right direction. Should I push her a little harder to go to therapy? Would it be best that she take a couple month break from working?

439,"Ok so here’s the deal, 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a 21 year old Muslim lad and I live in England, in about 2 weeks I’m set to be married to a girl from Pakistan that is my dads friends daughter, I’m worried and happy and all over the place shit scared because I don’t know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Picture a 20 year old boy a couple months into a sales assistant role with John Lewis.

&amp;#x200B;

So my mum and elder brother went to Pakistan last year to find him a spouse, they did but in the process they stayed with my father in law to bes’ family. Whilst there my mum saw potential wife material in the daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

Forward a few months, my father in law to be gets a marriage proposal from some American kid because his grandma asked about her from mosque. So my father in law asks my dad for advise, my dad says “calm down ask her what she wants and go from there, but if you don’t mind me asking could I have a pic of your daughter as my wife would like 1 of our sons to marry your daughter”.

&amp;#x200B;

So I come home they sit me down and ask me to look at some pics and ask which girl I like, I pic 1 but realise they are of the same girl. They ask me if I like her and if I’d marry her, to which I replied yeah, ( she’s probably a 7/8). I’m pushing 5 on a good day.

&amp;#x200B;

They tell me the situation and tell me to sleep on it and tell them if I feel the same in a week, so I do and I still want to get married.

&amp;#x200B;

So my dad tells her dad and follows up by sending my picture to them and telling him to ask the daughter if she wants to get married to me.

&amp;#x200B;

They get back about 2 weeks later and she picked me, so I was gassed (overjoyed)  was not expecting that I would ever win a girls heart by just looks.

&amp;#x200B;

So the girl is happy, the parents are happy, the grandparents from dads side are happy but the grandparents from mum side are unhappy as she’s the only granddaughter and they don’t want to see her go overseas, so that’s understandable.

&amp;#x200B;

Now forward 2 months I get a promotion and become a Sony sales rep. But comes with bitter news that the girls grandparents aren’t willing to let her move away.

&amp;#x200B;

So that kinda shuts that down, fast forward 6 months, I’m over the fact that I’m not getting married, I’m dealing with my own new problems, I’m in a job I enjoy, but the environment I’m in is not healthy, the people I called my friends do not like who I’ve become as my job requires me to be more proactive and customer orientated rather than socializing with them.

&amp;#x200B;

(1 key player is my best friend it’s complicated, we are very up and down, on and off.)

&amp;#x200B;

So I apply for a new job. Have my interview and so I’m waiting to hear back.

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst waiting I’m in my Sony role, on the phone arguing with my best friend and she decides that she’s had enough, goes on to block me on every form of social media and anyway of contacting her culminating in a block on WhatsApp with a message saying she’s had enough.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Within 20 mins I get a e-mail saying I’ve got the job I applied for, so I’m overjoyed I get to to get some space and stop straining my friendship due to the job, ring my parents they are happy, sort everything out with the new employers my notice period when I can start the works.

&amp;#x200B;

That takes about 45 mins, I draft up my letter of resignation for my Sony manager and explain the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Mum drops me a message asking when I’m home as they’ve got news for me, from tone of message could gauge that it was something big I pushed for more information and had a gut feeling that it was to do with marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ring and she’s like talk to your dad, so dad comes on asks about the job and everything what it means for me and so forth. Asks when I’m home, it’s a couple of hours so he’s like ok see you then, but I needed to know what was up as I was trying to get time off for my brothers wedding happening on the 27th October. 

&amp;#x200B;

So he tells me that’s father in law rang and that they’ve managed to persuade the grandparents to be ok with my wife to be moving overseas.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m overwhelmed,

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve got a bitter sweet news that my friend no longer wants to play games and so get out of the cycle 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve got a new job as a area manager with a car fully paid for.

&amp;#x200B;

And now I’m getting married.

&amp;#x200B;

So News is meant to come in 3s they lined up quite nicely.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now my reservations that I’ve had all along is Will we be compatible?

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve got so many questions that I wanna ask but cultural bullshit doesn’t allow it.

Religiously I’m allowed to talk to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my mum is currently going around Pakistan with them so I can ask questions via her, so I put it to you awesome community to

I'm 22 and I haven't gone to college, but I want to. I've been in and am still in a pretty deep depression. I graduated high school near the bottom of my class.... never made any college plans, never did anything. I fucked myself. I could not function then.... and I still cant, but I'm trying to be serious about getting myself some professional help. Anyways, I've been in a serious relationship for 5 years... While my girlfriend went to college 2 hours away, I tried twice to go to community college. Both times, I got halfway through the first semester and just dropped off somehow. I always start out really strong, but I think.... I don't know. Maybe I get overwhelmed.

 Anyways! What my real problem is now is that my girlfriend has graduated and she's been looking for a serious job that could take us (and our puppy) anywhere. She's hoping for somewhere like San Francisco or L.A.- those are the kind of places that she would have the most opportunities. I would be happier somewhere more northerly, but honestly I don't care. I mostly want to be with her........ But I was just offered something.

My grandmother (in FL) offered me the opportunity to come down there to go to school, which she would fund. I would live with and take care of her in return. This is enticing for me for two really big reasons. One, I love her and she's really on her last legs so it would be nice to spend some time with her. Two, the biggest obstacle between me and a degree (besides my shitty depression) is money. 

I would absolutely go, no hesitation.... if I wasn't in a serious relationship. I would be really worried that I would lose my girls if I decided to do this.... Even if it's for four years, my SO will probably get a job somewhere and life will be harder for her without me as I would help (slightly) with rent and life stuff if I just went with her. But I fear that I'll always be working kind of scummy jobs for the rest of my life. I wouldn't be able to respect myself and I for sure know she and her family couldn't respect me.

I don't know what to do. I know I'm kind of giving myself only two choices here which is never the case irl, but I can't think of anything else.",12Oct2018,1

444,"My husband had to leave to help out with disaster relief in Florida because of his job and me (28) and my sister (24) are home alone until he gets back. Last night I took 3 xanax spaced through out the night, my sleeping pill, melatonin, and had two beers and I was still too scared to sleep. I also have a German Shepherd, a hand gun, a shotgun, video cameras with the feed in my room, and a gate that is chained shut. I don’t have a lot of faith but I prayed all night but found no comfort in it because I kept thinking how bad things happen all the time and those people probably pray too. 

It doesn’t help that a week or two ago I was in the shower and I heard my dogs barking so I went to the door to unlock it because I thought it was my sister. There was an older man standing in my drive way staying back from the door because my dog is pretty scary. He yelled at me to come outside in a mean voice. I told him, No go away! He said put some clothes on and come outside. I was wearing my robe. I told him again to go away. I live pretty far in the country so someone being in my drive way is weird. I kept yelling at him to leave and he finally did. When I watched the cameras he was cussing at me as he got into his truck. I think he wanted to ask me something about my property.

447,"22 years old and this is my first real experience with dating. We’ve been seeing each other for a little over a month now and I’m still not sure how to go about making physical moves on her. Like when we are laying in bed watching a movie or something, do I just ask if she wants to or do I try and ease into it somehow? The only thing we’ve done is made out once the last time I was at her place. I was rubbing her back and she eventually leaned into kiss me and things just kinda picked up from there. 

She knows this is my first for pretty much everything and got rid of my worries that I was being too passive. She said she understood and that it actually made her feel respected (called me a “breath of fresh air”) because I wasn’t just trying to get in her pants. But, I don’t want to need her to make the first move every time either. ",12Oct2018,1
448,"Over the past few weeks, I've been feeling depressed. I've even thought of jumping off a bridge because I don't know why, but for some reason I always get attached to girls too quickly. Not that she knows that but it's just the way I am. She knows I'm a sensitive individual though, and I don't take break ups well.

We had one fight before, where she had a problem with me, and I spent a few hours resolving the issue. But a month later when the time came when I had to raise a separate issue with her, I texted her and she took it totally the wrong way, thinking I was throwing a tantrum and within 5 minutes she broke off our relationship.

She didn't even let me explain what I meant. She said she wanted to remain friends when we broke up, but to give her some distance. So I did. But she contacted me several times to check up on me.

But I was still left so, so, so shocked at how quickly she gave up on our relationship that I went numb when it happened. I've been feeling this numbness ever since.

I called her yesterday (after waiting a good four days of silence) to ask how she is (because I missed her voice), but she was very, very cold with me (although we did talk for 10 minutes).

I told her even though we are over, can't you still act like the old way that we were like before, but she said ""no"".

She was showing me a side to her that I've never seen before. She sounded calculated, mute and as if she still didn't want to speak to me. She told me directly this is the way she is like with most people she ""wasn't close to"" (when she said this it hurt unbelievably well; we were so close that we even spent everyday talking to each other, we kissed as well, and I've been over at her apartment several times and slept over.

She also said how could I have been so ""buddy buddy"" with her so soon after the break up (as if expecting me to openly grieve for her), and she then asked me if she was ever more than just a friend to me. That shit hurt and still does. It's like she was blaming me for the relationship failing, when it was her that cut it off.

Later we texted about the phone call. She told me not to contact her again, unless its something important. I got really frustrated with her and finally told her how all of this made me feel. I've honestly tried so hard with this girl, that it just sucks she gave up on us like this.

I told her I've given up on her and we said goodbye to each other. I told her that I'd miss her, and she replied back with ""likewise"". We're not even friends anymore now, and that sucks even more.

I just can't seem to get over this, and feel like I'm falling into a pit of depression.

She hasn't blocked me, and neither have I her. I don't know why either of us aren't blocking each other, but it's painful she gave up on me like this when I know I didn't do anything wrong.",12Oct2018,1
449,"So let me preface this story by telling a few things that are relevant to the story. I'm a high school student right now in the tenth grade. I've had lots of issues with bullying in the past, every year save the past two. I've made personal it a goal to build myself, mind, body, discipline, and all. This means I've never touched drugs and have never gotten drunk or drank recreationally with my friends.  

So to start the story, last year I was part of a team on ROTC in a very bad neighboorhood. I was attending the school as a magnet school, we live across the city from it almost. Long story short, my team had become my moral support and we're the closest thing to family in friends I had ever had. I had to leave because of an incident I caused after somebody was harassing me though, and the administrators favored him (I'm half white half mexican in a primarily mexican school. The kid was calling me nazi, tarnishing my name just because that, and I didn't politically align with him). I'm going to a school close to me now, with all the kids I had had trouble with and other ones i didn't like. I just really don't fit in most places, is what I'm saying. I've got one good friend in the school who I've known for years, and other than that have two discord friends I've been hanging out with for two years. 

Recently I've had trouble waking up. No, really. I'll ""wake up"" in a state so unconcious that I'll just walk over to my alarm and turn it off, not even press snooze. This will cause me to be late or worse, not make it to my school classes (all the important ones save english are before 12). I'm in all pre ap and ap classes, so naturally work stacks up quick when I miss days. I've been missing so much that I'm out of days for the semester, an I couldn't be angrier at myself. Lately I've been trying to set three alarms in various corners of my room, but the problem is still persisting. And to make matters worse, my work has kept me up till like 2 consistently, which pisses of my parents even more. 

So my parents will try to wake me up, but they'll yell at me and get angry, threaten to take my puppy, my mead I recently started brewing (skyrim lol), my phone, not let me drive (I just turned 16), the works. They'll yell how I won't be successful, how I'll never make it in BUD/S (I want to join the seals after high school), how great I have it and how I'm ruining everything, etc. When this happens, I lose all my motivation to even attend school and i chalked it up to laziness like they did. 

That is until today, when I realized that whats happening isn't me being lazy and the problem isn't actually my peers at school, it's my parents. Every day when they do this it's like having my bullies in my room screaming at me, and it just brings it all back. Today I finally broke down and went to my room around 11 am, and just lied down with my puppy and started crying. I think thats when I had my realization. And sure enough, but a few minutes later, my mom comes in and starts trying to be ""nice"" for a lengthy thirty seconds (I think she does this so she can claim she wasn't being rude), and when that failed, she ripped my sheets off and took my pillows and my dog, turned my lights and my fan on and started shouting that she's not gonna let me sleep if I stay home! I come back to my room thirty minutes later and all my bedding is gone. She took my phone and computer as well, even though I had put a call in to my school's counseling office to talk to them and was expecting a call back. 

Her anger persisted for another hour until my dad got home and i went to school with two periods left. I was supposed to do a bass solo for jazz band that I was unable to practice for, and I tried to not do it. I ended up just walking the chords instead, but when I was about to go I tried to stop the director and tell him I couldn't, and the whole time I felt vulnerable like I was thrown into my fourth grade class again where even the teacher hated me. Needless to say, it wasn't a very good day. 

I got picked up after school and nothing was said on the drive home. When I got home I was preparing to look for my computer so I could just chill with my friends and relax, and I found my parents had taken my desk from my room and moved it downstairs so they could limit me from playing it at night, because they've somehow rationalized that the problem is me playing games on friday nights (the only time I do). 

I was so frustrated, I tried to bring it up back to my room even though it weighs a good ~50 pounds and its bulky as hell. My mom caught me and got all mad, and noticed it had scratched the wood floor (which I do feel really bad about, they prize those so much they almost didn't let me get my dog). I was so done at this point, I went up stairs and tried to call my friend to get me some weed or something, but I don't want to resort to that and when they heard me calling him, they instantly called his father to prohibit him from picking me up (I wasn't even trying to get picked up). I'm not doing that after all because it's stupid, but my temper flaired up so much that I punched a pretty sizable dent in my wall. 

At this point I don't have anything to rely on for fun or recreation besides my school, and I really don't like my new team much. I just don't fit in with them. I can't play games or hang out ever, I don't have my desk, and I just don't know what to do. 

And the problem isn't new either, there is always a quarrel in my house, and I blame my mom more than anything. She just starts problems with people constantly. Last year was no different, I was a frequent meditator two years ago but the constant arguing has made me question myself so much, and my mind is always racing from it, that I cant even do it anymore. I haven't been able to for a year, and I was the guy that had seen a lot of success with it. It's what got rid of my crippling social anxiety and allowed me to have a normal social life in eighth grade, but I'm afraid it's coming back now. 

I tried telling my mom how I feel today, and I explained to her a day ago that I can either listen to them and allow her to disrupt me and suffer over it, or stop caring and do my own thing, and hopefully be happy. ",12Oct2018,1
450,"I understand the most obvious answer would be to avoid these people, but this happens with different groups of friends.

Two months ago, I decided to stop drinking. No particular reason. I just don't want to and alcohol doesn't really do it for me anyways. Being drunk is fun but I can have fun sober too.

A month ago, I was going to an event that didn't require drinking at all. They started taking shots and I refused, saying that I'd stopped drinking. They started getting annoyed, telling me to hurry up and just take it, shoving the shot in my face, etc. This kept going until one of them finally said ""she said she didn't want to drink it"". They stopped but I could tell they were very annoyed.

A week after that, I drank for my friend's birthday. We were drinking with a friend I didn't usually party with and he was CRAZY with peer pressure. He would grab a bottle and walk around making everyone take shots with him. If you didn't take it, he would get aggressive and start yelling at you. I tried to jokingly walk away because I had honestly had enough alcohol, and he came after me and dragged me back by the wrist (which hurt a lot but he was quite drunk). It wasn't just me, I could tell other people were annoyed with his behaviour too.

Finally yesterday I caught up with some friends for dinner. I didn't want to drink but I took a shot with a friend because I owed her. Afterwards I said I didn't want to drink that day, my excuse being I was on a diet. We went to a bottle shop to buy alcohol and they kept trying to convince me to drink, trying to guilt me by saying we haven't hung out in a while and that I was being such a party pooper. They got very annoyed and I felt terrible but I just didn't want to drink. 

I really need help refusing alcohol without feeling like a terrible a party pooper afterwards. All these situations are with different groups of friends so I can't just avoid the problem. It makes it so much easier when there's someone to defend me but in some situations I don't have anyone to tell them to stop. Are there any good excuses that will convince them to stop? Or any other advice?

I won't stop being friends with all these people because these are really their only bad points. I think they're genuinely great people outside of this and I really love being friends with all of them.

Also, even before I decided to stop drinking, if I was feeling sick and didn't want to drink, some other friends would just keep physically dragging me to the bar (I'm quite small and not that strong so it's easy) until I took shots with them.

I disclosed to 2 of my close friends that i'm trans, and asked that they didn't tell anyone else in our group of friends because it could be dangerous for me. 

For insurance, I prefaced my coming out by telling them if they ever outed me to anyone, I would spill one of their secrets that could potentially have life altering consequences. They agreed.

Well, they told someone, who told at least one more person, who told me. The person they told has previously said to me ""If I ever got hit on by a tranny i'd fucking slit their throat"".

Who knows who else that person has told. I approached the 'friends', they denied it and acted straight up defensive, almost as if i'm the bad person for coming at them.

455,"Hey Reddit,

I have a problem

A mystery

And i don't know what is going on. 

I want you guys advice. Maybe you know whats going on.

The story goes as follows

I live with my grandparents and my mom. My mom is gone every weekend. My grandparents are old and can't walk the stairs anymore. So i have all the upstair rooms. 

And a toilet.

And sometimes I experience the same thing. When my mom is gone. I go the the toilet. And what i find there is:

Pee, and toiletpaper in the toiler unflushed. The pee smells horrible.

Normal right? Someone just didn't flush. But who is this someone. I am the only one who lives upstairs. Who uses the toiler upstairs! All visitors for my grandparents use the toilet downstairs. The people who care for my grandparents use the toilet downstairs. And even if they use the upstairs toilet. WHY DON'T THEY FLUSH? They all have manners.

So more into the details. We got the pee what smells horrible with toilet paper on it. All the time. This means it must have been a women. Why? because their pee always smells bad. And they use toiletpaper. Men don't use toiletpaper after peeing. Some do, but I know for sure that wouldn't smell so bad. 

So today it happend again. At 19:00 I made myself ready to go to my basketball training. I brushed my teeth in the bathroom where the toilet is located. No smell. When I returned form training around 21:00 I went straight to my room and i played some games for maybe 1 to 2 hours. I had to pee, so I went to the bathroom. What i found there was the pee and the toiletpaper in the toilet. The bad smell. So I instantly flushed it.

I tought. This happend many times before. But now I had another detail. I was for sure my mom was gone, because she left around 12:00. She said goodbye and she didn't return. So it couldn't be my mom. The only person who could have done it wasn't home!

I was scared and asked my grandma downstairs about her toughts.. She didn't understand as well. She got scared as well. She told me to check all the rooms and the attic. I checked all of that. No one.

That leaves me here. I got no clues. Everything theory is debunked. 

I need your help, what do you think?

Do you have any solutions for me?

Btw this is real.",12Oct2018,1
456,"Howdy! 

So, I'm a senior in high school, and today senior polls came in. I won one: ""Most Awkward."" 

It's an accurate title. I've had trouble throughout middle and high school with building friendships.  I would say that I'm awkward; I have clinical anxiety that I've seen a therapist and have taken meds for. I also struggled with a speech impediment a couple years back. But I still think it's messed up that the school Yearbook has this category. If I had received this two years ago, I would've been heartbroken and miserable. I was severely depressed then, and I've, thankfully, recovered.

For so long, my coping mechanism was ""other people don't notice the small stuff, so don't worry about it."" But discovering that people actually /do/ notice the wrong stuff, and that the majority of my peers voted me as most awkward? It feels bad.

Sure. I am awkward, and quiet. And I like awkward things like gaming and anime. But I'm also an award-winning writer, co-leader of our Mock Trial team (which made it to state in it's second year!), gold award-winning in the national German exam, and associate editor-in-chief and opinions editor of my school's newspaper. I hate bragging, but. I don't know. I'm a good person. I get good grades, work hard and genuinely care about people. And I wish I could get revenge on my superficial school which values people based on ""best butt,"" ""most awkward,"" or ""most muscular,"" rather than things that actually matter. 

Anyways, we are supposed to take pictures for the yearbook. We are allowed to bring props and signs and stuff, too. We can refuse our title, but then it goes to the runner up--and I don't want the runner up to feel awful, too.  I also would like to publish an article, probably an opinion piece, about this in my newspaper. 

Any ideas on how to get revenge? Or clever props to bring for the photo or something? 

Thanks!

Long story short, Tyler found out I had taken them and had thrown punches at me and I had given him money. I f**ked up, I know I did and I think he got what he wanted.

Him and I are both the type to be friendly to everyone. In fact, we both won the senior year “most likely to brighten someone’s day,” yearbook award. 

He was diagnosed with cancer junior year. I remember him complaining on rides home about his jaw hurting him. He went to multiple doctors appointments and they dismissed it. Finally one random night he went to the ER and they ran a scan and found it was cancer. 

He quickly started treatments and went through intense chemo. He’s such a special guy. When I say he never complained, I mean he NEVER complained. Would come to school whenever he could, carrying his medicine in a bag. I could go on forever. 

Senior year I started dating a very “protective” guy. He made me cut off all my male friends, including him. We were still cordial, but I deleted him off my social media. He even requested me back twice. I was just too afraid of my boyfriend to do what I wanted but even then I felt guilty. Fast forward to his final days, I visited him in the hospital and went to the hospital ceremony’s graduation party for him (he wasn’t fit to attend the real one). Fact is, it was already too late. I majority of his last year MIA from him and only popped up at the end and I hated it and still do. It makes his death so, so much worse. When I cry, I can’t stop. It’s not even that he’s gone, it’s just knowing it could’ve ended better between us. And he wasn’t mad, he was confused. And it hurts me so much that I did that. I’m the type of person that goes directly to someone to apologize after very small things. This is huge. And he’s not there to say sorry to. I know if he was still here and I took it all back, he would talk me through it to understand and get it. But that’s just not what’s gonna happen and I don’t even deserve it. I resent that I ever let someone control me and it eats me alive. He’s gone and I can’t change anything I did. I just want to know how to deal with it.

462,"I don't have much experience in therapy so maybe I am reading into things that aren't really there. But a few things made me feel a little uneasy, not to the point I would stop seeing him, but I wonder if he is flirting or being inappropriate. I have only seen him 3 times. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first couple of appointments I opened up a lot. I told him about my unhappy marriage.  That I don't feel loved by my husband and though we have sex it's basically mechanical and without any emotion. I do it to please him and I don't feel pleasure (never really have). He works all the time so we have no real interaction except when he comes home and wants sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

I admitted that I talk to men online and sext with them. That I enjoy the attention and have even met one before in person (though it did NOT escalate to sex).  I started talking about what a horrible person I am and I how I'm so selfish. He tried to console me and said ""hey, you're young and pretty and you probably don't want to miss out on what's out there....or find yourself at 40 regretting your decisions. There is nothing wrong with that."" When he asked how often my husband and I have sex and I said 5 times a week. He responded ""wow, you have a strong libido, that's good. That's good."" (for the record, I don't but he made this assumption because of frequency).

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is the thing that made me feel the most unease. We were talking about how I don't get much out of sex with my husband. He said I deserve pleasure too. But the way he was looking at me while talking about it......he stared at me intently and his eyes were flirty, almost like squinty, it was so odd, and it was so obviously different than the face he had when we were talking about nonsexual things. It made me a little uncomfortable and I didn't know how to handle it. I googled the squinty eye look and came across ""bedroom eyes"" and that's exactly what he was doing.  Was this intentional? Is he flirting with me? Or is it possible that he was just tired and I'm misreading it? (My appointment is late at night and I'm his last one of the day so he probably is tired). 

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing, all our appointments have gone over by 20-30 minutes and I'm still not sure of how long our appointments *should* be. Isn't a typical therapy appointment 45-50 minutes?

Im struggling with depression based around my sexual desires towards children, most importantly my 13-year-yold niece. She lives thousands of miles away. shes safe. ive never done anything to her. Id hate to see anything bad happen to her. Id rather die than cause her pain.  


But i still want to do terrible things.. i feel like it could be fun or an amazing time (briefly) but the more i think about it the worse i feel.. realising thered be serious physical and mental trauma, ruined lives and families, jail time, regret and living with my actions for as long as i do.   


But.. i still toss and turn in my bed thinking of my niece and how awesome itd be to run away with her (sometimes i assume shes the legal age of consent and try to imagine that ending well).

I am seeking help. I see a psychiatrist and a psychiatric nurse at the local hospital routinely. they have a therapist ""set aside"" for me, but she's openly admitted that she cant really help with this at all.

Furthermore, the rest of the province seems to be only treating offenders AFTER theyve committed an atrocity. I dont want it to be too late before i get help. I NEED HELP NOW!!  


My doctors have suggested calling up various clinics and whatnot throughout the province and seeing if theyll do ""over the network"" therapy. but i really feel like i, as the patient, shouldnt have to call 60 different clinics without a referral. ive had 3 booklets given to me of different places to call and i havent bothered with a single one. Mostly because the clinics strictly advertise themselves as post-offense or youth offenders.   


I honestly feel like just having someone with an open mind to talk to about this issue would help tremendously.  
Ive exhausted all my friends; ive had a couple up and leave me cuz they cant handle me anymore.  


i dont feel like im an active threat or danger to children; im more worried ill commit suicide.  


ive nearly convinced myself it was better to hang by the neck than to continue living in a way that might end up hurting a kid. and if it were my niece... i wouldnt want to see the hell awaiting me.  


if anyone knows of any online help sources... whether paid or free or whatnot, or anything in ontario canada that i can contact for counselling about these issues.. id really appreciate a point in the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks for reading and any help you may provide.

465,"I(23F) have been seeing this guy(22M) lately and the other night we went out. We had been out before, but this time we ended up in my bed. I kept insisting that we use a condom, but he didn't want to. He later admitted he didn't have one so he left to buy some. When he returned, he tried to act like the condoms wouldn't fit. After a few more moments of us going back and forth about using a condom, he finally puts one on. 

Right as I'm about to get on top of him, he takes the condom off and hides it in his hand. I notice this right before it was too late and called him on it. He lied to my face saying it was not in his hand. I then opened his hand and saw the crumpled condom. He puts it back on and we start to have sex. The condom eventually ""pops"" and I immediately told him. He acknowledged the broken condom and proceeded to thrust harder than he had before until he finished a few seconds later. 

I got tested the following day and everything came back normal, but I stopped talking to him completely. Am I overreacting?",12Oct2018,1

Was she’s insulting me here or being nice? (self.seduction)
submitted 10 minutes ago by HHSHSHp
I go to appointments fortnightly  with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet)  ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she  said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm an ugly loser....or something like that. Need a 2nd opinion...I did need a shave which maybe why :/  she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined. But she also chose me for 2 interviews and didn’t say anything about appearance at all the 2nd time so I don’t understand :/",12Oct2018,1
467,"I don't understand guys. I'm 23, I've been in college for 3 years, I could have finished by now but I still have classes left. My family pays for it, I feel constant sadness, my sleepschedule is so bad I get tired at 5 am everyday and have to drink coffee. I started drinking coffee and energy drinks a year ago and it helped me achieved great things for a semester, then the effect faded, while they help me to stay awake I can't really focus on anything anymore, it's like a constant firing of thoughts and it's all so blurry, when I try to sit down to study I get bored quick.   
I go to classes and I can't focus and I have terrible anxiety. It feels like I'm in a robot mode. I have no friends and no GF, I barely know anyone in college. I'M studying in English which isn't my mother tongue so it's a bit extra hard to get out of my shell and socialise, as there are bunch of foreigners and my confidence level is really low and I feel mentally dumb.
Today I took some magnesium pills because I was looking for a remedy, a bit of a help for my anxiety and I already feel a bit better, but it isn't much, I might quit coffee too, but tbh I feel like I need it, because it gives me motivation despite the feeling of being all over the place. I don't know what to do guys, maybe my expectation about me was just too high and it is what it is, this is  me and this is only what I'm capable of. Maybe i should just accept how it is and keep moving. The thing is though I really need motivation and start doing things I don't like to do, but it's really hard.",12Oct2018,1
469,"There are two girls that I sort of like. One is my friend and has been since the end if school last year. We have each other's phone numbers and text each other multiple times a week. We also have class together.

There is also a girls I met this year who is just really nice and I like her attitude toward everything.

Both of them are nice and have special things about them, but generally the second girl is more ideal for a 'girlfriend', if I wanted to take it to that level. I need to become friends with her first though. 

Which leaves me with the questions... How do I become closer to both of these girls without becoming akward or making me seem desperate.  Which one should I choose if I do take it that far? Can I still be friends with them if something bad happens with the relationship?",12Oct2018,1
470,"I have a iPhone 6s Plus that I am very happy with although the battery needs to be replaced, the screen needs to be fixed and the camera needs to be checked. For these repairs, it’ll cost from $230 to $250. I told one of my friends and he said with T-Mobile (my carrier) I can get a iPhone 8 Plus for $150 then pay for 4 months with the extra hundred. I love my iPhone because it’s still fast (to me) and it has a headphone jack. I don’t know if I want to upgrade and get used to using an adapter. What should I do?

473,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing a bit with hand to mouth . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and like politely smiled a little (not a full smile just like a tighten lips hard to explain) and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whisper to her friend the brunette girl 'that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and the it went like:

Brunette: “excuse  me”

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...yer know.’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a quick smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me doesn’t these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously)

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it like upbeat)

Me: ignored her* 

Blonde: *watching the whole thing*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has”

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” 

Me: *ignored again wiping the table*

Blonde: laughs and says ‘aww no leave it he’s fuming now” 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me to say ‘byyyeee’ smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

TLDR: girls at my new at my new bar job talking to me asking if I have a gf and another saying I’m dead cute but that’s not tally a good thing is it,",12Oct2018,1
474,"Is there any better advice for getting over a breakup than the typical workout and think about the bad not good advice thats every gives?

 I already spend half my time working out because my job, there wasnt really any bad as the only reason we broke up is because she couldnt handle the distance, and my friends arn't really around to hang out with at the moment.

475,"So my dad passed away recently, and his service was today. I had an exam for my online statistics class scheduled yesterday, however it completely slipped my mind until I was driving home as I had been at my mom's house all day helping her set up for the reception, and putting together pictures for the service. I got home from her house at around 11:40, and immediately opened the exam as it was due at 11:59 and I was hoping it would still give me the full 90 minutes  to take it if I opened it in time. It didn't, so I tried to do what I could in the 15 minutes it allowed me to take the test. Ended with a 27% as I could only complete a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately emailed my professor and explained the situation and asked if the test could be reopened. He replied that it would be ""unfair"" to other students to reopen it for me since I had already attempted the test. I asked again and explained it only gave me 15 minutes, not the 90 the rest of the students had, so I didn't even see the majority of the questions, and also asked if there was anything else I could do to make up the points. He said that there was nothing he could do for me regarding this exam since it would be unfair to other students. I personally don't feel it would be unfair, as the questions are exactly like the homework and quizzes, just with different numbers, so I don't have a real advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have any other options or am I just screwed? I'm so stressed about this, because up until this I've kept a 4.0 GPA as I'm trying to get into grad school. This feels incredibly unfair and I just don't know what else to do. I've cried more over this today than I have over my dad lmao. Thanks in advance ",12Oct2018,1
476,"Hello there. . .

I'm a 35 year old guy - I've lost all of my friends through various problems that I've endured. I've moved away from them all, I've had to deal with stuff that I couldn't even begin to explain to them so I've just cut them off because I felt that they wouldn't have understood my predicament. It's been over a year since I've seen any of them, I've also missed two of their weddings and a child birth. I am now in a situation where I'm living with a girl who is pregnant with my first ever child and it's a relationship that I don't want to be in. 

I want to support and be there for my due child and I also want to get my life back on track but I don't know where to start?

478,"So, I'm a community manager for a discord server of about 800 teenagers. I'm also a teenager myself. The problem with this community is that very few people can think for themselves, as everything in this server is just bandwagon after bandwagon. I believe that I could end 90% of the drama in this server if I could low-key encourage users to think for themselves instead of blindly listening to everything someone tells them first.

There was a drama a month ago where a moderator said something along the lines of ""cutting is a bad method of coping,"" so an admin who really disliked that mod intentionally spread rumors that that mod was encouraging suicide and cutting because the mod didn't stop the conversation that was going on. That mod was bullied out of the server, came back, I gave her back staff roles (banned narcissistic admin already), and she just left again because a month later there's still a hate bandwagon for her.

So, one thing this server does is events. I think that I could utilize this somehow, but I'm not entirely sure how.

I hope this does not seem /r/iamverysmart. I believe everything *but* that I'm smart. I just want to encourage these users to think for themselves a bit more.",12Oct2018,1

Parents don't speak English well and is at a loss of how to approach this. No one knew he had this debt and is struggling. He hasn't made any big ticket purchases, no medical bills that would warrant taking this kind of loan out.

480,"So yeah, as the title suggests I’ve been feeling pretty darn distant from my friends lately and it really sucks, it feels like I’m being excluded somehow even though I regularly hang around with them during my break and my lunch period. I don’t really blame them, I’m not so interesting since I pretty much stay home most of the time and do maths, read, or art and the occasional reddit browsing here and there. But I just don’t get it; I’m new into the school and have been here since the first day of the year and met these guys I hang out with not too long after. 


Usually my friends will just not really care for what I have to say, or just sit in different places or walk away from me because I’m not constantly screaming and telling edgy jokes to get attention. I try to ignore this, but it really sucks because no one really wants to talk to me and I’ve never had a girlfriend as an introverted type person to even talk to about this.


Not really sure what I’m doing wrong, I don’t want to go into total isolation but I often don’t have any remarkable days as it’s pretty much just going to school, acing some assignments, riding the bus back home with an empty row beside me and no one to talk to besides the voice in my headphones which I consider to be my only solace at this point. 

There’s really not much else to say. I don’t really want to improve, I just wanna know what I’m doing wrong, am I doing something wrong? ",12Oct2018,1
