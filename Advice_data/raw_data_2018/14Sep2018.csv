0,"My mom and grandma have lived together for quite some time in a house that they recently put in my mom’s name. My grandma is not doing well physically. She is lethargic and not eating and has trouble moving around. 

My mom has schizophrenia and taking care of my grandma was putting too much stress on her. One of her sisters’ who is retired is going to have my grandma move in with her to take care of her.

Together my mom and grandma could afford the house and all the bills. My mom though is on disability and only gets around $1,150 a month. Now that my grandma is moving out she will likely not be able to afford living in the house. She is applying for food stamps and a plan to reduce the electric bill but based on her budget I don’t think she will have enough to stay at the house. She says she will get a roommate but due to her mental illness she will likely decide she doesn’t like the person pretty quickly and ask them to move out. I'm not really in a financial situation where I can help her pay her bills and buy food.

While not ideal I can have her move in with me. The tricky part is she has two dachshunds. This is an issue for a number of reasons:

*  They are not house trained. We could work on house training the boy but the girl is crippled in her back legs and is incontinent. 
* I also work from home and like all dachshunds they bark a lot.  I don’t want to jeopardize my job because it is noisy when I am on calls.
* I have a golden retriever and the girl dachshund doesn’t get along with him. She growls at him and has snapped at him in the past

I know it sounds bad but I don’t want the dogs to ruin the carpeting in the house and risk issues with my job. I also want to make sure my mom has somewhere to stay but I know it will be heartbreaking for her to give up her dogs.

If anyone has ideas or advice on how to handle the situation please let me know. ",14Sep2018,1

4,"I've never posted on this forum before, so I'm sorry if I have the wrong idea or something. Anyways, I'm a sophomore in college. Last school year, I struggled a lot with my grades and schoolwork due to some mental health issues. This year, I'm trying my best to discipline myself better so that I can stay on top of my work, and so far I think I'm already doing a lot better than I was last year (yay). But there's just one problem:  
I hate English class. The English class that I'm in right now is called ""Language and Society"" which basically tries to dive deeper into the societal norms of language or something like that. It's a really interesting class, and an interesting concept, but for some reason I can't stand the class. I don't hate the professor or anything, she's actually really nice and friendly and we engage in a lot of classroom discussion, so I know that the professor isn't the problem. I guess I could say that I hate writing papers, but not that much, because once I get into a paper and start to really write it, I actually kind of enjoy it; I took an Advanced Composition class in high school and I liked that one, and it was completely based on writing papers.   
I don't know what's wrong with English class for me though. Last semester I had a writing-based class and I struggled the most with motivation for that one, and I have no idea why, because I liked the professor and the concept was interesting. But now, I'm really nervous that I'm gonna fall behind in Language and Society (I have some minor research that I have to do and I've been procrastinating it a lot), and I'm scared that my lack of motivation for my Language and Society class is gonna spread to my other classes, and that I'm gonna do terrible.

8,"Hi there /r/Advice,  


I'm 18 years old. Me and my father both rented an apartment and share the bills. Recently though he's been telling his friends that I essentially am a lazy piece of shit who doesn't want a job and does absolutely nothing to help around the house. I have a job, I am a freelance graphic designer. He apparently thinks that job isn't a ""Real Job"" because I do it on my computer and am pretty damn good at it. He's been telling my uncle that I do nothing as well, and I have him calling me and telling me ""Quit being a freeloader and get a real job"" It's been quite annoying. I've been paying bills around here left and right. I've payed the internet ($70 bucks a month), half of the electric, and half of the rent ($375).  


However, according to him he thinks I'm hitting my Mother up for money to pay the bills and my job is baloney. I'm getting sick of being looked at as a freeloader, and pathetic. I work hard for my money and I'm getting sick and tired of this shit. He's acting like I'm still a child and I'm dependent for everything. In my mind, he's afraid of me doing better than him. Not to mention he's an alcoholic as well, a bad one.  


Any advice is graciously accepted as I'm looking for help finding an answer. Also yes I'm looking to rent my own place and take my name off this current lease.

9,"OK so here's the deal. I'm a college student who just got back in town before school starts up again. I pretty much have no friends here so I spend a lot of time on Tinder and OkCupid looking for folks to hang out with. I haven't had sex before and am somewhere on the asexual spectrum so I was mostly looking for friends. I wasn't upfront about this at first but now it's in my profiles to avoid awkwardness.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year (before I added that info to my profiles), I matched with someone I had gone to high school with and we chatted a bit before she invited me to a party at her place. At the party we both got totally wasted and she came on to me with an increasing lack of subtlety. Finally she asked if I wanted to fuck and I politely declined and told her I was pretty much asexual. She asked if I'd fucked anyone before and I said no. Then she said something along the lines of ""I like pushing peoples' boundaries. Do you want me to push yours?"" I thought that was sketch as fuck so I said no and she backed down. I went home shortly after that and haven't hung out with her since. I didn't hit her up and she didn't hit me up.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to present day. Still no friends. I'm bored, lonely, and sad and had the idea to hit her up again. She's the only person in this town who's ever been enthusiastic about hanging out with me. The reason I didn't hit her up again is because I was creeped out but now I'm trying to justify it to myself by saying she was just trying to talk sexy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure loneliness is clouding my judgement though so I was hoping for another opinion to put me on the right track. Is hitting her up again a terrible idea? If not, is it even possible she'd want to hang out again after months of silence?

10,"I am 14, and it is nearing the prom. I went with my friends last year, but I kinda want a date. One of my friends got a date last year, and he said he had a great time. They are still dating, and I want to get a date too. The thing is, almost all of the girls at my school are thots, furries, already are seeing someone, see me as a friend, or don't/barely know me. There is this one girl, let's call her E. She is cute, we've known eachother for a while, and have similar hobbies. The thing is, she hangs out around some pretty toxic people. I also don't know if girls would like me, and I don't even know if I want to date yet. I just, kinda want to have a first kiss. So I will lay some things down.

Physical Description: I'm kind of chubby, I have black hair and hazel eyes. I am southeast Asian and Caucasian. I have pretty good symmetry, but I have a lot of acne.

Personality: People describe me as funny and weird. My mother raised me to be a gentleman. I get nervous about things sometimes and I can have trouble controlling my anger sometimes. I can cook, I'm a black belt, and I'm in my schools advanced music group.

So, tell me what I should do, and be goddamn honest.

11,"Just gonna throw it out there - my name is Madison. No offense to other people named Madison, but I hate this name. 

As a kid I tried to have people address me by my middle name instead of my first name because I didn't feel like my first name suited me. I ended up giving up on that after a couple of weeks because my teachers, classmates, and parents wouldn't or couldn't remember to call me by the name I chose. My mom later confided in me that she was really hurt by my decision to use a different name because she ""picked Madison specially"" for me. 

I figured I just had to live with it, until an instance at work recently. I work with children (not a teacher, but I work with teachers and students) and when I introduce myself I go by my first name rather than Ms. LastName. Well, with this one group, I told them my name and immediately all the teachers and parents burst out laughing, and one of them commented on how it wasn't a real grown-up name. Three little girls put their hands up and announced that they were also named Madison. 

It seems like a small thing, but I really resent my parents for giving me a hipster name (for lack of a better term). When I was born in the early 90s virtually no girls were named Madison. I did some research and the name came into popularity after the movie Splash. In the last 15 or 20 years Madison has been on the top baby name lists in a bunch of English speaking countries. My parents gave me this name when it wasn't popular, and now it's extremely popular but mostly children and teenagers have it.

I've also started to see the name Madison used more and more in sitcoms and movies. Typically the character named Madison is a bitchy, stuck up, entitled teenage girl who is obviously being played by an actress in her early to mid twenties. 

I'm also sick and tired of people trying to call me Maddie. I feel like it's the equivalent of trying to call someone named James, who is an adult, Jimmy. I'm a grown-ass adult woman. I don't want to be infantilized by being called a child's name. 

I'm engaged right now, and I've decided to change my last name when I get married (my reasons for disliking my last name or a whole other issue that I'm not going to get into). I figure while I'm at it, I might as well just change my first name too. I like the name Madeline. It's pretty close to my current first name, and I find that professionally a lot of older people who have only met me once before, upon meeting me a second time, always call me Madeline. I think it's because they associate the name Madison with small children, while Madeline is an adult name.

The other thing to consider is that I have a master's degree so legally changing my name means changing my name on both my undergraduate and master's degrees. I'm not too far into my career though, so I think that if I'm going to change my name if it would be better to do it now when I'm only in the first couple of years rather than 10 or 20 years from now on I'm established, tho I would have to reprint my business cards and get in touch with previous employers. I'm also worried about my mom being upset with me, and trying to explain it to my in-laws and my friends why they would be calling me Madeline. My fiance says he likes my name, that he thinks it suits me, and that he would respect my decision no matter what I decided to call myself. 

How difficult is it to get your name changed? And would it be easier if I legally change my first name at the same time I changed my last name when I got married? Should I announce my first name change at my wedding? Do I start sending out resumes and business cards with my new name? 

Damn, this got long, but I'd appreciate any advice anyone's willing to give me.",14Sep2018,1

14,"The title basically sums it up. I was in a terrible relationship for almost two years and all of my self confidence, independency, you name it went down the toilet because of him after we broke up. I've been with this other guy for over a year now, and he is wonderful in every way. He's helped me gain so much back, and I'm starting to become me again.

But my biggest problem is overthinking . And I mean overthinkiny everything. If he's a tiny bit mad I assume it's because of me, if my mum texts me and it sounds a bit different I instantly assume she's angry at me. I don't quite know how to describe it. Today I went to work after 4 days off and I'm really stressed out because of money. Ive got $8 to my name and next week when I get paid its all going to bills, the week after that will be okay but for now I'm worrying non stop, except I know I shouldn't because it's just a small bad patch. But it's everything I overthink about, to the point where its frustrating me and making me feel incredibly sad and down because I KNOW I'm overthinking but I can't help it.

I know this probably doesn't make any sense and I'm just rambling but I can't figure out how to put it into words. I talk to my partner about it and he's great but it would be nice to get someone else's insight, if anyone can help.

I have major depression, my teachers are boring and I used to love going to school, but this school has drained me, and I feel like if I leave people will talk smack and consider me stupid, but I just joined so my parents can see that I’m better than they give me credit for, they verbally abuse me, calling me lazy, dumb, ugly, primarily my stepmom, she raised me but she treats me like shit sometimes, and I feel like I’m making other people happy, except me. Me. I never put my self first, I never talk back, my confidence plummeted going to this school cause all those “smart” kids have big ass egos,  yet they do some dumb ass... things sometimes. 

I feel like girls are jealous of me to an extent, because they stare at my body shape and get red, workout in the afternoons running for hours so I have a good shape ig.

Part of me believes I have a shot, part of me believes I don’t.

Reasons why I think I could make it:

-One of the members already in the group can’t sing a note in tune and never had any training

-I’ve been performing since I was six, doing karate for 10 years, then being in a musical at 17. I’m now just turned 19. They want someone with good performance experience.

-I’m learning guitar. They are also looking for those who show a genuine love for and want to learn music

-Some of the other candidates I’ve already met are truthfully (sounds really egotistical) worse than I am. (I’m not the best though, not even close)

-The group itself has a spot open for my voice type. And I’m the only one auditioning (as far as I know) for said spot.

Reasons I may not get in:

-I can only read basic sheet music. (Part of the audition, albeit a tiny part is to read by sight. However, they did say they would do something different for those who can’t)

-Many of the other candidates are far more talented than I.

-As I said, I’m decent, not fantastic.

-I don’t know what other qualities the competition possesses that could give them an edge.

-40 people are auditioning, myself included, only 3 are being accepted. 

So what should I do? Back out now? Or keep going? Do I have any realistic shot at this?

We were violating the lease the entire time, I never saw the lease with my own eyes, so I do not know how many people were supposed to be living in the house on paper, but I know there were definitely more people than was allowed. To my knowledge, the lease was in his mother's name. Every time the landlord would come to work on something or check on something, we would either leave the house or camp out in our rooms. The landlord still does not know we are violating the lease.

&amp;#x200B;

My one roommate as well as his girlfriend, let's call him Dan, were living in the house prior to myself and the other roommates moving in. They were the ones that invited us to live with them, and as young adults in our late teens and early twenties, the roommates and I were eager to move in with them. The house was large, the rent was cheap and we were free to live without out parents telling us what to do. Dan, at the time of me moving in, was a friend. He used to bully me in junior high school, but as we got older we began to put our differences aside and become friends. At the time I actually thought Dan had changed as a person and living with him would be tolerable. It turns out that moving in with my former junior high school bully was a very bad idea. Dan would constantly threaten me all the time when ANYTHING was out of order, he was very obsessive compulsive about it. If I left a mess and walked away for 5 minutes, he would barge into my room and threaten to fight me over it. It was occasional and I tried to ignore it, but it got worse and worse and eventually became one of the primary reasons that I moved out, besides college. I genuinely felt unsafe living in this house.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, this entire agreement was verbal. There was absolutely no written contract. Rent was paid through Paypal. Not sure if it was illegal but definitely against the lease of the house. I left my room in mediocre condition after leaving, there were no damages but a few small stains. Dan is the kind of person that would immediately let me know if there were any problems, and he didn't. He watched me clean the room in person and said nothing about it, I left the house after moving my things out, and I thought I would receive the rent and this would be the end of it. He has lied and confused me on multiple occasions about when he would give me the rent. He told me he would send it two days ago and didn't. He is now saying I need to clean the carpet before he gives me the rent in cash. It was my understanding the rent would be sent over Paypal, but whatever, this was not unreasonable, so I agreed. The agreement still seems to stand but he has resorted back to bullying me and making me feel like shit over text. This has made navigating the situation emotionally burdening and very stressful.

&amp;#x200B;

I have sent him a message stating that I want to visually see the rent in person before I begin cleaning the room. I haven't checked if he responded or not yet.

  
What would you do in my situation? Should I go to the house, clean the room and get the rent? Is there anything legally I could do if he does not give me the rent? I definitely should not have gotten myself into this mess in the first place, but any advice would be appreciated. Thank you very much guys.

37,"I really want to quit my job and i think i also need to for the sake of my mental health.

Everytime i go into work, i feel sick and sad and stressed. It’s just bad all around! And it’s far away and honestly i have all the reasons to leave. 

But i love my team, they are great people and i don’t want to let them down, especially after accepting a new position as assistant manager. Even if i feel like they don’t take me seriously(don’t tell me stuff assistants should know ect, it’s like i’m not in the « circle » cause I’m part time) i feel like they need me and i swore i was gonna be able to give a lot of hours while in school.

I have a bad school schedule that prevents me from working enough. I feel like i’m being a bad person after promising i could do it when i obviously can.

I also hate the owner and hate working for such a bad person. So one part of me doesn’t care and another part cares about the managing team.

How do i get over that guilt? Because i will definitely eff them over for a while if i leave. I also have to give my two weeks i can’t just leave, how do i deal with being there because there might be tensions...

I have left jobs before but because i moved not because i was « sick of it » so i feel like it’s much different... sorry if i don’t make sense.",14Sep2018,1
38,"This is going to be long. Some of it is fucked up. I'm just going to let it all out, though. I have no idea what to do.

I joined this company several years ago. This coworker, we'll just call her Amanda, joined around the same time I did.

At the time I was a very depressed individual. I weighed 300lbs, had very few friends, and absolutely no social life (or social skills for that matter). Amanda befriended me almost instantly - she was into all of the same things I was, didn't care about my appearance or my obvious lack of social experience, and was just an all around attractive individual. I had a massive crush right out of the gate.

As time went on, I would hang out with Amanda frequently. Eventually another person joined the company, we'll call him Frank, and also instantly had a crush on Amanda. Frank was much more social than I was. He was attractive and lean, skilled in conversation, and Amanda took a liking to him. I was jealous of Frank.

Not long after Frank joined, we all went out and had beers one night. Frank, after having some beers in him, confronted me about my obvious crush on Amanda. I denied it and left, flustered. 

Amanda never had any romantic interest in me, but my romantic interest only grew. I made major life changes. At first, I made these changes purely because I wanted to impress Amanda. I lost 20lbs. Then 30, then 40 - after a year I was down 80lbs. I was now around 200lbs, much healthier, and much happier. My social skills were still lacking, but I was funny. I could be entertaining, and maintain good conversation. I was much better. I would tell myself that I made these changes because I wanted to be a happier person, and that was true, but I also lied to myself. I made these changes because I wanted to be with Amanda.

Amanda and Frank eventually screwed. It was a holiday, all three of us were out, and Amanda casually mentioned that Frank could ""sleep in her bed, it wouldn't be a big deal"" while we were out. She said it right in front of me, and it confused me. ""Was she just offering that to Frank? Is that offer for me too?"" - it was said in a manner that left room for me to imagine that that was a casual offer for both of us. I refused to believe the truth - which was that she was strongly suggesting to Frank that she wanted to fuck. 

Throughout that night we bar hopped and did various fun things. Frank drank too much and Amanda comforted him - held his hand crossing the street. Let him rest his head on her shoulder. I was completely blinded by jealousy. I was the biggest third wheel you could ever imagine, and I was in denial. I told myself it was all just coincidence. ""I'm reading too much into it,"" I'd tell myself.

Later that night we actually met up with Frank's brothers. One of his brothers ended up taking a liking to Amanda... and they made out. I saw it happen. Frank was visibly jealous.. but also pretended he didn't care. It was all the more confusing for me.

Until the end of the night, where we both ended up back at Amanda's and were sitting on her couch chatting. Frank said he was tired and went and laid down on her bed. She hinted strongly at me to leave. I did, and was devastated. Even I, in all my powerful denial, was certain that they fucked. 

I continued to lose weight. I continued to be friends with Amanda. Frank and Amanda never dated, but they remained much closer friends. Frank always had cool friends for Amanda to hang out and flirt with. I would never have that - I offered nothing.

Eventually Amanda got a proper boyfriend. Let's call him Sam. Sam was actually heavier than me, bald, and had a beard. At first glance he actually looked like a bald version of me. This confused me further. I had delusions about Amanda perhaps looking for someone who looked similar to me. Maybe she was interested in me after all? Is it possible I've just never made the move? Should I man up and ask her out? It's too late though, she has a boyfriend.

She went out with Sam for a few months. He was a nice guy. In hindsight he was actually the only friend of hers that I liked. He was calm, considerate, and encouraging. Frank continuously asked Amanda when she was going to break up with him. Eventually she did, a week before her birthday. She was visibly devastated. It was a rough breakup, and I felt bad for her. I think she felt pressured by Frank to break up with him. 

I came over one night and we hung out playing video games. At one point late in the night, I finally made a move... a pathetic one at that. I put my hand on hers. She took it away near instantly, and then said she was tired and needed to go to bed. I'm very good at lying to myself and told myself it was unrelated to my pathetic hand move. ""She didn't notice, it was brief - not a problem."" It, of course, was exactly because of that.

On her birthday I offered to hang out with her. None of her other friends were available, and she said sure. We went to a local bar and played some arcade games. Then she texted Sam. Sam wanted to meet up with her and ""just hang out,"" she instantly agreed. We met them at another bar and I was third wheeling once again. Sam and her made up that night, sent me home in an uber. 

I think she felt bad, so she invited me to a baseball game the next day with her, Sam, and another friend. It was fun. She took a selfie with me and I smiled. I liked the picture so much that I posted it on Instagram. I tagged her in it.

\*\*It was then that she started to get awkward around me.\*\* Frank commented on the picture with something passive aggressive, implying that he was left out. Amanda slowly stopped talking to me. First she'd say she's busy and can't talk. Then she wouldn't say anything. Then she wouldn't even make eye contact with me. 

This went on for a while and I reacted badly. This is where I started to do things that, I know, made her uncomfortable. I'd constantly invite her to hang out and she would say no. I'd try to sit with her at lunch and she'd leave. We both went to a friend's wedding anniversary and I walked up and initiated a hug - one that she was uncomfortable with. 

It went on for four months before, finally, I got the hint and stopped talking to her. That was until new year's eve.

Before New Year's Eve I reached out to Frank and asked if he had any plans. He said no, and that he was interested in hanging out. I asked Amanda and she said the same. I thought this was it - a chance to end the awkwardness and just be friends again. That morning I got a text from Frank letting me know that he'd text me when they were headed out.

Eventually 7pm came. Then 8pm, then 9pm. I texted Frank, asked him when we were going to head out. He replied they all decided to not hang out after all - that it was too cold. That was a lie, of course. I knew it. I found out the next day that they in-fact were all hanging out, right down the street from me, at Amanda's place. 

I was furious. Upset. Defeated. I felt used, humiliated, and tossed aside. My attempt at an olive branch was taken and lit aflame. I didn't care about Frank or his friends, I cared mostly about Amanda. 

Amanda texted me the next day. She said ""things have been awkward between all of us,"" referring to Frank as well, ""for a while. Can we meet and talk about it?"" I of course agreed to meet. The meeting would be at her place - between her, Frank, and I. 

The meeting went poorly, to say the least. Frank lead it. He asked me what I thought the problem was and I couldn't even formulate an answer. I asked him what he thought the problem was, and he told me. It was their impression that I had a crush on Amanda. They were right, but I denied it. I asked what gave her that impression. She seemed nervous, didn't want to recall anything specific - she said one time I touched her hand when we were playing video games. I, of course, knew exactly what she was talking about. Still I denied it. Frank spoke up and said something about me going in for a hug while they were out one night. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Still I denied it. I denied, denied, denied. They claimed they believed me - that it was all a misunderstanding.

Then Frank told me that they think I've turned into an asshole. I asked him to elaborate. He said that, after all of my ""physical changes,"" referring of course to my weight loss, that I've become overconfident. I was a worse person since I've lost weight. He even said, and I'll never forget this... ""Don't you think you were much happier before you lost weight?"" I turned to Amanda and asked if she agreed - and she did. ""To a lesser extent,"" whatever that means.

At the time this comment overshadowed everything that was said before it. I was furious and upset - but I didn't show it. I ended the conversation by saying ""I think it would be best if, from here on out, our relationship was purely professional."" 

I went home. I was upset. Distraught. Called sick into work the next day, and the day after that. On monday I went into work and was very uncomfortable being there. I didn't want to see Amanda or Frank, not after everything they said and did. I went to my manager. I told him everything that happened on NYE, and everything that was said in the meeting. He wanted to tell HR - he thought one of them would be fired. He was furious on my behalf. I let him do it. I was told to go home for a few days while HR conducted an investigation.

A few days passed and HR called me. They told me they were sorry this happened, and that Amanda and Frank were clearly upset at the ""misunderstanding."" They said they just wanted to be friends again and let it all end. I returned to work, but I never talked to Frank or Amanda again - for approximately 6 months.

Then Amanda started to be friendly again. Slowly. She said ""hey"" to me a few times. We both participated in some of the same work activities and started to interact a little more and slowly become friends again. Then we both ended up on... vacation together. A group of work friends (a few of us) planned a group vacation of sorts. I won't go into details, but it was a trip somewhere that we needed to train and prepare for. 

On this trip I ended up spending a lot of time with Amanda. More than either of us predicted. It wasn't romantic at all, and I'm proud to say I honestly thought my crush was in the past and we could just be friends. We spent too much time together, though. She became uncomfortable again. We were both the ""slowest"" in the group, so the rest went on to the head of the pack while we stayed behind toward the back. I spent too much time with her. I admit it.

Then came the fatal mistake. On our last night of camping (yes it was a camping trip), her tent was in shambles. She ripped a hole in it and ruined the entrance. She broke one of the poles that holds it up. We had 2 tents left - mine, which was a 2 person tent. Then another, which was a 4 person tent. The 4 person already had 2 people in it, and mine only had me... so I asked her if she wanted to stay in mine. I think this was too far. She quickly replied ""no,"" but I could tell she was iffed by the mere suggestion. She stayed in the 4-man tent.

After we returned from vacation she stopped speaking to me. If we both were going to the same event, she'd cancel. If I walked into the room she'd find an excuse to walk out. She stopped making eye contact with me, and stopped acknowledging that I was even there. 

I feel guilty. I feel horrible. I feel like a creep. A pathetic creep who doesn't deserve much of anything. Since my crush obviously returned, I'm just hopeless. I can't be friends with her without having those feelings... and even if I make an active effort to try and hide them, they always show in some way and she always catches onto them and becomes uncomfortable.

Do I quit my job and just leave? Do I even attempt to speak with her and resolve it? 

I want to just forget about her and move on, but she's always there. I hear her laughing in the halls. I hear her talked about and adored by other co-workers. I can't move on because she's always there. 

I've left a lot out of this story, believe it or not. What I didn't mention was that I've been promoted much quicker than she has. She's shown signs of being jealous and even resentful when I get promoted... Before the awkwardness, when I got my first promotion, she said ""Really?"" after I told her I got promoted. I let it go, because I'm pathetic. 

Do I ""turn myself in"" to HR? I'm a creep, right? I don't want to live with myself if I'm going to make people this uncomfortable.

54,"so a few years ago my dad got into contact with this woman online. she would drive 8 hours across the border to visit once they got to know eachother. i always got a bad vibe from her. i thought she was super clingy and obsessive and would always talk about how much she loves my dad or how much she loves me and my sister etc and it was weird but i just ignored it. (for reference i'm 20, this started probably when i was 17/18 and my sister is 2.5 years younger than me)

&amp;#x200B;

anyway fastforward a bit my dad ends up sending somebody some nsfw pictures of himself to someone that his friend introduced him to. so friend A came first. and friend B was also an online friend that my dad met through friend A. friend B was the one the photos were sent to.

&amp;#x200B;

friend B would end up blackmailing my dad. everytime something went wrong with my dad and friend A and when he told her she can't visit or when they weren't on good terms friend B would suddenly contact my dad and blackmail him. friend B's facebook profile is pretty sparse and not much can be dug up on her at all compared with what can be dug up on friend A. it's like she doesn't exist.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway basically friend A is obviously also friend B and clearly has some issues. my dad has finally set some boundaries and friend A is no longer visiting us anymore but he keeps in contact claiming that ""she's a good person"". it's become frustrating for me because it's quite obvious friend A is not a very good person and is in fact quite damaging and obsessive. I told my dad to block her and cut off contact (he had already emailed friends alerting them of possible blackmail coming their way so friend A has less leverage) but he says it's ""ignorant"" and won't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

i don't know what to do. he needs to cut off contact but he keeps trying to see the good in her despite her manipulations. if there is a better subreddit to post this in i will. and if i need to explain anything better i will answer any and all questions and edit the post as needed. i think relationships is the appropriate flair but if it isn't let me know.",14Sep2018,1

I tried to be respectful as possible and said I’d do a lot better , I also tried to apologize which he didn’t seem to accept ( which is reasonable since I’ve been an asshole.)


Anyway I’m gonna try and improve behavior, but what i really wanna do is go to his office and apologize for how I behaved to make sure it’s wholesome. But I’m really too much of a pussy to do so, Should I just behave better and hope next time I give off a good impression or should I go to him.

59," 22M. I'm having tough days in my life right now and I live away from my  hometown. All I want is to call my mum and tell her about my struggles.  But I just can't bring myself to do so. First, I rarely ever call my  parents and I actually feel bad about that because I know they love me,  and sometimes when I return home, my mum would tease me saying ""you  haven't called for so long, don't you miss your mother?"" This just shows  how she actually cared about me. The reason I rarely call them is  because I don't know what to talk about and I'm afraid it would be  awkward. Gosh, I'm so dumb. For my whole life, I've never really  expressed my feelings to my parents while my siblings don't have a  problem doing that. I'm the only awkward one. I usually just keep  everything to myself. But this time, I just feel a need to call my mum but  I'm afraid if I'm being insincere, that I only call her in time of need, but not anytime else when I'm okay. I don't wanna be that asshole. Ah, my brain is so messed up. I made a few attempts to call her before actually, but I didn't tell her about my struggles after all and it ended up with me just saying hello and asking her how she's doing, and there was a long pause during that call because I just don't know what else to say, and it ended up being just a short call. How do I cope with this? What should  I talk about with my mum when I call her? And how do I overcome this awkwardness?",14Sep2018,1

Being the shy girl I am, I didn’t talk to him that much but he caught me staring at him a few times, I’ve never felt my face getting hotter before those “few times”.

It’s been 2 weeks since I last saw him and i miss him so much, I’ve never cried for someone before but I cry my eyes out just thinking about him, I miss him so much that I sleep all day just to not feel like I’m dying, it’s even worse bc I can’t sleep at night and it makes not thinking about him harder, my heart ache so much that I feel like throwing up, nothing matters for me anymore knowing that there’s a good chance I’ll never see him again, ( my mom have some sort of business with him, so I know I’ll see him again but still!), I love him for real and even my mom noticed the change in me, she jokingly said “I think you’ve fallen in love so hard that you look high”.

69," 

Hello, I am currently a college freshman and I plan on studying EE with a focus on control theory or communication, and I have looked at the plan of study it requires around 130 credits to graduate and I came in from high school with around 50ish credits through AP, Dual credit, etc... so all of my general eds, university core,etc.. are completed or will by the end of my freshman year. So this leaves me with dilemma as the EE major only has around 28 required credit hours(everything else is selective/lab) and I can most likely get done a year early or more as I do plan on doing summer classes as well(I will definitely be doing this upcoming summer don't know about the future).

So I was wondering as the EE degree makes me take up all the way to diff equation and vector calculus, about adding a second major in applied maths with a focus on com sci or just applied maths in general. The reason for this that I am really passionate about math and that is one of the reasons I wish to study EE, especially control theory and communication as they involve a lot of math. Or I can try to do an MSEE in four years.

Which of these options do you think would be the best as career wise I am interested in a stem job but am also interested in financial(quantitive analysis mostly due to the mathematics).

70,"To make a very long story as short and sweet as possible I am a 27 year old male who has been living by himself since he was 18. I paid my own rent and bills and never had to rely on anyone even my parents. It took me four years to get an associates degree and I have been off of school for about a year and a half. I am looking forward to attending university, but because I live alone and pay everything myself it leaves little for studies.

My dad offered to let me stay with him rent free and I was very shaky because I did not want to lose my independence and personal space. The deal that we made was that I would not stay there rent free ( my decision because I believe that if I have money I should help) if I was given time and space away from him and his nosy wife.

No sooner than 2 weeks into our arrangement I am constantly being berated for stupid shit such as having the collar of my polo unorganized after I come home from work, constantly being called for anything, and I have my dad's wife constantly checking the contents of my room. Anything that she sees laying around or on a dresser or something is constantly being moved. 

They have two kids. One boy, who my dad's wife will ground and punish for any reason whose only joy in life is playing video games since my dad's wife constantly puts him down or screams at him for the most minor thing. The other one a girl who is constantly being praised for anything and has the same sociopathic tendencies of putting her own brother down not to mention that she gets away with anything and can say anything that she wants. My dad, being the quintessential nice person, never attempts to put things in order causing the girl to be like a third adult. 

yesterday my dad, his wife and I had the day off and we decided to clean the basement of their house. In the room that I am staying in I've had a very expensive processor on the drawer because my gaming desktop went haywire and I have had no time to fix it. Since July it has been on that drawer with no body touching or moving it. After spending all day cleaning I go downstairs to make sure that the piece is still there after I last seen in Monday.it's not. 

I discover that my Dad's wife went into the room and somehow moved the processor. Later that day she sends the little girl to get the stuff that she went into the room to ""get"" and I discover it on the floor chipped on one of the green sides. I am furious because the piece cost alot and this is not the first time that something like this happened.

This afternoon I catch up with the little girl and tell her that my piece was on the floor after one of them went down and I was blasted with apathy. This fucking 11 year old girl tells me ( most obviously after hearing one of my so-called financially responsible parents blast me on my gaming computer) that I was stupid for spending money on that dumb processor anyway and that she didn't touch the stupid thing. I tell that she should have respect for others things and that even if she didn't do it she shouldn't be calling my stuff stupid. She proceeds to keep on about it and I become furious going on a tirade about how her and her dumb mother are fucking disrespectful to other peoples things. I pack my stuff and go back home. 


Am I being petty for standing up to this? Am I wrong?",14Sep2018,5

72,"So I'm in college, and there's this girl I kinda like I guess we've hung out in orientation, and talked a bit. I bumped into her a few times on campus and we've talked on insta and snapchat a few times.

Ive wanted to go to a  film club cause it sounded cool. But I missed the first meeting cause I forgot about it and the second since I went to an event on campus. 

Anyways she posted a story on snapchat which clearly shows she's at film club, which I had no idea she was in. but I realize she saw me view it and itd probably be creepy if I go now, I told my roomate as a mistake I forgot he was an asshole, and he says hed yell in the class he'd say I was stalking her.

What do I do, ignore him and potentially be embarrassed? And even if I do go it could potentially be awkward cause she saw me view her story ..",14Sep2018,1
73,"Growing up, I was always very close with a girl that I will name Candice. By close, I mean we were best friends. We knew everything there was to know about one another, and would hang out consistently for around 11 years. This lasted up until around half a year ago. Just for your understanding, she and I are both in our early twenties right now. 

I want to start by saying that I would never stop being friends with someone due to mental illness, but when I strip the issue down to its core, that is exactly what happened. Our friendship went from happy and light, (with of course the occasional venting session and hormonal angsty teenage breakdowns), to very dark and dreadful. Not to toot my own horn, but I listened for hours upon hours upon hours about how devastating life was. Obviously this was very concerning, and I did reach out to the appropriate resources for Candice’s well-being. I, myself struggle with anxiety disorder. Just knowing that I had plans to hang out with Candice, I would sweat profusely and become extremely uncomfortable and upset. 

I was no longer getting any enjoyment out of our friendship. I understood that she was not well, but this was beginning to hinder my own wellbeing and my mental health. No one can have their own opinions, interests or individuality without her barreling into you like a ravaging animal. Anyway, after a few snappy comments, I took that as my way out and our friendship ended by my hand. I cut the strings.

My life has been so airy and free ever since. I feel like a new person. I haven’t enjoyed life and myself  this much in years and years. I hadn’t realized how much Candice dragged me down. I know what I did may sound harsh, and I do feel some guilt over it. It sounds bad to abandon someone while they’re ill, but man. There are endless details that I left out for anonymity reasons. 

Did I make the right decision?",14Sep2018,2
74,"I live in a unit with shared space (laundry, storage, etc.) with my neighbors.  My neighbors (an older couple) routinely store their things on top of mine and take over my portion of the space.  This was frustrating but not unbearable until they accidentally gave away a box full of all my winter clothing to Goodwill.  Apparently they were cleaning out their stuff, and since it had been placed on top of mine, they mistook it for a box of their clothing and gave it away.  No one realized until I tried to find the box a few months later, by then it was too late to get any of it back. 

The box contained a pair of nice winter boots and multiple really nice $70-$80 brand name sweaters that my Mom gave to me for holidays.  It also contained lots of other winter gear, Halloween costumes, and clothing items with a lot of personal significance that were given to me by family members that have passed away.  

I went through and inventoried the lost items, checked prices, and estimate that, in order to replace them all with \*new\* similar or identical items, I would need to spend around $600. 

My neighbors are regretful, and I appreciate that it was an accident, so I don't want to screw them over.  At the same time, I'd like to replace what was lost with similar, high-quality items. I'm struggling with whether or not I have calculated the value of the items correctly and what I should ask for from them. We've had a rocky relationship at times due to their lack of respect for my personal space, so I'm not particularly worried about offending them, though I also don't want to make things super awkward or uncomfortable.  

My neighbors are willing to replace the items, but their suggestion was that they give me a gift card to an inexpensive store they like to shop at to replace them, or to buy me several sweaters from that store and let me choose a few I like.  Both of these are nice gestures, but also feel a little unfair because the clothing would be lower quality, not replace everything I lost (winter boots, gloves, hat, etc.), and I would have less choice. 

I am really struggling with what to do in this situation and would love some advice. ",14Sep2018,2
76,"My parents weren't the best people. I can definitely say that. My father beat me and when he stopped he replaced it with slapping my ass and giving me the looks that gave me a shivers or just not looking at my eyes and instead focusing on other parts. My mother beat me and constantly berated me and said i belonged in a foster home. I don't want to become these people. 
I had at first thought of course i won't ever be like them but i slowly can't help but think that's exactly what ill become. People say i look so much like my mother and i hate it. Whenever me and my younger brother get into fights we get physically abusive towards each other. And yet for some reason although i know its not right i have the thought of 'he deserves it' no one deserves to be beaten but for some reason it just always pops up in the back of my head. 
I also am afraid to be alone with young children because I have intrusive thoughts of me harming them. I don't want to do any of that but it makes me nervous around them. 
My older brothers are too far gone in the path my parents took with them but I'm hoping i can still change. I don't want to be like them but my mother said she used to say the same thing about her parents. When she had beat me I yelled something along the lines of i would never do this to my own kid and she said that that was the same thing she thought.
Am i just destined to become what I hate or can i still change? How?",14Sep2018,1
77,"Beforehand, I was friends with these two girls (M - 18F &amp; K- 18F) and we were friends for over 4 years. We all became very close and very trusting of each other and basically the best of friends but then that all changed when I got a boyfriend.

I started liking my current boyfriend 3 years ago and we just recently rekindled our communication the beginning of the year. We really hit it off. Fun times, and absolutely worth the time spent. I thought I was living the life with having awesome grades, my first and current boyfriend, and having the best social life. 

Suddenly, problems initiated when summer came along. I continuously ask M &amp; K to hang out and spend time with me but they always turn me down because either they’re busy, said no, or said “I’ll think about it” or “I’ll call you” (but they never did obviously). So I assumed “okay maybe they need space from me or something” and so I just let them be and I started hanging out with my boyfriend and other friends every single day.

One day, they invited me to a dinner party months in advanced but they failed to give me the memo of the location of this dinner party even though I asked twice (the night before and the morning of the supposed dinner party). So, I didn’t bother on calling because it looked like they didn’t want me there. However, that night M&amp;K both called me (group call) and started telling me things I’m doing wrong like not asking them to hang out, spending time with my boyfriend/other friends, and losing communication. They also claimed that I was supposed to call them to invite MYSELF to this dinner party even though I wasn’t hosting the gathering. 

I kept my streak on Snapchat with them. One day my boyfriend sent a funny Snapchat of us just having fun and hiking to all of my streaks (including them). They BOTH replied and said “Stop sending this stupid crap. Idc. Gross” when this was the first time that I’ve ever shared my boyfriend and i alone time with them. It broke my heart actually, I cried non stop for two weeks of my summer vacation. I felt that they didn’t support my relationship because all they did was criticize me whenever I would even talk to my boyfriend. Even go as far as sending hurtful emails that I wasn’t making time for them when I was actually trying. I felt mentally and emotionally at my lowest because that really hurt. However what made me confused was when I asked other people who were in that group if I was balancing my time out between my friends and my boyfriend well they all said and reassured that I’m doing fine and I had nothing to worry about.

I didn’t invite them to my birthday dinner because I didn’t feel like it was right since they didn’t really take my feelings into consideration when I was really hurt and we haven’t hung out since and they didn’t reach out. I reached out once and said “hey let’s go to the gym” and their reply was “I’ll put a pin on it”. So I just didn’t invite them. 

K wished me a happy birthday but M didn’t. K asked if we were cool and I agreed. K continued instigating me of why I didn’t invite K AND M and I just bluntly told them the reason.   K started instigating an actual argument even though it was my birthday, I was insulted and they blamed all the problems that we had on me with no fault coming from them of course.

Then school came, M &amp; K start talking about me to the entire world, depicting me as this selfish person who only cares about her boyfriend, using them as an excuse to be with my boyfriend because I’m “not allowed to date” (COMPLETE LIE), starting group chats to talk about me, telling my partner that I’m fake, telling my bestfriend since 6th grade that I’m a terrible person, spreading my sex info that I told when we were friends to everyone, and the list goes on. Although everyone tells me about these things in which they all dont believe because all they do is talk about people, another reason I pulled away, it affects me because it hurts.

Recently M started talking to me about school and slowly implanted herself in my friend groups even though no one wants her there she just forcefully pushes her way in due to her own isolation from the fights she starts. I’m feeling way better and happier than before and I want to stay away but she keeps forcing her presence upon me. 

TL;DR! Toxic friendships escalated quickly that affected my life drastically and friends say I should tell someone with a higher authority about it. Should I? Or should I just ignore her all together? Need advice on what to do or say the next time she spreads another lie or gives me a snarky comment.

I wanted to do design. I love art.  I love drawing and making things.  I love playing around with Photoshop and making things. I love technology and games. I love it all.  The only thing that deterred me was coding.  But the thing is I could have gotten help.  I could have bought a computer that was meant for designing and drawing rather than a stupid laptop that can't even run word.  I want to change that, I was thinking of going on a plan to get an iPad or a tablet to help me with the drawing side but I know squat about tablets because I wasn't allowed to even think about looking at them as a teenager-but I know you can do that stuff via tablet, and the most popular one I've seen was the ipad. 



I was wanting to change to a course that's design based, or art based I'm not too sure, I was thinking of making the trip into my campus and talking to them about it, they said they'll need a portfolio the last time I enquired which I can easily do for when I plan to start going back to college, I want to go to orientation day and check out what my college offers. 



I need encouragement, advice on what I'll need to do first. I'm scared I'll do the wrong thing, go into debt for the wrong thing. I don't want to go on a plan if it turns out I don't need it or will need something else entirely.

94,"hi everyone,

thank u for taking the time to read my post;

i am glad if u can provide any advice!!!

so it really does feel like my life is headed for the worse haha. seems like everyone i know or everywhere i go i get in trouble for doing nothing haha. mm i guess i don't know where to really start except i come from a broken home. my parents argued everyday, my dad was alcoholic and violent, and my mother is emotionally abusive. today I've hit the tipping point i guess. i am seriously depressed and i need help. i often wonder why they hate me so much. by hate, i mean they would name call me everyday, laugh at me when i get hurt, force me into fights, or get me in trouble (reporting me to someone). they would often lie to me or hit me. i wonder a lot why this is. i think i am quiet and respectful. i don't really criticize, judge, blame, laugh at others. yet i feel like i did something wrong. i really wonder why they hate me (they do).

sorry if i don't know where I'm going with this. i guess I'm just venting at this point. 

you might ask what do you mean ur mom is emotional abusive?

she lies to me, laughs at me when I'm crying, reports me to teachers, name calls me, whatever u can think of. one time it really hurt when my mom called me homeless while i just woke up walking around. don't want to make this into a sob story or make my mom look bad. I'm just putting it out there.

you might ask what do you mean ur dad is abusive?

alot of days i would wake up to him barging into my room drunk, throwing my stuff around, and yelling at me for hours. one time on fourth of july my father woke me up while i was sleeping and ignored me, then proceeded to yell at me, spit on me, call me a f\*ggot. another time my parents kicked my door (broke it), took all my shit, threw it on the ground, and yelled at me for another few hours. sometimes him and mom would both spit on me or push me around or hit me or force me into fights with other ppl. just some times. sorry if i sound like I'm making my dad look bad, but this is how it is.

i feel like they are willing to lie to me, hit me, yell at me, name call me for forever. i wish it wasn't like this. to this day i don't know what i did wrong. I've been getting nightmares cause i wake up to all this shit. some of u might not care, i hope u stop reading here. I'm financially broke, my parents want to control everything i have and ever will have, and they are willing to break it at anytime. i wish it wasn't like this. i don't think i did anything wrong. they really do hate me, don't say they don't. 

I'm going back to college for my sophomore year and i hope i don't get sent to the deans office again (haha) and i hope i can muster up the courage to make some friends (haha). would say my first year wasn't too good (haha). roomies were a little bit annoying.

today i sit here, still sad about all this shit haha. i still wonder if i offended them somehow. i wonder if they would miss me if i were gone. i really do wonder if they would miss me. i tried my best in everything they asked me to do. i tried my best in school, some martial art thing, anything they asked me, but they still want to bully me everyday. i wish they would ignore me for my whole life instead or kick me out of the house. i can't shake off the feeling that if i were gone they wouldn't care. i wish i had friends i could talk to about this, but its really awkward making friends. ppl I've talked to seem to not listen to me. 

well i don't know what else to say haha. if you have any advice i would appreciate it. in the past I've gotten advice like get a job, ignore them, cope with it, talk to them about it, go to therapy. i tried a lot of things haha, they seem to not work after awhile. i would appreciate any new advice!!! thanks for reading!!! bye-bye!!!

TL;DR: came from a broken home, at my tipping point, going back to college soon. mom and dad actually hate me, do things like get me in trouble, hit me, lie to me, yell at me, spit on me, push me, break my things. don't have anyone to talk to. wasting time doing nothing productive. I'm broke. I'm wondering why this is all happening. I'm quiet, keep to myself, don't criticize or judge others. tried my best in what they asked. tried my best in school. life is headed for the worse. i love my parents, i still have feelings (haha funny i know) for them and i want to make amends, but they do everything looks like hate.",14Sep2018,1
95,"Throwaway BTW TL;DR @ Bottom  


Backstory:  
So I started to date a girl in senior year of high school and things got pretty serious. Some circumstances led to her living with me for a few months as soon as we graduated. During those months we had a rocky relationship that started with us not being together then getting together and it ended with us breaking up and her moving out. However we stayed in touch and still being intimate. Fast forward about a year later due to other circumstances shes moved back in. She wants to get back into a relationship with me while I don't. I don't want all the commitments that come with a relationship. I still love her and I consider her my best friend but at times I just want to be alone and not have to deal with anything. I was honest with her when I told her why I didn't want to be with her. 

  
Fast forward to today and I'm still not content with what we have. I don't enjoy spending time with her that often (since we don't have much in common besides movies) and I would rather spend that time by myself doing what I want. I understand that it is very selfish of me especially after I've been so present in her life thus far and it is the reason I don't want to commit to any kind of relationship. I do love her and will definitely be there for her in emergencies but I feel like her everyday needs revolve around me too much. I can't sit with her and think about life or have spiritual talks or go on long walks to random places it just doesn't suit me. She knows that by now but still demands all these things from me  based on the fact that I love her (which she questions everyday). So what I'm asking is how do I balance this out? Also am I a dick? There are a lot of little details to be added but I figured having strangers pick apart this situation might help me see something I'm missing. Thanks in advance.  


TL;DR  


I love a girl but don't like spending much time with her since we don't enjoy much of the same things but she wants to spend a lot of time with me. How do I come to some sort of balance while keeping my own time intact? Also am I a dick?",14Sep2018,1

I really want to get a job that helps me go in the right direction on the path I want to take in life.

98,"Beforehand, I was friends with these two girls (M - 18F &amp; K- 18F) and we were friends for over 4 years. We all became very close and very trusting of each other and basically the best of friends but then that all changed when I got a boyfriend.

I started liking my current boyfriend 3 years ago and we just recently rekindled our communication the beginning of the year. We really hit it off. Fun times, and absolutely worth the time spent. I thought I was living the life with having awesome grades, my first and current boyfriend, and having the best social life. 

Suddenly, problems initiated when summer came along. I continuously ask M &amp; K to hang out and spend time with me but they always turn me down because either they’re busy, said no, or said “I’ll think about it” or “I’ll call you” (but they never did obviously). So I assumed “okay maybe they need space from me or something” and so I just let them be and I started hanging out with my boyfriend and other friends every single day.

One day, they invited me to a dinner party months in advanced but they failed to give me the memo of the location of this dinner party even though I asked twice (the night before and the morning of the supposed dinner party). So, I didn’t bother on calling because it looked like they didn’t want me there. However, that night M&amp;K both called me (group call) and started telling me things I’m doing wrong like not asking them to hang out, spending time with my boyfriend/other friends, and losing communication. They also claimed that I was supposed to call them to invite MYSELF to this dinner party even though I wasn’t hosting the gathering. 

I kept my streak on Snapchat with them. One day my boyfriend sent a funny Snapchat of us just having fun and hiking to all of my streaks (including them). They BOTH replied and said “Stop sending this stupid crap. Idc. Gross” when this was the first time that I’ve ever shared my boyfriend and i alone time with them. It broke my heart actually, I cried non stop for two weeks of my summer vacation. I felt that they didn’t support my relationship because all they did was criticize me whenever I would even talk to my boyfriend. Even go as far as sending hurtful emails that I wasn’t making time for them when I was actually trying. I felt mentally and emotionally at my lowest because that really hurt. However what made me confused was when I asked other people who were in that group if I was balancing my time out between my friends and my boyfriend well they all said and reassured that I’m doing fine and I had nothing to worry about.

I didn’t invite them to my birthday dinner because I didn’t feel like it was right since they didn’t really take my feelings into consideration when I was really hurt and we haven’t hung out since and they didn’t reach out. I reached out once and said “hey let’s go to the gym” and their reply was “I’ll put a pin on it”. So I just didn’t invite them. 

K wished me a happy birthday but M didn’t. K asked if we were cool and I agreed. K continued instigating me of why I didn’t invite K AND M and I just bluntly told them the reason.   K started instigating an actual argument even though it was my birthday, I was insulted and they blamed all the problems that we had on me with no fault coming from them of course.

Then school came, M &amp; K start talking about me to the entire world, depicting me as this selfish person who only cares about her boyfriend, using them as an excuse to be with my boyfriend because I’m “not allowed to date” (COMPLETE LIE), starting group chats to talk about me, telling my partner that I’m fake, telling my bestfriend since 6th grade that I’m a terrible person, spreading my sex info that I told when we were friends to everyone, and the list goes on. Although everyone tells me about these things in which they all dont believe because all they do is talk about people, another reason I pulled away, it affects me because it hurts.

Recently M started talking to me about school and slowly implanted herself in my friend groups even though no one wants her there she just forcefully pushes her way in due to her own isolation from the fights she starts. I’m feeling way better and happier than before and I want to stay away but she keeps forcing her presence upon me. 

TL;DR! Toxic friendships escalated quickly that affected my life drastically and friends say I should tell someone with a higher authority about it. Should I? Or should I just ignore her all together? Need advice on what to do or say the next time she spreads another lie or gives me a snarky comment.

102,"We've had little Stanley for about a year now, he's a great fish that has had sort of a rough go from the start. I didn't think either of us would wind up caring so much about the little guy...

But today I arrived home to my bf nearly in tears, which almost NEVER happens. It turns out our lil guy might be heading to the big fishbowl in the sky any hour now. He's had iffy nights like this before, but always pulled through... tonight he just seems too tired. I drove my boyfriend to work a few hours ago, and he barely spoke the whole way there. He completely blames himself for not taking good enough care of the fish. Personally, I think he's done a fine job, but knowing my boyfriend, hes going to beat himself up regardless.

I know Stanley's just a fish, but he's also not. I shit you not, this fish has a soul and a great sense of humor. Watching him build nests and blow bubbles has made me fall in love with his scaly ass.

This good boy has a one way ticket to fishy heaven, and it's super sad to see him go. But it's making me even more sad to see how heartbroken my boo is and not know what to say.

105,"Earlier this year, I did something horrible to a friend and ruined our friendship. I made some decisions that affected the both of us, but at the time I didn’t consider her feelings, or rather I thought my feelings were more important. I never really apologized to her properly and just let the friendship end as I selfishly benefited from the decision I made. 

I haven’t seen her since and she’s blocked me on all platforms. It’s 9 months later and I think about her everyday. I think about how I just abandoned this person who cared about me because I was so concerned with myself. 

What happened between us really does not have any room of reconciliation, I don’t think. I think our relationship is just far too damaged and I’m completely at fault. 

The thoughts of what I did to her are plaguing my mind as of late. I want to so badly write her a letter and let her know that I’m so sorry for what I did to her. 

What stops me is that I’m worried that me contacting her will only hurt her and remind her of the pain I caused. 

I also feel like me apologizing to her may be a form of closure for myself. I’m worried that me sending her the letter is just a way for me to forgive myself and I don’t know if I deserve that. 

So I’m asking for advice here. What would be the best form of action? Should I reopen this wound and tell her how much I regret being an awful person to her? Or should I walk away and find another way to cope? I just don’t want to hurt her more by sending her this letter...",14Sep2018,1
107,"I’ve always been very interested in philosophical ideas and pondering them on my own. When I was 16 I believe I bit off more than I could chew without knowing how to handle an extremely perplexing philosophy. The theory being solipsism. If you know what this is you will understand my struggle with the consent.

For those who don’t know about solipsism. Essentially it is believing you are the creator of your world. Everything you currently are experiencing is due cause of your brain creating things for your conscience. You are on a treadmill with a VR headset showing you images  as you move along. 

When I turned 17, I tripped on 2 tabs and it went awfully awry. I had a trip that I was effectively not prepared for or matured mentally enough for. An ego death for those of you who know about psychedelics. It broke my brain. For a year I struggled with what was and was not reality and if there was even a reality. I couldn’t smoke weed anymore and that had been a huge anxiety relief for me for a while then. Nothing made sense, I couldn’t leave my bedroom without breaking down and losing my mind in an abstract shit show. As I grew up I started to become accustomed to my new found ability to over analyze EVERYTHING. I started to feel normal again. 

What I hadn’t realized is that for an entire year I had neglected my social skills and my prior mental illness. I had lost a large portion of my prior ability to relate and communicate with my peers. I’m a senior now. It’s my last year of high school. All I want is for it to be a good year so I can’t live in peace. The biggest issue I’m having is with relating to people my age. 

I think this is directly related to me feeling as though they’re beneath me intellectually. Also of course of overall inability to find a way to make anyone I talk to feel uncomfortable. Even on reddit I have a huge problem being heard. Maybe it’s my wording. Maybe it just my personality. Regardless I just want to learn how to be human again and relate to them in general.

I do, but he still brings her out I guess to make sure she doesn’t have to go) but anyways he had brought her out to the front yard and I said something along the lines of “How many times have I asked you not to bring her out front without a leash, it really makes me uncomfortable” and he said “when you have kids of your own you can tell them what to do. You’re not even my child” ouch, that stung. I don’t know what to do, I’m so hurt because he’s not wrong, I’m not his child but why would he say that to me.

I feel very naive at this moment for letting myself be so vulnerable around this person. I have only been with 5 other people sexually and he and one other are the only ones I’ve had repeated sex with with no condom; everyone else were one time things. The guy I’m seeing has been with 10 others and said he was clean. I trusted him. We’ve begun having sex two weeks ago without protection.
Now we are just going with the flow of things but I feel serious about him and I thought that he was serious about me too till today. 
Last night we spoke and I asked him to just tell me if he plans on seeing other people and he turned the conversation around on me and told me I shouldn’t be fixated on him and that he wouldn’t feel offended if I saw other people... 
We have been talking all day today but it felt different. He wasn’t talking to me normally as he does in-depth. 
I had dinner with my best friend who casually goes out with us on Thursdays to a bar to play pool. 
My friend told me her and the guy I have been seeing have been messaging all day and I asked to see the texts... they were having full blown in-depth conversations about all sorts of things.

112,"Ok so first of all i'm 19 and i'm a guy who's in his first year at college studying Computer Science. I have waited over two years after I graduated from high school when i was 17 years old to go to college due to my parents never having the money up until now that they can finally support me. And now that I literally just started since last week I feel like i'm not focused, whenever I attempt to start studying and get grinding in the night my mind would space out at any opportunity it gets and I would feel a desire to go watch porn and masturbate. Whenever I fight the urge to give in I end up procrastinating and wasting time. I try giving in to my urge to get over it but I ended up feeling sleepy and I would have a hard time thinking straight and remembering anything that I attempt to study. So apparently giving in doesn't work for me. 

I think why its so hard to quit porn is because I've been doing this as far back as when I was 12 years old, Growing up girls would like me but I never found those ones to my liking and so according to them I didn't want anyone and came off as a loner which was probably true at the time I wasn't interested in investing time and energy into having a girlfriend I saw it more of a chore and enjoyed quick perverted digital pleasures instead. And I don't have any friends either, my output on this is that friendship doesn't exist, people come and people go the ones who claim to be friends are only there when you have something that they want such as money or the hype life. And I also think keeping up certain image/portraying the illusion that you have it all going on for you in life and that your life is perfect is too exhausting and full of shxt. Which is why I don't do that instagram/facebook shxt. 

Sorry about the rambling I seem to be getting into.

Its just my parents give me huge unhealthy dinners. So usually I'll eat a lighter lunch. But I'll still finish my food. My friend after a week of eating with her asks me if I was anorexic. She asked me this as i was eating chicken. Obviously i said i wasn't and i was telling the truth. She started ranting about how girls are self conscious and the topic moved on. 

Today i was eating a sandwich from the school cafeteria. She was yelling at me to eat as i was chewing. So i told her dude i am eating. She continued more talking about how i should eat and how eating is unhealthy. Then she processed to call me unhealthy. This pissed me off because i have been working a lot on my mental health and self betterment. So i said you don't  know if im unhealthy. She then snapped saying fine i don't care if youre unhealthy.

Context: She broke up with her ex a week after us meeting. The relationship was toxic and she felt a lot of sexual pressure and feels guilty about it. He was also a deadbeat stoner without a high school diploma. We started out as lab partners then turned into cuddle buddies which I thought would turn sexual, but because of her past relationship I was clear that I didn't want to pressure her into having sex. 

She told me she wants to take it slow and if sex happens (when we get back to the city) then it happens.

It is great, but when I turned 18, I'm no longer a dependent of my father's so they ask for proof of income statement and such. 

During the summer, I work quite a bit so that I can pay for school tuition, pay back student loans, live, etc. But it is at the end of the summer when they ask me to submit my income slips and such. 

I really don't have enough money to start paying for rent, I have mountains of debt (over 10k accumulated from credit cards and student loans) that I need to pay back. I live at home for this reason. 

I understand that I'm in a lucky position where I can get subsidized housing for my family. However, I have no idea how to move forward because they have asked for my income statement again, and the last three months I have been working the most, so it's highly skewed. I don't know how to proceed. Has anyone gone through this or have any advice? I feel like the people managing don't really care for my story, they'll just look at the numbers.

Thanks again.",14Sep2018,1
129,I have a coworker who leaves 20-30 minutes everyday for well over a year. Should I tell my boss about this or should I keep it to myself? ,14Sep2018,0
130,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.
So I met this guy a few weeks ago who's probably two years older than me. I'm a small but muscular female freshman, hes a tall but scrawny junior? Cant confirm. Basically, after knowing him for only a few days, he got extremely touchy and clingy. He overshare about his personal life in a way that comes off as him expecting me to take care of him, and with everything I'm doing this year, I dont have time for that even if I was willing to do it. It made me uncomfortable from the start that he touched me (no sexual contact, though) without my permission. While you could argue that because I didnt explicitly refuse at first, it still gives him no right. Hes mostly touchy about my legs, which bothers me a lot, and he gets way too close to me in situations where we could be as far as 10 feet apart. He gets ""upset"" if I dont respond to his texts, and if he aske a question and I dont respond he assumes my answer. While I do have a friend who's willing to block him from sitting near me and I do have a room I could go into for lunch, I cant eat in there and friend can only cover me on one side. 
Now its probably a good idea to mention that I hardly trust anyone touching me at all. This is because I've dealt with abusive friends and it's made me incredibly jumpy and sensitive to touch. Also, I'm a huge germaphobe. So basically, if someone I dont trust/like touches me, I will probably jump and brush that area off, looking visibly uncomfortable. I never gave this guy permission to touch me and the only reason I haven't been firm is because he has mental issues that I want to be very cautious with. While I was firm enough, I was still gentle enough so as to not scare/upset him into potentially hurting/starving/killing himself.
So I decided it was beyond my control. I told a senior who's very sweet and friendly and is a class TA/important in programs that I trusted and knew would content the two teachers who could help me deal with this. I talked it out with them, they contacted security, I wrote up my statement and mentioned that he needed a counselor to help with his issues.
Everything's great, right? 
No. See, I have a class with him for the whole year. I cannot avoid him. It's my homeroom, too, so I go to that class every day. 
Issue 1: Awkward. Every day, awkward. Every time we pass each other, awkward. How do I deal with it being so awkward?
He also has multiple friends (who hes also touchy-feely with) that think hes just a sweet dude. And he is. But he needs help and to learn boundaries. 
Issue 2: those friends probably won't understand why I did this or think I'm overreacting. I'm not. It wasn't even my idea to report it, it was the senior-who-i-mentioned-earlier's idea. No big deal, right? Nope. For one, high school drama (which I want none of ever, by the way) spreads fast. Stories get twisted. One of us looks like a monster, big drama or something. Is there any way I can deal with/avoid this?
Another issue, hes got a lot going on. No appetite, bad home situation, missing parental figure, lonely, stressed, depressed. 
Issue 3: if he hurts/starves/kills himself, Hell, even if he falls deeper into depression, that gets blamed on me. Of course I'll feel bad, but I'm not responsible for his actions or how he takes it, but of course there'll be some guilt and it'll probably look like I'm bitchy. I'm not. I care about him, but there was underlying issues. How do I deal with this?
Final issue. 
Issue 4: what do I do if he twists the story?

So in conclusion (my advanced English teacher would hate me for that. My ""arguementative-essays-are-my-life"" personality hates me for that, and I willingly wrote it), how do I make this as easy as possible on all involved parties?
Just ask if more info is needed, I will do my best to respond to all comments.

I want to just keep being a good friend and be there for her but I don’t know if I can.

136,"I have devoted myself to work most of my life, and in that area I have done exceptionally well. I certainly did not have the best relationship with my wife or my son. In honesty, I think now that I have behaved lousily. Our marriage worked well until she got sick. It was chronic and caring for her took me away from what I wanted to do, after the first two years it started to cost me professionally, and I resented her for it. It was not right of me to feel that way and there is nothing I can ever do to fix that.  


By the time that she died the relationship between my son and I had deteriorated quite a lot. Still, for the most part, I thought everything between us was going to be alright. We argued sometimes and I never thought he was willing to work as hard as a man should, but I left him alone about it. When I found out he'd gotten a girl pregnant is where the big problem started. I have never been angrier in my life. I'll never forgive myself for how cruelly I talked to him, and to his credit, what he was able to say back to me shot me in the heart.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I worked hard every day of my life, my company became my family.  Well, he married the girl a couple years later and they live together still. So whenever I think about that now it makes me happy. I tried to reconnect about six years ago. I bumped into his wife at a store. I could tell she didn't know who I was so I started chatting with her and told her who I was. She said that my son was in the store over and that we should talk and sit down nearby and eat. I was feeling very hopeful about it. As soon as he saw me he looked disgusted. She was trying to get him to talk to me but he refused.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a nephew that I still talk to sometimes and who my son is close to. So I've been keeping up to date on them through him. Work has petered out over the years and none of the people I used to work with are around. Many of them are dead now, and as I get older I realized I bet on the wrong horse. Years of hard work and a comfortable living is not enough to make me happy. I am over the hill now, and I'm not much in touch with how the world is changing, this is not even my account. One guy I work with said he knew somewhere I could ask advice.

139,"I'm 20 now. I feel like I've learned a lot about myself these past couple years.

I kind of coasted through highschool and overall was told I was gifted even though I didn't work very hard. I got national merit finalist which gave me a scholarship to a state college which covered most of it, then proceeded to throw my scholarship away by not going to class half the time and just staying in my room as I failed to develop the study habits I needed. I changed my major once but I didn't like either, but who knows how I would feel if I actually took it more seriously. I did the bare minimum to get B's and sometimes A's in easier classes while playing as many games as possible, and then when things got tough for me in Calc 3 and Physics I just avoided the obstacle and retreated into playing more games and going to class less and less. 

I left the University to come back home. The original plan was to join the military since it was clear to me and my parents I am aimless and need discipline (chairforce reserves), but I was rejected outright because I had hypothyroidism, so I worked at a grocery store for like 5 months to pay off my rent from the house I left in the State University's town (my housemate's dad threatened to sue us if we didn't because we broke lease by me leaving, so I had to). 

Now I'm staying with my parents. I more or less feel like I failed my year and a half at university. I didn't give it my all, but saying this to others is useless because who cares right? **I've basically come to the wall that nobody in the world actually cares unless you do things**. Having potential is actually meaningless because everyone has massive potential, and now I just feel like a loser.

I just studying business administration now and will probably switch to finance. My study habits are the same but I can make As and Bs again because the classes are easy because it's a community college. I'm just coasting again and not challenging myself. I imagine my life doing finance or something and I hate it so much. I want so much to be passionate or work for something but I'm so lazy. Everything I've ever accomplished in my life I did in like a day or was pushed into it by somebody else to actually work at it for a while. What I deeply want more than anything is apply myself to a passion and make something of it. 



How can I explain that my life has been mostly downhill and that my current life strategy is just to do the bare minimum to probably have a decent paying job and then die. I'm so unhappy with this. It's not enough. I can't let other people accept me like this because I don't accept me like this. How do I become a more respectable person?",14Sep2018,1

Now, I asked for advice regarding this online on Reddit in a few subs and the answer was unanimous. Its very mannerless and uncivilized, so you should not attend such places.

165,"We moved from Chile to Spain 15 years ago because my father didn't have a job and had a great job opportunity here in Spain. Besides, he always loved Spain and hated Chile. We ended up in a relatively small city (40k people) and things went well for a while.

I moved out of home a few months ago when I turned 30. My brother (28), my sister (21), my parents and my grand mother still live together.

My father is the problem here. He works on IT but never really put in the effort required to become better at his job. After a few years in Spain, his company started firing people and they got rid of him. He took it hard because they ended up ""owing him"" money, even though he wasn't really producing anything and didn't even have a contract.

After he left that company, he found another guy around and started a ""partnership"", although it was unofficial. Three years went by, and his partner started withholding money, denying him work with clients, etc. My guess is that his partner realized that my father's skills weren't worth it so he decided to cut him loose, and one more time, my father ended up with money owed to him and no job.

And we got to the present. He's 61yo and, obviously, is finding it very hard to find a job. My mother is really anxious because she says that ""after all the sacrifices he made, it's really unfair for him to be without a job and with people owing him money"".

And this is where I draw the line. I work on IT too, and I've realized years ago that my father wanted the ""easy"" job, ie, ""learn skill, do your job, done"". But he was never willing to learn new skills, so he got stuck, and started blaming the world for it. Small city = very small world.

When he was 45 he had already shown he would rather make *me* work on his personal projects instead of doing it himself in an attempt to build something ""together"". The whole ""you are younger and I'm your father so you are supposed to help me"". Needless to say, we ended up fighting and I found myself a real job, and he took it hard.

Later on he would work from home and, give I lived with him, I got asked a lot to assist him, and he wouldn't understand that I didn't want to work on his stuff or on his projects and that it was *his responsibility to do his damn job, not mine*. I couldn't even lay on the couch on a Saturday afternoon without running the risk of being asked ""are you busy? I'd need some help on this...""

Manipulative and out of place... of course I'm not busy, I'm chilling because I've worked all damn week and  I don't want to do your job. And each time I explained this to him, he took it badly...

That being said, my mother has a solid job, my grand mother has a pension, my brother works, and we have a few properties in Chile that we can sell and/or rent. We are all in good health, but he's just ""tired"" and doesn't want to put in the effort anymore, and my mother supports him and ""enables"" him on this.

Another thing that infuriates me is that there *are* jobs around. A Chilean friend of ours in our city works for a nearby factory and has a great salary and job stability. My father had the chance to ask for a job there, but he said **he would never work on a factory!**

He just got a job offer from a company 250 miles away from our city, and now my mother is anxious because a) if he takes it, they would have to move to another city and start over again, b) they are too old to start over again, and c) he doesn't want to move there.

In all of this, I have a nice job, a nice place, and my mother tries to guilt me into finding my father a job in my current company... I f* hate this. My father got what was coming to him and he's responsible for it, not ""the world"". And I'm sort of put on a position of ""guilt"" because I may be able to help, but I don't...

168,"I love math and I love programming. I like the ideas I come up with and the problems that I have to face when coding. I like how I can continuously experiment with an idea in math and discover new and weird things. When I'm on lunch break at my minimum wage job, my co-workers constantly tell me about how I should be in some IT department getting paid more.

People don't realize that most of these computer jobs require degrees. So the solution is to just go into college, right? The thing is I already did and I did terrible. I got a D and a B in the two classes I didn't withdraw from halfway through the semester. The other two I got a big W on.

I left college after 1 semester because I felt so incompatible with it. I was so frustrated with how they try to mold you into the image that they want to see, not what you want. It's about them and it's about $$$. So now I reserve my Math learning to Khan Academy which is great and all, but employers don't give a flying 🦆 about how many videos I watch on there. If I don't have that Bachelor's degree, then they don't want me.

Certifications would be an obvious option, but those still require me to pay large amounts of money to these scumbags so that I can get something that raises my chances of employemt  by so little. Trade schools and so on also require me to sell my liver to the Sun Gods in order to get in.

I am so frustrated with how colleges expect me to pass all of these classes my first time through. Businesses create absurd demands for perfect A and B students and refuse to take anyone that has a few C or D classes here and there. I can't get on board with this ideology that schools support.

It's been like this for a really long time and I don't know how to help her anymore. I've tried countless times to convince her that everything will be fine if she just goes to school and that she can do it. She has been to a counselor a couple of times but that doesn't seem to help either. 

The problem is that I don't see and end to this anymore and I'm afraid she will get stuck like this for years to come. Doesn't help that I end up fighting with my parents every time I bring it up as well.

173,"**Background story:**

  I went out with my roommates on a Friday night and one of the girls got very drunk (roommate #1). When we noticed how drunk she was, we (roommate #2, #3, and I)  decided to leave but she didn't want to because she was talking to some guy. She was too drunk to make any rational decisions so we hold her hand and guided her outside, but the random guy decided that he was going to go back home with us. He wasn't nearly as wasted as our girl so he must have known what he was doing. I didn't think he was serious so I ignored him. 

On the way out, roommate #2 suggested to grab food before going home, and the guy then volunteered to take us to a ""close"" place he knew. When I asked him the name of the place he said he didn't remember. Then I asked him to show me the location on google maps and he refused by coming up with a lame excuse. He then tried to grab my roommate #1 and take her out through the back door in the bar which led to an ally. 

I saw all of these as red flags! I didn't let him take her and called roommate #3 for help (guy). My roommate then came and took all 3 of us outside to the front of the bar and the guy followed us. We told him he couldn't come with us because we were going home and we didn't know him. He started acting very forceful with us, and we walked away hoping he would just give up but he didn't. 

A block later, the creep and my guy roommate were about to get into a fight because of how forceful and stalkerish he was being with us. We even threaten to call the cops and it didn't scared him. 

So my roommate #2 decided to give him our R's #1 number so he could text later hoping that it would drive him away and it did. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The present:**

  She doesn't remember that night and despite of what everyone told her about that creep, she decided to still talk to him. Why? I have no idea.

Them hanging out doesn't really bother me because it's her life. My issue is his presence. He has been over twice and I want to say something about it but I don't know if I should.

 I felt threaten and violated that night and I don't want him in our apartment because it makes me feel uncomfortable and uneasy. I've also noticed the tension between him and my guy roommate when he was over our place but he didn't say anything about it...

This is my first time living on my own and with roommates so I don't really know what to do.

Is it okay for me to ask her to not bring him over? Do I have the right to make such request since it's also her apartment?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice, insights, perspectives, and comments are welcome!

Currently I’m in this situation where I’m in a “relationship” with this boy and I “like” this other boy.

*this is getting really confusing, the boy I’m in a relationship I’m going to call him Bert and the boy I like imma call Jamey* 

Anyway, I  can’t just break up with Bert and be with jamey cause first of all, Bert has depression so if I break up with him he could get even more depressed. Second, Bert says he loves me but I just don’t. I really want to be in a relationship with Jamey, oof

But basically Bert loves me I don’t love him back and I want to break up with him but idk how so do any of you know how to break up with people who have depression? Or how to break up without being too harsh? Eek. I’m just no ready to be in a relationship with Bert, I still care about him but i just don’t love him

It really felt like it wasn’t mine any more, and it gave me major issues like not liking my body, not wanting to use sexy underwear, bikinis, nothing that showed my skin. I recently realized I wasn’t being sexy, and I wanted too! I started to try and do my own thing, rock my body, dress how I wanted to, and it was working... but now I feel like I’m back to where I was before.

177,"TLDR: I need help making a minimum of $5000/mo as a freelancer or content creator, but am having a hard time finding options. I'm too stressed to be creative and resourceful like I used to be. I need the advice of individuals who ideally have a mix of a corporate background and being self-employed in Canada. OR even people who work for the camgirl / fetish modeling industry, or world of digital marketing, Youtube or content creation. If you have experience in the above can you please share some advice? I WILL do FREE design work for you in exchange for your consultation and expertise if this needs a closer look. Please guys, I really would just appreciate substantial, non-generic advice.

\----

Please read with mercy and only if you have substantial advice. Even if they are crazy ambitious, I am open.

I'd like to preface this by saying I can't afford a life coach, counselor or financial coach to help me and anymore courses. I also don't have a healthy credit to apply for loans. I don't have wealthy relatives or friends to borrow from. My partner and I don't work well in full-time jobs working for someone else, which is why we became self-employed in the first place. I have nothing to sell. And lastly, moving to a ""cheaper"" apartment / living arrangement will set me back many months if I go with that option, so I can't do that. I am looking for ways to make MORE and increase performance, not be forced to ""save"" or reverse the progress I've already made so far.

I am a freelance graphic / web designer with 3 clients who I have monthly retainers from ($3000/mo). I live with a partner who is also a freelance IT who has been covering 60% of our expenses from his savings, which we were forced to use and now it has run out. We relied on the savings as he isn't working a full-time job right now, because he wanted to focus on building these elaborate crypto mining facilities that he hoped would bring us a return. With the current markets right now, we aren't doing too well so we're both very discouraged.

I have been trying to get more clients (but with no luck) because we both need a minimum of $5000/mo to cover our business and personal expenses. This is already the most conservative amount we can bring it down to. Perhaps the stress is blocking my mind from being resourceful because I can't figure a way out at all... like I really don't know what to do and don't know any other options that won't cost more $$$. It's hard to find clients that have the budget to hire me for $1000/mo. And if I take on 10+ clients at lower rates I would burn out completely. My partner is now too deeply involved in his projects to get a full-time job, and I have to figure it out for a bit longer until he finally gets back on his feet.

I am debating between the following directions... if anyone has experience can you please help me?? Even just a conversation I would be so grateful and will return the favor in some way if there's anything you need as well.

1) Start a monetized Youtube channel focused on design tutorials, and create a mailing list that I can sell my digital products and services to. (however how long will this take to do? will it be good ROI?) 

2) Start selling fetish video clips or photo sets. (I heard this works for some but I'm not sure if the revenue is actually possible within a short time?)

3) Find capital to help with operating expenses for a few more months and then also use it to fund my Amazon e-commerce business.

4) Sell drugs. (i don't even know where to start with this nor do i have the street smarts...)

178,"Honestly, I'm pretty pissed off right now.

My best (and pretty much only) friend from high school (let's call her Sarah) called me to let me know that my mom randomly dropped in on her yesterday to ""chat"" with her and her mother.

To give a bit of context (sorry it's long), I always tried to keep my mom from meeting my friends back in high school.  I do (usually, maybe not right now) care about my mom, and she's got some good points too, like how she's smart, determined, and sociable (outside of home).  But she's also narcissistic, controlling, manipulative, and the least empathetic person I know.

My dad has always been the one to do the cooking, cleaning, etc.  He gets up at 7:00 (while she sleeps in until 9:00) to make breakfast.  Because my mom always oversleeps, she usually doesn't even eat what my dad makes for her, but she picked a fight with my dad a few weeks ago just because he missed making breakfast one morning.  She forces my dad to give her everything he makes and is in charge of all the finances.  He has to report back to her for everything he spends money on, like she's his boss or something, or she'll pick another fight.  He goes drinking with his buddies once a week, and she says stuff like ""I hate coming home to an empty house"" and ""this isn't the happiness you promised me thirty years ago"", all while she goes out with friends until late without even letting him know he doesn't need to make her dinner.  My dad, kind and patient and strong and compassionate, even gets tired of her shit sometimes, and I honestly don't see how he's still in love with her, with her threatening divorce in every argument they get into.

This is mostly why I try to keep my friends away from my mom.  She's also really rude sometimes, telling a guy friend of mine that she thought he looked like a girl while laughing.

Right now, I'm on the other side of the country right now for university.  My mom visited last year, and insisted that I bring friends for dinner.  It was hard to refuse because my roommate was a part of our small group.

One of my friends is studying business, and when my mom found out, she talked to her nonstop about selling insurance together.  My friend was obviously not interested but didn't want to seem impolite, and my mom was not deterred by my trying to change the topic.  It made dinner extremely awkward.  After we got home, I told my mom that I didn't care what new MLM or insurance she was doing, but to not use me or my friends for it.

Fast-forward to yesterday.  My mom just ""dropped by"" unannounced, to ""finally meet them and see how Sarah and her mom were doing"", but told them to ""make sure not to tell [amnesiac-ponderings]"" that she went by.  I always made sure my mom couldn't get their phone numbers, but letting her pick me up once from Sarah's house this summer when my dad was at work was a mistake on my part.

Apparently, she mostly talked to Sarah's mom, but she also also tried to rope Sarah into selling insurance with her.  When Sarah said she wasn't good at marketing stuff, my mom insisted on taking her to the next ""training"" meet.

She also wanted Sarah to meditate with her.  She's been into meditation for the last three years, which is great, but she's been trying to force everyone around her to go with her (my dad humoured her for a while, but he didn't enjoy it), which isn't so great.

But if it was just that, I wouldn't be this angry.  Apparently, ""while chatting"", my mom kept saying stuff like ""I wish my daughter was as thin as Sarah is.  [amnesiac-ponderings] is so fat because she's lazy and has no self-control, she stuffs herself with everything that's in sight.""  Sarah said she could only laugh along because she was so shocked.

Weight is the one thing I'm extremely self-conscious about.  I know I need to lose weight, and I've been trying to for a long time, but she only sees my failures.  I put up with my mom constantly reminding me that I should lose weight at home, but I've gotten mad at her for bringing it up in front of people I know.  I didn't think she'd say stuff like that behind my back.

Then, for some reason, my mom brought up my eating disorder.  I never told my best friend about it because I wasn't sure if she'd understand, although I know Sarah's not the type to judge someone because of that.  But it wasn't my mom's story to share!  I can't believe she'd tell people about that behind my back.  Who else has she told that I don't know about?

Also, I try pretty hard to get my friends' parents to like me.  I know it's quite fake of me, but I had a friend in elementary school whose dad thought I was a bad influence and told her not to play with me, so it might be partially because of that.  And partially because I'm my selfish, conceited mother's daughter after all.

But Sarah's mother used to me.  She thought I was nice and responsible, which I do try to be.

My mom, on the other hand, has a victim mentality.  She tells people that my dad's only a perfect husband on the outside, and never really does anything for her.  But for someone who had lived with them for 18 years, my dad has always humoured, comforted, gave advice to, and been there for both of us, even regardless of all else he's sacrificed for us.  What has she ever done for him? 

This time, with Sarah's mom, she tried to spin it on me.  Apparently, 4 years ago, when I was old enough to drive and my mom wanted me to get a licence, I said something along the lines of ""I don't need one, I can just get you to drive me around"".  I don't remember saying it, but it did seem like the type of thing I would joke about.  But she remembered that, even though she forgets my birthday every year if neither my dad nor aunt reminds her.  She used this story to prove her point that I was lazy, rude, and ""treated her like slave"".  My mom also said that I never helped around the house (I did more than she did, which I agree was not much), how I got angry easily (I do concede on this point that I inherited her ugly temper), and basically how I'm a shitty daughter all around.

Unfortunately, my mom is charismatic, and great at painting herself in a good light.  From what Sarah was saying, my mom convinced her mom that I am basically a piece of shit.  When I said that I might have said the driving thing as a joke, even Sarah told me, ""well she took what you said seriously and was really hurt because of that.""  But my mom didn't even drive me anywhere that she didn't force me to go.  I biked to school everyday back in high school, and got my dad to drive me or took a bus to go anywhere farther.

My mom is also the type to get really angry on her own behalf the more she thinks about something, and she often moves herself to tears while making her speeches about how she's a strong and hard-working woman stuck with a husband and daughter who don't appreciate her.  Well, I'm certainly not appreciating her right now, but my dad should get some credit for putting up with and continuing to care for her.

But I can't believe she said all that to Sarah and her mom!  My mom knows how much my friendship with Sarah means to me.  She also knows that I hate it when people talk about my back, and people who do stuff like that in general, because of an incident in elementary school that left me isolated.  I've even mentioned to her before that I'm struggling with depressive symptoms, that I'm having troubles with my friends in uni, and Sarah was my only support system.

I never trusted my mom with anything, but I didn't think she'd break what ever shred of trust I had left for her to this extent.  But it's for this reason that I can't call her and tell her to stay away from my friends.  Sarah said that my mom made her promise many times to not tell me that she was there, and she asked me not to let my mom know that she told me.  I don't want to be anything like my mom and break someone's trust.  Plus, my mom is vengeful and will always remember anything perceived wrong to her, so if she knew that Sarah told me anything, she would do anything to make me lose the only friend I had in high school.

What should I do?  I told Sarah to not let my mom push her into buying or selling insurance.  But Sarah seems really interested in trying out meditation, which might be good for her, and it's really her choice.  I told her not to believe everything that my mom says, but my mom is already starting to turn her against me.  I'm just scared my mom will make my oldest and best friend hate me.",14Sep2018,66
179,"This is the email I sent to my apartment complex detailing the incident: 

Earlier today, I was getting out of my vehicle and walking to my building. A man was walking past me towards the dumpster while carrying a full trash bag. 

I proceeded up the stairs to [my floor] and he followed me instead of continuing towards the dumpster. I went to unlock my door but I felt him standing behind me, so I turned to him and asked if there was something I could help him with. He didn’t respond, and instead walked up to the [next floor]. 

I waited a moment, feeling uncomfortable and afraid to open my door while he waited on the landing above me. He stood up there for a few seconds then came back down to [my floor]. 

I asked him what he was doing. He said “I live in this building.” I asked what unit number and he responded with “uhhh 2326”. I said to him that 2326 isn’t a unit number and asked him why he followed me. He said “call the office”. I responded with, “Gladly. What’s your name?”, to which he said “have a nice day”, waved goodbye then walked downstairs back towards the dumpster. He dropped his trash and I shouted again asking why he followed me, and why he stood behind me when I went to unlock my door.

He grabbed some of his trash and headed towards the dumpster and said, “I’m trying to throw out my trash you stupid idiot!”  

I watched him throw away his trash then walk towards the back of the complex. He pointed to another building, I’m not sure of the number but I can point it out, and he shouted “Right there!”, indicating that’s where he lived. 

I immediately called the police and reported what happened. They agreed that it was not normal behavior and very suspicious. 

I have photos of the back of this man. He was shirtless and has a tattoo. 

—————— end of email 

I genuinely believe this man would have forced himself into my apartment if I opened my door. He stood there. He was facing me. He only continued walking when I called him out. Then he lied about living in my building... idk... 

I have since packed up my two cats and an overnight bag and am staying at my best friends house about a half hour away. I’m afraid to be there alone. 

I’m reflecting on things and am remembering and piecing stuff together. He opened a mailbox on the way back from emptying the trash to prove he was a resident. He also said he lived in the building that faces the pool - which I am at on schedule every other day from noon to two pm. Every other day I am at the gym at that time which is located at that same pool area. I’m wondering if he’s been watching me. 

I forgot to mention in the email that the cops could not find this man and therefore only documented it as suspicious activity. Unfortunately there wasn’t a lot they could do, and I understand that. 

So I guess to the part where I ask for advice... what do I do now? I don’t feel safe. Anywhere. I’m nauseated and haven’t been able to sleep all night. It’s 6:30 am, so I’m approaching having been awake for 24 hours very soon. 

Thank you for reading, and I apologize if I don’t respond for a while. I’m hoping to fall asleep soon.

182,"I used to be good friends with a girl, but recently, for absolutely no reason, our relationship has been going downhill. Something happened between us two and we got called into the principal's office and we solved things out. We both ended up crying and telling each other that we'll be there for each other, and I really believed that we had solved things out. Then, after that meeting with the principal, nothing changed. She became good friends with another girl and when I tried to talk to her, she would sometimes ignore me or glare at me.  The girl that she became good friends seems to have been influenced by her because she won't interact with me anymore, but before, she used to talk to me first. Then, I heard from someone that she and her friend invited almost everyone at school to hang out this Saturday except me.

I don't know why she's acting that way. I really believed that we had solved things out. The thing is, her friend misses school sometimes, and she doesn't have anyone to hang out with other than her. So, when that happens, she always comes to me and my friends to hang out with them, but I have the choice to be nice and include her or to treat her the same way and leave her out. If I choose the second option, our relationship will only worsen, but if I choose the first option, there is a chance that our relationship will get better but it's not a 100% chance.

The person I agreed to sell it to I work with and is in charge technically. However he is on very thin ice and is in no position to punish or fire me.  However he could arguably find ways to be a cunt.

Anyway so I caught him beating the shit out of a cow in a rage. The animal is ok thankfully and the owner has told him he should be fired, but he was one chance and that anything ever again is going to be the end of his job.

I reported him and he knows I did. We as co-workers had drinks later that day and I approached him and he inquired about that car that I had bought from our other co worker.

I agreed to sell it to him after the beating in the interest of mending fences, but  now I hear from a coworker he is talking shit about people. (Me most likely.). He was trying to impress some new girl.  He is acting like a general cunt in different ways.

So what do you guys think. Am I honorbound to sell him the car and uphold the deal?  I was thinking instead of donating the car to other backpackers as a free car. I paid $200 for it and already have another car.

Essentially I can let other backpackers have it instead of him and have more people have a better use for it.  Technically it will still be my car, but I won't be using it.  Seems like a better use than selling it to a piece of shit.",14Sep2018,1

He said that she thought I was a creep, and hated me for ""many other reasons"", none of which he would tell me. 

Since then, I have always been a little nervous of doing something wrong, and isolating myself. However, there is this one girl I know and work with that makes it a lot worse than others do.

I always apologise to her, and overthink things big time. Indeed, the other she told me, as part of a conversion:

191,"Hi! Throwaway account, I'm an engineering student. In my class there's like 10 girls and 60 guys, so there's plenty of competition.


The other day I was walking out of the campus and I crossed paths with one of the girls in my class. Really smart, really cute and all that good stuff. Moreover, she didn't seem to mind the fact that I am really socially awkard. And right when we were really hitting it off, another guy from the same class sat next to us on the train. So I had to be respectful and talk with him too in order to not  look like a jerk.

I want to ask her out. I am not shy, but I don't want to come off too strong. So I thought I have to have a more lenghty conversation(s) with her before doing that.

The problem is I don't see a situation where we can talk alone in the future: I only have one class I coincide with her, twice a week. Talking with her in class is hard because I have to pay attention, there are other guys around and the other girls form an unbreakable pack around her. But also I have other classes, meaning she'll have long left the campus when I leave class. And let's say I made a study group, she couldn't be in it due to her schedule. 

How should I approach this? Should I just ask her out or is there a way to meet with her so that we can just talk?",14Sep2018,1

193,"I’m a university student who’s just moved back to London for my second year. 

I’d have thought by now I would be used to being away from my family but I just am not. I had such a lovely summer, my mental health was great etc.

But now I’ve come back and I’ve moved into a house with two people that I don’t know very well. I have to get a job which I’m worried about because I feel like I’m just going to have bad luck. And that would be sad because I want to work and I want to be productive and support myself. 

I’m very socially anxious and also never really feel safe. Leaving the house is difficult.

I was never homesick last year but I did feel very unsafe. This year just feels horrible and bleak.

I just want to be with my family in the place I know. 

To top it all off I miss my cat so much. It sounds stupid but I keep sobbing everytime I think about him. He’s just a sweet little dude that seems to know when I’m not feeling great and he’ll just come and sit on me and purr and then I just feel happier. It’s killing me that he’s not about. 

One think I think will help is that I’m finally going to get to see the right team for my mental health problems which I think are really contributing massively to this low panicky feeling I have. I have C-PTSD and recently my brain has been processing everything as some nasty traumatic event even if I know rationally it’s not.

195,"I've tried to ask her why she's so uncomfortable and she answered with ""I don't know I just am"" and I'm just trying to understand her perspective

My flat houses 4 people and we each have our own full bathrooms. It's 3 girls and 1 guy, and the way the flat is set up, there's two hallways that both have 2 bedrooms in it. I share my hallway with my guy roommate who's also in a long term relationship but he has the option of staying in his girlfriends dorm. The two other girls share the other hallway. My boyfriend lives in another city with his mum and brother so it would be weird and inconvenient for me to sleepover unless it's a weekend and we both work on weekends (me in my university town and him at home)

My boyfriend commutes to our university and we have a lab together at 830 one day and we both decided it'd be nice for him to stay at my place that day. My roommates know he's going to be sleeping over every Wednesday so it's not a surprise for them.

The roommate who is having issues with me just changed her reason why she didn't want him here but she's been sticking with ""I just feel uncomfortable"". We all have our own bathrooms so that's not an issue and when he's over (which is literally once a week unless we went grocery shopping and he just has to help me carry stuff up) , I make sure I tell everyone before hand so they don't get surprised. He's a contributing member of the household because my roommates and I all don't have a car but he does and will find himself driving my roommates around occasionally (even the one with the problem with him). He'll do his own dishes (and some of my roommates dishes too).  

She doesn't walk around in her underwear because we have a guy roommate. Privacy is a given when we live in separate hallways in different halves of the apartment. She gets free rides from him. Honestly, as full time university students with part time jobs, sleep trumps sex  so overnight noises isn't an issue as well, we sleep way earlier than her. Me and him thought they were friends until she was just uncomfortable with him sleeping here

I'm just trying to understand some reasons she may be uncomfortable with him sleeping here before I consider that she's just being unreasonable. I don't want her to feel uncomfortable in her own house but she has to understand that two of her roommates are in long term relationships and will have their SOs here from time to time. Currently, her rule is two nights max in a row but she talked to me yesterday and she said that just having our SOs over for one night makes her uncomfortable and I'm really trying to understand why.

206,"&amp;#x200B;

So, just to give some context. 

I'm 22 years old. I'm from Europe, and in my country Uni is tuition free. I never had a specific passion for anything, but I was always good at humanities/history/languages (but who wasn't right?) 

I enrolled in a IT degree last year and I completely bombed, didn't know what I was doing, missed a bunch of homework assignments..so i failed. I enrolled in a bit different course this year. I slacked of a lot in the first semester, but I became much more serious about it in the second. But as a result of slacking of in the first semester I had a hard time fixing my mistakes in the summer. End result: I passed 6 out of the 10 subjects, including math which is regarded to be among the hardest. But I failed 2 lab assignments (first one I failed by 4 points and the other one by 1 point. Also worth noting: because I didn't pass the assignments during the semester, I had to now pass the more difficult  version of the assignments  in the exam term), and therefore wasn't eligible to take part in two exams. I then also failed my last two exams (data structures and databases) both by 2 points. 

So here I am, two years deep in my studies, I cant enroll in year 2 but I can pay to attend the courses I failed, to complete year 1. That would set me back for at least 900€.. 

I also cant change my degree anymore(switch to something else). I'm confident that I could pass the courses, but i'm not sure if it's worth it. All this has taken a toll on my mental health and I don't want that kind of stress in my life again.

Sorry for the long explanation but I feel the details are important.

She complains to me that she is being sexually harassed. I believe her and i agree that it is possible. I tell her to call the HR department talk to someone, which she does. I then get a phone call from HR asking a bunch of questions about him, which I answered truthfully. Now i get to work with him for the whole week while this is going on, and he has NO idea. The whole time discussing ideas for the future and working on projects that I know are essentially going to be dead in a weeks time. She has meanwhile been transferred to a new floor on some excuse until this is sorted out.  


Its not that i don't think he should be punished, he absolutely should be punished no question. Its just this WHOLE THING sucks. Everything about this is terrible. She gets her experience at work ruined, and a terrible emotional and physical experience with men, possibly affecting her for life. He gets his current career and likely future career ruined. I will likely be promoted if he is fired or moved, a position I actually do not want because it entails working a 6 day week, with minimal extra pay. I have to lie to a man I once respected, while simultaneously having conspired in the burial of his career. I guess I'm struggling to deal with the fact, that I did everything right, I encouraged her to make the complaint, showed her how to do it, gave an honest account of my experience with him. I feel like I'm wrecking someones life and I've been instructed to lie to his face about it.   


Him being fired is also going to severely impact my work load, as I will for some time probably, have to do both his and my job. I feel like I've shot myself in the foot for all the right reasons. Its not a good feeling.

I've been doing a little research on bpd and there were many undeniable similarities between the core symptoms and the way he's been acting. I don't want to get too specific and bore you with details, but N has lately been exhibiting an over-blown self confidence (not so much ego), daily shifts between being over joyous and sadness, somewhat self-destructive behaviours. Along with these are a few volatile mood swings and finally, constant substance abuse - from drinking almost every night to taking others' unprescribed ADHD medication.

One thing that popped up was how we both have major health problems to deal with (I’m severely visually impaired, have autism and dyslexia). She mentioned that she’s allergic to loads of things. Nuts, eggs, dairy, fruit, quite a lot. I remember her saying about 30-50 things. She got a lot of grief for it in high school which I find kind of fucked up, since she’s so nice!

I studied first aid in the past so I was curious about how her allergy pen works. I also figured that it would be a good thing for someone else to know how and where to use it in the case that she gets an allergic reaction on campus and no one else knows what to do.

Everything went really fast and i never really had problem with it. I really love her but somehow im scared even nothing really changes after the marriage ( basically its just formally thing) but somehow it still feels like i would throw away my best years of my life (mid 20´s ).
I dont even know why i feel like that because i want to stay with her and im not really interested in party/other girls (even if i would be single, i just hate party and that stuff)
Does anyone had a situation like that? How did everything turned out?
How would you tell ur partner you want to cancel the marriage but want to stay together? I feel like i would break her heart(which is 100% understandable), im also scared she would just leave me then.

243,"Hello all, I recently move into a two bedroom dorm with two other girls, one of which I graduated hs with and have been good friends for awhile. My second roommate moved in mid August because she plays a sport. The day I moved in, my boyfriend’s parents (who were helping me move in) notice she was kind of messy. I’m not pristine either so I didn’t really care at first. They opened up a cupboard in the kitchen and there was nearly blackened bananas and a horde of fruit flies came out. A few days later, the garbage began to reek like crazy and only made the fly problem worse. I changed the bag but the flies refuse to die off. We have 2 garbage cans, one covered and one uncovered and I started putting food and perishable trash in there (hoping the flies would stay out) and plastic garbage in the other. My second roommate disregarded this and just throws her half eaten food in both and the flies returned in full force. What can I do to get rid of them?? I’ve left our balcony door open a bit, hoping they’d find a way out. Bugs gross me the fuck out, what can I do to ensure our trash isn’t an open buffet for the nasty fuckers? ",14Sep2018,3

I’m 26 years old, will be 27 in November and I’m currently still (again) living at home with my mother. I moved out when I was sixteen. Then moved back home when my sister fell sick. She passed away in 2013. I had a couple of surgeries in 2016 which was great to be able to live with my mom. But now I want to move out and she is threatening me if I do so she never wants to see me again. 

I had a shitload of bad luck in my life and didn’t get to finish school. My dad offered me to teach me certain things of a certain real estate job. I would make enough money and be able to do that job for many more years to come. I told my mom and she exploded. Saying he is always taking her kids away from her. And again said if I go she never wants to see me again. 

She wants me to become a nurse but that’s a four year education for a job that doesn’t fit me at all. I have spoken to people of a school nearby and they don’t even want me there. (It’s a long story but not relevant about why.) 

I have been looking into a certain education I REALLY want to do but it’s expensive and I don’t have the funds. I thought if I work with my dad for a year or two I can save up and bend over to this education. 

I told her I’m entirely dependent on her and that when she is gone I have NOTHING and I am NO ONE. She goes “well I don’t feel like that’s true”.

She doesn’t want to see that she’s basically keeping me from building a future. Even my relationship she actively tried to ruin. It got ruined on its own but her pulling the shit she did makes me not even want to date anyone anymore. I don’t want to pull anyone in that horse shit.


I don’t know what to do. I love her and I can acknowledge that she’s probably just afraid to be alone. But I want my own life. I want to travel (she won’t let me, “it’s too dangerous”. If I go she never wants to see me again.)

So I've been suffering with something called epididymitis  (pain in the ball) for about 2 months now and have tried treatment but it hasnt fully worked. It can be a chronic problem.

The pain stopped me from getting a summer job and going out very much at all. It has improved over time but can still be painful at times restricting my activities.   

Im due to go back to university really soon but it will mean committing to a housing tenancy for a year. If i have trouble with the pain and cant attend uni my loans will be cut and my guarantor (parent) would be forced to pay for the housing; if i wanted to return and finish the course I would also have to pay the uni for my course fees up to the date i leave because I am entitled to 4 years funding and my course is 4 years long (i cant afford this currently). I definitely want to finish the course, I did well in the first year.


 At the minute i live at home, dont go out a great deal and have help with getting the shopping etc and i just dont know whether ill be able to take care of myself, attend uni and socialise. It feels like a risk but I could feel fine in a couple of months and then ive wasted a year. I havent contacted the uni about this.

259,"So long story short, last week I got a call inviting me for a phone interview for this past Wednesday.  So, not wanting to jump the gun, count my chickens before they hatched, and really because I simply wasn't ready to be ""out"" with it yet, I told my boss I had a medical appointment, which she gladly allowed me to use sick leave for the time I needed to have my appointment, so I did just that -- I took my lunch, I left the building, had my interview, then came back.  No harm, no foul.

Well, yesterday, on my way to work, I got a call inviting me for an in person interview.  Now, this new position is a whole state away from me and it will take a good 6-7 hours to get down there, so obviously, I would definitely need to take off of work to accommodate the interview.  Well, the interview was scheduled to be on a day where my boss had already switched around my schedule so that I could cover a shift for her while she went to a meeting.  So, this put me in a bit of a predicament.  I knew I'd already lied to her about the phone interview, and I knew I couldn't continue with the ""medical issue"" story and then request time off for a multi-day trip out of town -- that wouldn't exactly line up, especially since that ""appointment"" took less than an hour and I am very obviously not that ill, at least not enough to warrant going out of state for treatment for an imaginary issue, haha.  


Anyway, I finally decided that I should just be upfront with her.  And my personal policy with honesty is to be honest about everything, just in case something comes back to bite me in the ass. So, I told her. Everything. About the in person interview and the phone interview.  And naturally, she was justifiably not happy with me at all.  She gave me the day off that I needed for my interview, but that was it, and she barely even looked at me the rest of the day.  What little communication we had the rest of the day was through email discussing the logistics of my request.  

I apologized multiple times and she's not even upset about me finding another job -- she's upset that I lied to her, and rightfully so.  I shouldn't have lied, and probably should've just left out the part about the phone interview.  I did get her a little ""You're a great boss!"" card to try and reconcile myself, which I know she got, but again -- she didn't talk to me again after I spoke with her in the morning so I honestly have no idea where she stands now.

She made it clear that my current job \*is\* a reference for any future job.  I know her, and I  know she wouldn't go out of her way to throw me under the bus or anything, but I'm also kind of worried about it too. I don't really know what to do to remedy the situation, and now I'm scared I may have jeopardized my new job prospect.  So...help?  What should I do?",14Sep2018,2

So here's my story: I work full time in a cubicle. Big girl job. It's decent, pays the bills, but I really dislike sitting and staring at a computer all day. It's pretty much the opposite of what I want to do with my life. I'm not happy and I'm easily replaceable. It scares the shit out of me when I hear people celebrating 25+ years here. I don't want to live in dull contentment.

I plan on changing my career before it's too late. My husband and I are saving money to move out of state and we figured it would take about 2 years. I just have to be patient.

During these two years, I'm in this sort of limbo. I have a lot of leftover energy from being cooped up inside all day. I work out. I take some college night classes my work is paying for. I listen to podcasts while I sit at my desk. TedTalks, Nightvale, No Sleep, all that good stuff. I even sometimes watch motivational videos on YouTube.

Any ideas on what I can do to pass the time in a valuable way so I don't feel like I'm just waiting? Any miscellaneous advice for some random, nervous nihilist turning 25?

When I'm studying, they make comments like, ""You study too much. You're such a nerd, etc."" Mind you, I'm a Biology major. I'm taking hard classes. And I don't study 24/7. I do have a part-time job and I am apart of a club.

266,"I told a friend about how I was depressed &amp; suicidal a few months ago. Just the act of telling someone helped a lot and I've been doing a whole lot better recently. But the thing now is, I don't think she took me seriously and it's been bothering me a lot. She never mentioned a single word of what I texted her irl even after telling me she'd try her best to help, and she keeps joking about suicide casually ('I'll literally kill myself if ~~happens'). And if anyone even mentions the same night I texted her crying she'd blatantly make the situation awkward for everyone and resort to all means to change the subject. She also keeps telling me constantly about how great her art lessons are, when she knows it's something I'm sensitive and jealous about. And though this is unrelated to that she keeps intruding on my personal boundaries and making me uncomfortable, like hugging my stomach randomly (saying she 'likes how it feels') or putting her arms around my neck, and when I react negatively or tell her not to she gets all pouty and whiny.
To be blunt: I don't like her at all, and although it helped to confess I don't know why I chose her. I don't know what to do, as she keeps guilt-tripping me for avoiding her, but I don't think I want her as a friend anymore. What do I do?",14Sep2018,6
267,"I haven't posted in this subreddit before, I'm just a bit stuck as to how to behave in this situation so I thought I'd ask for some advice from people with no attachment to anyone involved.

Backstory: I have been dating my girlfriend since February, we're both at the same university and spend a lot of time at each others' respective uni houses, socialising with each others' flatmates etc. I get on pretty well with her 4 flatmates and they like me too, all good. We've been on summer break from uni since May/June and I haven't seen any of them since though.

Approx 2 months ago whilst I was teaching abroad for a month, my girlfriend was distraught because her best friend/flatmate had been raped by the guy she was seeing for the past couple of months. Her friend had come to my girlfriend for support and it was all very traumatic for everyone. What furthered the trauma was that this girl made the decision in spite of all her friends to stay with this guy, to not tell the police, and to argue vigilantly against anyone that tried to tell her otherwise. My girlfriend was seriously worked up that this guy seemed to be tearing her and her best friend's friendship apart by emotionally manipulating her into staying with him, and I was 8000 miles away and was very limited in what I could do at the time to help my girlfriend recover. I was of the view that rape is rape. You go to the police. Or at the very least you tell her parents or people of importance. But for my girlfriend and her friends the situation was complicated by nobody wanting to sacrifice their friendship with this girl and go behind her back. 

Anyway, currently my girlfriend and this girl have semi made up about the situation. At least in the sense that my girlfriend acts civil to this guys face (in the few times that she's seen him), for the sake of her friendship with this girl. None of our friends who know anything about their situation like this guy or approve of the relationship (which is really just predicated on sex, they see each other frequently but have barely ever been on dates etc). 

I haven't seen either of them over the summer since this has happened, but the thought of him enrages me to the nth degree - and I am not someone that typically holds grudges. I think that it has a lot to do with the fact that I feel very little obligation to be civil to him for the sake of my friendship with my girlfriend's flatmate as I've only known her since March or so. This rapist has caused so much distress for my girlfriend, and therefore me, and I do not want him to be a part of my life at all. 

He is an evil person, but as time passes the impression I get is that everyone seems to be forgetting what he did. Rape is rape, and he should be facing prison time. I can't stand the thought of having to socialise with him and I recently even skipped out on this girl's party that he would be in attendance of simply because I had no idea whether or not I could hold my tongue and not cause a scene on her birthday. I really have no right to dictate who would be allowed into my girlfriend's flat as I do not pay their rent, but I am flabbergasted that her and her flatmates are reluctant to try and stop such a violent and disgusting person entering. If he was known to have raped someone else, I can't imagine that they would let him into their home. So why in the world would they let him in if the person that he had raped was someone that they all deeply care about? 

I don't even know if this girl knows that I know that she was raped. To her, it probably seems like none of my business. But I can't stand the idea of being in the presence of this guy, someone that committed an act so vile, and someone that has given me such second/third hand trauma. So how do I behave in the near future? There's no guarantee that this girl will stay with him. But how do I even broach the subject with this girl or behave when we're inevitably at her house at the same time? Do I be honest with her, I'm certainly not the only one that hates him? Do I be honest with him if I do see him? I don't know. 

Thanks if you read this far, any opinions welcome. I am aware that I could simply avoid going round to her flat, however at least in the very near future I will be living with her as I am yet to sort out my living arrangements this year so that's not an issue in the short term. ",14Sep2018,4

&amp;#x200B;

1. I had a pregnancy scare last month. I was having really bad anxiety and he comforted me along the way and told me we'll get through this together. Thankfully I wasn't pregnant, but he still would beg me to have unprotected sex everytime things were getting intimate, promising to ''pull out''. I've always made him wear a condom. Months before, he told me to never let him stick it in raw if he asks, and not to trust that he will pull out. It hurts because it makes me feel like he has no respect for my body and is willing to risk getting me pregnant and putting me through that emotional stress again. I did speak to him about it, he apologized, and hasn't done it since. 

2. This was recent, like about a week ago. When we were in public, he would point out girls he found hot. I was deeply hurt by it, but didn't tell him right then and there. I waited until I was home to text him how that made me feel. He kept telling me it wasn't what I think, that he just wanted to point out ''how abnormally large their butt/boobs were'' and he didn't have the hots for them. Then he kept bringing up that I should've communicated that to him in the moment, which he has a point, but I felt anxious. I also reminded him that I did tell him i the past that I don't want him doing that (before he actually started doing it) but he kept reiterating that I need to communicate face-to-face when it happens. 

3. For his birthday he wanted to go to an escape room with me. Then he asked if he could invite some friends. I have social anxiety, and he's well aware of how bad it can be, but I wasn't going to be an awful girlfriend and say no so I told him he can. I started feeling a lot of anxiety and almost wanted to bail out but I assured myself that everything will be fine, that he will make sure I'm comfortable. Well, once we were there, I pretty much felt left out. Like it was hard to participate and put myself out there and I ended up wandering around, not doing much like a useless person. He only talked to me a few times but for the most part I was alone and silent. Yesterday I gently brought up to him that I felt ignored the whole time and he didn't make much of an effort to make me feel included and comfortable. He got really defensive, saying he didn't know I was uncomfortable, that he couldn't really gauge how I felt because I looked blank and wasn't saying anything, etc. He essentially blamed me for not communicating to him that I was feeling left out and anxious. I guess he has a point, but he was having so much fun with his friends and I didn't want to be a downer. I just thought it was common sense to make your girlfriend feel comfortable and included, especially if you know she suffers from social anxiety. He said he's sorry, but it didn't feel heartfelt or meaningful. He keeps reiterating that I need to communicate to him in the moment how I feel.",14Sep2018,1

291,"My boyfriend and I have decided to share a larger condo with another couple, who are our friends. We feel that we could get a long well, while saving money in a 2 bedroom + 1 Den Condo. The condo is 1400 feet, a good amount of space for under 3K for the 4 of us. 

The catch is, the master bedroom is huge with a giant bathroom and standing shower, where as the other bedroom is average with a seperate normal bathroom. Comes with 2 free parking spots. My boyfriend and I both have cars, but the other couple doesn't. We thought whoever gets the larger room should pay more, but then the other couple suggested that having the parking spots possibly equal out the the larger bedroom value. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally don't agree with that, as most condos we have been looking at already included parking too, and the value of the parking spots doesn't equal the value of the large bedroom/bath. Also, we would be providing them plenty of rides too.

300,"I‘m sorry in advance for just writing down my thoughts, I‘m too confused right now to structure this properly..

My dad pays aliments for me since I‘m 6 (I‘m about to turn 18, still in school for about a year). He wanted my mom to give the left over money at the end of the month to me. He said he‘d pay even more if I need more. But my mom refused. Because of that my dad was always saying she‘s keeping money to herself (around 200/300€ a month) that he pays for me and my future like college/university. But I didn‘t believe him. Until now. My mom came up to me yesterday and started demanding money for food and rent (350€ a month). While I still have to cover my monthly expenses (food outside home, clothes, netflix, gym, bus tickets, vacation, car etc.). 
.. I got about 175€ for that. 75€ if I wanna save up money monthly like I was planning to, which I probably can‘t afford now. 

My stepdad usually is really fun and overthinking, but he said if I don‘t pay maybe I should move out. I‘m still kind of shocked by this.

The thing is I know she doesn‘t want to make me pay for those things, it‘s that she wants money. I noticed in the past that she‘s pretty greedy for money and there‘s no fun in talking about it with her.

As anybody in their right mind would have done I asked her if she wants to make her underaged son pay to live at home.. especially considering I‘m still in school for a year. 

She started crying and telling me that she couldn’t live without the money. I couldn‘t take it and said I will pay.

Then she instantly switched back to happy and has been acting way more happy the last few days than ever before. Buying me sweets and random clothes without me asking for it. Usually I had to beg her to buy me things and she was always pretty unhappy about it.

Some side infos for better understanding:

Her friends consider us (my mom, stepdad and me) sort of wealthy and my mom always put’s worth on being seen as a good/rich person (instead of actually acting like one as I’ve noticed over the last few years). 

It just hit me how she only works 4 days a week, each 5-7 hours and goes on vacation very often in addition to going out almost every day of the weekend.
Still she saves money whenever she can and always told me there‘s not enough when I wanted something. 

I depicted her as quite the monster but I always thought of her as a good mother. 
She could be pretty moody a few times a week but and she basically forced me to say „I love you“ back until I said it hollowly to comfort her or eat the food she made or else she would get really upset, but in the end she drove me to friends from time to time or helped me organize things for school. I believe she deeply cares about me, it‘s showing more in her words than in her actions but she is my mother after all, right? ..right?

I‘m really starting to doubt it to be honest.. While she does love me, does she puts her money above me, her only son?

I don‘t really know how to feel about this.. I hope someone can guide me or advise me what to do. 

Is this just? Am I wrong maybe? Does my mom not love me? 

I‘m really confused and can‘t really think straight..

303,"Before everything, I am 16. And secondly, it might be long but I'll try my best.

I realised I love this girl back in May when we visited Istanbul to do a presentation (school related), she was already a very close friend of mine, and she went up to the Galata Tower under heavy rain with another boy (he is a year older than I am). Long story short, I easily guessed they went through romantic moments up there, and in fact she really started walking with him during the last 2 days of our visit (not even seeing me anymore, even though she'd constantly hug me) and only then I realised I love her, since I envied greatly and found myself crying that night. Later on, I learned that she actually tried to commit suicide there and he held her to save her. Anyways, we chatted for long hours (I also learned that she didn't romantically love him), day and night and one day she asked if I liked her or not. I was afraid to lose her so I faintheartedly said ""Probably yes"". She said that maybe she liked me too. Days gone by, I learned everything about her, that she lost a cousin very close to her, and she had various psychological problems and a weird childhood with obsessive compulsive disorder and eye problems. I mentioned our days in Istanbul so that you can visualise how unusual the girl is, but things that happened afterwards were probably much more weird.

&amp;#x200B;

After I confessed my love to her, we were like lovers in 2-3 days, and one day she asked me ""What are we now?"", and when I replied ""I don't know"" she asked what I want to be with her. Usual stuff, I replied saying I want her to be my girlfriend, and she said we'll talk this in school. She kissed me in my birthday, but we didn't talk about this lover stuff, and after that day, she started acting weird, as if nothing happened, and even asked me to get out from her class. That night, she called me and she said she is not ready yet, and wanted to stay as friends. For 2 weeks I walked around depressed, not even getting out of my class in the breaks. She sometimes visited me however, she sometimes looked into my eyes (we stayed like that for minutes), sometimes held my hand out of the blue, sometimes played with my hair, nothing changed about her views on being a couple but I recovered.

&amp;#x200B;

We continued chatting on WhatsApp, and before the day school ended she promised me to meet up someday in the summer so that I don't miss her (at this point, I knew I was in love, it wasn't a simple liking). I went abroad for holiday and she messaged me whenever I found wifi. She even admitted to miss me so much and wanted to hear my voice. But before going abroad I asked her out for like 3 times and she first said yes, and then found excuses. When I came back, I was still trying to get her on a date but no. After my 5th time or so we even picked a quarrel on that topic. She was amiable to me most of the time but she sometimes acted agressive. One day in July (might be June though, I can't quite remember) she said ""I'm yours"" as well as some other romantic things. She even said we could meet up tomorrow without even me mentioning it. It was probably one of my happiest days. Until tomorrow though. She didn't answer to my messages, and took back what she said yesterday, saying she didn't feel like she did yesterday and that this was abnormal. Well, I don't need to express how sad and angry I was, do I? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now is the time to mention her ex, who was a psychopath liar. When I (btw her name is Sude) confessed her, she had called her ex (whose name is Çağan, they were still friends but in a weird way) and told him she liked me. The day after that, Çağan came to school with matches in his bag (which I later learned that he planned to burn me with those -it was an obvious bluff though-) and he also talked with Sude in private, which ended up with Çağan trying to strangle Sude to death, I stood up for her though and he got the fuck out of the class. Remember that these are happening in May. The day the school ended they even went out somewhere (but they weren't alone) to eat, which Çağan had taken Sude's phone to block me on her WhatsApp (I was confused and when I called Sude, she was crying). A normal, logical person would definitely stop interacting with this guy (I didn't even tell you how Çağan cheated on Sude, but Sude kept believing he didn't even though all her friend including me had evidence that he did -and the girl Çağan cheated Sude with was another psychopath but that's another story-) but no, Sude wasn't normal. She continued talking and when I asked why she said ""I fear he'll commit suicide if I leave him completely"", I believed at first, but I don't think it is even true now. I also add a quick note here: They had promised each other to commit suicide if they break up. Don't even ask me why, they are fucking mad and I remember convincing Sude not to back when we were just friends. Though, Sude reassured me that their relationship as friends was bad. But in the middle of the summer, we had a romantic night on WhatsApp, we chatted from 11PM to 5AM, it was great, we were dreaming our marriage and some other things we'd do together until in a sudden moment Sude said ""Sorry, I can't do this. I'd do this with Çağan, and we're still good with him (still as friends though, thanks God). I lied you about our relationship being bad."" That was it. I was super mad, and super sad, all day and maybe more than 2 days I told Sude exactly what I was feeling after that, even though she was trying to cheer me up (like hell she could). She came to a point where she couldn't stand it anymore, she said all kind of insults to me, also emphasising how she is not normal so I shouldn't act as she was normal, that she cries a lot, that she was always sleepless (this was definitely true though, her earliest sleeping hour was 3am or so), that she also has feelings so I am unrespectful for making her feel guilty etc. She even wanted to stop talking with me as long as she wants (I only wrote good morning etc. at the time), we didn't chat (except my good mornings) for 3-4 days until she finally started speaking with me normally. This is getting long and, it was oversimplified anyways, so I'll over-oversimplify the next part.

&amp;#x200B;

Number of our quarrels increased, she got angry to me over literally anything (for example, I didn't find what she found incredibly funny even close to funny and much more stupid fights, I can give examples as a reply to your comments if you wonder them but there is no need: They don't even make sense, I even asked my friends' honest opinions about them and they agreed that Sude was overreacting). But still once in 2 weeks or sometimes more frequently, she, out of the blue, said she loved me, and said she wanted to talk to me. Her last ""I love you"" was on the 30th of August. These ""I love you""s come in my most unexpected times, too, like when I am at vacation, or busy for a whole week so I can't speak to Sude frequently enough.

&amp;#x200B;

But 4-5 days ago, in another stupid fight that I can't even remember (this time I acted kind of aggressive towards her not answering my messages, I guess but I think she rightly deserved it) she said that she doesn't fear to lose me as a friend anymore, and that she used to like me very, very much as a friend but now that her views were neutral. So I basically watched her lose her interest on me. And 3 days ago, she said she has a date on this saturday (tomorrow). I asked her who is it with but got replied with ""It is none of your business."" I said ok, despite the fact that I was dying of curiosity and envy, but she suddenly mentioned the topic back, I learned that it is a 12th grade (again, a year older than me) that asked her out for beer on Instagram. Yes, she accepted that. I broke my back for 3 fucking months just to get a single fucking date but no, some random 12th grade was much qualified for that (she said it isn't that random, she said it was interesting that she expressed that she found him sympathetic to her friends even months before that). It is not only that, but she talks to me about it, I can't stand it and I requested her to stop mentioning me him unless I ask. She said ok, but she asked me what to wear on her date and even though I warned her for 5 times, she continued talking about him. It is obvious that she wants to make me envious, and I fucking am, I'm sure she is aware of that too but she achieved much more than that. I couldn't sleep properly in the last 3 days, and my school started as well, I felt like there was a huge gap inside me and always felt stressed and scared  (that's probably because I couldn't hug her for 4 months now, and when I asked her if I can hug her when the school starts back in August she did say no, which shocked me so much at the time, because yes we were having fights, we had bad memories but still we were kind of flirting), but I usually love first days in school I found myself locked for 10 minutes thinking about Sude, forgetting I was in a readiness exam (they test everyone's level on their lessons). I felt like I was in a hardcore depression after that, just thinking about getting out of there while trying to get rid of the thoughts of Sude, making up my answers. Fortunately, I was better when I got some fresh air. Yesterday she asked me if I could come with her after school (I was surprised but not so much since I knew she was going to find an excuse to break the appointment) and yes, as I have expected, she cancelled it. I feel like I am having a heart attack when I see her, even if it is from a far distance.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help. I don't want to live like this anymore, and I couldn't find a way to solve my problems by talking to her. Also I don't think I can handle getting her out of my life. And about her date tomorrow, she says it is going to be fine and they won't be a couple, but it doesn't matter. She might fall in love with him and omfg she can fall in love with anyone except me (well, she falls in love with me at times, as a hobby).

&amp;#x200B;

Some other notes: There isn't even a single day that we didn't chat on WhatsApp, and we used to talk to each other on phone too (about once in 2-3 weeks). 

&amp;#x200B;

I bought her a necklace for her birthday, and a bracelet (I bought the bracelet like 2 months before her birthday but I wasn't able to give it to her since we didn't meet up), I put them into her locker with a long note including birthday wishes (won't talk about that here, but I can do so if you want me to). 

&amp;#x200B;

Her ex still has her Instagram account (Sude said she can't change the password because she forgot the e-mail, but as you can easily understand, that's a big fucking lie), and he blocked me on the very first day of summer, Sude didn't unblock (she did once, but soon after I was reblocked, I even suspect if she blocks me intentionally, though I don't know why) so I am blocked for almost 4 months now. I gladly have a friend stalking her for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite that I have lots of pictures of her, all of them are sent by Sude herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Sude is born in the same year as I did, but she started school late, so she is 10th grade now while I am 11th (just some more info).

&amp;#x200B;

I find her to be more loving to me at night times. She is a whole different person at the morning. And no she doesn't have multiple personality disorder.

We’re still going to be friends and some of my best friends I met through her and they still live in her area, so I want to come and meet up with them all at times. As friends and nothing more. 

But all my friends that I grew up with back home have moved away and have their own lives now. I will arrange to see them at points, but busy schedules and money for travel will always be a factor. I feel kinda lonely at home otherwise. I have an amazingly supportive family and some good friends where I lived before with my ex, but I feel lonely still. I don’t want to become a hermit and stay in my room the whole time at home. I think I do need time alone sometimes, but it will become old fast and I need something to distract myself from being sad. I want to join a gym, which I think will help, but I don’t really know how to get out there and meet new people. 

I will be travelling to a different city altogether this time next year for a masters degree, so I’ll have to start all over again. But for now, I want to focus on the coming months. I will get to see my friends at times, but I do feel like I will be lonely a lot of the time. Therefore I need to compensate for being alone, in which I want to do things for myself, by myself if I have to. Go to the cinema, go shopping, go for walks etc.. 

What advice would you guys give me for dealing with this kind of situation? Thanks.",14Sep2018,3
306,"No matter how amazing I'm treated in relationships, I always end up finding that my guy, at any given time, texts and exchanges pics with other women. I recently gained confidence in my beauty, my personality has always been great, and I'm in great shape. At 30, 10 years of therapy for this, and no progress, I feel ready to end it. The only thing holding me back is my family. How can I find someone who will love me, without me making the same mistakes?

307,"So on Tuesday evening, I met up with a family who has three dogs. An 18 year old Italian Greyhound who is just the sweetest, most affection little old man, a 4 year old cocker spaniel and her mixed 3 year old son. The youngest dog during the meet up came over for affection and to ensure that I was a safe person to be around. I passed his test...until I came back to let them out for the first time Thursday evening. 
What a nightmare. I can get them to calm down if I’m sitting and especially if I’m sitting and handing out treats, but if I’m standing? All hell breaks loose. I never turn my back to them, never raise my voice, never look them in the eye or get worked up. I remain calm, try to do what I have to do without making them feel more threatened than they already are with a stranger in their home and just try to be patient with them. 
What makes me nervous is that the owners had said sometimes they’ll nip at your ankles, the younger dog reached out from on the couch and bit my hand last night as I was trying to get to the door to let the oldest dog out. They make it impossible for him to get to the door to make it out to go potty on time and the mother dog won’t even try to go potty outside. She’ll stare at me and just piss on the floor. 
I’ve been bit three times, all by the same dog and I’ve tried contacting the Rover emergency number for help, but they don’t have anything helpful to say or any good insight on what to do in a scenario like this. 
My boyfriend’s dad told me to be firm but not loud, which I am. To show them my place in the house and to crate them whenever they start to get aggressive, but I can’t even touch them (and haven’t tried) as they’ll either bite (obviously) or just run because honestly, I know they’re scared. 
What can I do to make these dogs more comfortable? I can’t get them to go in their crate, only one will go outside and go potty, and quite frankly, I hate that I have to keep stressing them out like this. I don’t want to get bit again just from being there. ",14Sep2018,3
308,"Hey there, 

I am living at my school and I am having a really good time here with great friends too. But some less great though. The thing is that, we are a group of 4 guys who hang out alot, let’s call them A, B and C. 

The truth is, I only cling with C, the other two are very immature and just not my cup of tea. Also I feel like I am “just there” because I don’t fit the two others.

(A) spend 3/4 of the time being negative and aggressive about anything that is in his way, and his attitude is really gross and annoying. He makes me cringe and litterally want to leave a room when he starts.

(B) does nothing but talk to C when he is in the group. Me and B barely talk unless i put effort into the conversation, that I have no clue about because they usually talk about stuff I werent part of, making me feel put outside.

Me and C fit each other very well, we have same life issues and experience and are both very chill. I enjoy talking, drinking and playing games with him. We have a really good time together, but as soon A and B joins, my joy just get ruined and I feel like just walking away instead of faking my joy with them. 

A is clingy to C. C knows but he don’t really care though he says it’s annoying at times. C is the type of guy who can fit in with all personallities. A also tries to be dominant. He also want to be woken up by us, because he got sleeping problems. How are we able to wale him up? But not alarms? *thinking*

Sometimes I feel like abandon the whole group, just to get rid of the two other, so I dont have to fake having fun. 

Me and C, had another friend lets call him D, who was really fun and also matched us before A and B. but D got kicked out and no longer part of this group anymore as he stopped talking to us after he got a girlfriend. 

I really dont wanna care, but I live with A, B and C at the school, so they are part of my life.

311,"so my brothers 12 and im 20m.

first of all im not his parent so its not my responsibility but im so damn concerned for his future im making it my responsibility.

so his life is: wake up, ipad (yt with/and minecraft or roblox), eat, ipad, sleep.

and school fits in after his first ipad session.

his vision is so tunnelled in to it, he doesnt know whats going on around him until he drops the ipad. 

he doesnt think for himself. i tried to teach him to use his own brain, being calm, talking to him in simple steps. i asked what in here (pointing to my head brain area)... he doesnt answer after asking 10 times, each time reassuring him nothing bads gonna happen and so on... he doesnt answer i even told him you can say i dont know"" if you want... he doesnt respond and i said think.

then my sister got annoyed and said ""say im stupid"" ... and he said im stupid....... so i said whyd you say that and he says because she told me to, so i said if she said jump off a cliff would you? he ofc said no.

so then i said whats in here again and then she says to him say idk, i was like no he can use his own head. then he responds IDK and i said why he says cus she told me to.......

hes very sheepish also and a walk over. he once left open the door for aaaallll the parents and children in primary school (school before highschool) for a performance to enter the hall ... out of kindness... and 90% of then didnt even notice he kept it open. i told him you dont need to be so nice and no one will notice etc.

did i also mention he never got the spanking when he grew up... might i say a spanking goes a long way in the right way imo.

but at this point, its too late and im in no position to do that. SO 

WHAT DO I DO. i told him id confiscate his ipad when i go work (part time on weekends) he doesnt agree ofc.

i said he should read more (the reason for this is because his level of creativity does not expand beyond the minecraft universe or roblox). i gave him an example of creative work in forms of art and writing that he could do, as he struggles to use his brain to think about what/why the creator/author did what they did or even understand it.

my brother does not have any disabilities at all, he is smart and is good in maths. HE JUST doesnt think for himself and is stuck and self trapped in his ipad, tunneling his vision inside the game and basically self brainwashed himself.

he doesnt learn ever, i can tell him a million times to stop doing something, he continues to do it. 

im not ready to be a dad, and theres no way imma father him about.

but if there was anything i could do, what advice would you give.


i tried giving him a life plan eg.

wake up, brush teeth, eat breakfast, etc etc.  he wont even make his own breakfast until everyones awake or someone tells him to or my mum makes it for him.

313,"My [24F] boyfriends sister [24F] borrowed $700 from me in January. She was broke, needed money for bills, I had the money at the time and was stupid to lend it to her, but she was also a avid casino gambler and spent it all on slots and lost it, which makes me look stupider. I know. 
But I obviously would not of given her the cash if I knew she was going to gamble it. She ensured me 3x she’d pay me back within a week. Her husband was supposed to get paid the next week, so I trusted her. 
I knew she was bad with money but it got a lot worse after that, at least I started realizing how horrible she was.
Here’s the real dilemma: so, she obviously didn’t pay me back a week, a month, even a few months later, she always had some bullshit excuse and I felt so bad/weird bringing it up. She hasn’t had a job this whole time FYI and divorced her husband in May. Her father is currently supporting (aka enabling) her. 
We had a falling out in June, it didn’t have anything to do with the money, in fact the last time I brought it up to her was in May and she told me she’d be paying me back in payments, and I said that would be great. Well we haven’t spoken since June and she hasn’t paid me back a dime. 

What should I do? My boyfriend is obviously mad/disappointed with her but I’ve asked him to just stay out of it to avoid conflict. Her father doesn’t know she owes me money and she never told her now ex about it either.  (he was shocked and disgusted) 
$700 is a lot of money to me. I work my butt off. I haven’t accepted the fact that I might never get it back. 
Should I ask her about it? Even though the last time she spoke to me she was screaming like an insane person? Should I get my boyfriend involved? Or should I just try and drop it. I don’t know what other options I have. Although I can’t imagine myself ever just dropping it because I feel like that is so wrong of someone to do...I legit couldn’t imagine not paying someone back $10. 


TL;DR:
I let my BF’s crazy sister borrowed $700 in January. 8 months later she hasn’t paid me back. We stopped speaking in June. Should I accept the fact that I’ll probably never get it back? Confront her? Involve family members? 

Sincerely,

Lost, stupid and could really use $700!!!

314,"So throughout my college years, I had a roommate, whom I considered my best friend. We joined our sorority at the same time and we were thicker than thieves. Flash forward a couple years after graduating, I currently live near my old college town and sometimes still hang out with friends I made while there. 

Enter Old Roommate. She came into town without mentioning it to me, and was hanging out with some of my close friends, without even mentioning it. Ever since graduation, we drifted, but we were best friends. I would at least think that she would let me know she was in the area. I texted her, surprised she was around and asked if she wanted to hang out. Enter the cold answer of her having plans with One Friend. But I know for a fact that the friend has their own thing they're doing tonight that OR can't go to. So why would she lie to me?

 I don't know how to react to this, as I've always been the person to feel slightly betrayed when this stuff happens (I'm not petty, just overthinking everything. Always been like this). So how do I approach this? If I call her out, it'll just get worse. But I feel like I should say something.",14Sep2018,1

317,"TLDR; My boyfriend was thrown into a dumpster at birth. There was a docu-episode done on the case where a woman was interviewed and I need to identify her, at the very least to just prove it isn't her. Looking for advice on how to get the story out there or any paths to take next. The closer I get to finding out who this woman is, the more people shut down and slam doors in my face.

Hi everyone,

I won't make this post about me because it clearly isn't, so let me give you the facts. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost six years. In the beginning of our relationship, when he was 21, he found out he was adopted. He seems to be mixed; his adoptive mom is white and adopted father is black, so he never suspected a thing. Several months later, his mother informed him that he was actually thrown into a dumpster at a local convenience store at birth. Yes, wrapped in cellophane, put into a trash bag with his placenta, and thrown away. This occurred in Loganville, Georgia, in 1992. An investigation was done by police but nothing was ever found and the case went cold. The show 48 Hours, ran by CBS, came to town and ran a special on his case, which was worked as an attempted murder. I have the footage from the episode now that was sent over by a producer, since his mom had lost the VHS she had of it.

So naturally, he took some years to process this information and come to terms with how his life started. This past summer, he said he wanted to attempt to find his family. Now, here's where I come in. I started on the local buy/sell pages on Facebook for that area, just sharing the story in hopes that anyone would remember when this happened and reach out. Turns out, lots of locals remembered. A woman reached out to me and informed me that her parent's lived 0.25 miles from the store then. They had often seen a young pregnant woman walking the road, coming from a house 3 doors down. I will call the family she was staying with ""The Smiths."" There were three sisters (10, 15, 17, at the time), a mother, and a father. The story was that she was a family friend who was sent from her parent's because she became pregnant (most likely because she got pregnant by a black man; this was the rural South in the 90's). Her father had asked the woman where her baby went when she no longer seemed pregnant, and she said she gave it up for adoption. So, he called the police.

The detectives went down the road to interview the woman, and the 48 Hours crew followed. What I mean by this is, I have this woman and her interview on camera. I have her photo. The detectives asked her if she was still pregnant, and she said yes. I do not believe she was still pregnant whatsoever. And if she was still pregnant, why did she tell the neighbors she had given her baby up? The police left and asked no further questions.

I actually got the contact information for one of the sisters of the Smith family, who's house the woman was staying at and was interviewed in. They still own the home today. I have been slowly questioning her for weeks. She straight up denies any pregnant woman ever staying with them. She added me on facebook, so that I could update her on the case. She seemed to want to stay involved, which leads me to believe that she wants to know what I know. I watched her page for awhile, and a woman who is not her sister by blood kept tagging her in ""sisters"" quotes and stuff. This told me that they have probably been friends for quite some time, and she honestly looks like the pregnant woman that was interviewed, so I reached out. This woman lost it. She called me over facebook messenger and told me to stop harassing her. I only messaged her once. She hung up on me and I did not reach out again, mostly because she basically threatened me. That night, she called me over 5 times on facebook, which I did not answer. She said she was going to go to the police and ""get a warrant out on me for harassment."" I told her that I just wanted to ask a few questions, and her friend was so forthcoming, so there was no need for aggression. She totally backed off and started apologizing, begging me to call her and ask her my questions. So, I sent her the photo and asked if she recognized the woman. She said no, she did not recognize her and she assured me that no pregnant woman ever stayed with the Smiths. I left it at that.

The county did reopen the case and assigned their cold case detective to it, but it's been over a month and he's done nothing. I have gotten so far with the search and cannot rely on him to properly do the job. I almost feel like they put him on the case to get me to stop because they know this was not properly investigated at the time.

It's very frustrating to me that everyone is denying that this woman in the video exists. She is real. I have her talking on video. Her name was not included in the footage, unlike all of the others interviewed, so I feel that she was a minor. I know there was some information stricken from the case files, so that may be what was taken off.

**All this to say, where do I go from here**? I have a detective who won't go question anyone. No one will answer me. I have a photo of a woman I desperately need to identify. My thoughts are, that if this was just a woman that stayed with them and not his mother, then they would just tell me who it is. The fact that they deny her existence is very telling. I know this story is so long and complicated, but I have the video if anyone needs proof.

Please, help me. No one will share my posts on facebook. I can't get it to go viral. I know that people will want to help if I could just get it out there. He just wants to know if she ever told the father she was pregnant, and if she knows who it is. Unfortunately, I doubt she will come forward herself as she could still be charged for the crime. He doesn't want this, though, and would not go to police if she came forward.

This is a novel. Thank you if you made it to the end.",14Sep2018,1
318,"FACTS  

* Work in college administration, eight years at same school.
* Boss went out on indefinite leave at the end of last week.
* His boss just asked me to fill in for him, even though I'm several rungs below him in pay/rank.
* I can do 90% of what he did (managerial/operational components) with my eyes closed.
* Other 10% is PR, outreach, community stuff where I have little experience.
* I am a classified employee (supervisor) in a strong union. He is a non-union at-will manager.
* While filling in, I will still be a union employee, but getting his pay (or something close).
* Nobody thinks he's coming back.
* Could easily be in position for 1-2 years, because...
   * He can milk the leave for months.
   * Once he's actually terminated, my boss wants to rewrite his position (lengthy process).
   * HR is notoriously slow at recruiting and hiring. So once position rewritten, could still take a while.
* Have to essentially do his job and mine, but they're giving me an assistant to help with busy work.

&amp;#x200B;

CONCERNS  

* The 10% that I know very little about-- Is there a fast way to learn the basics of PR, outreach, etc?
* Possible resentment, sabotage, future retaliation from coworkers above me who were not offered the position.
* Possible resentment and retaliation from my boss (the one on leave), in the off chance he comes back.
* When the position is finally rewritten and posted for hiring 1-2 years from now, I'm worried about:
   * Not getting it. The position is very high-paying and competition will be fierce.
   * I'm confident that I'll do the job very well, but I only have a bachelor's degree.
   * This position only requires a bachelor's, but will certainly draw applicants with masters+
   * If I did get it, I'm a little hesitant to accept and lose my union protections, guaranteed pension, etc.
* Should I consider applying for a better job while filling in at the higher pay rate, before pay goes back down?

Any thoughts and advice would be very welcome. Thanks in advance!

320,"It started around the same day last month. It's just some things happened before that make me paranoid that I caused the distance. 

So at the beginning of August, after we hung out with each other and watched cartoons (basically saying it was on good terms), we had a heart-to-heart. She told me that she was really worried and stressed about her school since her major was starting to pick up. I told her mine, which was about my suicide attempt a year ago. I suffered from depression and around the time she rejected was when I did it. It wasn't because of her -- family issues (mom's health led me to it). I didn't think of it that way until my therapist got angry at me for ""manipulating her into liking me"", which was never my intention. Ever since, I've been paranoid that my friend wouldn't trust me and I became very paranoid. So I told her and I just mentioned the rejection. I told her that that was never my intention. She said that she never felt like I was and it gave me relief. I asked if the conversation helped her, and she said it did and she thanked me. 

A week later, I text her and she said that she wasn't having a good day and that a family member of hers in the hospital. Gave my worries and she thanked me. Next one, I text her and she just tells that she is not having the best day and that she didn't want to talk about it.

Then she just stopped.

Granted, I am friends with her brother so I was talking to him these couple of weeks and I'm confused now. I thought she would be mad at me for what I said during the heart-to-heart because I feel like I phrased some things wrong in it, but he told me he talked to her and he asked her if I had said something writing to upset her or annoy her...

...but she said no, and even assured her brother that it was actually the opposite... 

She also said she was just dealing with life stuff now. The brother also said that she does that when she is stressed and said that she was neurotic. 

But one day, my friend told me that she has been in a better mood with him so to try and text her again. I did, nothing. He doesn't understand what is going on now because she is seemingly better with him and answering his texts. But she is still ignoring mine.

The problem is they allow the dog off leash in the front and back yard so every time I come home this dog barrels toward me and barks at me like I’m an intruder. I love dogs and It takes a lot for me to get scared. The dog won’t even try to smell my hand. I try to stand tall, not let the dog “sense” I’m nervous, I’ve tried talking calmly to the dog. Ignoring the dog completely. No matter what I do this dog loses its mind every time me or any visitor comes to the house. My friends are too scared to come over because they know there is a 90% chance of this dog being loose on the front lawn. The owners just yell at the dog and tell it to stop and to go to them.  I could even be sitting in the backyard having a drink and they let the dog out and it runs right for me and barks and growls until the neighbour tells it to stop. The dog usually listens but it still gives a person a fright every time this happens.

328,"I recently got out of a short relationship (3 months) a few weeks ago, and there's a guy I've been interested in but have only talked to here and there. I don't want to come off as desperate to him, but I'm terrible at receiving and giving hints. I can't tell at all if he's interested. He might be, or he might just be a very sweet person to everyone.

I'm a much more straight forward person and am considering just letting him know (in person or over text. Which would be better?) that I find him attractive and would like to talk/hang out with him more to develop a friendship or possibly more. Is that too forward? 

It's not like I'm in love with the guy, he's just really cute and pretty shy so I don't think he'll be approaching me even if he is interested.

329,"Alright, so, this post may seem excruciatingly stupid. However, I don't have anybody to turn to on this issue.

So, I'm a grade XI student who has a maths exam in a couple days. Due to some of my educational board's policies, I have to cover 24 chapters in Maths in 2 days. I've been extremely regular to class and have always been in the good books of my teacher. Earlier, she used to allow me to stay back after school to study maths. However, since the beginning of July, she hasn't been giving me any time after school or enough time to clear my doubts. My mother is extremely stingy about my marks, therefore, when I told her that my teacher was unable to teach me today (although I had asked her whether I could stay back or not on WhatsApp twice), my mother got rather angry and decided to complain against my maths teacher to the school. Moreover, Mom wants to meet the Principal and the Heads of the school to discuss why I'm not being given enough attention, especially considering the fact that I am the topper of my batch. I don't want to spoil my relationship with the teacher over a thing which she cannot control as she has to teach quite a many other classes.

TL;DR: Teacher not clearing my doubts, Mom thinks she's being lazy and wants to complain against her. Don't wanna spoil our relation. What should I do?",14Sep2018,2

331,"Hey guys,

I am wondering if there is any chance I might be one of the unlucky few that may have low T. A little bit about me: I have been watching porn for over 13 years and am receiving treatment for it recently with a counselor. It has been somewhat helpful. I don't have the best of diets to be honest... I could afford to eat more veggies, fruits, salads, etc. and put away the McDonald's and beer. I am not losing my hair on my head and have a pretty decent sized beard so this is what makes me confused. I always thought guys with low T had shoddy hair. I am pretty much the definition of skinny fat and practically have to force myself to go to the gym. I just dont have that zest for life to be honest... very nonconfrontational. I have tried dating apps but always convince myself that they are toxic and end up deleting them. I always psyche myself out when it comes to girls so I have never had a real girlfriend. My sex drive is meh. I think I am maybe going through the changes of abstaining from porn right now that my body has to adjust? I am getting morning wood every now and again but not consistently. My passion in life? Nonexistent. I can't think of anything that I can really get perked up for. It feels like everything is a phony and people are just feigning passion just to make money. I dont know who I can trust anymore. My biggest concern is that if I do go for a blood test and find out that I do have low testosterone I dont want the TRT to fuck my body up somehow where I lose my hair so damn quick or I don't know what else could happen... Anyone have experience like this? Just frustrated. I am probably going to eat more veggies/take vitamins here on out. Sorry for this rant -- just want to know if I am alone or not

I've been taking the bus to campus lately and have noticed that there is a guy(that is on the autisim spectrum) keep harassing the female passengers that board.

In the past 2 weeks I’ve stopped leaving the house to do simple things like tanning, putting off getting my haircut, and pretty much all the way around avoiding everything except work. I get up, go to work, and come home and watch YouTube videos. I’ve had problems with mild social anxiety in the past but low doses of Xanax has helped. 
Nothing in my life has changed drastically, I have a girlfriend and a good group of friends but I’ve started to even push myself away from them and it’s more subconscious than anything. I’m finding I could avoid negative situations by not letting situations present themselves at all. If I just stay away then things will be more simple I guess is what I’m thinking. 
I work retail and I’m talkative, have a great relationship with my coworkers who show me respect. I don’t understand what’s come over me recently and just someone else’s insight who can relate could help me greatly. I don’t want to live my life as a hermit!

341,"i love my parents and respect them. that being said my dad hurts my feelings as a father son relationship.

im the oldest of 3.  and i grew up being told the eldest takes the heat etc etc.

my dad has never taught me anything in my life - hes been strict with me all my life  as a form of keeping the children under control. keeping the oldest under control means the younger ones are too...

so according to this silent rule. he barely speaks to me, keeps his distance, doesnt act so lovey unless its once in a while. ill consider it that he does love me.

but when i do smth wrong he just gives me the most painful stare or tells me how bad i am or how wrong i am and how crap i am. 

the only time we conversate is when he wants me to talk about his own interests, or hes telling me off.

no love no care.

and then when me and my siblings argue he bullys me telling me how dumb i am to do that and why dont act more mature and ignore them (aka let them walk over me) and tells me to be chill and peaceful with smth i disagree with. 

he tells me that... but when the same situation is between me and him. he dont have that chill or peace ... he a hypocrite.

he hasnt taught anything to me in my life and has expected me to have figured it all out 5 years ago. im 20M.

when i watch him be all lovey and fatherly with my younger brother, my mum (who i complain to cus shes the one who actually listens to me and discusses with me) tells me that hes the youngest so needs to be treated good or hell cry etc.

- well f that. cus i was brought up strict.

then i see him treat my sister extra well

and my mum says... cus shes the only daughter. so i ask my mum... what about me?

she says, ""dads have to be strict to the oldest one"" and i was like ""...""

its worse because im the one who listens and respects and does everything for my dad than them all...

I EVEN MASSAGE HIS STINKY FEET - cus i know he works hard and is tired and doesnt get good sleep etc. and even when i do, he makes me do it often when i dont want to and if i dont he emotionally blackmails me tells me i dont care for him OR gets mad at me and not understand the struggles hes going through.

so im treated like shit. taught nothing. and expected to have known everything.

as a result, its affected the way ive grown up and my socialising skills.

worst of all, my mum and her brother are travelling to another country to see their mum (my nan). and my mums the only that treats me fairly - in a way im losing my best friend for 2 weeks and ill be stuck with my dad parenting us alone for 2 weeks.

that being said i am going back to university soon on the 1st of october.

but it wont end this problem.

my dad is too strict to ever have a conversation with me, and if dont agree with him, he thinks im too dumb to understand what hes saying and that hes a level above me.

i just hate my dad in that sense. it may seem like im whining for nothing as i still have a dad etc

but in this sense he might not as well be, hes just bringing money in, so to say.

his strictness just makes me want to rebel more and move to another country.

Another thing is that, hes extra strict because all my dads brothers and brother in laws have been too loose with their kids and a lot of their sons have become drug addicts. so he thinks he has all the right to continue.

i cant tell my dad all this because like i said i just cant conversate with him cus hes too arrogant and stubborn. and when my mum tells him what weve discussed she doesnt say it all properly.

and if i come out to him how ive resented him for so long hell tell me... oh thats how you feel huh? after i raised you your whole life and fed you? well you can get out of my house, my hearts like stone and i can flick you out if you want to go and i can love you with it all if you want to stay.

345,"Throwaway :)

About 2 years ago I (m14 at the time, m16 now) met a girl online (same age as me) that I really liked, let's call her... Amber. 

So Amber was your typical gamer girl I guess you could say. She would sometimes join in in the discord call when my friends and I played League of Legends together. Even among all my friends talking at the same time, we've always felt that there was some kind of connection between us. About a month passed and we started playing alone together, in a private call. This is when my friends that I went to school with and I started drifting apart, because I'd always spend time with Amber. (Amber and I were long distance btw)

I remember at that time I had a lot of fun when we were just texting all day and when we both could, we'd hop on our computers and play LoL together (note that we still weren't officially ""together""). Some time passed and at some point I discovered that she was a smoker. Being born in a religious family, my brain kept telling me to let go and just stop talking to her, but I was pretty much addicted to her. Even when she dropped out of school and my brain kept telling me to leave this education-less chick, I didn't.

Inside though, I was broken (probably an exaggeration). My friends hated me cause I wouldn't spend time with them, I was dependent on Amber, I was jealous of her boyfriend, etc. Then the day came while I was on a trip: she broke up with her boyfriend. I remember being very happy despite her being depressed, and being blinded by my love for her, I asked her out the following day. I know what you're thinking: ""OP wtf give her time to cool down"" and I get that *now* but at the time I was so madly in love with her that I couldn't spend a day without talking to her. Suprisingly though, she accepted and we started dating, still long distance.

We lasted 2 weeks.

At the time, she was under a lot of stress due to the fact that she wasn't going to school and had to go to court. I remember her saying that she wasn't ready for a relationship. I wasn't happy. I blocked her, and unfriended her everywhere. I kept thinking about her though, and despite my judgement, I contacted her a day later, said I was sorry and we continued being ""just friends"".

After a week, Amber got a new boyfriend, I still had huge feelings for her, so I was jealous. Slowly, she started talking more and more to her boyfriend, and I was left in the background, alone. Our texts were basically limited to ""Good morning"" and ""Good night"". After a month or so of this way of us ""talking"" like this, I confronted her about it. She got mad and I got mad and I told her that she made me feel lonely. She suddenly felt bad and sorta apologized. I say ""sorta"" cause it was pretty half-assed. Anyway, we started talking some more, and I was happy again.

The thing is, while we weren't talking much anymore, I met another girl, let's call her Sarah. We started talking more and more and at that point, I was talking to 2 girls at once. Sarah and I started talking a *lot*, like a lot a lot, but I still preferred my first love, Amber, despite still having feelings for Sarah. After Amber and I made up, I told her about Sarah and how I liked her a lot. She sadly ""let me go"". Our texts were very limited once again, but this time, I was happy because I was talking a lot to Sarah, and my friends and I recconected. So in a sense, Sarah became Amber 2.0. She didn't smoke, went to school, and was a very smart and beautiful girl. After about a month, Amber and I ""officially"" said goodbye for the last time, and I haven't talked to her since.

Sarah and I are still together to this day, despite the fact that we've never met, we're both very happy together and are making plans to meet next summer. The problem lies in the fact that, even after being with Sarah for over a year now, I still have feelings for Amber. Although they're not as strong as they used to be, they're there. At this point, I dunno what to do, I know that I shouldn't love Amber due to her dropping out of school and smoking and whatnot, my friends hate her because of the fact that I wouldn't spend time with them while with Amber and I'm in a relationship.

What should I do?

Getting into frat parties has been pretty hard, and although I’ve made a few friends here and there, I haven’t really found people I REALLY connect with. 

I’ve always been pretty good with girls but it’s been dry since I got here. people always say hooking up is 100x easier in college than in high school but it’s been even harder so far. 

All this has just been making me feel even more introverted and lost, and I really don’t want my next four years to feel like this.

I’m a senior in college and live about 6 hours away from my hometown. I moved into a 1 bedroom apartment in a pretty shitty complex about a year ago because it’s the only affordable place here in town. I haven’t had any major problems until a few months ago. 

My neighbor is a few years older than me and not the sharpest tool in the shed but a nice guy that I didn’t have a problem with until he had a woman move into his apartment that either has a drug problem or a mental illness, or both. She SCREAMS at the top of her lungs for hours on end next door, slams doors and cabinet doors so hard that my silverware and plates vibrate in the drawers over here. Whenever I go to the bathroom, I can hear her talk in the bathroom next door. She sometimes screams obscenities and her witch-like voice makes it a million times worse.  She once “threatened” to put a camera in my bathroom to find out “what the fuck you’re doing over there”. I never respond to any of this and I’m also not loud. 

I went over there once at 11:30 pm to complain to my neighbor about it because her screaming and swearing kept me up and I had an exam the next day. He said he couldn’t make her stop so it obviously didn’t get better. I’m pretty sure she’s not on his lease and not even supposed to live there. It is making my life hell because I can’t study in peace or sleep when I come home after a long day of classes and work.

362,"Using a throw-away because I'm very embarrassed, but long story short, and keeping out details: I never got to go to School growing up because of family complications. Family support is out of the question. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for where I'm at;

I was told by a friend to take online classes and start at a 4rth grade level. But I look around and it's just daunting with all the options there is, not only that, left and right I see shams like ""10 EASY STEPS FOR A DEGREE!"" and I'm just unsure what's legit or not. I want to actually be educated, not looking for a shortcut. I have 0 clue how this really works as I never even went to a real school before. I hardly grasp grades and so fourth. I ask my friend and even he gets confused on where to start online and says ""Just keep looking."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like advice on where I should start, I'm very lost on this. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but I genuinely would like a pointer. I'm not even sure if taking online classes is a good idea.",14Sep2018,1
363,"I'm a first year university student. As of right now, I'm currently just taking subject that interest me (writing, philosophy, intro to business). I enjoy the courses that I take, but I can't help but wonder if university is for me. I don't really see myself graduating, but I also don't know if that the fact that I'm just unsure of what I want to do. I mean obviously I can always go back to school, but for some reason I have this feeling that me going to university is a temporary thing, like I don't really picture myself graduating.

I've been taking a lot of online course/webinars. And I notice that I enjoy that way of learning too. I'm all for learning on your own and getting a mentor, rather than just sitting in the classroom and not getting experience. 

I have an idea of what I want to do, and I really want to help people and I do enjoy business, and creating content. I've looked into  social media marketing, life coaching and since I like content creating I'm going to do it on the side, blogging/vlogging. I'm also really interested in creating my own a lash line and maybe become a lash tech.

If I had to pick a profession, I wouldn't mind being an English teacher but I don't see myself sticking to that job forever.

Obviously I can do these things I mentioned on the side, but I just feel like in a way I'm wasting my time in university. I don't know if I'm just being stubborn, biased and maybe even confused about what I want to do but I honestly don't really see myself graduating from university.  Also it doesn't really help with my mom pressuring me, about how I need to stay in school, graduate and have a job. Then once I have that job I can do whatever I want after. Basically she's saying the job i get after university that will support me enough so that eventually that job's income will be enough for me to work with what  I'm most passionate about. 

Now you know a bit of where I stand and what I'm interested in, maybe I can get some advice/thoughts/views  from other people! All your input is much appreciated! ",14Sep2018,3

365,"A friend of mine told me he'd kill himself and that I was the only friend he had. I don't think he would have killed himself but I think he really did feel as if he wanted to. We were friends for one or two years and he wanted hugs and stuff. I don't like physical contact but it was just a hug so I thought nothing of it. I suspected he liked me and then he confessed to me. I told him I didn't feel the same way. By then, he'd told me about his hang ups so I let him down gently and he seemed to take it fine. 

He touched me a little more. Stuff like the hair and asked for more hugs. I don't like that thing but I was insecure, weak-willed and lonely with no other friends so I brushed it off. He asked to touch my breasts and other places just to see how they felt. I said no but he'd always ask again an hour later or the next day. I gave in eventually and he'd tell me how horrible he felt about his life and how he really loved me and stuff. He'd ask me to give him a chance. I'd tell him I didn't want to but he'd ask the next day and again and again. 

I had no experience with this sort of thing and I liked it when he'd tell me I was pretty or smart or how he loved me. I liked talking to him and we had similar attitudes, philosophy and political views. I didn't feel like an alien around him and isn't that what you do with a boyfriend anyway? I decided to give him a chance and thought that I could get over the physical stuff eventually.

Things escalated really quickly though. He told me how much he wanted me and flattered me a lot. I felt more and more guilty every time I said no. I imagined how horrible it would be to hear him committing suicide and knowing that I made it happen. If some touching makes him happy then I was very selfish for saying no so much and he was always so disappointed. I don't really want to go into details how much we actually did together but he never did anything when I said no and he was never aggressive or angry with me. He even checked up on me afterwards to make sure I was fine and okay with what we were doing. I lied because I thought it would make him feel really bad to know that I didn't like it. He wasn't physically attractive and didn't have a good self-image.

After a week of getting me naked, he noticed that I had tears in my eyes and he told me he was sorry and broke the thing off when I couldn't. I don't even think he noticed what he was doing or how I felt before then though he may have had a feeling which was why he kept asking if I was fine. I believed him when he said he was sorry and won't do it again, though that doesn't say much. We stayed friends and we still talk. I don't let him touch me and he hasn't asked but we both know that if he wanted to, he could probably pressure me into it again. The one friend I've told doesn't like that I'm still around him.

The guy did not send my items for 2 weeks, on me asking for a refund claimed he had sent them and was looking for the receipt; then sent a message of said receipt showing they had just been posted 2mins earlier, before sending half my order damaged and practically unusable.

I contacted him asking what he wanted to do about it and he offered partial refund. As the order was for a friend I said no and would like my money back. He then asked me to post them back to him and he would refund me.... Of course you will champ. 

I explained that I had opened a PayPal dispute due to him not sending the items, and he got a bit shirty and said we will let them decide.

Now, I'm pretty confident that PayPal will side with me and ask me to return them so my question is this. Be a good gent and return my side of the bargain as is, or send him back a box full of grapes/washers/screws and keep the stuff for him being an ass?

I haven’t been able to master controlling the temperature down here because the thermostat is upstairs in their living space for the whole house. They keep the temperature set the same, but downstairs is always too hot or too cold, never just right. 

There are 2 air vents that are in our main living space. We keep the one closest to the kitchen open at all times. It’s the furthest away from our couch so it’s not blowing directly on us. The other one is on the opposite side of the room, right next to our couch. We generally keep this one closed, but I find when it’s closed it gets too hot but when it’s open it gets too cold. 

Both vents are on the ceiling.

376,"I'll try to make this short and sweet: My cousin, who has been my best friend since we were little kids (I'm 30 and he's 32, now) simply won't talk to me. A little backstory;  approximately 8 months ago his wife told him she wanted a divorce which was no big surprise. He started cheating on her, in their house &amp; on their bed they shared together, within two months of getting married. He always treated her like crap and has just always been a very selfish/borderline narcissistic dude. This same guy used to go out of his way to sleep with girls I liked when we were in high school, but I always forgave him because we're family and best friends and it was easy come easy go for me. Anyways, as soon as she told him she wanted a divorce he started looking for excuses as to why it was happening. He hinted to me that he thought she was cheating on him and later came out and told me he knew that I was sleeping with her. I live 3 hours away from them and I would never dream of doing such a thing. He had very bizarre ""evidence"" of our ""affair"", but later admitted that he knew I didn't sleep with her and that he was sorry. Of course, I forgave him because I knew his head wasn't in the best place with all that was going on. Fast forward a couple months and I told him I was going to be in town and wanted to talk. He told me he might have time to get lunch, but that was it, which I took as an insult considering how much I have forgiven him for and how much we've went through together. I know his schedule and his life, he was shortchanging me to go out and try to get laid. Now, suddenly I'm the bad guy and he won't even take a few seconds to respond to a text. I know I shouldn't care, but I love the dude and we've been through everything together. He'll talk to MY friends, the ones I introduced him to and only through me he knows, yet he won't lift a finger to talk to me. I'm having a really tough time understanding this, especially since I'm the one who should be mad at him for; 1. accusing me of the ultimate betrayal, and 2. because I have forgiven him for all of the terrible shit he has done to me in the past. He'll also talk to our other friends who have not been 1/100 as loyal or supportive of him, ever. To top it all off, he has badmouthed and talked shit about ALL of these people who he now confides in and uses for their company/support. Any advice or similar stories??",14Sep2018,2

Should I just quit now and work somewhere while I wait for school to start? I’m going to work at least part time during school but I don’t know where to work that will offer a decent pay to cover bills. At this point I just want to enjoy my life again. ",14Sep2018,2
379,"We're Canadian. This is going to be a long post too and I'm not even including everything they've done because it would be too much. I've posted before and deleted it in fear of her finding it. I probably have to delete this one too. I just need advice on what steps to take for my sanity.

My flatmate is religious and told me as such before we moved in. I mentioned I had a boyfriend and that he wouldn't be over often and she said it was fine if he was. I made it a point to always ask her if it was alright to have him over (in my room) for a few hours and she eventually got annoyed that I kept asking permission so I stopped when she asked me to. He's over almost every day (not weekends) now for about 2 or 3 hours depending on our work and university schedules, but it's always in the morning when she's gone or asleep. He comes over to get extra hours to sleep. We aren't loud. We do shower together before he goes, but again, we aren't loud and it's after 8am at that point anyway.

She went away for a week during a holiday weekend and came back (I texted her a few times to remind me the rent was due and that pissed her off) and tells me she's married and wants to move her husband in, in a few months. I give a half hearted congratulations and tell her I had no idea she had a boyfriend because I thought she was afraid of men, since she told me that was part of the reason along with her religion why she didn't want my boyfriend over too much. She scoffs, gets angry and says it's courting in her culture and acts incredibly offended that I called him her boyfriend. She moves him in a month later without my consent and he's a sexist asshole towards me about my clothes.

They fought 24/7 and one night she accused him of beating her and raping her and she tried to drag me into it and say I was a witness to it. I was not. While he IS an asshole, he's never even raised his voice to her in my presence. They only fight when they think I'm not home and it's always her who started the fights over ridiculous things like water on the bathroom floor or eating without her consent. If I'm being honest she seems like the abusive one, not me, but whatever man, not my problem. He left after a month because of her threats and their general incompatibility back to his home country.

Yesterday she texts me to ask me when my boyfriend and I are taking over her portion of the lease so she can leave. I explain that him and are absolutely do not want a huge 2 bedroom apartment with a gigantic living room and dining room. We just cannot justify that amount of space, nor can we fill it. Not to mention that we never once said we would take over her lease. I did mention in passing once that I would be willing to have HER HUSBAND take my half of the lease to give them privacy, but nothing more. As her husband could not get a job, that never happened and things remained as they were.

She got upset when I told her we would not be taking over her half of the lease, but that she would be free to find someone else to take it and that she can move out once our leasing office approves it and does a background and credit check on them and they come back clean. Instead she counters that I need to find someone to replace myself and that it must be a female who does not have a boyfriend nor plans to have one in the future. She then proceeds to blame her broken ass marriage on my boyfriend and I because we didn't give them enough privacy and that I enjoy the company of men too much.

First off, I have ONE man in my life. Second, we are RARELY at the house. We either go out or stay very quiet and he sleeps or does homework while I read and listen to music. Finally, I am rarely in the house in general because of how often I work. She is ALWAYS home so it's not my fault on occassion my boyfriend sees her when she's 'not decent' and that, that disrespects her husband and her culture. This isn't what I signed on for and she can kick rocks and deal. He doesn't want her ugly ass anyway so what's she worried for.

Finally, she's angry I no longer pay for any shared household resources. I used to buy dish soap, hand soap, air freshener and toilet paper, but it would all mysteriously vanish or get used up so I stopped since she never bought any until we were out and had been out for weeks. She's so adamant about not buying toilet paper that she will shower after each and every bowel movement she has instead. God forbid I forget and accidentally leave my roll behind, because she snatches that shit in a heartbeat and it's never seen again regardless of it being a brand new roll or not. She also constantly bemoans working and going to school and how she's always tired and in debt and how I should pay more because I'm better off and have no debt.

I've obviously refused.

I plan on moving my boyfriend in and our leasing office has already approved it, but I'm not paying a cent more than what I already do. We share a singular room and shower together as well as leave all our lights off and use natural lighting. We also never run the ac which she runs at 65 degrees constantly. I have refused to pay the outrageous bill and agreed to pay a quarter of what is owed and he's throwing a huge fucking fit regardless. She's a damn child, it's no wonder her husband left.

Am I being unreasonable here? Short of finding someone to take over my lease (which I'm still legally bound to should said person not pay) I'm at a lose at how to deal with her tantrums and passive aggressive drama. I would rather ride the lease out til March of next year and be done with it. I've already informed the office I will not be renewing my lease next year and they understand and are offering me a discount for a smaller room next March. How do I survive with this psycho until then?",14Sep2018,1
380,"So here's my story: I moved to NYC for a new (contract) job. Figured while I was at the contract job, I could network and make connections to help me on the next step of my career.

Well, the contract ended a while ago and I now unemployed for several months. I feel like my chances of ever getting a ""good"" job are slipping further and further away the longer I remain unemployed. (I'm talking 'entry-level' jobs, not C-suite jobs; I just want something that has more room for growth than 'assistant night shift manager') To make things worse, I screwed up in college, had an existential crisis my senior year and WRECKED my GPA so grad school is out of the picture (even if my grades were better, I'd still not be able to pay for grad school).

I spend a lot of time beating myself up for letting my life get to this place. I hate everything about myself and want desperately to get a job I can be proud of so that I can actually answer the question ""so what do you do?"" without being evasive or admitting that I'm an unemployed degenerate.

I feel super-entitled whining how I can't get a 'good' job, like I expect everything handed to me on a silver platter. However, my brother and several friends from high school and college have flashy, prestigious jobs and I feel like a fucking failure every day.

A different friend of hers decided to throw a party. Sounds fun. We usually make a nice dinner at someone’s house and play music. That’s what I was expecting. 

What I got was an email from the other friend saying she made reservations somewhere and please bring the money to pay for it. 

At no point was this discussed with anyone. She just took it upon herself to make all these expensive arrangements and is now demanding money. She “paid for everything up-front” and it’s “non-refundable”. 

The birthday girl is excited about it. I’m also staying with the birthday girl, with nowhere to go, and the reason I flew out there was exactly for the reason of celebrating her birthday. It’s pretty difficult to just lie to get out of it. 

But I’m also angry that I didn’t even get a heads-up as to what I would have to pay. It’s not birthday girl’s fault, and I don’t want to start any drama and ruin her birthday.

Their mom recently had a new baby and my 3 year old nephew has been regressing a bit and asking for help with things he definitely knows how to do on his own. 
Today at the playground he was acting like he didn’t know how to go down the fireman’s pole. I stood nearby but insisted (audibly) he do it on his own and he did 3 or 4 times. I went to help my older nephew across the monkey bars (a few feet away I would have heard for sure if he asked for help and he didn’t), and when I came back the grandpa was helping my little nephew down the pole. I almost made a joke about him being bamboozled by my nephew who can do it alone but then I noticed the man’s hand was squeezing his butt hard. 
I come from a generation of don’t touch other people’s kids without permission, but even with an age gap surely a waist is the best place for helping a child down from a height? Or arms out to catch if necessary but not to hold and squeeze the child by the butt? 
My nephew had no strong reaction and the man said nothing and left with his grandson soon after.

For a while now, I have noticed that little things that I think should not annoy me, do.

It's just little things that I know I wouldn't do and I guess I expect that of her as well.

I realize that when I was younger, stuff like this was burned into my head and I have really internalized  it and that maybe she was not raised that way, hence why she doesn't think like me. But still, common sense to me.

It makes me feel like I'm an asshole and that I'm super needy, granted I am needy but just too much so. I also feel like with some of these things, she should be able to put herself in someone else's shoes and understand how it's annoying or aggravating. 

I am pretty observant and I notice these small things but also insecure and so I feel like I'm a second thought or that I'm not very important. Therefore, I notice every instance where she does things like this and I feel unimportant often.

I just want to convince myself that stupid shit like this doesn't matter and that we would both be happier if it didn't annoy me in the first place. Any tips for how I should treat situations like this or how I could feel more secure in my relationship? 

I know deep down that I am very important to her. But no matter how clear the water is, you can't see the bottom if you look directly into the glare.
Somebody give me some sunglasses, please.

P.S. she has an amazing heart and I don't think she tries to annoy me a lot of the time. She is loyal to a fault and I appreciate her very much.",14Sep2018,3

Fast forward to last week she follows me on instagram and I follow her back as I do with most people even if don’t recognize them as my Dad is kind of a figure in my religion as a counsellor (which fucking blows but at the same time doesn’t). When she followed me I instantly get hit by a “FOUND YOU”. And everything clicked as I realized what happened, it was Midget Chick fuck. After she sent me some really quite creepy shit, like kinda weird messages and shit. So yeah I know shes probably stalking me.

399,"My husband and I have been living in our apartment for two years this November. Almost every time it rains our apartment floods, it comes in through the walls on the side of the building. When there isn’t much rain we only get water in our living/dining room area which is all vinyl. Three times now it has been so bad that it has flooded the entire apartment, saturating the carpet in both of our bedrooms. We then move all of our stuff into the living room and wait for them to remove the pad and clean the carpets, which normally takes a few weeks. This past Saturday was the most recent time we flooded and since our lease is up in November we talked to the apartment office about the problem. I then learned that they have known about the problem for at least four years, even though we were never told, and that if we move out they will just move other people in. I was told “it isn’t uninhabitable.” They have offered us no options to help nor have they offered to supplement our rent for all the trouble. We have lost numerous personal belongings and been put through quite a bit of stress all because they never mentioned that this building has a flooding problem. We are lost on what to do. Should we just move apartments and forget about it or should they be helping out with the situation more? I’m also concerned that the carpet has been saturated three times with flood water and still hasn’t been replaced. This time all they did was pull out the pad and put down fans to dry the carpet. It has been a week tomorrow and it still hasn’t been cleaned. The smell is terrible. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",14Sep2018,3
400,"I (21f) am in the second year of university. The trasnfer from high school, where I didn't study at all was pretty hard for me, not only in the terms of getting disciplined, but also in handling all the stress mentally. This lead to me ending up in therapy, since the stress drove me to depression and the ""I guess I can just end this life since I am a failure anyway"" mode. I am currently on antidepressants and although I'm doing much better, I have a huge exam next week that I NEED to pass, so in the last week I've been pretty stressed out again.

One of the reasons I am so prone to stress is because I am unable to value my own work. I am perfectionist (in the worst sense of the word).  If I study let's say 10 hours a day, I still go to sleep feeling like a slob because there were still moments where I did 'nothing' (cooking, bathing, relaxing for an hour, let's say). I am trying to overcome this, visualize how much I do and seeking valuation from my boyfriend and people around.

But this month, I'm staying at home, as in with my parents. And boy, they are not making it easier for me. 

They no longer say things like ""And did you study today?"" or ask me how much I've done. But I like to put on earphones and listen to some music while I study - and I use my computer and youtube to do that. Also my boyfriend helps me if I don't understand and/or I research the subject on the internet. So 90% of the time I study, I have the computer turned on in front of me.   
Let's say I get stuck with a math problem. I ask my boyfriend via facebook or search similar problems on google. If my father goes around while I look into the computer and not my notes, he asks ""Are you studying or facebbok-ing?"" in a bit degrading tone. At first, it's more about teasing me, but if I type for a longer period of time, or God forbid read something longer on the monitos, he starts to actually show concern about my discipline. My mother and sister are quite similar.   


Now obviously, with my mental issues, this does A LOT of damage - and doesn't help the studying at all.

My family knows I'm in therapy, and knows that it's because of the stress from school, but have never been really good in discussing what it actually means, my feelings and issues. I can't really imagine how to tell them. Then again, my results, as in passing exams, haven't been that great too, so I can't use that as an argument. 

Any advice? Please?

403,"This is a very complicated story but I’m going to try to explain it the best I can. A few weeks ago, my boyfriend of 1.5 years (who was also once my coworker before he left 2 weeks ago) moved out of a house that he shared with one of our other coworkers (call her X) and her boyfriend. They had a lot of fights about petty issues and who owed what before he left. X decided to seek revenge on my boyfriend the other day. Apparently she knew my boyfriend was attracted to another coworker of mine in my department (Call her Y) I had no clue about, and decided to text my boyfriend pretending to be Y, sending flirtatious and sexual messages. After all the stress my boyfriend has been through of different things going on I can’t go into detail about, he made bad decisions and gave in and said things he shouldn’t have said and cheated. I’m not defending him, but what she did was wrong. Now an ex boyfriend of Y who is also our coworker is going and telling everyone that Y had an affair with my boyfriend to “ruin her life”. I’m to embarrassed to even show my face at work now. I went to management and they said they would investigate, but they’re known for not doing anything about these situations. I threatened to go to HR but I don’t know if that will do anything either. I want to explode on X and scream and yell and probably do something that would get me arrested, but I know it wouldn’t be the mature thing to do...what do I do to fix this if my management doesn’t do anything? I can’t let her get away with this. I’ve delt with her belittling me in the past and I can’t handle this anymore

He says he wants to remain neutral in the situation, so he'll stay where he is (with J). Anyhow, the reason I want to leave this group is because J posted ""dont come to school tommorow"", which a GIF of a cat firing a gun. When it happened, I called him through discord and he says it was a joke and everyone thought it was funny, and assured me he'd never do anything like that. Okey. But I'm a worrier, so I start to remember that he plays Gary's Mod ""School Shooter Simulator"", that he used to bring a nerf gun to school and just shoot random people (wth), and that hes racist (i dont know if this matters). Although over internet he seems weird, in person he's really a normal guy thats ok to talk to, which is why I didn't report him in the first place. But, low and behold, he made another post. See, I would have reported him with the first one but that could get him expelled; or worse, which could ruin his future. But I feel guilty because he may be an actual threat. I've consulted several of my friends and every one of them say that it's just his type of humor.

406,"This is going to be really controversial and I am going to get a lot of negative comments towards my husband (and probably myself), so I may delete this later depending on how it all goes. I’m in a serious pickle honestly though,  and I truly need advice.

My husband is taking three online classes right now as well as working two jobs. I work one job but it’s only part time. We start a new semester on Monday, so he is at the end of the semester in these three classes. 

While he is at work if I am off, ALL semester he has come to me kind of whining and asking if ai can help him finish an assignment here and there. He is in easy core classes that I’ve already taken. I know it’s wrong and I honestly feel guilty, but my husband is always so tired and he works so hard so I have felt guilty and will just say yes. I started helping with an assignment here and there, but It has added up though to this point where he now almost expects me to help him. Eventually it got to a point where one of the classes has become pretty much my responsibility. I don’t even think he looked at three weeks of work on there. I did kind of fight back once by “forgetting” to do the hw in one of his classes and he got mad at me because he didn’t do it either and his grade dropped significantly. (A to a C-) And I kind of got into an argument and we both apologized and before we knew it here we are again in the same spot.

Right now I am doing his final projects in two of the three classes and they are due tonight. It sucks. I don’t want to do it, but i’m almost done and will be finished (for this semester). He checks in all the time too and says guilt-trippy things like “so.... just wanted to thank you SO much for helping me with the hw.... means the world” which I take to mean he is trying to remind me in a manipulative way that he wants me to check the hw. 

My issue is right now I am frustrated at myself mostly for giving in and doing his hw all of these times. Now I have gotten him in a spot where it is essentially the last day of the semester and I am like basically done with it all, but now I just resent him. I’m mad at him for putting me in this situation. I know he works so hard and I’m grateful but I feel a little manipulated. I know this is BOTH of our faults- mine for giving in and doing something I know to be cheating and wrong, but his for asking and guilting me into it. I resent him and I am frustrated and upset. I don’t know what to do or say. I feel weak.

The other thing is that my husband is actually a VERY good man and always thinks of me first and I think he truly started out this process just needing help and it has evolved into this where he is leaning on me a bit too much.

I learned a while ago that they're very restricted on what they do, they aren't allowed to go outside of their house, they have security cameras in every room in their house spare the bathroom and their bedroom which constantly notify their mother of their movement, Their mother is addicted to video games (to the point of borderline child neglect), specifically some sort of mobile game (Bad taste, I know) and their lives are dictated by their her.   


I should also add that they're both trans and want to dress up like boys.  


I recently had a conversation chain with them via text that makes me worried...  


(()) - This means the enclosed text wasn't in the text itself, I'm just adding it for context.  


Me: What stuff, tell me.

Her: um. it's kind of a lot.

Me: Tell me, worst thing your mother has done.

Her: There's two I guess. There was when we came out as trans and they screamed at us ((Her mother and her boyfriend)) till we cried, saying this was not okay, not normal, not real. there were several fights after that first one on the matter, saying your family will never accept you, this is fake, this is a mental illness. then they proceeded to deny my right to feel what I ((I believe she meant have been, instead of  I do, she's talked about her depression before)) do recently, by saying I'm faking depression and anxiety for attention and that those things are not real either. She tried to get in bed with me that night to cuddle me so I wouldn't tell anyone and I had a panic attack because she was so close and touching me, and I had to pinch myself hard and bite my lip to keep from screaming. Since then, I don't like being physically close to her

Her: She said I need therapy and I said yeah, I'm suicidal I'd love a therapist and she didn't take it seriously. I told her how depressed  I was and how much I hated myself and she thought it was bullshit.

Her: She literally said

Her:You have no reason to feel that

Her: You don't have depression

Her: or anxiety

Her: When I stopped shaving my legs she called me disgusting

Her: She says the clothes I wear look like garbage

Her: hobo, etc.

Her: She took the clothes I liked wearing bc they made me look like a boy

409," Hello, I had a small business idea that I think would be really beneficial for Ontario High-School Students and wanted your feedback before I spend all this time and find out no one wants it.

If you want to take the idea for yourself, be my guest. This means its a good idea! Just let me know if you like it.

In short, I am a tutor for high school math and charge $20-40 an hour. But in this hour we only accomplish one lesson / one homework. Instead, I want to build a whole website teaching grade 9-12 math and science and charge a monthly fee of $20/month for this whole catalogue of videos.

Yeah I know Khan Academy is great and you can probably YouTube each lesson and find a video. But I haven't seen a program or channel that is structured and organized to fit the Ontario High School Curriculum. Students don't have the ability to really learn ahead or have lessons organized + worksheets + solutions to worksheets.

If your a parent and have a child in high-school please let me know if this is something you would really shell out $20 a month for.",14Sep2018,3
411,"I will probably sound like a horrible person because of this but here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a fairly old and somewhat close friend, that I've on off had contact with.  Since a little over 10 years ago though I haven't really had regular interaction with him so it's not like we're THAT close to be perfectly honest, and have had a lot to share but he really does love me and I believe love him too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now he's recently reappeared in my life and is currently dying of cancer.  He came back to my area with his wife and young kids and is at the moment living out of a trailer.  He's currently calling me every day and wants me to come over all the time to be with him.  I currently have issues and stress of my own; some health problems though not as severe/dire, a job where I work about 60 hours a week, depression and anxiety issues that I haven't had officially diagnosed but are pretty damn sure are there.  I feel really tired and burned out all the time, and by nature I'm very reclusive and anti-social, though I try my best.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know how to deal with it right now.  He doesn't seem to want to do anything about his cancer; I don't know the details or how long it's been and can ask him more but I feel it's a sore spot and that he's trying to run away from it.  I tend to not want to pry into people's lives that way personally either.  I think the most he knows is that he has it.  He hasn't tried anything else but get the initial diagnosis, not visited an oncologist or seen his options or anything.  I have a few thousand saved up myself and have been in the process of trying to get a car which I need but thinking I should use that to try to help him.  Or maybe try to start a gofundme for him, or get him on my insurance if I have to pay extra and try to cajole him to go to an oncologist/specialist.  I just don't know if it should be my responsibility.  He has plenty of family etc around him though that I am pretty sure have already badgered him about the same issues.  I probably at least need to chip in my two cents on how he's personally handling this and that he has to at least \*try\* to fight this.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the time when he calls I am ignoring it.  Honestly, it is just stressing me out, and since we've been apart for so long I don't really know what to talk to him about.  But at the same time I feel like a monster/asshole and not a good friend.  I've already hung out with him for a few hours about 3 times now, and it can vary between rough/awkward and somewhat like old times.  Mostly he wants to just drink and goof around though he's really weak.  Sometimes he can be very delirious and with his living situation it really grinds down on me.  But then I feel like I'm just being weak and not strong enough/helpful enough for him.  Honestly, and I know it makes me sound horrible, but whenever I'm hanging with him I just really don't want to be there, and I don't know if I feel enough of the same connection anymore.  I've dealt with death before in my family at a pretty young age but I still don't quite feel capable to deal with it in on a social level, and as a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it my responsibility at this point to try to save or help him?  Would it be better to devote this money to try to save him?  Should I make something to help raise money for him?  I feel like I need to discuss this with his wife at least first, as I don't know how public his condition is right now.  I just don't know what to do and part of me is like it's additional sudden stress that I really really don't need right now and another part wants to do everything for him, though in reality there's only so much and he needs to personally have the motivation to do something about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice you can offer on how I should approach it?  Am I being terrible in how I'm handling this?  Should I go out of my way to hang out with him as much as possible?  How responsible am I for helping him/possibly saving him?  Anytime I question hanging with him or just simply talking to him I just feel like I'm being a douche complaining about him ""cramping my style,"" though I know it's more complicated than that.

Mmkay so essentially I’ve known this girl for a mere two weeks and now I’ve became so attached to them it’s not even funny. Like I care about said individual despite the flaws in her personality.

So I dated this girl for the first week and had fun up until some other guy asked her out and she chose him. Okay so that ends that right? Nope because she continued to text me, mainly to ask about problems but small talk as well. This week we’ve been hanging out in my place regularly playing video games. I loved her company, it was fun teaching a newbie to gaming how to play Dark Souls. 

Now despite that, I can’t stand to be around her and that guy. I try to make my time with short, but yesterday she brought up them having sex. I asked her not to speak about that, but didn’t tell her that I had a thing for her or still did because what the fuck would that do? Only make things worse. I was hoping she’d put two and two together, but I may have be flat out honest next time if there is one.

So let’s get into the pros and cons. She’s sweet, cuddly, fun to be around, has a darj sense of humor like myself, pretty, and caring when she needs to be. Now for the cons; suffers depression due to shitty ex, poor anger management, clueless, inconsiderate, and young and immature. (She’s 18 btw) Yeah I know I’m a cunt for saying those things right?

Now let’s get to the climax of this little fairy tale. Her and I had a falling out last night. I unintentionally hurt her feelings and she then began treating me like shit. I eventually got fed up and had them leave my room earlier than usual. I tried to shut the door behind my friends only for the girl to pull me into a hug telling me “Sorry”. We walked her back to her room and she hugged me again despite saying I already got one. I guess she saw how annoyed I was or maybe realized some of the shit she said stung.

She texts me that night telling me “Sorry, but you pushed me too far.” I then tell her to be more upfront next time and I would back off only for her to say “It should’ve been obvious when I threw that book at you.” I then got fed up, told her good night, and stopped responding. I then felt bad for that and told her “I needed some time to myself” No response.

So here I am, walking to class and no response. Part of me thinks this is good, I can finally move on! Other part of me knows that the next few days are gonna suck ass because I’m gonna miss her inevitably. Despite her flaws, I still genuinely care for this girl . She probably couldn’t care less about me, likely talking shit to that FWB who asked her out.

I asked her to play ping pong and she said “I have a lot of homework, sorry.” She goes to the other room and talks to one of my friends. I couldn’t really tell if she was doing homework with him or not. Later I went to the dining hall for dinner with the friend that was talking to her. He offers her to come up with us. She declines as she says she has homework. Two days later I asked her again to play. She made the same excuse. This time, however, I see her sit down across the room, about 15 feet away and she pulled out a book. I saw her erasing something in it, but most of the time I saw her on her phone. I checked Instagram to make sure she wasn’t just googling something but she was on there.  Later, one of my other friends who like her walks up to her and her friend and starts talking with them.

I have very strict religious by the book parents and overbearing let me know your move every second of the day parents, and I was hoping to attend my senior prom.

I can assure you nothing horrible will be going down on prom night (sex, pregnancy, cocaine lines, the works) I do have a significant other, and I would be going with them probably just meeting them at the prom.  My parents are hard to convince. My father is deciding whether or not I will be allowed to go. Should I just leave it to my parents to decide if I go to prom or not or should I fight against it?

I tried everything to fix it as I initially was on my laptop. I then tried the website on my phone because I thought my laptop might be broken since it’s really old. The same warning happened on my phone. I got frustrated and just ended up clicking ‘take me to site’

I did that and it wouldn’t even let me login anyways but now I’m freaking out in case I fucked everything up since I didn’t listen to the warning.

422,"I didn't want to put exactly what happened in the title because I'm pretty upset.


My cat, my best friend for the 6 years of his life (had him since he was a kitten), was missing for 2 days. I did everything: emailed all the neighbors, created ads within five miles on Facebook, searched for him multiple times a day, etc. Today when I got home, someone had dumped his body in my driveway. I was so excited to see him I ran up... And his face was missing. A neighbor's dog had killed him and they just dumped him. I'm happy to have the closure, but there are many better ways they could have dealt with this (a call, an email from a throwaway, just about any sort of human interaction).


I'm absolutely devastated and trying to erase the image of him dead from my head. I've had terrible things happen in my life, but this image was just fucking awful. I keep trying to look at pictures of him to replace that as my last image but I'm just so sad. 


It happened not on our property so no point in involving animal control. I just want to know if anyone has suggestions. I'm beside myself. ",14Sep2018,1

He wanted me to listen to his stuff, I did, honestly it's rough around the edges because it's a completely different genre and approach to producing than he has been used to in the past. They've been at it for about three years though. Trying to make headway.

424,"Background: My girlfriend agreed to temporarily take care of her brother's dog for a while (ostensibly) because his girlfriend's mother was in town for medical treatment and they didn't have an extra room for the mother so she was sleeping in the same room as the noisy and stinky dog. Personally, I think this was just an excuse. Taking the dog in was done against my express wishes--I do not like dogs and refuse to help take care of it. I also was suspicious of her brother's motives. It's a juvenile (not quite sure the age) but not a puppy, and it is extremely powerful, energetic, untrained, and noisy when being kept in its cage or tied up outside. I have been told it's a boxer/pitbull mix. It is also not potty trained and will go to the bathroom wherever it wants to, so its cage stinks to hell and if you let it out it often immediately goes on the carpet before you can get it outside. If it is not in the cage, it is very destructive (and shits/pees anywhere), and is dangerous to my girlfriend's 4-year-old, so it is kept in the cage except when it is taken outside.  It also terrorizes our cat.

Here's the problem: My girlfriend's brother has now said that he no longer wants the dog, and has said we should either get rid of it or keep it. We are actually not allowed on the lease to have a dog (we had to negotiate to get a single cat), and we are trying to figure out what to do. There is a 0% chance that my girlfriend's brother will reimburse her for any costs associated with surrendering the dog. Given the problems with this dog, I don't see how anyone will take it on. Does anyone have any advice on the most cost-efficient way to get rid of this dog?

This is in the Washington, DC metro area.

As the title states, someone threw something at my car. I was driving home on the highway during rush hour when I suddenly heard a loud clunk on the passenger side. The person I suspect threw whatever at me sped past. Fortunately, we were both shit out of luck because, well, the traffic was shit. That didn't stop me from (foolishly) aggressively staying on his ass for a bit. I was able to get pictures taken  of his license plate. I then flipped him off when I passed him and got off onto my exit. After I got back home, I checked my car for any damages. Nothing big, just what appears to be something from a soft drink. 

What do you recommend that I do? I mean, I am not entirely in the right either. I suspect that I did cut him off beforehand. If I did so, it was unintentional. Still, he may have spilled that very same drink (if it was a drink) on himself because of me. Thoughts?

432,"15/M
The church I regularly attend organized an event for tomorrow, I'm expected to go there and already promised stuff to do so I must go. I've been a regular there for 8 years.

Up until a year ago I have been a total mental/emotional trainwreck. I neglected my appearance, health and  I had only one person I talked to school and nobody outside of it. I spent most time thinking about random ideas and it went above everything else: social life, health and fitness except school.
As high school was approaching fast I knew I had to change everything: spent time meeting people, turning my few acquaintances into real friends, getting fit (more like average with a bit of muscle), doing personal projects and hobbies  and went to a therapist a few times. The only thing left about ""old me"" is the social anxiety which was the cause of all of my problems. 

So, tomorrow I will go to the ""family day"" of said church. Most activities are for small children so the adults and teens have always just chatted. When I was there I did nothing: took a couple of photos and played on the phone and this time I don't want it to go this way.  

I know a few people there from school, though I never really talked to them. One is a girl who also attends the same highschool as I do. I've never talked to her in primary school and in every social situation my anxiety made it impossible to chat with her. She knows a lot about me and so do I about her because our parents are friends. So you can see that I have missed a lot of opportunities to get to know her.  I want to be able to talk to her and after all of the missed opportunities befriend her (I'm male so...). I'll admit I have a ~crush on her.  She seems nice and we have much in common. Her mom once said to mine that how come I don't have a girlfriend since I look good and am very smart. I don't think she meant anything about her daughter with it but it's fun to fantasize about that idea.
Her siblings will also go to the event and probably she will just hang out with them and a few of her friends. 


But I don't want to be alone for 8 hours. How can I  approach her and what can we talk about? I want to break the ice, but the ice is meters thick and it's been an ice age for years. 
 We know everything about each other but still haven't talked a bit. Battling my anxiety for 1 person is hard but with siblings and friends I don't think I can do it. Also, she probably  expects me to be alone as usual and doing otherwise she could think that I am hitting on her which would make my awkwardness much more miserable. How can I defeat my anxiety?

437,"This is going to be tough to summarize, but I needed a recommendation from a teacher at my school, who also runs the foreign exchange program. I approached her asking for a recommendation, but in the process, she asked me if I would want to be apart of the Dragon team, which was the Chinese new year dragon costume thingy they do for the Chinese new year. I said yes because I really needed the recommendation and wasn't really thinking, she put me on the spot to commit to it without giving me any times/dates and only said she'll email me. Fine. I go about my week not really caring, but then she tells me that the first meeting is next Tuesday. This conflicts with something else of mine, and if you couldn't tell I am not particularly fond of being apart of the Dragon club either because:

1) I'd be the only non-Chinese kid
2) I'd rather not. Nothing against China and their traditions. 

So my dilemma is I want to remain in good contacts with this teacher but not do the dragon club. I could say it conflicts with my schedule, but the club (afaik) doesn't meet on a regular basis.

447,"My ex was emotionally abusive.   


And maybe I'm a shitty person for thinking this way, but...  


His ex-wife accused him of being emotionally abusive, the way he describes why some people have left him suggests he's behaved this way to others too, and I remember him talking about his estranged mother where he was accusing her of similar things he ended up falsely accusing me of. This wasn't just me imagining things and it wasn't just a problem with me, but I guess I feel I want him to acknowledge this - he denied being abusive, he lost something great but doesn't acknowledge that as in his mind I was responsible for the breakup - it's common to want that validation I guess.   


The breakup with my ex has cost me our shared social group as he's closer to them, I no longer feel comfortable within the group and I can't be sure what he's said to them to protect himself if I told them what really happened - I've only vaguely mentioned his abuse to two friends within the group. Right now he's well-liked in the group, he puts on an act and plays the popularity game so well, it's frustrating for me that people can't see who/what he is.   


His new woman is friends with a mutual friend from our shared social group who's one of the ones who has a vague idea what happened with me, although I know it's a horrible way of thinking about things part of me wants it to not work out due to these issues just to show to someone else that it wasn't just a problem with me. To be clear I don't wish the new woman harm, I hope she catches this behavior quicker than I did and gets out sooner - although she may not, his abusive behavior snuck in and took time to notice, thus he may continue to get away with his abusive behavior.   


It's just frustrating he gets away with it, people who do wrong shouldn't just get away with it!   
It's also like I need validation, it's not enough that I know who/what he is but I want others to know it's not just me.   


This isn't healthy, I shouldn't be sat here worrying about him getting his comeuppance and needing some sort of closure or validation, he may never accept he was abusive (to me or anyone else), he may live happily ever after with his new woman and with our friends...I should be able to move on and no longer worry about any of this, but I'm not sure how.
