0,"Whenever I'm watching a movie or listening to a podcast, I always scroll back to whatever part I think I've missed, even though it is small and insignificant. When I play video games, I make sure to go through every nook and cranny, restarting if I felt I missed a cutscene. In school exams, I always have a problem completing my papers as I always have to look at my answer again and again before moving to the next question. The list goes on. I can't seem to convince myself that many of these things only need to be done once. I understand that these are relatively mild and not a cause of concern now. My question is, how will I know when it becomes excessive and should put a stop to it?",12Jun2018,1
1,"Hello everyone, I’m a female (21) and recently I’ve been applying to jobs everywhere because my last job wasn’t paying me well or giving me a flexible schedule with school. I worked in a professional setting so I’ve been applying to other professional type jobs relevant to the previous one. I know for a fact I left on good terms so I doubt my references are speaking ill of me, but i have an interview everything goes really well and i never hear back. I dress appropriately for the interviews, make some interviewers laugh, provide a good resume and even follow up with a thank you email the next day. Then I just never hear from them again. This has me in a depressed like state as I’ve been in this situation for almost a year. I’m still in school so I applied to a few internships as well and same thing happens. Is it me? Do I smell? Am I weird? I would really appreciate some honest advice.. I’m starting to think of applying to a minimum wage retail job because of how desperate I am for a job. I can’t keep living off my loved ones. I know they don’t mind but I feel guilty and I need to be financially independent. ",12Jun2018,1

5,"The job is for part of a crime scene clean up crew. I applied for it because it seemed like a very unique opportunity, and felt drawn to it when I saw the company was hiring.

I got a phone call from them today and we talked a little about how the company works and I was granted a second interview on Wednesday. I'll tell you what we spoke about below:

The job has two tiers of pay. When we're on the job (actively cleaning), we'll be paid $15/hr. We are expected to be on call 24/7. When called we are expected to head to home base asap to load into the company vehicle and head to the scene, which could be anywhere from miles down the road to up to four hours away. Some jobs will be quick, others may take up to a week.

While on the road, we will have our hotel rooms paid for and will each get separate rooms. Not sure about food, I'll ask during the second interview. 

There is no guarantee of work, though the man I spoke to today assured me I can expect anywhere from 30k-35k/yr. He said during time where there are no cleanups, I can choose to do job training or marketing (going to funeral homes, police stations, and so on) to essentially advertise, I suppose. Pay rate during this time is $10/hr.

My main concern how much I can rely on a stable paycheck. If there's a slow month, what if I cant make rent? I wouldnt be able to get a second job due to the on call nature of the job. I expressed these concerns and he assured me I could expect to make the aforementioned numbers yearly and can do the side training/marketing. He also said upward mobility is a strong possibility with this company, and they have many offices across the US (30), so transfers are also very possible. After three months I will begin accruing PTO, and health benefits as well as 401(k) (though this may be further than three months, I dont remember ecaxtly)

The other thing is, this job is an hour away. My lease just ended so I could reasonably move, but I looked (lightly) into housing in that area and its about twice what it is here. I'm trying to put money away currently, so this may not be the best avenue. Then again, working two jobs, I dont make anywhere near 30-35k, more like 20k.

The nature of the job doesnt concern me, I've been in the medical field and have experienced death/gruesome conditions in my personal life. I'll adapt. I'm more worred about the logistics.

Anyway, on Wednesday during our phone interview, he said I should have about 5-7 questions to ask, and they'll have plenty for me. I want to ask as many questions as I can because this could be a really cool, enjoyable job that pays well, but I would be devastated if I put myself in a bad financial situation.

The questions I've planned so far are:

- How can an employee expect to maintain a good quality of life financially (paying rent, bills, etc) if work and pay is not guaranteed?

- What is the turn over rate? In your experience, what are the most common complains you hear from employees/ex employees? On the other hand, what is common praise/pros you hear?

- I was told there are options for paid marketing and training. Is there a cap on this? Hypothetically, could I fill all my training and pursue all marketing leads, and be left with no ""secondary"" source of income during a dry spell? 

- In terms of marketing specifically, is this paid hourly? Not being a sales job, I expect there is no commission. Do these count as admin hours (what he referred to the secondary pay as, the $10/hr)

- Not to beat a dead horse, but what keeps you from providing a low base salary along side the on the job pay? Most employers (that I've seen, anyway) provide some sort of on call pay, as well as on call rotations. Has this been considered? This hearkens back to my concern about financial security. 

- Besides on the job pay and paid hotels (maybe food), is there any sort of pay for time spent abroad but not on the job? 

How do these questions sound? I dont want to be too forward but I want to feel confident in this decision if I go with it. Also, can you think of any other questions I should consider asking?",12Jun2018,1

9,"For context, I am a engineering student who is wrapping up my first year at college.

Coming in,  I didn't know what to expect, which is normal, and tried a little bit of everything socially and academically, trying to find some clarity as to where my life should be headed. 

At one point, I was very certain that I was right where  needed to be: studying engineering, looking for a job, and immersing my self in my college life.

But now i just feel overwhelmed at the realization that to get to this goal, I have to invest so much more than I can give right now, in terms of focus, time, and energy.

Now I first told myself that I was just being lazy, and that no reward comes without the hard work being put into it. But recently, I've been thinking, in order to put that work in, I have to first find a purpose that justifies why I am working toward this goal. More than just a large income and prestige. More specific than ""leaving my mark on the world"" or ""making the world a better place"".

So my questions are:
1. Am I being too idealistic in feeling this way?
2. What are some general tips to find this purpose I am looking for?

Also I realize that I gave a pretty vague description of my situation, so feel free to ask questions.",12Jun2018,1
10,"Hi Reddit, my name is Laura and I need some advice on what to do with my son. He suffers from autism and lives in my basement and I think he might be a pedophile.

My son was diagnosed with Autism when he was 6 and after that they said that he can’t live independently and he’s been living with me ever since. I work as a Real estate agent and my husband has left me once he found out that he was autistic.

He is obese and sits on his computer all day long on this website called “4change” I think. He always wants to eat chicken nuggets and Mountain Dew and I buy it for him since when I don’t he has a mental breakdown and it won’t stop until I meet his wishes.

In my basement, it smelled nice until my son moved into my basement. It reeks of feces and is a really disgusting basement. He poops and pees in plastic bottles and stores them in one big corner and I can’t clean it since there’s too much of it and I bet there’s atleast one STI in that corner.

When I went down there one time to get some things from my laundry room, I saw his computer opened up on a website that was full of underaged pornographic content. He was out with his social worker and I came to the conclusion that he was watching child porn. I forgot about it until next week when I found the same thing again with a tab oven called “/pol/“ or something on this website called 4change or something.

I did some digging in his search history and I found all of these Mega files that were full of child porn and after that I was about to contact the authorities but I waited to have a conversation first with my son but that hasn’t happened yet.

I’m worried since I think he might have some serious mental health issues and they need to be fixed or else the worse will approach. He might be a pedophile but I don’t know for sure yet. I need some help from you guys since I don’t know how to tackle this situation. Any help is appreciated.",12Jun2018,0
12,"I’ve worked at a company for a year and a half now. This doesn’t sound like much, but I’ve ended up being the longest working employee at the company currently. We’ve had our ups and downs, as we’re a newer company, but I strongly believe in the vision. 
I’ve seen management and employees come and go. I feel like I’ve learned from their failures, and we’ve recently promoted our most recent manager to a different part of the company, as of today.
I see this as a prime point to make a jump for the position of manager. I’ve long wanted it, and I believe there are things I can change that will truly change the outlook of the company. I know our processes, our staff, our vision, and more importantly, I know the leadership of the company well. 
I’m not particularly qualified to be a manager other than by my extensive and long-accumulated knowledge of the company and its dynamics. I’m a college student, so I haven’t had too much experience, but I was a lead on my high school robotics for two years that we made the world competition and started a club at the college I went to.

14,"Hi all, looking for some advice and opinions here.

I have been offered a new job opportunity with my employer to move across the country and increase my income from $33.5k to $56k, around a $22k increase per year.

The problem is, I live with my partner who doesn't want to leave his sick mom behind. She doesn't live with us, but her husband isn't a good husband and only provides financial support for the most part. She can't drive, and can't work due to her medical condition. I would have her move with us, but she doesn't want to leave behind her grandchildren and she would need to transfer her medicaid which would be a lengthy process.

With that in mind, would it be stupid of me to give up this opportunity due to my partners situation? Eventually I can make the same amount of money on the East Coast where we live now, but it'll require obtaining certifications first and finding a new employer. Or do I leave him and move alone across the country with no friends or family to start my career? Lol.

I know only I can decide, but I'd appreciate anyone sharing similar experiences as well as advice and opinions. ",12Jun2018,1
15,"So my friend has been in a relationship with his girlfriend for 2 years. And for the last 6 months or so their relationship has been pretty rocky. Arguing a lot about stupid little things and letting tiny little non-issues escalate to huge arguments. 
When I say “letting little things escalate..” I am referring to the girlfriend. My friend is a pretty rational guy. One of the most relaxed guys I know and doesn’t let stress get to him. Every time they have one of their big arguments about nothing I tell him “Dude, why do you put up with her shit? You don’t need all that drama.”

Then last week he told me why.. 

For Christmas last year his girlfriend bought him/them a 2 week all inclusive vacation to Hawaii this summer. He says if it weren’t for that he would’ve broken off with her a long time ago, but as long as they make it to this vacation he can have his free vacation that he “needs because she is such hard work” then once they come back he’s going to wait for the first little argument to explode as usual and leave her. 

Should I tell him to break it off now because it’s a terrible thing to just use the girl for a free vacation? 
Or do I just stand by and let him enjoy it? To be fair the guy works his ass off more than anyone I know. He works long, shitty hours for a pretty poor pay check. He could never afford a vacation like that himself. I feel like he does deserve the vacation but just shouldn’t be taking one for free from a girl he doesn’t even like any more.

22,"So I feel like I missed something between my friend and I. Either that or I just completely understood what our friendship was. But what has prompted this, is that since graduation we've only seen each other once, and our communication has been sporadic. For the past year we've texted each other day and night about things, joking talking and laughing even during breaks and the summer. But then all of a sudden she pulls away.
Now it was a really odd friendship from the start. We met in class but she came over and stuffed her number in my hand. Women almost never do this with me, and I just thought it was odd. I sorta wrote it off as nothing and only texted her once and she didn't seem to respond, I just asked if she wanted to meet up and study. But then she started asking me to lunch. That just sorta went on for a while because I was really busy. We started getting closer, she asked me over for coffee once, and we started going out to drinks after class together. Then we took a bit of a break.
Finally when summer came last year I planned an outing for our group of friends and it ended up being sorta romantic. And she made me go out to dinner with her alone. She gave me a really tight like 10 second hug and then ran off.
Then we didn't see each other for two months and when she got back I picked her up at the airport and she treated me to dinner.
But during all of this it just seemed like a tit for tat relationship I'd do something, she'd do something for me. Although, honestly I never did any of these things with the expectation of her doing something in return, I think that's a very cold way of looking at friendship. Sometimes she'd surprise me and by rather loving but the most of the time it seemed like a tit for tat relationship.
If we hadn't been in school together I would've asked her out beyond what became our regular friend dates, which go really weird when we were drunk. But it would've made grad school really complicated if I torched our overall friendship.
What finally got me is that over the past 6 months has included me in her personal life above a lot of other people, and it got really weird.
Over the past two weeks we really drifted apart, and I fell I'm sort of mourning the relationship or what could've been. On one hand I really liked her as a person and there's been very few people I've gotten along with so well, have had so much in common with, and just felt complete peace with. On the other hand I feel that despite the fact I liked her maturity in most things, trying to talk with her was never a strong point.
TL;DR: I'm sorta mourning what might've been either a good friendship or relationships (yes I think that was a possibility but I missed all the signals). Did I miss all the signals? Was she just using me? I felt that we were close but now I'm questioning how close we actually were. I know I'll get over it, but it will probably be a good while til I do.",12Jun2018,4

35,"Sorry for the format and the long-ness. I’m on mobile, and it’s been a while since I’ve been on Reddit. So me and my friend who lives in Virginia (I live in California) were playing Rainbow: Six Siege on Ps4.

It was a 1 v 3, my friend was the 1 guy and the other 3 were on the other team. My friend clutched it as Montaigne, a character in the game. We were happy and all that crap but whatever. Next game. My friend (Gonna call him John even though it’s not his name for privacy purposes) John gets a notification in Ps4 messages with him and two other players from the other team when he clutched it in the group chat. The two players were on the other team when we clutched it. They started shit talking him, saying it was luck and crap like that. Btw I was not in the chat at the beginning and John was just telling me everything they were saying. Then I tell John to invite me to the group chat so I can back him up. I see the messages. Then the two players tell me and John to join their party chat so we could talk.

We join their party, end up going at it for around 5 min while me and John are in another game but end up leaving it because of what happens next. Me and John and the other two trash talk for a while. (Me and John never got too aggressive, we just defended ourselves) They both sound around 14 or so. Mature, but probably not competent enough to be “master” or “experienced” hackers. Both were trash talking, but one was the “hacker” so to speak.
The other dude was just trash talking. The “hacker told us he could hack our WiFi connections and cut it out. We said go ahead, and he actually did it. To me at least, not to John. I don’t know too much about tech but I do know that to do that they have to be around my location or state to compromise with my IP address that well. Because John, all the way in Virginia, was completely fine. My connection went out, I joined the party again, then the same hacker guy said he can swat us, and told us our city and state locations which we never told them to him. He even told John his address (which actually was right) but was i think wrong about my address. Then I left the party for the while while John was telling them how that’s illegal to mess with our IP address, threaten to swat us, and even looking at our addresses. 

Both of them got pretty damn scared, it was funny as shit. But it was true. It was illegal (to my knowledge). Then later the hacker guy gets perm banned by John on PlayStation. Me and John go and join the same party, and the hacker guy ain’t there. Just the other guy and his other friends. They seem scared and willing to give info. I ask if he lives around California, they say they think so, proving me right about the IP thing. Then I say thanks and go away with John.

That’s all we know bout him. John even got audio proof and evidence of him talking about it I think. I have screen shotted everything I could use as evidence. Even his gamertag (idk why lol).

She often talks about her love life, and talks about sex (not in detail or anything, just in passing) and it makes me uncomfortable. I've usually just gone with it and continued the conversation, but I was wondering if it would be okay for me to just say ""hey, I'm not comfortable talking about that with you.""

This is long but if you can make it without a headache, thank you in advance!

I'm an only child my aunt has two children.

The oldest kid from my aunts side is expecting a child.

Both families has equal ownership of the house but we need 2 more years to pay it off.

Since living together there's constant disagreements

EX: my mom is always doing the house work and cooking for her when she's home for dinner, which leads the the constant arguing about my aunt not contributing to any of the house work. (They're both full time employees). 

Even if we tried to settle some sort of rule of who does what my aunt always says she's ""tired"" (if you could give advice on how to solve this that'll be great)

Bc of the growing family on their side, we want to move out but my aunt doesn't want the house. 

We've spoken about this before and her reasoning is that she doesn't want the house but she's not willing to move out nor willing to let us pay the remaining half of the house of the last two year and move out ourselves; (the fuck is this logic???)

Also, she said it was bc of financial issues but before she did state she had 20,000\+ saved up???? TBH I think bc my mom is so used to ""babying"" her (cooking, cleaning etc. ) she doesn't want that to disappear and have to do it herself (who would want to give that up, food and a clean house when you get home from work). Plus the fact that she'll have someone to help take care of her future grandchild.

39,"So a few years ago I came damn close to getting my bachelors degree at a pretty reputable school in the northeast. Unfortunately a run in with a minor cancer and the effects it had on my career plans (the Marine Corps) left me in a deep deep depression and I had to withdraw from school with about a year’s worth of credits left.
I just applied to a local university and hope to begin finishing my degree full time in the fall. In the 3 years since I left school I have worked my way up to a management position for a very successful landscaping company in Massachusetts.But as much as I love landscaping, I wish to find a job in more of an corporate setting.
So, therefore my question to Reddit is: What is the likelihood that a business would be willing to hire me on a part time basis, knowing that I’d be finishing my degree shortly thereafter And/or would a headhunter be able to help me? Thanks!!",12Jun2018,1
40,"I’m not sure why, but I’ve always had this urge to pull out my eyelashes or eyebrows. It never really bothered me until recently, as it’s become something I do far more often than ever before in my life. It’s even gotten to the point where I’ll scratch at my scalp and create scabs that I can scratch and pick off. I know this is gross and I don’t know how to stop. I also bite my nails, and the skin around them. I’ve been extremely depressed and anxious, and this habit is really bothering me. I’m worried I’ll do so much that it becomes a visible issue. If anyone has  any advice I’d really appreciate it.",12Jun2018,1
41,"Hey guys, I'm having a little conundrum at the moment and really need some help. This is my throwaway account. Me (24M) and my fiance (23F) have been staying with her family in a trailer park for about a year now, and we've been trying to move out the entire time we are here. Looking together with us is an older woman, let's call her Charlie, who was staying in the same trailer, who became a really close friend of ours because of our shared struggle with the poor living condition at the trailer park. 

Here's where the tricky part comes in. Me and my fiance have good rental history, good credit, good references etc. and I have a stable job while taking classes at my uni. As for Charlie, she is one of the nicest people I have met, but she isn't quite having the time of her life right now: she doesn't have the best credit history, has disabilities and cannot work, has been trying to apply for rental assistance and disability benefits for months to no avail, is dating someone from several states away online, and has no money.

Throughout the year we have agreed that I would pay for the initial move-in costs and perhaps the first few months' rent, after which she will have her online dating partner move to our state, live with us, get a job and pay me back. At first I was 100% on board with this plan, but over the last few months her continuous failed attempts to get money from the government started to concern me that she will not be able to pay her part of the rent once we get a new place...she currently owns our landlord about $3000 because she hasn't had anything to pay rent with. Our landlord, after a year of not getting paid rent from her, has finally had enough and is kicking her out by the end of this week. She does have a place to crash for a few days at but nothing to rely on long term. 

Now to list my worries. To start with, I am concerned that her partner, whom none of us have met (including herself), will turn out to be a bad roommate -- he said he would start looking for work immediately once he gets to our state, but I’ve had roommates not fulfilling their promise one too many times before, on top of her partner being a complete stranger, I am very skeptical. Second, the apartments we can get with our budget are very small, has a single bathroom and will be very crammed with two couples. I will be going back to school soon and will need space to work on projects and study, which had been difficult with past roommates. 

I am very much against leaving her out completely since I do think of her as a close friend and don’t want her to end up homeless, but I am also worried that roommate conflicts will cause a lot of unnecessary stress mentally and financially, especially when I’m back in school to finish off my degree. 

Please reply with any thoughts and suggestions you have. Thank you for reading my post!

43,"Been smoking for around 5 years near enough every day, usually before bed to help me sleep but do smoke during the day when I'm not working. I have a full time job and the same stresses and most people have day to day. Was diagnosed with GAD before dependency took hold. 

I want to become less dependant and be able to have days where I don't smoke, and hopefully with this I'll have a clearer mind and better memory, and in turn I can address other problems.  

I would like to refrain from professional help unless really necessary as I'm very secretive about it, I keep it completely separate from work and colleagues.

44,"I just recently graduated from high school and I started working full time (50 hr weeks). Since I graduated I’ve been feeling like I’m lost and really stressed. I have a lot of things I want to do but I don’t have the time and energy to do them. I need to figure out how to schedule classes for college, I need to get a new car, and I need to study for huge certification test that I paid a lot of money for. It doesn’t seem like a lot to me but then I put on how I want to hang out with my friend and enjoy my summer it just adds more weight to the load. I know that I should put the important tasks before hanging out with my friend all the time but I haven’t had a good friend like him in a long time. I never had any friends that I hung out with out side of school until this year. I was really introverted for most of my school life but after trying to change that my senior year I kinda got something like and addiction to hanging out with friends. I say friends because some times we have other people we know that join us once in a while. I can’t stand being alone anymore I need to have someone to talk to or else I start to fall apart. And it doesn’t help that I still haven’t broke out of my shell completely yet. 

I keep thinking to negatively and I don’t like it but it’s a struggle to stop thinking like that. I’m worried that it’s going to cause me to lose sight of my goals. This is the only time I’ve really felt helpless(Thats an exaggeration I couldn’t think of a better word) ever. I’ve always been able to rely on my self to help me through things like this but it’s not working very well anymore.

I do not find women attractive in anyway.

47,"So as the title says I work at a bank, well a credit union, but I digress. My issue is everyone in the branch is required to make a sales payout each quarter, and it differs depending on what your title is. I’m only working part time -required to have 24 points- so I don’t need to have as many points as the full time tellers -they need 36 points.- My question is: How can I open up conversation in a way that’s not so robotic when it comes to offering products/services? Do people really even want to sit and listen to a sales pitch while/after doing their transaction?    
(Back story: last qaurtet, i was suppose to go to sales training class but it was canceled because the conductor had a family emergency, so they sent us all home. I have not completed the course. My managers know this but yet i havent been sent back, and am still required to make payout because i have been with the company for more than a 150 days and had access to materials in the branch. If i do not make payout this qaurtet i will receive a written warning ontop of an oral written warning i already received. If i continue to not make sales, i could lose my job. Despite being a hard worker.)   
I’m frustrated because i work at a slower paced branch, and since I’m part time, I primarily work drive through. People that use drive through typically dont want/have the time to listen to a pitch. I have asked to be placed up front, and that’s only happened twice.  
Also, I find it’s the same people coming in, so I offer them a product, and they say yes and then it never goes through. So if I’m seeing the same people all the time, and they didn’t follow through the first time they sure as heck aren’t going to follow through the second or third time around. ",12Jun2018,1

49,"So I recently met a girl at a bar. Not my usual place to meet people. We danced for a bit and we were holding hands throughout the night. We ended up making out and fooling around slightly. I won't go into details but we did not have sex. She stayed over the night and left the next afternoon. 

Problem was I had forgotten to ask for her number. I live a few states away so it's not like I'll be running into her again anytime soon. I only knew her first name. I'm not a casual hookup person either. So while on instagram she came up as someone I might know after following the page of the bar we met at. I want to message her but I'm not really sure how.

50,"Is this illegal?? Hi, I’m 14 and my brother’s name is Kevin. So I have a friend that is 22 years old. Yesterday my parents were driving Kevin and I to this place and my friend decided to hop in the car and carpool without even asking them.. He sat between me and Kevin and it was already awkward. I only see my ‘friend’ once a month, keep that in mind. So after a few minutes he gave a little hug and said that he misses me. Then after a while he hugged me again, but I gave a little tap on his hand to move away and he did. Later, we were just talking about movies and summer plan and all of the sudden, he put his arm around my shoulder and said “Maybe this summer we can go on a date together or something”. I was like, “haha, with Kevin right!?”. But obviously, that was a no. I was like I’m still a baby and I need Kevin around me at all times, he’s like a babysitter. But my friend couldn’t understand that I’m barely starting high school and he’s finishing college this year, there’s no way we could go out. And so, he had his arm around my should the whole 20 minutes car ride. Keep in mind my parents are in the front seats, driving. (Luckily they couldn’t see and couldn’t understand him with his strong accent). I was gripping really hard on the car door cause that’s how uncomfortable I was. I texted Kevin on my watch “help”, but Kevin didn’t even try. Finally when we reached our destination, I was like “Ooh were here, oh let’s not forget my phone”. And hopped out of the car. My friend finally let go of me and asked “Can you give me your phone number?”. I said “ummm I forgot it, ask Kevin for his number instead”. But obviously my friend knew that I knew my number, but I started walking away from him. When the event started at the place, he asked for it again. I said “um maybe later?”. Then the event finished and he asked again, I said “next week? Got to go” and ran into the car. - 
So you guys can see that I’m very bad at rejecting people in a nice way

He also mentioned that he’s going to be very lonely this summer because his brother and sister are moving

When I first met him, we ask each other questions. One of the questions were “do you have a gf/bf”. He said “no, but I’m planning to ask someone soon.”
I had a feeling he wanted to ask me

53,"Hello everyone. This is something that i really need to get off my chest and start dealing with it because I’ve been living in absolute torment and trauma, and I do need the most effective advice you can give me if you can.

I am a 19 F that moved and now living in uni. I can never get past the horrid memory of my father and what he has done. My grades are failing because I’m very stressed out about it and it haunts me every single second.

My mother passed away the day I was born. I never had the chance to see her, so I was under the care of my father. I believe he was very upset about it since he is one of the heaviest alcoholics I have ever witnessed, downing 4 beer bottles and two thirds of a Bacardi bottle everyday. This resulted in him losing his marketing management job. 

It was my seventh birthday and he didn’t even notice. That day he was finished from a phone call that made him mad and scream through the phone, a state of anger I have never seen him be in. I wanted to approach him and calm him down but he scared me a bit, so I waited until he cooled down. After he was calm, he headed straight to the kitchen with haste, I sneakily followed him and heard him pop a few bottles.

I kinda forgot about him until I met him dozing off on the couch dripping fuzzy alcohol off his beard. I thought it was the perfect chance to show him some affection and warm his heart a bit, drunk or sober. As I cuddled him, he said some stuff that was very slurred that I couldn’t really catch. At some point I was sitting on his lap and I felt this very hard structure that I thought I was sitting on a stalagmite or something. He then started kissing me and rubbing my body. I thought it was normal and it was him just loving me. 

He then picked me up and headed straight to his room. He started undressing me fast like he was changing a dirty diaper. My heart was racing and I had no idea what was happening. He left me completely naked and then he started to undress himself and I saw his huge penis suddenly emerge swaying left and right. He then started penetrating me for a while until he ejaculated on my body. I was crying heavily out of fear and confusion, not knowing what the hell is happening. He was covering my mouth during the process which made me scream harder. After he was done, he threw some clothes on me and I heard him say to put some fucking clothes, barely holding on to his slurred speech. I just slept on the bed with a pillow full of absorbed tears like a sponge.

After that incident he was taking advantage of me every second, abusing me hard everyday and having to cry myself to sleep. I endured so many slaps, hits, and kicks that my body was bruised in an unbelievable way.

Now that I’ve escaped from this psychopath, I’m seeking help in any way I can to heal myself. I’ve been traumatized in a way I think nobody in this world have experienced. I have serious suicidal tendencies and cut myself a lot to make me numb. Anything that you tell me will be considered and ask me about anything if you need any more information. Thank you for your time.

60,"This might be a bit long

I am a 22 year old guy. Barely graduated high school due to lack of motivation, I found everything too easy so I never showed up (I signed up for advanced chemistry in 12th grade, skipped the first 3 weeks and the final exam and failed the class by 1%).

I spent 2 years after high school unemployed and single, before I finally got a job last summer. I worked my ass off at that job, I was determined to get my life on track. I started saving money, got a girlfriend, was almost ready to get moved out of my parents house...

And last Thursday, I was fired for no reason, with no notice or warning, total surprise. Things had been going so well at work for the last year that I honestly thought my boss might be calling me into her office to give me a raise, so getting fired was a huge shock. And then Sunday my girlfriend broke up with me. So now I'm back to being unemployed and single and feeling like a total failure.

I have grown up since school, now if I start something I am determined to finish it and not feel like a failure again. I didn't take a single sick day in the year I had my job.

But I don't know what to do now. Taking a minimum wage, part time job doesn't even pay enough for me to live here (my parents have been making me pay rent since my 18th birthday, and I live in a town of less than 900 people with no public transportation so I absolutely *need* a car to be able to work). I also only have around $1500 saved after needing to pay for dental work.

But I also know that being fired from my only job after a year, and having no other experience or education, doesn't qualify me to do much more than work at McDonalds.

We met in a chatroom... yes the ones you are thinking about... He seems smart and hardworking. We are in similar fields and had similar sexual preferences so we got alone pretty well. We never plan on meeting or dating. 

I was a little obsessed with him for a little while but got out of it now. 

The problems are:

1. We tried some role playing and he preferred me to be very young (14\-16). I'm not saying I don't enjoy it ( I like older guys) but it still creeps me out a bit... 
2. Sometimes I feel like he's being sincere and sometimes I felt I was feeling this way just because he wanted me to... I feel like I was being played.
3. When I told him I had a crush on him, he said he doesn't mind keep talking but I shouldn't expect us ever meeting. Although I'm not as obsessed, I still have feeling for him and still fantasize us meeting one day. We barely talk about anything other than sex but he did say he likes me more than once.

I'm not going to try to justify why I like him. I can't even accept it myself but it just happened. I'm not sure if I should still talking to him, given that this ""relationship"" has been very time consuming and I spend a lot of time thinking about him everyday but we will never meet.

70,"Sooo my Honey befriended a someone, let's call him Carl and they've been friends since winter.

Carl is an interesting fellow. He's a single father who's been through much and has PTSD, which makes me feel like a terrible person for all this...

We have turned down many dinner invitations with various excuses but we are running out and there's been times where he has pretty much begged us to come over.

So what's it like hanging out with the guy? Basically we are like an audience. And anytime we try to give some input or be apart of the conversation... he'll say something like ""I know"" and then steam roll you with more conversation. If one of us is talking he finds a way to make it about him or his experience. He always has a better way of doing things or better story. About 60 percent of the Convo is about what he's been through (in a vague way) or about ex girlfriend issues. He's also always trying to give us things or be overly helpful in a way that you can't always say no... like pushy niceness. It makes me uncomfortable when people do this... as if they're doing these nice things with the motive of asking for something in return ( don't get me wrong, I love doing things for people but this feels like a huge imbalance... especially since when I try to return the favour he won't accept it)

All this was okay, and I could deal with it but the other week, Carl asked my Honey if he would do some paid work for him.  We had just learned that our good friend passed away the day before. Honey decided to help him out anyways. They planned tentatively to do some more work the next day but my Honey wasn't feeling it (needed to process feelings about friends death) so he called it off.

Carl flipped out... calling him a flake and sayings how everyone does this to him.  He eventually apologized and has invited us to dinner, but I don't wanna go... ever? It makes me sad that we've been his ear for the past six months and when my Honey just needed him to be a pal, he saw it as something being done to him.

Jacob is recently 14 years of age. That fact won't be changed as I go into further detail of our situation.

*Note: Some names in this will be changed* to protect my identity and the identities of my parents and even the child I'm talking about.

Before I begin to explain what I have been dealing with, I believe it's worthy of mentioning that this child is a danger to me and my family. I sometimes question his sanity and his intentions.

I also believe it's noteworthy to say that this is a situation that authorities and CPS are actively still investigating and I don't wish for him to be placed in alternative care, such as a foster home, juvenile detention center, etc.

Now, first, I'll explain why he lives with my parents.

[I believe] 10 years ago, my sister met a man named Jeff. Jeff was a good guy, churchgoing, short, strong willed, handsome, kind. The kind of man you'd be willing to take home to your family and friends, and you would want to spend time with him constantly. This, of course, was a very witty façade, which he has probably used to persuade many women before meeting my step-sister.

Shortly after meeting, they fell in love and subsequently became wed, and happily moved into a home in a trailer park (actually, it's a mobile home community next to ours, maybe a mile down the road).

After the marriage, they went to their honeymoon on a cruise ship. The cruise held no issue but she noted he was suspiciously walking around the ship at times, usually at night, seemingly looking for something. He looked to be searching for something. Not sure about this behavior. I may never know.

My step-sister has Jacob, Eve, Kay, Bryan, and Anthony now, from oldest to youngest. At the time of this marriage she had no children. She had no plans to run off and have children, but she wasn't at all surprised when she found out she was pregnant with her first child. She was only 22 at the time, and she was naive, and in love. It was described by my family as a genuine desire for one another (so-called ""puppy love"") and a sincere love as far as any of us knew.

Upon having her first child, Jacob, she saw changes in the man she had married. Jeff was taking being a father quite difficult and even became angry when he couldn't quite be the father he wanted to be and that my step-sister wanted to see in him. He was almost always agitated and, almost as often, angry with my sister for having such an ""accident"".

So, they tried to work through their various marital problems with counseling, against his behest and his attitude toward ""outside help"", but a few years went by and they became closer. They even learned how to cohabitate, which is something I know a lot of married couples don't quite grasp, even after years of marriage. They had accomplished this by the time Jacob was a young boy.

At the time of Jacob's first molestation, he was about 5. He was being watched by his father, Jeff, while my step-sister was away at work. The second time, a few years later as recalled by Jacob in court, was during the time he was in counseling for the first molestation. These assaults were increasing until about Jacob's 10 birthday, during which the parents were not together and at some point even had a restraining order (specifically a Personal Protection Order) placed against the abusive father.

The PPO was eventually dissolved, as part of the investigation and the lack of evidence, and communication with Jacob revealed that he wasn't sure of what exactly happened between he and his father during the assaults. There were several, occuring over a large timeline, of which I can't be sure now.

We knew something was up when a friend of my step-sister came forward with a video of his behavior around other children at a pool in the mobile home. His trailer (that he and my step-sister shared for years) was coincidentally only a few doors down from the pool, and you could see, in detail, everything that happened at said pool.

From the house, while Jeff had taken Jacob to this pool, before the first molestation of Jacob: he was observed by this family friend at the time, as walking up to young boys and touching their suits and bodies in a suggestive manner. 

On another occasion, the father was seen pushing children into the pool and ""accidentally "" holding their suits, so that they would come undone/off. He swore up and down to the friend, upon questioning, that it was a bad accident that happened more than once and he apologized for this. But that was noted in court as well, as a part of the investigation into his behavior, including the actions with his own son present during.

So, some time after these things, the friend took the information to her friend, my step-sister. They took the information to Jeff and said they were concerned with his actions and that they were affecting people around him, namely his family, especially his own son.

He denied everything for years. He still denies it. He often used his plea of mental illness as a defense. This was a clever trick but it was still enough to gather pity and it got him out of a sentence. He is free today. He cannot see Jacob or any of my step-sister's children, and if he does without permission he will go to prison. He has been seen but not convicted of stalking occasionally, but nothing we can prove, because there is no evidence of that.

On to the current situation: Jacob has been counseled for several years and has not fully admitted to himself what he did, because he doesn't believe he is responsible, or because he believes he can't control his actions sometimes. He abused my two other nieces, years within his age, and I think he abused my nephew Bryan as well, age 6.

A couple of years ago he moved in with my parents, age 52 and 43, if that's relevant. They are very lenient guardians and they try to accommodate but also rehabilitate my nephew, their grandson, and some days Jacob has good days and some are bad, which is not altogether his fault, as an abused child will never be fully recovered from the actions of their abusers.

As part of his counseling, he is required by the system to report to an office building out of town and is observed by several psychologists and counselors, CPS, and Sheriff. His behavior has been studied by a few experts and they all conclude that, absent evidence and testimony on behalf of my nieces and nephews, he can't be held accountable for these things. But he is still being monitored as he lives with my parents and they are the legal guardians.

He is in school and he takes part in counseling sessions on a horse farm in town, a few minutes away, where he is being trained to interact with the horses and rode them and take care of their health. This happens every week, at the end of the week, on Fridays. His behavior, for a time, briefly changes during these visits. He becomes calm, more friendly and less irritable when he is there. Then he returns home and resumes his poor attitude (and his hygiene suffers a lot as well, due to his increasing apathy).

Now, since moving in and taking part in counseling, Jacob is not only angry 24/7, except for horse ""therapy"" and his mother visiting once a week, but he is also very inconsiderate of my parents and abusive to my parents' cats and their two dogs, both about 13-14 years.

He routinely gets out of school and plays Xbox (his Ark game is the sole purpose of using it). He has a few friends, most of which he verbally insults and degrades over chat, constantly, while he plays. He rarely is seen outside of his room, the room that I would use when I was younger and now when I visit.

I don't know how seldom he showers or even applies deodorant. He doesn't share the clean and well-groomed behavior of a sociopath, but he does share the abusive nature and perceived malicious intent.

I don't know how to handle this, as I am not a part of the system, I am not sure of his intent to harm, but I know I see this desire to see what happens as he frequently chokes or otherwise upsets the cats of the house, just because he is stronger and has even told me that ""they can't fight back and I'm just doing it to hear the noises"".

I wish that I could do something to help out my parents but I don't want my nephew to be taken away. Though it frightens me lately, his behavior. I wish him a happier life but I don't believe it can be gained here. No offense to my parents, but he is almost permitted to ignore his chores, without so much of a consequence as grounding for a day from his Xbox (he still has an unlimited plan and a phone, which his mother granted him a year and a half ago).

His intense internet usage is foregone by my parents; he never brushes his teeth and they frequently try to get him to do his chores but he refuses. This is in large part due to it being the summer, and the trailer having power issues - basically he can't play his Xbox and we can't use the air conditioning at the same time, due to a problem in wiring.

They have used a cord (extension cord from the outside) as a source of power to one whole side of the house. During which time, with the AC on, he cannot play Xbox and he gets very angry and refuses to do his chores or even speak to my parents, so I've observed.

He gets extremely agitated, I believe due to his abuse and neglect by his father, and hits walls and pillows and says, ""this is stupid and it's your fault"" to my mother. My father is less inclined to punish but rather, he will try to use constructive feedback based on good behavior, and it never works. The kid just doesn't listen and he doesn't care about them. He complains via phone to my step-sister that he is being neglected.",12Jun2018,1
72,"Last night a couple of friends and I were in a silly mood at a sleepover, and we decided to prank call a mutual friend who I hang out with quite a lot &amp; consider to be a good friend. He didn't pick up both times we called, so we didn't even get to say anything.

 However, he messaged me after and absolutely freaked out about it. Swearing, insults, giving ultimatums, saying ""grow the f\*\*\* up"", demanding I apologise to his specific standards. Apparently he ""really doesn't like getting calls from unknown numbers"" and ""it pisses me off when people do immature things"". After an angry text argument I ended up saying ""that's it, I'm not going to deal with this anymore"" and there's been no contact since then. He's never like this so it took me by surprise.

I am wondering a) Was his reaction justified, and b) What should I do now? Should I continue to give him space and wait for him to realise he was being unreasonable, or should I apologise again? ",12Jun2018,1
73,"Hey there, for almost a year and a half I've been wanting to become an artist. I love looking at drawings and paintings and I'm always thinking of ideas for drawings and stories. The only problem is, I just can't seem to translate that to a piece of paper. Ever since I was a little kid, I've had a problem where if I'm not immediately good at something, I get so frustrated and want to give up. For example, I've tried to take online drawing classes several times, and when I can't copy the first lesson exactly like in the book/lecture, I get so mad and end up avoiding taking another lesson for a while. I also have issues with motivating myself to practice. I've tried to take art classes with a teacher at an art studio, but I ended up not going due to the fact that there were going to be other people in the class. I really want to learn how to draw and be a good artist, how do I get the motivation to keep trying and to keep practicing, and how do I convince myself that my drawings don't have to be perfect immediately?",12Jun2018,1
74,"Im going to make this as vague as possible to protect personal information. Recently was told by someone about assault that happened which includes the title. The female informed about this after I did some things that hurt her in our relationship. I did not believe her and actually was enraged that she was making things up. Said female provided evidence including multiple police reports filed in multiple police departments including several witnesses that attested to her statements. The assault involved a very famous athlete's son who is also an athlete. All police reports, restraining orders, and protection orders were dropped within a week of being filed. They were not dropped by said female but instead the athletes father. I WAS IN COMPLETE DISBELIEF. How could something like this happen? Said female is an orphan with not many people to turn too. She has some physical scars present from the abuse as well as emotional scars that began to make sense to me after she informed me of the details. I AM LITERALLY IN DISBELIEF. On top of this there is another female that was assaulted in a similar fashion by the same athlete. Her police reports were dropped the exact same way. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?!?! Said university does not have the best reputation involving these types of things including a case known across the nation where a doctor was abusing his realm of practice on gymnastics athletes. The said athlete got away clean. All assaults happened within the past four years. What options are there to bring said athlete to justice for the pain he has caused these women? What options are there to bring the police department to justice for allowing someone to drop charges that they had no authorization to drop? One of the police reports literally says the person filing the report is requesting that this case not be dropped by anyone including herself, AND STILL WAS DROPPED. WTF?!? Any input or advice is greatly appreciated as I am currently in shock that this stuff actually happens in real life, feels like a movie or something....

80,"I’m trying to pick it apart on my own but it isn’t really bearing any fruit. So Id appreciate your advice!

Curious situation. My ex and I broke up 3 months ago. Good end, no hate between us, but haven’t spoken in a while. We’d hug and be pleasant if we saw each other again. She moved from our city and took her dream job in our state’s major metro city. I’m still in our old city (2nd largest city), and would like a fresh start. I see how it would be a very good thing for me. So I’m considering moving to the same city she’s in, because I am able to see how I can start to chip away at some actual opportunities there. I feel a little bit too much of a mental hurdle here and having the motivation to get something going. Plus I’m in a bad-for-me roommate situation and can live alone and cheaper in the new city while I go to school. I’m in an “everything old must go” mindset. I need to 180 my lifestyle. New friends, new experiences. All of it. 

The kicker is is I’m not TOTALLY convinced that my reasons for wanting to move there don’t at least involve my ex. I’m stable enough to separate all of that from the positives I think I would net from a fresh start. But still. The idea that “we can be together again” is at least there, potentially influencing my actions. I absolutely would not show up on her doorstep one day asking for her back, unless I had a damn good enough reason to. 

My question is is do I give her a heads up, and talk about my intentions to move there? I really don’t want to be misinterpreted about my reasons, to come off as chasing her. But I feel like she wants her fresh start too, and enjoy her life in a brand new city without ex’s running around, and I want to respect that. 

Disclaimer: I feel like the overriding sentiment will be “Who cares what your ex thinks” so trust me, I am giving that notion the credence it deserves. 

Tl;dr I want to respect my ex’s new life in her new city, but I want to move there too. Do I give her a heads up before I move in ~2 months?

81,"I have a close friend that I met online many years ago, who lives literally across the USA from me. He just bought a new house and invited my boyfriend and I to go stay with him for a week. We have been planning this trip since February. We've been planning things to do, nature hikes, drinking, etc. and it was supposed to be a couples thing - he and his wife, my BF and I. Last Monday, he texts me out of the blue to tell me that his wife's 11 year old nephew from California will be staying with him while we are there. He seemed surprised, almost hurt even, when I acted like it wasn't really okay, so I told him ""it's fine lol"" and we haven't discussed it since.

I'm kind of upset about this because I'm afraid it won't be the relaxing getaway my BF and I thought it would be if a child will be tagging along with us everywhere we go. I know there's no real way to change it, since the kid's grandparents paid for the trip and it's over a thousand miles away, but I at least want to let my friend know that it was kind of shitty to spring this on us so close to the trip, especially since we'd been planning it for almost 6 months.

I graduate high school in 2 days, and have been accepted to a university and the original plan was to go stay on campus starting this fall.  I don't even know what i'd do for a degree.  I was looking at the website for the college and literally nothing they offer is what I want to do.  It's kind of unusual in my family not to attend college, and my mom wants me to go.  Is it a waste of time?  I truly want to either get a band going (I know it's hard but i'd rather do that) or work in the Cannabis industry (Which would require moving, I live in Virginia)  I have a few friends that would want to do the band thing, and I also have a few friends that would probably pack up with me and move to a legal state to work in the cannabis industry, but my family and my friends (i'm staying on campus with my best friend) will all look down on me.  I know going to college would help, but I don't want to and it has nothing to offer me.  I also suffer from mental health issues so college would just increase my symptoms from what i've seen happen with other family members....

   I have a friend who recently quit her job because her boss became too obsessive.  He would show up at her apartment complex with fruit baskets for her.

My aunt and uncle adopted a new cat yesterday (1 years old and he is the only cat in the house). He somehow got out of his confined spot and we think he went into the attic. My uncle said he saw him up there this morning and there are little paw prints in the settled dust up there. They both looked and are not able to see him. He is a black cat, so I'm thinking he may be up there in the shadowy areas? I stuck my head up there and looked around with my phone flashlight, but did not see any reflection from his eyes or anything... I'm not sure...we are just very worried and sad and want to find him soon. He is most likely scared because he is new to the family. Has this happened to anyone and if so what did you do? Does anyone have some good advice?

102,"Hey Reddit,

so my boyfriend (21) and i broke up 4 months ago. he ended it with me because he was going through a lot with his family and other things. 2 months later he reached out to me and we started hanging out again, then agreed to work on us. He told me that no one was like me and he was so beyond in love with me. then... more family issues arose and he became to act distant. then he told me he wanted me and a future for us but didn’t want to be reporting where he was... his attitude started changing and he acted like a jerk and started going out so much more than usual. but we agreed that we both wanted to end up together. then, he refollowed two girls he had slept with during our breakup on instagram. After seeing that, I felt so disrespected and hurt and ended things with him. at first he acted like he didn’t care, then he began blowing up my phone and begging to talk and to fix things. he said he only wanted me and wanted to talk but i kept saying no and ignoring him. the next day, he told me he missed me and how he would like to move past this but he knows it’s a process. i’m leaving on a work trip tomorrow morning and he was supposed to drop me off... he’s been begging me to keep letting him drop me off. then today, he started refollowing every girl from his past.

I work full time and go to school online and have struggled with school so badly that I have failed out twice-the most recent was this school year and I am now in jeopardy of being suspended for a year if I don’t get my gpa back up this term. 

The cycle goes that I get a good routine going with work, school, exercise, social life, etc., and then suddenly I lose the balance and end up missing school due dates and not exercising, drinking too much, and seeing validation from men I just met. This lasts for about two weeks and by the time I recognize the behaviors and fix them, I’m too far behind in my classes (8 week terms) and I feel terrible both mentally and physically.

We talk nearly everyday and have a lot in common including the fact that we both work in the same field. He has a girlfriend who I initially didn’t know about even... about a year ago his girlfriend hacked into his phone and read all of his phone conversations and did so for months without him knowing ( she got his Verizon account and read his texts through there ) she finally fessed up to what she was doing. That was months ago and he believes that she’s hacked into his phone again despite the fact that he’s changed his passwords .She doesn’t like me, she thinks that him and I are planning on getting together and she’s accused him of this on multiple occasions when in fact we rarely hang out because of her. She has brought up my name frequently and according to him I’m the center of a lot of fights between them. Besides her I’m the only person he talks to regularly and she’s jealous that we have such a good friendship( what she’s said)and they don’t despite the fact that they’ve been together for 5 years. I don’t want to make her angry or get between things so I don’t ask him to hang out anymore or don’t invite him to things but he tries to hang out with me. On the sam Tolkien I think he would be so much happier with somebody else  and I’ve told him that but I told him that’s all on him as well.I go without talking to him and he’ll initiate conversation again. Me being friends with him has put an immense stress on his relationship and it’s adding stress into his life. I feel guilty because I feel as if I’m adding to the situation.

I currently am about half way through my internship and about to enter my senior year of school. My mom just asked if I could move back home to watch him, which he agreed he would start getting his act together.

113,"This developed in the last year for me after I took an extended break from employment. I had no regimen and no schedule and was able to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. This meant staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning just because I could. Not every night. But often enough. Now I'm working again and it's starting to bother me. 

I wanted to give some additional context that I think is pertinent:

- I stay up late because I want to, not because I'm not tired.
- When I do go to sleep I fall asleep pretty easily. 
- Some nights I get 4 hours of sleep, some nights I get closer to 7. This is because of my erratic sleep schedule. 
- I don't want to go to bed. I feel like there are things to watch, things to read on the internet, books to read, etc, and this is all more exciting to me than going to bed.
- I feel like going to bed is ending my day and I haven't accomplished everything I wanted to. I think this is partly why I stay up.
- My wife goes to bed at 9pm every night because she wakes early for work and I just can't bring myself to go to bed that early. 
-Sometimes when I do get tired I push through that feeling. 5 minutes later in wide awake again. 

Has anyone experienced a similar situation?
I feel like I can't convince myself that sleep is important although I know that it is crucial for a healthy mind and body. I'm more addicted to staying up to do random stuff than to hop in bed and I'm worried about the long term effects.

114," A very close friend of mine has been on and off with his girlfriend for over a decade at this point. They have kids together. She has a long history of cheating and crazy behavior/lying. If he is out of the house, she will call/text his phone and whoever he is with claiming there is an emergency until he talks to her. She has verbally attacked several of our friends out of nowhere with seemingly outrageous claims. I have found that of all of his friends she seems to like and trust me more than anyone. She recently confided in me through text message that she suffers from depression among some other things.  


At a social gathering this weekend (which both he/she were at), she confided in a couple of people openly that he has been physically abusing her and that she was using makeup to cover the marks on her arm. She also claimed he has been going to anger management. Each of these people came to me to talk about it as I am the closest with both. My friend is the most laid back person of all time. I've honestly never even seen him become slightly angry at anything. It seems very easy to call bullshit especially given her very known history of dramatic behavior; however, there was a situation in the not so distant past in which he found out that she was talking to several other guys and admitted to me that he lost his temper, destroyed a lot of their mutual possessions, and grabbed her head and pushed it into the bed during an argument.   


My immediate thought was to call him out on it, but in the event that she was being honest I certainly don't want to make the situation worse for her if it is true. How do I approach this?

In my mind now they are just my “party” friends now and nothing more. I can’t expect much from them so please don’t take that the wrong way readers. They have continuously showed me that they are not my best friends any longer. This is despite are different paths in life. 
But anyway so I hung out with them on Sunday and we all caught up because one of them in particular is going through a rough time. So I thought okay I want to at least check up on them and go have a little bit of fun. But they’re wondering why I’m not bringing my boyfriend to these things.. and honestly I felt so thrown off I just told them I’m not ready yet. 
My reasoning is first of all, they are at very different places in life then me and an aspect of my past that I don’t wish to represent myself to my new boyfriend, second of all they are notorious for putting me down in front of others and third of all I honestly feel (I haven’t told them this) I can’t trust them with serious stuff like this. And this is a guy I truly want to be serious with. 
So my question is what do I tell them the next time they ask to meet him? I really don’t see any circumstance where it would be okay in my eyes except for maybe a social outing. I truly don’t think it’s important for them to meet him. But their question through me off for some reason, they can really get to me still and I wish it wasn’t like that but it is.

119,"Hi, so I'm currently a junior in high school and will be a senior this fall.    Sorry if my grammar is messy, my thoughts are jumbled as I type.

As of right now, I want to pursue in the art field and animation.  Personally, I had a passion for art ever since I was young and I had put it to use many times.  I have made some short animations before, though I still need a lot more practice.  I draw and sketch almost daily.  Etc.

Anyways, the reason I'm confused is that my parents want me to major in a medical field (I used to want to be a pediatrician) or something that has to do with coding.  However, I am no longer interested in the medical field.  I also had no interest in coding(or whatever the field is called) to begin with.  Currently, my dad signed me up to volunteer in a hospital for six months, and I have to do an interview next week(which I will fake my personality through it otherwise I will be a disappointment).  I didn't ask to do this by the way.

So, this brings me to my point.  My parents want me to go into the medical and STEM fields because they make a lot of money, according to them.  Meanwhile, I want to go into an art field because it is my passion and it is what I enjoy most, but my parents reject this idea because it will flop and I will get no where in life.  They even said that I shouldn't even have art as a hobby because it's not useful in life; their second career suggestion to me should be my hobby while I'm in college.  What I don't understand is why should I be going into careers that are in demand and make money while at the same time have no appeal to me?  I have already said that I'm not interested in their suggestions many times.  To me, my parents seem like they are saying money makes happiness.  I just don't get it.  But to be honest, it's maybe because I'm young(17 right now) and I don't know what's good for me and that my passion is a waste of time.",12Jun2018,2
121,"Hey Reddit, this is my first post on here so I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this and whatnot but I really could use some advice. Here's my story:
I met this guy at work and then I started to get to know him and I've fallen for him hardcore. I found out recently that he likes this girl from his school (we're 18 but he's still in high school) and that although she likes him back, they can't date since they're going to different cities for college in the fall. Him and I will be going to the same college. 
The thing is, I catch him looking at me a lot at work even if we're working at stations that are across the floor. He comes to my station a lot when he has a spare minute and talks to me about random stuff. I don't see him acting this way with anyone else during our shifts and I can't tell if he's just really comfortable with me as a friend or possibly more?? I guess a lot of this doubt stems from the fact that he's the type of guy that a lot of girls would find attractive and I don't consider myself to be that pretty. Our coworker once joked about me liking him once in front of him (without knowledge that I actually do like him) and all I could think to say was ""I like you as a friend"". Ever since then I've been super paranoid and I keep calling him ""buddy"" and ""dude"" and ""bro"" and all those not very flirty not very cutesy things. I feel like this had led him to think of me as not datable. 
The thing that's making me post this now is that during our last shift, something happened that made me very upset. He took notice of this from my facial expression and actions and took time from his responsibilities to keep walking across to my station to check up on me. When I started crying he asked really genuinely what was wrong and cracked a few jokes that managed to make me smile. I'm sure he just did this to be a good friend but I'm wondering if I should start trying to get him to see me as more than a friend before I get trapped in the friendzone for good. Should I flirt with him?? How do I flirt with him?? Is there any chance that he might already sort of like me?? 
I was thinking of giving him until the end of the school year to gain closure with his current crush since they do like each other before I do anything about my feelings. But that's coming up rather soon and I don't want to lose out on him. ",12Jun2018,1

Another example is my irrational fear of fires (which i believe was actually triggered by something) but if I smell anything like smoke my first thought is that there's an emergency fire or something like that and I'll get really panicky until I figure out where the smell is coming from.

125,"I don't really know if this is going to be at all helpful but Im at a loss as to what else could be done. Just to give some quick background, this is a very small town in Pennsylvania. A few years ago someone dropped an injured mute swan off at the creek near a small park in town. She had her wings clipped at some point and couldn't fly with a badly healed broken leg on top of it. many residents in town and surrounding towns loved her. She was a very sweet animal. My mother could actuallywalk right over to her and the swan would put her head on my mom's shoulder. We ended up with flocks of ducks and geese hanging around all year too because they were coming in attracted to the food and attention on the swan. This turned into a problem in itself because all those people who fed the birds in spring and summer didn't want to do a thing when it was cold out. The birds should't be here over winters. They migrate for a reason but these ones didn't because they were domesticated at this point. The baby ducks and geese had never migrated. They were not taught by the adults. There were about 3-4 families that fed all of the birds over the winter and set up shelters for them. My family was one of them. We're animal people, to put it lightly. All of our own animals are rescues. That was not an ideal situation but I had no idea how to fix it. People weren't going to stop feeding the birds in warm weather and it was already too later for the younger generation to learn migration habits. 

The swan ended up hit by a car 2 years ago. The shallow, fickle people who could not be bothered to even look at her in cold weather when it wasn't fun brought it up to the town council that they should get more swans. Stupid, stupid idea and they were told what a ridiculous idea it was. Breeding pairs of swans aren't fond of humans or anything else. Male swans are aggressive. There was also the fact that the birds shouldn't be here. They aren't meant to stay in a cold climate like this over winters. They fly across continents. Of course no one built them a shelter of their own and there was no set feeding schedule after they bought a pair of birds. They almost died when the ice went out because they can't fly and were stranded on ice flows. 4 town residents literally risked their own lives getting into the icy water below the dam to save the birds. Now those birds have 3 precious babies and the male has been chasing and attacking people in kayaks and on shore. Those people complained non-stop since the beginning of May so it was just announced the entire family of swans will be destroyed because they are 'aggressive.' Most animals are aggressive when stupid, selfish people try to pick up and fuss over thier babies, which is exactly what the kayakers did. They took their kids over and the father tried to use an oar to keep the adult swans back so his kids could play with the babies. Its all recorded. People saw it happening from shore so the lies told by these people were immediately debunked. They also claimed the entire family of swans chased them onto shore and into their car. I don't think I need to say that was also bs. Those baby swans are the size of a 6-month old kitten at this point and the adults can't run fast enough on land to chase people. 

So all 5 birds, 2 adults and 3 babies, will be dead by the end of the week thanks to rounds of stupidity from all corners. I don't know how to stop it or if it can be stopped. It is so upsetting that people did one stupid, selfish thing after another that will now result in the death of 5 animals who had no choice in the matter at all. There are many people upset but we can't do anything about it. I have no idea  how this could be addressed. ",12Jun2018,2

129,"So, I’m a student (incoming college freshman) and my summer break recently started. As a result, I have a lot of free time, which is great, except for the fact that this one girl keeps pestering me to hang out. And she will NOT leave me alone.

A little background: I absolutely despise this girl, but for the sake of my friend group (which she’s a part of), I’ve tolerated her for the past year. But she’s an all-around awful human being: always must be the center of attention, constantly shit talks everyone (even her other friends), spreads rumors and tells people’s secrets, etc. 

I didn’t want to stir up drama, so I was just planning to avoid her over summer. Which worked for a while — I met up with other people, declined group hangouts if she was invited, and made excuses not to hang out with her one-on-one. 

The problem is, she legit does not get social cues. I’ve been distant but polite for a month now…she doesn’t seem to be taking any hints, though. She’ll ask me if I’m free to hang out on one day, and if I give her an excuse, she’ll ask about the next day, then the next, etc. 

For example, the last time we “hung out” was ~2 weeks ago. I initially declined because I had to volunteer somewhere, so she decided to that place just to see me. Even though I explained that I wouldn’t have time, because I had work to do. She showed up, I was busy and couldn’t talk to her at that moment, and she just hung around for a while before leaving. Like, what was the point of that??

Since then, she basically asks for my schedule every week (not just if i’m free on a certain day, but what I’m doing specifically on each day). She’ll monitor when I’m on Facebook and make comments about it, like, “Oh, you were up at 1 AM yesterday?” Which, IMO, is not only annoying, but also kind of obsessive and creepy.

I’m so fed up with this. I do not want to hang out with her, and I’ve made this clear in the gentlest way possible (if I told her to her face, she’d probably throw a tantrum and then start trash talking me to our mutual friends).

132,"I'm at total rock bottom. 2.5 years ago I moved from my hometown to LA and it has been disastrous. I had very little work experience so I spent my first year getting fired several times and not having any money. I slept in a bunk bed. 
The beginning of my second year I worked as a dishwasher and lived in a rented shed. I have since been an office assistant. Much better job than I have ever had, but I am not excelling due to my severe depression from my personal life. 

I am currently living in a rented monthly motel near a gas station on a busy street. My window is only a few feet away from the street and I am constantly bombarded with heavy traffic noise to the point where my ears hurt and it is impossible to concentrate. My place is so small and poorly soundproofed I can't do anything here but go crazy, but I have no friends and nowhere else to spend the evening, aside from the random bar or fast food restaurant.

I am overall grappling with some pretty intense issues. Having no skills or career prospects, no comfort, no people, nothing. Just staring into the void. Just to mention, I also made the decision in late 2016 to transition MtF and even more recently to go back. So yeah, now I have to live as a man with boobs. I don't even have my body anymore. I have recently learned from a discussion I had online that I most likely have borderline personality disorder, which would explain my constant changes in self identity. 

I'm throwing this all out here hoping someone will listen. And I'm just wondering, should I quit my job right now, pay the final month of my lease, and just run away? I have about $6,000 dollars. And I personally don't care what happens to me.

133,"Let me begin with the fact that I'm 22 and have never lived alone in my life. I joined the California National Guard when I was 19, and have only been away for military purposes (longest one year in the Middle East). I've literally lived in California my entire life. 

I'm almost done with my transfer classes at my community college. I want to go to the University of Hawaii @ Manoa to finish my BA and possibly even masters.
I visited Hawaii once--for seven days. It was magical. The locals were incredibly kind, the food was great, the beaches were everything I imagined and more, literally everything. Everything was perfect. I wandered on my own around Oahu, Waikiki, Kailua and Honolulu and i truly felt like I found home. I know that sounds so cheesy, but the vibes felt so genuine. My serenity has always been the beach and chill. I realize it was a vacation and things will be WAY different if i live there (especially on my own). But i loved it. I can't think of another place I'd like to live.
The plans I have thus far: 
I'll be using my G.I. bill when I go, so i'll be getting around $1500 each month for housing. Plus tuition assistance via Hawaii army national guard (I have three left on my contract) and hopefully fafsa. 
I'll be going without a job, without any connections, literally with about nothing but school and drill one weekend a month.
This is IF i'm even able to transfer to a Hawaii unit. 

I want to go for it. But i'm scared of not being able to make friends or not liking it like i thought i would. it's an incredibly expensive move. i can't just easily move back to california if i move there.
i'm young, driven and i absolutely love traveling. 
I've been to japan, europe, the middle east and i'm only 22. i can't get enough. i am not in a relationship or have any serious ties to anyone. although i do have a pretty big family that i'm quite close to. they'll support me no matter what, though. 

what are your thoughts? should i just say f it and go for it?

I ended up texting my friend almost confessing,  but I joked it off. They asked me to be up front with them so I confessed my feelings and that I wanted to go on a date. I haven’t heard back since. It’s been eating me up, I feel like an idiot and I messed up something that could’ve been special. Even just as friends.

When my mom asked me if I felt like going I told her no since I was feeling really down at the time and I really didn't feel like going anywhere at all. I was assuming that I would just stay home and they would go on without me but they actually canceled the trip since it was centered around helping me get out of the house. 

Now they are looking at booking a place at the mountains since they think I might like it better (part of my reasoning for not going to the beach is because I said I didn't want to be out in the sun a lot). I'm nervous about this since we've never actually been. They are doing this just because I said I didn't feel like going to the beach. I'm scared that my family won't actually like it since we aren't outdoors people and wouldn't be into hiking and there isn't much else to do. I feel like I've ruined their vacation.

Now that I'm feeling a little better I'm thinking that the beach might actually be nice and I would enjoy it but I don't know how to fix this after they already canceled the booking. They are already looking into booking a cabin and I don't know how to backtrack. Does anyone know how easily fixable this is? How should I bring it up?

137,"Earlier this year I [28F] applied to a couple of unis here in Aus to study Biomedical Science. I've just received an offer from a uni in a state I'd like to live in. The problem is that I have an ok career path ahead of me already.

Here are the main points:
~ have always wanted to study medicine, have talked about it my entire life right from my pre-teens
~ flunked out of yr 11 &amp; 12 due to depression but got into uni to study business
~ still depressed so struggled with my Bach of Business, eventually finished it part-time while working full-time in 2013
~ couldn't get a job so enrolled to do a Master of HR. Applied myself hard and got a 6.0 GPA (on a 7.0 scale), finished it 2015.
~ still want to study med but now I'll be ~40 y/o by the time I'm certified
~ got a career path at my current job with a fantastic mentor
~ moved to a new city in January this year for this career path
~ current career doesn't make a lot of $

What to do? I didn't think I'd get accepted into the uni that made an offer to me and now it's all very real. It'll still be 3 years of BBiomedSc then 5 years MBBS, and 2 years of working before specialisation? That's a long road.

143," 	Okay y'all first and foremost this is gonna be a long one, and I apologize for that.  I'm looking for advice, information, help, honestly anything!  

So lets start at the beginning. For 2 years I've been working a full\-time hourly job, I was only getting paid minimum wage, however it was more then I had ever really made before and I was able to put money away. I felt secure enough to get a few credit cards that I used gently, got a 'adult' phone line ( T\-Mobile ) and was content with life. However in November life went to hell. Due to a few issues with my GM, I was transferred into a job that I physically couldn't do, and was basically pushed into quitting.    

I've been trying to keep a float ever since. As of January I found another job, I did the math and figured out that I needed to work AT MINIMUM 25 hours a week – that would cover rent and bills only, no extras nor food or anything like that. I ended up landing a part time job at a local Starbucks. However by this time I had burned through my savings and had nearly maxed out all my cards with keeping up with bills, food ( though I did sign up for EBT and Medi\-cal) and pet needs.      	

   I ended up working at the one location I was concerned about, it is the fastest in the district and area ( for you all who know Starbucks) and a ways away from home. However at the time I had solid transportation, and the willingness to try. Not to count the NEED for money. So I go and do the job, and it was exactly what I was worried about. To fast, to chaotic and honestly I was in a bit over my head.  I requested a transfer about a month in and was told point blank that it couldn't happen. However I was working between 25 and 30 hours a week and scraping by through the skin of my teeth, but I was making it. After a month or 2, the location felt a lot easier and I was finally making headway on what I needed to do to keep up with it.    

However at this point in time my motorcycle started have problems. First it was the oil intake, the engine was eating oil, then the chain started making this horrible grinding noises, and the bike was soon un\-rideable.  Also at this time my boss informed me that I was getting my transfer after all. I was being  transferred to a slower location that would have time to train me better ( due to the speed of the location I was at I had not been trained on how to make drinks, I was primarily register and customer support) and would have more hours available to me.  I thought okay that works.    

So right around the start of May the transfer happens – now to note at this point I've already almost been short on rent once, friend covered me last minute. I had a talk with my new manger about what he expected of me and what I needed from him, namely what I needed  in hours and training, and why. Since that point I have been getting less the 20 hours a week ever week, I am at an even faster location when I am constantly being treated like an idiot for not knowing how things at that store work.     

As of right now I am a month behind on one bill and do not have the money to pay anything else. I have \-2 dollars in my bank account and was told at the start of this month that my rent will be going up 100 dollars.  I would love to find a new job, however I no long have reliable transportation ( and can not sell the busted motorcycle because it was loaned to me by a friend, and is not mine) and can not afford a 70 dollar a month bus pass, let alone the 5 dollar day pass.  I have sold off several electronics and collectibles, whatever I could basically, and have cut back as much as I can. I have contacted friends, and while they wish well and are trying to help as they can, they are not in a position to fix the situation. Due to late bills causing credit issues, a loan is also not possible.                  I do know that if I do not touch my bank account at all for the rest of the month. I will have the money to cover next months rent, and nothing else. 

I have no idea what to do, or where to turn to for help. If anyone knows of any programs, grants, or can offer help or advice of any sort, it would be greatly appreciated.    

Thank you so much for you time.

148,"I have a background in finance with many career obstacles. I am now 37 years old.

Summary of my career is as follows. On my resume, I have 6 years of full time work experience (working for someone else). There is a big gap in my resume. 2 of those middle years were spent as in a part-time position that was unpaid. It was during the 2009-10 years of recession in order to gain experience as well as to pad my resume. During that time, i tried effortlessly to find a job but could not. The place where I worked was run by 1 main guy. He had then offered to vouch for me as if I was working there full time even though I had not. I leveraged that to get another job. 

2 years later I was laid off from that job. Coincidentally, my greatgrandmother became ill. I spent about 1.5 years helping to take care of her and running the family business (unrelated to my career). She then passed away. Shortly after, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. During that time, my mother undergone chemo. It was up and down. I never knew when she would become better. I had continued to help manage the family business. In fact, I turned down a dream job offer across the country for her. I made many sacrifices for my family in which they don't seem to even appreciate (which is another story). Recently, she became better and I feel comfortable going back to my original career. I have 2 big gaps on my resume and need to explain it somehow. Any advice would be appreciated.

*First gap: 2 years as an unpaid associate. The reason I was there for so long was because of the recession. It was meant to be temporary but kept prolonging. My old boss is unresponsive and I don't think he will vouch for me any longer.  Since i wasn't paid, I have no documented proof that I worked there. I think he stopped returning my contact because I kept asking for favors (references etc.). how do I prove I even worked there?  I was thinking of purchasing a fake reference online. Has anyone had any experience doing so?

*Second gap: 5 years helping my family. Basically i was a property manager which is unrelated to my career. How do I explain the departure of my family business? When I go on interviews, I feel that interviewers think i am already ""SET"", which is not true.The business is now suffering because of legal issues, which is why i need to leave.

151,"Alright so, about two months ago now I had a house fire, no specifics on how it started as the investigation still hasn't been completed, but it's important to note that the investigator has refused to release any portion of the house to us until their investigation is done.  I've been feeling completely overwhelmed between losing everything, the contractors, this investigation being delayed so damned long, and the insurance company fighting me tooth and nail over every little thing.

It wasn't all bad, the fire destroyed the garage, and blew up the ventilation system.  Ash and asbestos are spread through the entire house, and the ceiling has collapsed in the entire front end of the house.  Lots of heirlooms, electronics, and collectibles were stuck because we were told not to take anything out except from the back end of the house, until the investigation was done.

Over the weekend, someone decided to break in, and help themselves to EVERYTHING that wasn't nailed down, collectibles, clothing (mainly fur, and leather jackets) electronics, and more.  There's so much missing, I can't even begin to remember everything that was in that house, but I've been told to make another list anyway.

The police weren't helpful, blaming me for not securing the house well enough, or letting it sit to long (Even though I can't do anything about it due to the investigation), and essentially said 'oh well, we'll start the police report, you fill it out and give it to your insurance'.  

So now I feel stuck, violated, and like the world is just collapsing down around me, what the hell am I even supposed to do at this point?  There's things gone now that are impossible to replace (the other member of my household had a vintage handbag collection, as well as a huge number of other valuables taken.  Including tax forms.)  It feels like the insurance company only exists to try and make my life harder right now, and my contractors are getting antsy, and blaming the insurance company for the break-in.

I'm sorry to ramble, or for how disjointed this post seems, but I'm just beyond overwhelmed, and now the break in has just made everything even more stressful.  I have no idea what I'm even supposed to do anymore, beyond keep filling out these lists that the insurance company wants.",12Jun2018,4

Since my grandparents want me to manage hotel staring from next year my dad is now mad at me and thinks I’m turning snobbish or something, but actually I just want my place because right now I feel I’m running around helping everyone and when I get home the only place I got is my bed to rest when day is over.

162,"Context: I'm a 20-year-old College drop out and I've been in a relationship for a year now. I and my partner have known each other for years as really close internet friends and we are pretty close. 

My grand father was in poor health and I had to leave school to care for him but he passed away and I couldn't keep up with his house (The one I moved into to nurse him) and I had to move in with my friend as a quick fix to my rocky start to my adult life. 

Well, my boyfriend is in the service. He's active duty and stationed in FL in the Navy. He's just returned from his training and wasn't deployed so... He offered to let me move down to finally meet him and be in person. That was months ago, now... It's in two days! I move out of state and across the country in two whole days and I'm sweating bullets! I'm not backing down and I am jumping with joy to see my partner. 

But I'm worried about how things will go. 

What I need to ask: What are some tips for going from Long Distanced to suddenly in person 24/7? I'm disabled and I won't be away at a job (He will be) so I'll kind of be there a lot. I work in web design and try to keep up with projects that don't require me to hurt myself. 

I'm really shy and enjoy my space. I'm an introvert. 
He's really bubbly and outgoing and loves talking a ton. 

We've worked out so far, will this break us or make us? 
Why am I so nervous? 

Please give me advice :( ",12Jun2018,1
163,I have been experiencing very high libido for the past couple years. Its distracting me from my work and leisure. How can I control it?,12Jun2018,1
164,"I was a virgin and had sex for the first time with this guy I've been dying to get with. I feel like all he wanted in the relationship was the sex because I'm sort of anti-social... but now I feel I ruined that as well.

So everything was fine and it started out great, he helped me get used to it and eventually it started feeling so amazing... To good really. For one, I started uncontrollably rolling my eyes like crazy. He even stopped at one point to ask if I was okay. After that as if I was crazy I started drooling nonstop like a dog's mouth fizzing. I could not stop either... he even told me to quit drooling on him and had to switch to doggystyle.

After that we took a break and I was just even more terrible at conversation as usual. He looked extremely uninterested and annoyed from how bad the sex was that I offered him a free blowjob. Apparently, I was terrible at that too because I could only get the tip for him.

Luckily enough, he let me ride him also a fail since he took the lead and I had my drooling zombie face again. And so he tried to be nice and suggested we tried anal, that maybe I was doing that because I just lost my virginity and it was hurting or something. It wasn't, but we lubed and tried anal anyway, which was honestly great as well. He even enjoyed it a lot since I stopped acting crazy.

Then finally where I completely ruined my chances with the guy. He switched back to my vagina to finish and I went back to my drooling and eye twitching, then out of no where... I shit myself. Like mid sex... it just dropped while I was on him cowgirl. Luckily it didn't touch him but he noticed and pushed me off of him saying wtf. And he made me pick it up with my hand... after this he wanted me to leave and so far hasn't returned any of my text.

&gt; I feel like he blocked me.

Now I'm extremely worried not only because I embarrassed myself in front the guy I liked so much... but also because I have to see him tomorrow in front of everyone. He could easily remark this to anyone and I'll be the laughing stock. My sex life will end without it even beginning and I'll be known as the worst sex partner ever... I've been trying to text him but I feel like he's blocked me. I don't know what to do to convince him to keep it between us or just try to fix it but omg... I need advice soon. I feel like my life may be over.",12Jun2018,1
165,"Hey Reddit, how are you? I have a little problem here. Since summer started, I can't sleep properly and it's been driving me crazy. I'm in a bad mood, I'm deadly tired and my back is killing me because I end up sleeping in the couch at 11 am.

A little context. I moved to Finland on September. I -somehow- survived finnish summer with just 4-5 hours of light. I though the easiest part would be summer, because I'm from a tropical country and I would have sun 24/7.

God , I was wrong. Here 3 am looks like 16 pm and sometimes around midnight or an hour after that is the brightest time of the day. I can't sleep at nights and I'm just sleeping 4-5 hours per day in the morning. Not good.

I've tried the following things:

-Close all the curtains, turn on the lights at 21:00 to trick me it's dark and help me sleep
-I stop eating at 20:00
-I drink relaxing tea before sleeping
-I train at the gym at noon and then go to the sauna sometimes to make myself relaxed
-I have tried to cover my eyes with a sleep mask
-I don't take any naps
-I also tried yoga and meditation


Please guys, I need some help. If I keep sleeping so little, I would go nuts. Thanks in advance for all your helpful answers guys (:

167,"Hey,

It's four in the morning here and I'm in a call with my girlfriend and she's asleep, I can't sleep. It sucks. But it's because I can't stop thinking about a lot of things regarding her. She has anxiety and clinical depression. I personally have ADHD and strongly suspect anxiety too.

What's keeping me up is the fact that I don't know if I'm a shitty partner or not because of these things we're going through. I'm 17 and she's 16. So we're both really fucking young at this point and I think that's important. It's also an LDR too. Kind of an odd circumstance.

A couple months back she started hanging out with her friends a lot more and started becoming distant. I made a few pretty bad mistakes with this and I acknowledge it in that I didn't give her enough space to do what she wanted. I don't have much of a life outside of going to the gym and dicking around on Reddit and with FL Studio. So a lot of my time is spent talking with her over text and calls. 

We used to spend nearly everyday and all-day talking which is why this still bugs me but I get it. Sometimes change happens and I guess I have to get better at dealing with it. So when she told me that she wanted to hang out with her friends more I was fine with that. My anxiety kinda fucks me up here but I'm learning to cope with that ATM. 

What's big is that earlier in the year,we told each other we were going to be sober for the rest of 2018. I personally have finished experimenting with all the shit that I want to. I also do not have any problems with substances normally but in a relationship it's a lot greyer for me. She didn't see any problem with that at the time. She does have an affinity for weed though. We promised each other sobriety. She agreed. 

Anyways, her hanging out with her friends starts to become everyday and she stays out later sometimes having sleepovers. She doesn't really call (this is like March?) Or text a lot, and when she did, it was really brief. From this point on, she's stopped taking her medication, but I only learned about this today.

I'm a really lonely guy and all that time just laying around doing jack shit kinda got to me and I told her how I felt she was becoming distant. She said she felt the same and she promised to fix it. Except she didn't and continued on. 4/20 comes around and she takes a hit as a ""joke"" but she didn't mention that until way after she told me, where I was really disappointed that she'd broke our promise not even halfway through the year.

I told her my stance and said that if she smoked, it'd be a deal breaker for me (evidently it wasn't and I feel like a bitch for not sticking to my guns but I love her). This stressed her out and she had a panic attack that night. I felt really bad, I hate hurting her so much but I don't know what I'm supposed to do there. 

By May shes starting to go to the beach with her friends a lot. I barely talk to her. When we do call it's before bed and she goes right to bed. She admits to me she wants to smoke and I reaffirm my position that I don't want her to smoke and it's partly because of how young she is and also because of what we agreed to. We have an argument. She admits that she feels trapped with me because I don't give her space and that she wants a break.

That fucked me up a little. She said that smoking was a big part of her and that she didn't like changing who she was. I said that we were fundamentally incompatible. I broke up with her.

Except I called her ten minutes after because I was worried and we got back together. Yay. She said I was worth not smoking for and we went to bed. Next morning she tells me she wants a break again and tells me she would have liked to smoke a bowl. I said OK, we can take a break but I don't want you smoking. She agreed to that again.

Two weeks later she tells me over text she smoked. And that her smoking was two days before her text. I realize at this point that this wasn't a deal breaker or at least an immediate one. I told her it's OK. I asked if she could smoke only occasionally though. She said sure. But she's developed this issue with promising and justifies it as her not knowing what will happen in the future and says she can't promise anything. But in the last two weeks she's smoked 6 times, when we said once a month at most.

That brings us to now. I can't shake the feeling that something is up. She told me about her finsta and on her feed there's a lot of shit relating to her smoking and weed in general. It makes me feel so confused about her when I look at it because I never really knew this side of her. We just had another argument over this and I told her why I didn't want her smoking. She told me she knew the effects on the brain and she didn't care. She's put me into this position where I don't know what to expect because she says she can't promise anything. 

She says she doesn't want someone that's controlling, but I know if I am controlling. I keep thinking about what we had and what she's done, but I don't want to bring it up because I don't want to upset her. It's fucking with me I don't really know what to do.

Please ask questions I don't think I explained this very coherently. Apologies for that it's kinda late.",12Jun2018,1

""You're 21?! I though you were 16!... So THAT'S why you wear buttoned shirts!"" Made me understand he thought I was a kid every time he asked me why am I wearing buttoned shirts.

I also read enough about how it doesn't actually get better as you grow older to completely destroy all my confidence. No one actually considers you part of the same group, so you get left out as the ""kid"" that is too young for whatever is happening.

She called me out in class for taking a picture of something on the projector for studying purposes because it was copyrighted.

I was right, so I cited what I read in the email and kept it super nice and cordial, just telling her that what she had said was wrong. I really only did it because I don't like being called out in front of my peers and I felt wronged in a way, but she doesn't know that. There's really no visible reason for sending her that other than to say ""i'm right, you're wrong, HA"". Yet I did it. Can I get in trouble for this?  Do you think she'll be mad?

171,"I have no idea what my next course of action should be and I was hoping you could help me. I'm in Canada if that matters.

When I got home from work I found puddles of water on my floor. It came from the ceiling above me (not a water pipe. It was the tenets mistake overflowing something in their bathroom). My mattress was soaked, all my clothes... Everything. There was so much water it flooded the bedroom floor and leaked into my hallway, living room and bathroom. Unfortunately my laptop was on my bed and was literally dripping water.

I called the landlord and he talked to the people above me. This isn't the first time they've flooded their bathroom. A few  months earlier they flooded the unit beside me. (a little extra info if it matters but they've spo the last two weeks throwing and banging all night. It's been bothering every person in the building)

A few minutes ago the banging started and knocked a ceiling tile onto my bed. Thankfully I wasn't in bed bc it landed on my pillows where my head would have been.

What can I do in this situation? Am I just out an expensive laptop because of my neighbours stupid actions? Also, I'm not comfortable sleeping in my bedroom since my head and bed are right underneath a giant hole and don't want to wake up to toilet water in my face.

172,"I have a video game addiction, and I'm not sure how to stop.. Everytime I try to quit, I just end up playing again. Even when I disassemble my PC, and try to quit cold turkey, I always end up going back to it. I play all day, I definitely have a life, a good job, school, friends, family, and gym a lot, but my life could be SOOOO much better with more time on my hands. I spend at least 10\-12 hours a day on the PC, and a lot of my friends notice that I do spend a lot of time on it. 

But it has always been this way for the past 14 years, and I am 24. It's just so hard to give up, because I feel like it is the only thing that gives me excitement anymore, as I am dealing with clinical depression. I tend to sacrifice sleep for video games, and I try to convince myself that I can make it through the day with 4\-5 hours of sleep, but usually wound up exhausted the next day at work or at school which in return, diminishes my work or school quality.

177,"Hi, throwaway account because I'm very embarrassed and upset about this. I can't really tell people because they would make fun of me. I'm a HS senior. I'm sorry if I'm not really clear. Its 3AM and I'm really upset because I can't sleep because of it, and I don't like opening up about it because it gives me extreme anxiety just thinking about it at all (the name of the game, the characters, the nightmares, the scary thoughts, etc)

When I was a freshman I was really into this game (Five Night's at Freddy's) I would read super into it, follow fan art and all that stuff. I never actually played the game, just watching videos about it. I'd look at a ton of screen caps too. Back then it never really bothered me, the characters just being there, looking into the camera and stuff, trying to get to you, just being threatening or whatever. There's been sequels where there's more characters, more threatening and scary. I don't want to get into detail.

I got over the game really quickly. I stopped following the ""fandom"" after one of my favorite artists stopped following it. Never really thought about it after that.

So, I don't know what happened. I'm not sure when it started but let's say around a year ago, I started having nightmares about the characters in the game. Like, them just staring at me or being in my house and just being a threat. Like staring at me through my window, or peeking at me through the door.

It's been progressively getting worse. The nightmares used to be just that, them staring at me, but they're more extreme now, like me trying to get away from the thought of it, but I can't. All I can see is them staring at me, and I keep crying for help but nothing happens and I'm alone.

I have an awful time trying to fall asleep. I keep trying to shut my eyes but when I do I just see one of them staring at me. I am so afraid of trying to leave my bedroom at night because I imagine they're outside of it. 

It's not been consistently a year. I have like, 2 week long ""episodes"" of having these thoughts and then it kind of isn't nearly as bad. I still have anxiety being in the dark and stuff, and I can't talk about it or think about it or I'll have another ""episode"" and I'll be stuff in a terrifying loop of this again.

Also seeing ANY merchandise of the game makes it all come back. I do my very best to avoid it in stores but sometimes it happens unexpectedly. If I see something on accident I immediately start crying. I have to have my boyfriend kind of guide me through areas where they have merch for it because I can't look.

I can't talk about it with anyone. Even with my boyfriend I have to be very, very vague like ""I had a nightmare about that thing again"" and nothing more, because if I do it makes me EXTREMELY anxious and I can barely talk or breathe. I can't stand thinking of the game or trying to describe how I feel. It was really hard typing this out.

The other night I had a really bad nightmare, and I think someone came into my room that morning, saw my light was on and turned it off, so after the nightmare I woke up in complete darkness and freaked out. I went to lay down in her room and I ended up venting about the whole thing. The problem is that my mom is a religious nut, so she thinks my demons have invaded my mind. I appreciate her effort to try to ""cleanse"" me because I know she wants to help, but it's just making things more stressful for me. 

I've begged for a therapist but the problem is that we just don't have the money for one. I'm starting college in the Fall and I really don't want this on my mind during this. I struggle with my education already because I am autistic. I need help. I don't know where to go. 

TL;DR: I've been having reoccurring nightmares, terrifying thoughts and meltdowns because of Five Night's at Freddy's. 

BTW I realize the game isn't even scary or whatever, I get that. It's just the fact that they just sit there and stare at you in such a threatening way. I know this is really stupid but I'm just really desperate at this point. Thanks for reading.",12Jun2018,1

 Option A:
I have been in contact with Option A for about 5 months now. It is a long distance relationship right now as he is in the military. We used to date as teenagers but had to break up because I was in college and he joined the military and was traveling the world. I few years later and both of us are single adults. We find that we still have strong feelings for one another. After a while we tell each other we love one another and I am very happy. However... he will be moving even farther away from me and as of lately been saying some really crazy stuff that has been making me upset. He is visiting for a week to see if a relationship together is the right thing for us. I am very excited.Physically I am very attracted to him. He is my height (5’7) very physically fit. Dark and very handsome. Very much established in his job and has a very active lifestyle. He goes out a lot and has lots of friends. 

Option B: 
I met him at work as a customer and we connected immediately. He is so nice and has a wonderful personality. We have so much in common it’s almost borderline creepy. I have found myself really spending a lot of time with him and it sucks when we aren’t together. I have found myself opening up to him even though I have only known him for about 2 weeks. Physically he has grown on me. Very tall (6,8) skinny build. He is VERY smart. He works A LOT like almost 60 hours a week. 

I have told Option B about Option A but OA knows nothing about OB

My dilemma is OB said I need to make a decision on who I want to be with before OA comes and visits because he does not want to feel like a rebound. Which is completely understandable. 

I have no idea how I will make this decision because I know whoever I pick may potentially be my future husband...

There is nothing at college anymore but long lessons that ultimatly mean nothing as I have completed my exams and to add on to this the practical lessons at the end of the week are introducing things you need for the second year of the course, but Im not taking the second year of the course, Ive secured a spot doing A levels and can do them no matter what (I fail or pass or get kicked off the course). I have lost all interest for this subject and dont feel like I can learn anything new in the next few weeks. I was told at the beginning of the course we would be finished by June but the course was 'postponed' or some shit. To add on to this beause I thought June would be free I have organized loads of shit with my mates to do and dont want to cancel all of it. (My mates are finished ithis week and I have 3 more weeks). What would you do? Skip 85% of the lessons and ignore the phone calls home and letters or just bite the bullet go in, cancel my plans and subjcet myself to pointless boredom but without the fear of getting kicked off he course for my low attendance or getting severely told off.

187,"I work at the front desk of a gym in my city so I get to talk with the members everyday and get to know them more than even most other members.  One person that I have had many real conversations with turns out to be a tax market leader for Ernst and Young (like, this dude has local newspaper articles written about him).  When we last talk he asked about what I'm studying in college and I told him I will be entering my junior year towards a BS in Economics and a minor in leadership.  We kept talking about that and he mentioned how Ernst and Young hires a lot of Economics majors out of my college (conveniently located about a mile away from their headquarters in my city).   When he was leaving, he stopped and gave me his business card and said ""send me some of your information \*Genzhi\* I'll see what can be done.""  What and how do I email this guy so I don't fuck up anything?  I've never had someone so important do this and I honestly have no experience emailing people ""some information"".  I'm assuming he wants my resume, but should I write something else or add anything else?

\*Tl:dr\*  Important dude gave me his card and said ""send me some information"".  What do I send?  How do I format what I send?  Do I write what I'm looking for, or do I just essentially say ""here ya go.  What does this qualify me for?""",12Jun2018,1
188,"I’m a student back home for the summer and have applied for a few jobs to make some extra cash while I’m back.

I managed to get the first job I applied for and have an introduction there on Thursday to get me ready for my first shift next week.

However I’ve had an interview at another place where I’d prefer to work and will get much more hours there. 

I hear back from the preferred place on Friday and will then know if I have the job or not.

The dilemma is about going to this introduction on Thursday and then possibly telling them I’m going to another job instead the day after and 3 days before my first shift.

Is than an acceptable thing to do or should i approach this a different way?

191,"Okay so I met this girl in the club added each other on Snapchat a couple weeks ago. Got the feeling she wasn't interested, then she starts messaging me a couple of times just replying to my story. Was pretty weird but probably over thinking things.

Today we both have our last exams, she said she's probably going to get drunk after them and that I can join her if I want.

Am I over thinking things, taking it the wrong way? Like I'm a really fucking awkward person and I have no idea what this means if it means anything ",12Jun2018,1
192,"Some background to what happened prior.

My brother, for the past 3 years approximately, has displayed some very alarming and erratic behaviour. Things at times have become violent, or have been more of the delusional nature.  For example, I remember my brother once posted a photo on Instagram of him smiling, with trees in the background of the photo he posted. A day later, a girl he found attractive posted a headshot (LinkedIn style headshot type photo) of her on Facebook with trees in the background. He saw this and thought that the attractive girl was in love with him and was trying to translate that through her photo. 

From events like this, I obviously knew something was very wrong. He has gotten violent on many occasions, and I have had to call the police on my own brother about 5 times now, as I was scared someone in my family was going to get hurt when he was getting out of control. Once, he pulled a knife on my father, and threatened to hurt him if my dad didn't give him money. 

One day, he had a complete psychotic breakdown that was probably the scariest day of my life. He was arrested, and then was admitted into a psych ward, and stayed there for around 2-3 months. After years of doctors sending us away and saying everything was fine and normal, he was finally diagnosed with a disorder in the schizophrenia family. Basically, his sickness made him imagine that people or society altogether were plotting for or against him. He would genuinely believe the things his mind told him (think almost conspiracy theories that someone genuinely believed, based on the most random details he experienced through his day to day, like the photo of the girl with trees in the background). He has been getting monthly shots of meds since that day, and his real self has come back. He has been very kind and sweet and has returned to the sensitive self that he once was. He has not gotten violent or aggressive for around a year and a half now. 

Everything had seemed to return to normal; however, recently, he has not been getting out of bed for days at a time. Whenever I asked him if he was okay, he would simply tell me to go away and not to worry about it. My parents are very panicky people and are somewhat traumatized from his past, and have been freaking out because of this. I knew something was up, and that it was bigger than depression alone.

Today, he texted me and told me to keep it private between him and I that he is addicted to cocaine, and does not know how to get off of it. He said that when he lies in bed, he is lucid dreaming, and he is trying to get his mind off Coke, which is on his mind constantly. He said Coke started recreationally for him after he graduated last year, but has turned into a problem. He has had issues holding jobs for years now, and this is probably part of it. He said he would like to get off of coke but do it recreationally when the time is right for that type of thing, such as a party. 

My brother has had the project of rebuilding a car for the last 5 years now. Basically, he was very ambitious and decided to fully replace the motor of his VW with a bigger and better one. This project has cost him tens of thousands of dollars, and unfortunately has failed. The car won't start, and the vehicle sits vacant in the front of our house. from time to time he will try to fix it, but I think he has given up. He said that every time he thinks of the car, he gets upset and feels like a failure, and does a line of Coke to deal with the pain. This car has been a source of conflict for a long time in my family, as it is quite the eyesore (imagine a completely deconstructed car sitting vacant in front of a townhouse in a carport). My parents are egging him on to deconstruct it and sell the parts for money, but they are not aware of his addiction and I cannot tell them, as they will get angry and possibly kick him out. 

I am very worried that he will spiral and go back to his old ways of being aggressive and quite delusional if his addiction continues. I don't know much about drugs, but I am very scared because of his sickness and the past. Since he has confided in me, he is trusting that I don't tell my parents. As I mentioned, my mom and dad are very triggered people and would instantly get angry and panic if they knew about this, only making things worse. My mom is the type to get explosively angry and yell when she's scared, and my dad gets very stressed and sad. I want to do what's best for my brother and support him, but I am not sure of what to do in this situation. I would ideally like him to get help and get off of Coke altogether, but I don't know what steps to take. 

I would appreciate any sort of advice or support from any of you who have experienced something like this, or have knowledge about addiction that I do not have. I appreciate you guys for reading my post, and will be open to any type of feedback regarding what steps I need to take with my brother to send him in the right direction. ",12Jun2018,1
193,"Recently me and my boyfriend broke up. With that being said, I have began the process of moving out of the place we once shared together. By recently I mean a couple days ago. Last night while picking up some remaining belongings we had a conversation in regards to how each of us are doing. We both expressed discomfort of lacking companionship, but both of us recognized that this is an opportunity for both of us to become healthier/stronger people. Additionally, we expressed that we both still hold out that one day we will come back together but until then we must not rely on one another for being each others support system. Based on that conversation it was clear that we both are going through things, and experiencing sadness. He even told me that he needs to become happy again. Well fast forward to that night I go to sleep. I wake up with this absolute knot in my stomach. My gut is telling me something is horribly wrong. It wasn’t just one of those gut feelings. It was more than that. I woke up physically ill because of it, and eventually threw up. After sitting trying to find an explanation as to why my body is experiencing such panic and feelings of intuition I get the feeling to check my ex’s Instagram. When I check his Instagram I find a recently posted (posted about 3 hours ago) picture of a handgun. Immediately the pit in my stomach grew and completely amplified. Since that point I have been nothing short of worried sick. I don’t necessarily want to reach out to him and say anything but bottom line is that I’m worried. This worry is based on his statements about depression and suicide. Although he hasn’t mentioned suicide directly to me for quite some time I have found that he has looked up ways to kill himself on his web browser during a rough patches in our relationship when we were together. Like I said I don’t want to reach out because I fully understand that we both need this time apart in order to grow independently. I just can’t shake the feeling that he might do something and the idea that if I don’t say anything I must live with that for the rest of my life. Following that logic though that proposes the problem of bringing it up. I don’t know how to do it or even if I should. I understand that we’re not together and it’s no longer my responsibility to check up on him. However, if he hurt himself I would be completely devastated. Especially if I didn’t say anything or offer my support, love, or guidance if he needed it. I guess my problem is that I don’t want to appear as the crazy ex who checks their social media constantly. I feel as if me reaching out could come off that way. However, I just can’t shake this feeling, and it’s eating my alive. Since finding this information out I have been non stop pacing around the room in which I occupy in my parents home now. What should I do? What would you guys do?  ",12Jun2018,1
194,"This is actually an ongoing problem but in last a couple days it became really hurtful.

I am not actually diagnosed but I researched a bit and I think I may be on the autism spectrum. A couple days ago I discussed this with my BF to help him understand me better. At that time everything seemed okay, he was a bit silent but he didn't say anything wrong.

Fast forward to last night, I was feeling really bad and anxious about something, then he said something like ""reeee look at me I'm an idiot I'm autistic"" making fun of me. I immediately burst into tears but didn't tell him what was the problem because even thinking about what he just did hurt too much. He seemed like he had no idea what did he do wrong but he tried to console me. A couple hours later I felt better and we went to sleep. We had plans to go out in the morning. We received a parcel before we went out and I started playing with the bubble wrap. A couple minutes later he said ""okay let's go out"" and I said ""wait I want to finish this first"" and he went ""take it with you and walk around like an autistic""

I, again, burst into tears and he again has no idea what's wrong. I told him to go by himself so he went, and now I'm alone at home. 

I have no idea how to manage this situation. I don't understand how can he not have an idea what did he do wrong? I can speak to him openly but I already feel too vulnerable and I feel like it was a mistake talking to him in the first place.",12Jun2018,2

196,"My brother is extremely mentally ill. He has no identification, has been in and out of jail and is too mentally unstable to take care of himself. He lives with my parents, ignores everything they say, urinates on the side of the house instead of the toilet.   


While I stayed at my parents for a year, I was subjected to all kinds of psychological torture. My mother threw bottles at me, locked me and my brother out of the house for no reason whatsoever. She demanded that I go to the store for her every day to buy her booze, even when the streets were covered in ice. She kept me up until 5 in the morning screaming at me.  


Meanwhile my brother would make sexual advances at me, call me a faggot, threaten to put sharp objects or poison in my food, constantly ask for money to buy drugs. He would shit himself and refuse to get into the shower or change clothes for weeks. He smeared dirt all over our bathroom and dismantled all of the fixtures. On two separate occasions I caught him staring at me through the crack in my door.  


Finally I earned enough money to move. I live in an apartment and might be forced to move again soon. However I'm confident that no matter what happens I won't have to back track to my parents ever again.   


My mother drunkenly called me at about 3am over and over again until I picked up. The last time she did this she threatened to call the police on me for not picking up the phone. \-\- Today she tried to guilt trip me into taking care of my brother. She says family is family and that means sticking together no matter what.   


I have to say that after all I've been through with the abuse and the isolation, and recovery from my own trauma induced psychotic episode: I never want to take care of my brother or have anything to do with my family again.  


I do not feel any attachment to them, and while I was growing up I had to pretend to feel something about them in order to get by and survive. \-\- Just so you know, I'm not some kind of sociopath. I have close friends who I care about, I've fallen in love on at least 2 occasions and really know what it means to care for a person. When my friends are in trouble I am the first one to rush to the rescue like when my friend needed stitches after building that pillow fort.  


I made it clear that I was never going to take care of my psychotic, manipulative drug addict brother. All my mother ever gives me is guilt for nothing in return. What is the cut off point? When does a person decide to cut ties with their family? What if I need a place to stay again? If I lost my place being homeless might just be a better choice than living with them for my health.",12Jun2018,80

I'm not going to go into detail, I could write a whole fucking book, but that's not the point. 

I'm convinced I can't get a normal, actual relationship. For everyone I've been into, I've either been to pussy to ask them out, or they just reject me but go on to another person like I'm nothing (most of the time these people actually want a relationship, so). It's more the latter than the asking them out part.

This time around, she wants a more intimate and sexually involved relationship, whereas I want the intimacy and romantics, but not the sexual involvement.

201,"Question about two internship offers.

First company:

It is a company that is basically world-wide but isn't anywhere near the Big 4 level. It's a telecommunication company which I wasn't really aware of until I saw their job postings. There are 125 reviews on glassdoor and it's fairly positive.

The position they want me to work is as a QA Analyst. So basically just testing and finding bugs in software.

Second Company:

It's essentially a no-name company a little bit outside of my city. It is an assurance company and has 0 reviews on glassdoor. (It does not even show up).

The position they want me to work is as a developer.

This is where my dilemma is. The second company's position seems very interesting as I essentially want to either be a Java/C# developer once I finish school therefore this would really be a nice step towards that goal.

However, the issue is that this company is entirely French. My French is fairly decent when speaking (the interviewer said he doesn't know why I put ""intermediate French"" on my CV) however writing it is pretty awful. They said their meetings are in French and all writing is in French, I can see myself getting lost a fair bit and probably wouldn't be able to discuss with co-workers as easily. I also write in French horribly, also have somewhat difficulty reading it.

The first company seems ideal in terms of environment, language, etc but I would only be testing software and I was told that these jobs don't really help furthering someone's ability to get development jobs.

So I'm unsure if I should go to a job where I'd feel more comfortable in and just test code or go to a company that is less known and where I'll be out of my comfort zone but have the ability to actually develop.

This is for Co-op where I will complete 3 internships during my degree. This is my first internship.

211,"I'm 27 years old. Due to both the fact I'm an idiot and the fact my family is extremely dysfunctional, I basically threw away the past 9 years of my life. I feel like a failure, powerless, and like I'm going nowhere.

I finished high school and started going to university in the worst possible moment: as soon as I started, I lost someone whom I loved very much to cancer. I have a gap of a few years in my memory. I drudged through university during that time, but as soon as I started to emerge from that weird limbo, my family decided to implode. I know I could have done more to keep up, but I just didn't have the strength to do it.

Things are not better now, but I am older, and I am exhausted. I'm thinking about giving up the path I'd picked after highschool, and starting over. Maybe getting rid of the emotional and literal baggage from the previous course I'd decided to study will help me function properly. The problem is that I'm terrified I will fail again. I'm terrified I'm overestimating myself, that I won't be able to achieve what I want anyway. I know from experience that the moment there's a lull in the usual bullshit my family pulls, I need to start worrying. 

I don't know what to do. The options I have are either to keep trudging through what I'm doing now, which would mean 8 exams and two more years of university after those, or start over by studying something I'm actually decent at for the next five years.

213,"Hey guys,

I'm   writing this in the dark of what appears to be a sleepless night..  Long  story short, I don't feel good in where i'm at in life right now.

I   don't really have a lot of friends, I have a few of course but not  that  many and my issue is that I don't manage well solitude.

I'm   currently studying in networks, I almost finished my two year   technological diploma, and next year i'll either go in a big city (2nd   largest of the country) in an alternating training with a   job in   optical fiber but half techninican half manager of some sort. I've been   accepted in the school and already have the job, did not sign the   contrat at this moment (I have until the 16th). This would get me away   from home, and I guess in a place with more people of my age (probably   in a student hotel \- not hotel but big building with lots of rooms with   students).  
The other option is that i'm waiting for another response   from another school in network security. I do not have a job in this   school yet but I can get one easily I think, either with the school or   by my brother who was working in one of the big companies. This would   mean living at least one more year in my parent's house, but also saving   all the money I would make that I don't spend.

Now that you have my two options, I'll get into my relationship.  
I've   been with a girl\[19f\] for a little more that 3 years now, with up and  downs  (and big downs). When we broke up at some point she went with  some other  dude (and tbh I still think about quite often), and I felt   uncomfortable with two other guys while in a relationship (she started   talking to them when our relationship was in a bad shape) to whom she   stopped talking with when I told her I was not really okay with it, even   though nothing was happening (they were talking as friends, but I   didn't like to see their name first thing in the morning and last thing   before going to sleep). Latest tging is that she started talking with   one of my childhood friends from another country, his mother recently   commited suicide and I'm really happy she could help him with that in a   way I couldn't, but I didn't know they were talking from either of them   and they got quite close (apparently they even got into a fight) but   thay'vre been talking for 5 days or so I heard. I admit that i'm quite   jealous, but not to the point I get aggressive or overprotective, but   yeah often i'm “right” in my feeling.

Now,   I havn't been perfect with her either since I cheated on her mentally   (never slept with the girl but I was telling her anything that I could   to hurt my gf, but I never though she'd find out). Recently, the   relationship was quite good but I can't manage to continue with this   burden on my shoulders.  
To quickly add to my family life, I was   abandoned by my father when I was around 15 and I live with my mom, step   dad and steo sister. She's been with us for two years only and she's   not rally the kindest or anything. My mom have a hard time dealing with   her, my parents fight a lot because of her, and she's the kind to  always  leave the shower dirty etc etc (we share a bathroom). Next year  she's  moving out.

Finally, when I told  you  earlier that I don't manage well solitude, as in that usually i'm  never  alone always with friends on discord or netflix, youtube etc.  Recently, I  lost one of my close friends (because of a girl haha..ha)  whith whom I  was playing with a lot, my best friend is really distant  because of  school and he can't play that much, my gf is always doing  her stuff and  we quite never speak on weekdays since I work a 8\-5  (finish at 12 on  friday), I feel that my childhood friend don't really  want to play after  a few tries (more to tell him that it's okay that  they talk if they  simply tell me) and now I don't even want to bother.  I'm then left with  no gamer friends, I don't like to play alone, I  don't really like to  spend family time hence I don't feel good and  don't know what to do.

\*\*tl;dr I don't feel good in any of my relationships and life in genral, don't know what to do in life\*\*

Today I had my last exam and she has hers too apparently. What chatted for a bit and she says she's probably going to get drunk after her exam, I said ""that's a shout lol"" not knowing what to reply with kind of hoping to kill the convo. She then replied with ""you can join me if u want"" again no idea how to reply so I just said ""maybe lol, I'm always down for a drink"" and she says she'll maybe message me later.

As you can tell I'm awkward as fuck and probably over thinking things and it probably is just drinks but still. Its just weird that we don't know each other at all. I'm really awkward with talking to people I don't know as well especially if there's just two of us. Thankfully there'll be drinks so maybe that'll help but I'm still panicking for some reason

Now I've finally gotten around to getting my licence but have no idea where to go. I work part-time but the people I work with are all women past their early 30s, so I have nothing in common with them.

225,"For my Meetup group I was going to do 18 to 26 year olds but after i asked on Facebook if there is a enough demand for my Meetup group which thankfully there is big demand for it and think it is a great idea but some of the people who is 27\-30 wanted me to change age limit to from 26 to 30 so they could go to my Meetups as well so after some thinking i changed it to 30 instead of 26.

But to be honest from right at the start the goal/aim of my Meetup group is for me to make new friends around my age(i'm 23) and get people who is around my age make new friends them self as well while doing really awesome and fun activities together, So i wanted my group to be around my age group 18 to 26 year olds as i am 23 years old and plus i would feel more comfortable with my people around age and would have more in common. if i did that age range.  :D :D

But if i did 18 to 26 year olds i might not get as many people to my Meetup group compared if i keep it to 18 to 30 year olds age range and i have found that most people who are between 26 to 30 are more mature/grown up and nicer/friendly then some of the people around my age(18\-26).  :\-\\

230,"(Trigger Warning - Rape, Abuse, Suicide) 

Long time lurker,  first time poster. Apologies in advance for the formatting, I am currently on mobile. 

As for my title,  those of you familar with Greek Mythology should know the story of Atlas,  the titan cursed to carry the sky/heaven on his shoulders. Anyhow,  onto why I'm posting. 

Through-out my life I've been the friend the others come to with their problems. From break-ups to mental health struggles,  I've weathered a storm or ten with my friends. Lately,  due to my own mental health I've slowly become overwhelmed with the weight of everyone's struggles. 

For reference and understanding,  I will detail a few of the most recent and most difficult struggles I bear. 

1. One of my cousins confided in me that he had planned to take his life on multiple ocassions, and I worry he will make such plans in the future. I spoke with his father about it, and have removed myself from the situtation,  but it had taken its toll on me. 

2. Another very close friend relies on me for a certain degree of emotional support. Without going into too much details,  during her childhood her parents were verbally abusive and this in turn caused her to develop multiple mental and physical health conditions,  including Depression and Severe Anxiety. She has expressed at times that she would like to cease existing,  but not in a suicidal way,  if that makes sense. 

3. A third close friend,  who is 14 as of writing this struggles with severe depression and anxiety. I am pretty much the only one she opens up to as she feels her parents wouldn't understand her feelings. I dated her older sister at one point (didn't work out sadly),  and while her parents are lovely people,  they don't understand mental illness. She has also exoressed a desire to cease existing as opposed to suicide. 

4. Perhaos the hardest,  and the most recent. This is where that trigger warning comes into play. A very dear friend confided her past to me,  warts and all. Included in her past were the multiple times she was raped,  which broke my heart. 

So yeah, trying to shoulder all these struggles has been really hard lately. Not to mention my own struggles with mental health and having lost my Great-Grandma approx. 1 month ago. We used to visit her every week,  and saw her at least twice a year until she passed at 98 years old. Add in a University degree and you can begin to imagine why my mental health tanked recently. 

The question I want to ask is what would you do? For those who had experience with loved ones having suicidal thoughts or having experienced abuse/rape, what did you do to help them? ",12Jun2018,2
231,"In April I went camping with my friends and housemates. On the way out I asked one of my friends to grab the red camping chair and the blue one. He grabbed my roommate's instead by accident who pointed it out. I apologized and was about to switch out but he said not to worry.
So we didnt. Went camping, had fun, and came back. The camping chairs got left in my friends car by accident. 
 I told the roommate and said I'd get it next time I saw him. He said no worries.
Fast forward a month and my boyfriend and I have moved out, and are unpacking. I spy 2 camping chairs, one ours, one my now former roommate's. 
I ask and find out the boyfriend had been given the chairs the last time he went over to our friend's  and thought they were both ours.
So I said no worries, we will take it to him next time we are over but until then we can use it a little since we only have those as seating options.
This morning I'm talkinIng  mtti mfriend. He had gone over to my former roommate's ti vosit, who informed him that he believed I had stolen his camping chair and lied about it being ar t s house at any point.The friend corrected him, and explained what happened, thinking it would satisfy him. Apparently former roommate now thinks my friend is trying to lie for me.
It's just a camping chair, and the only difference between mine, which is still there with the former roommate, and his, which is with us, is mine has my name airbrushed in it(it was a thank you gift). Otherwise, the exact same.

But what gets to me more is this former roommate of mine, we had lived together 3 years and any problems we had ever had we were able to talk through and work out or work on. This sudden change in his addressing of this situation has me somewhat baffled and admittedly angry.

I'm aware that people dont see all sides of a person, wi this could be a part of the former roommate I never saw, especially since we.had lived together for so long.

So, I guess the request is, how should I approach it? When we take back the chair not say anything, let bygones be bygones and move on? 
Or address the issue and try to sort things out.
I'm leaning towards the first, but it's been bothering me non stop to the point I sent even want to talk to him in any way outside of civil comversation.

But the thing is, I feel that he’s being deliberately putting on a facade so as to seek attention. Somehow he’s given me the impression that he’s manipulative but I can’t seem to pinpoint why. 

I’ve recommended him to seek therapy but he refuses. 

Some of his posts go along the lines of “ I want to die..... I want to slit my wrists... life is fucking pointless...”.

It’s almost as if he researched and mimicked the symptoms of depression.

249,"I am 18 years old. I'm not really a drug addict, I have done weed and taken hits from a wax pen a couple of times and I've noticed it's not really my cup of tea. For the first time, this Saturday, I decided to do LSD with a group of close friends for the sake of experimenting and trying something new. However, I did an extremely high dosage (3 tabs, 600ug) and came home really incompetent and sick to my stomach. Long story short, I ended up in the hospital after the ER and my mom called my good friend but he wouldn't really fess up but he was scared and doesn't have a good track record with moms. He drove me home and dropped me off but my mom thinks he had left me and I beg to differ since I know he did what he thought was best at the time. My other friend is moving up north so it doesn't matter to me that much but I hang out with the other two quite often and they've done nothing but help me whether it'd be relationship advice or any advice in general. Due to this ""LSD Overdose"" I am now gonna have to get a job to pay for my phone bill, no longer have a car and I am supposed to cut ties with these 3 friends of mine. I also lied to her about him not taking 3 tabs so she wouldn't rant about how he drove 3 people who were impaired while he was also impaired behind the wheel. My mom is a great mom but she has certain restrictions and I feel shackled sometimes so she suggested we go to therapy since our relationship is pretty much in shambles from this horrible experience. I feel remorseful and am going to try my best to make this go away but the thought of not being able to hang out with three of my close buddies because of a shitty situation that in my opinion, wasn't really their fault is ludicrous. She has a notion of that they're drug addicts and they're scumbags but they're really not and I don't want to hurt her anymore then I already have.

256,"To be fair, I've deleted a couple of them (e.g. facebook and okcupid) but I still maintain my snapchat, instagram, and tinder. I compulsively reach for my phone and browse (often times tinder) unti it occurs to me that I really don't want to be doing this and I stop (temporarily). It really does feel compulsive, though. It reminds me of my dad telling me he smokes cigarettes because it's like a ""filler"". Not using his hands for something for long periods of time makes him uncomfortable. That, and that his body's too addicted to *years* of heavy smoking. I wouldn't quite understand why he *has* to use his hands at all times. Recently, it occurred to me that I'm kind of doing the same thing with my phone and browsing. I'm acutely aware that I could utilize so much wasted time on learning more about myself and finding things I enjoy to do. Instead, I waste time looking (essentially infatuated) with the idea of swiping and meeting someone.

To note: I only have 400 followers / people I'm following on instagram, ~30 friends on snapchat, and a  *TON* of matches on tinder I don't respond to or have ceased to respond to. I swear, I'm not a jerk, I just can't seem to maintain conversation with most of my matches. I think tinder is making me extremely picky, too. My point about the lack of followers and such is to note that I don't even share much or contribute much, I just observe. It's become a habit I can't break. 

Some possibly relevant background info: I recently ended a 6 year on and off relationship. I'll spare the details but I spent the last couple of years browsing through tinder and (deleted) okcupid (while we were together). My ex spouse knew about it briefly (he didn't ask much about it and the couple of times he searched my account he saw it was harmless). I never cheated or anything, mostly just wanted to explore my options because I was severely unhappy (but I'd always just end up going back to him because I do love him -- its a long story).

All of this kinda started when I was younger but it's gotten worse over time, I think. Idk how much of my memory is biased lol. 

I made an appointment with a psychiatrist to get some unbiased opinions (sans medication). However, I just wanted to hear some anecdotal experiences and opinions, too. Couldn't hurt, right?

I'm a pretty rational person so please address me and my question as such.

In a few months he moves out of town for college but he's said how he doesn't know if he can go that long dealing with his mother. What can he do as a minor?

261,"So we were all evicted on short notice about two months ago, lived in a motel for a short spell, and then slept in the car after we couldn’t afford the motel. 

My mom kicked out my grandmother from the car due to noise reasons (my grandmother needed to pee in the middle of the night and my mom got angry) but she was able to stay at a hostel. 

Back then, I asked my grandmother if she’d like me to call the cops on my mother for elder abuse and neglect. She said a huge NO because authorities make things 10x worse. 

She was being helped by a young man there from Italy with food+money. Even though he paid for more time, the manager kicked her out on short notice. 

Now she’s sleeping outside. I offered to try to go to the police to look for women’s shelters, but my mother said my grandmother wouldn’t want that. I texted my grandmother and she didn’t respond. I’m super worried. I resent the fact that my mom kicked out my grandmother in the first place. I told her that I’d rather be kicked out of the car first since I’m an able bodied 17 year old who is much better suited to sleeping outside than a 77 year old woman. 

Should I just call the cops? Or should I just listen and not do anything. I feel horrible and I want her to be OK. ",12Jun2018,1
262,"For those who don't know: playstation plus is needed to play playstation games online. You also get free games every month, but are only able to play those games if you are a psplus member.

My subscription will end in July. It normally costs €59, but now costs €39. (Although it can be found for a price that low through the year if you look carefully)

The thing is though: I still need to finish the single player games I once bought. If I plan on doing just that, then I don't need psplus. I do however sometimes enjoy playing online, and I do play a few games that I got with psplus. But mostly those games just end up in my library cause I don't have the time to finish them. Not until the holidays start here (which will also be in July). On top of that, when I do enjoy a psplus game I tend to finish it or play it a lot, again stopping me from finishing the games I once bought.

I once read that you shouldn't see a backlog as games you need to play, but as opportunities to play those games if you want. So, having psplus and psplus games shouldn't stand in the way of me finishing my single player games.

It's a luxury problem, part of me wants to have my subscription expire and just see what will happen. I have plenty of games to keep me occupied, and at least will do so cause I can't go online. Part of me feels like this is a deal I shouldn't miss and is afraid that I'll miss the psplus games.",12Jun2018,0
263,"Hey guys,

I'm writing this in the dark of what appears to be a sleepless night.. Long story short, I don't feel good in where i'm at in life right now.

I don't really have a lot of friends, I have a few of course but not that many and my issue is that I don't manage well solitude.

I'm currently studying in networks, I almost finished my two year technological diploma, and next year i'll either go in a big city (2nd largest of the country) in an alternating training with a job in optical fiber but half techninican half manager of some sort. I've been accepted in the school and already have the job, did not sign the contrat at this moment (I have until the 16th). This would get me away from home, and I guess in a place with more people of my age (probably in a student hotel - not hotel but big building with lots of rooms with students).
The other option is that i'm waiting for another response from another school in network security. I do not have a job in this school yet but I can get one easily I think, either with the school or by my brother who was working in one of the big companies. This would mean living at least one more year in my parent's house, but also saving all the money I would make that I don't spend.

Now that you have my two options, I'll get into my relationship.
I've been with a girl[19f] for a little more that 3 years now, with up and downs (and big downs). When we broke up at some point she went with some other dude (and tbh I still think about quite often), and I felt uncomfortable with two other guys while in a relationship (she started talking to them when our relationship was in a bad shape) to whom she stopped talking with when I told her I was not really okay with it, even though nothing was happening (they were talking as friends, but I didn't like to see their name first thing in the morning and last thing before going to sleep). Latest tging is that she started talking with one of my childhood friends from another country, his mother recently commited suicide and I'm really happy she could help him with that in a way I couldn't, but I didn't know they were talking from either of them and they got quite close (apparently they even got into a fight) but thay'vre been talking for 5 days or so I heard. I admit that i'm quite jealous, but not to the point I get aggressive or overprotective, but yeah often i'm “right” in my feeling.

Now, I havn't been perfect with her either since I cheated on her mentally (never slept with the girl but I was telling her anything that I could to hurt my gf, but I never though she'd find out). Recently, the relationship was quite good but I can't manage to continue with this burden on my shoulders.
To quickly add to my family life, I was abandoned by my father when I was around 15 and I live with my mom, step dad and steo sister. She's been with us for two years only and she's not rally the kindest or anything. My mom have a hard time dealing with her, my parents fight a lot because of her, and she's the kind to always leave the shower dirty etc etc (we share a bathroom). Next year she's moving out.

Finally, when I told you earlier that I don't manage well solitude, as in that usually i'm never alone always with friends on discord or netflix, youtube etc. Recently, I lost one of my close friends (because of a girl haha..ha) whith whom I was playing with a lot, my best friend is really distant because of school and he can't play that much, my gf is always doing her stuff and we quite never speak on weekdays since I work a 8-5 (finish at 12 on friday), I feel that my childhood friend don't really want to play after a few tries (more to tell him that it's okay that they talk if they simply tell me) and now I don't even want to bother. I'm then left with no gamer friends, I don't like to play alone, I don't really like to spend family time hence I don't feel good and don't know what to do.

**tl;dr I don't feel good in any of my relationships and life in genral, don't know what to do in life**

271,"My dad has never been the best dad. I remember a period where I really hated him and wanted to punch him and stuff. My parents have been separated for a while now, but my entire family lives together. My mom has been sleeping on the couch for almost 5 years. We even moved to a new continent almost two years ago. They fight everyday. Frankly, I don't even understand this situation myself.

It seems the more my dad ages, the more childish he gets. I am 19, and while I consider myself to still very much be a child, I'm more of an adult than him. He spends his days watching youtube, playing video games, and taking naps, and complaining about the littlest things. He's bipolar and is probably in the middle of a depressive episode at the moment, but he's like this even when he's not. He asks questions like ""do you think I've eaten enough"" and can't wash a spoon when he needs one. He always imagines the worst case scenario for everything. Living with him is exhausting. He's like a leech, he sucks out the entire family's energy.

Since he and my mom fight a lot, he comes crying (a lot of the time literally) to me, saying that she's mean and all. He begs me to try to tell her to be nicest, basically treats me like a marriage therapist. I told him to stop, but he doesn't listen.

He's made 3 suicide attempts in these past months. My mom at first dismissed him and even told him to go ahead and kill himself (she's just completely exhausted, which explains but does not justify her behavior), so he came and cried to me about it. It was very triggering to me, as I also have depression. I've had to call the ambulance on his first attempt because my mom was rather apathetic. His third attempt was the most serious, and I was home alone. I just went on autopilot and called an ambulance again. At the moment, he's still at the hospital.

My mom was extremely upset with it since I had to see him laying in his blood and told me that he wouldn't set foot again in the house, which was relieving to me. I've been wanting for them to separate for very long. But I knew that it would most likely never happen. No matter how much my mom yells at my dad, she's still an enabler. She enables him to continue living the way he does. She buys his alcohol, works to keep the family afloat, probably gives him money so he can buy his weed, and cooks for him. I understand why she does it. Otherwise he complains and it's awful. But the problem is he knows he can get anything he wants. So my mom went from wanting to do nothing with him to visiting him at the hospital everyday and bringing him dinner because he doesn't want to eat the hospital food. She told him neither her, me, or my sister wanted him back in the house. He said he'd try killing himself again if he didn't have us.

I don't think this is blackmail. But he's already tried killing himself three times when he was with us (including one time we were hosting an exchange student). At this point, I don't know what to do anymore. I know he's in a lot of pain, but it's not fair for us to have to deal with all this.

On August 9th 2017 I had a therapy appointment around 3:30pm. For personal reasons, I no longer wanted to see that therapist again. So I went home, did some contemplating, and called the office. It was after 5, so I left a voicemail. I said I would like to cancel all other existing appointments. Never heard from them again, in fact, I never even got text reminders of my appointments. Also, I only had therapy once a week, so it was more than enough time to cancel.

Fast forward to a month ago. I saw my therapist at my work. She asked me why I stopped coming and I told her that I didn’t need her assistance anymore (even though that wasn’t the reason). She went on to say she misses me etc. I wish her well, and off she went. Well, two weeks ago, I received an email in my patient portal stating that I owed $65.00. On the bill, it didn’t have a due date, or a reason. So I called to inquire why I owed money, and why an entire YEAR later they decide to bill me. The receptionist was really nasty with me, saying that when it has no reason it means I missed an appointment and that she’d make a note and send it to billing. I agreed that it was a good option and we hung up. 

Today I called to inquire about my bill again, but she got even more nasty with me telling me billing would definitely call me back. I haven’t heard anything and I really just want to dispute this. I have text messages of my husband and I talking about it back and forth, me stating I was going to cancel, and phone records of me calling that same night. The only thing I do not have is access to the billing departments personnel. 

Please help, I have so much anxiety over this stupid bill. I don’t know who to call or what to do. The lady is so rude, and it doesn’t help my mental illness.

I'm in retail on a checkout at the moment. I was on the Fresh department(all fridge products aswell as bread and cakes) but was moved.

I hate being on a checkout. I like to keep busy on my feet,plus I'm not exactly a people person so checkouts a struggle everyday. 

When I was on Fresh I did alot more than just shelf stacking. Also promo changes,Stock counts,Gaps scans,Date checks.
There was alot to it and I did enjoy coming in,even did split shifts(6am-10am and 6pm-10pm),it exhausted me but I got the job done and felt good about myself since I was able to provide for my future wife and daughter.

Plus Im only contracted 15 hours a week,I really want to be doing atleast 25/30 a week.

So ofcourse I have been trying to get transfered back to Fresh. After 3 months and nothing happening Im getting fed up.

Game design and the mechanics of gameplay
Card games
Computer coding but never really learnt much

280,"I have an apprenticeship at a really big engineering company starting in september, and it was a huge opportunity to get it. It was narrowed down from something like 120,000 applicants, to a final 42 that actually got the placements, and everyone in my family was really proud and I was happy for myself.   


But I recently got out of a bad relationship and now I've taken a step back to reevaluate what I want to do, and I don't think I want the place anymore, it's 4 years long and I get an engineering degree at the end of it, and it pays well, but I don't like the idea of working there, I'm only really doing it because it's what everyone else wanted me to do.

282,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I don't know where else to turn to.
Just for some background information, I'm a 21 year old guy who is just finishing their bachelors degree  and I'm moving back to my home town near London in a few months to start an ""exciting job"". I've always been very insecure in terms of my appearance and relationships which is what makes this so difficult.
I started seeing my ex just over a year ago, and it was clear from the offset that it was a complicated relationship: we lived together for a few months before finally hooking up and because i was so ecstatic that finally someone liked me that i overlooked the obvious flaws .
My ex was a complicated person to say the least : without getting into it she had severe issues with insecurity and alcohol , frequently causing me severe embarrassment whilst we were together , and she has some stories from her past that would make a normal persons skin crawl ( mainly to do with drunken, irresponsible behavior.)  Even in my current misery I can honestly say that our relationship was toxic and not long term , but I still cannot get over it ending.
There were several points over the last year where I had attempted to break it off due to her behavior but always found myself going back on it, to my shame, due to my intense feelings for her and my own feelings of inadequacy . This came to a head last week when i admitted to her that i was no longer sure if i loved her anymore , which she took very hard, but it took her a week before she had finally had enough of my several attempts to end things, and she broke up with me.
I can hold up my hands and admit that at times I had behaved atrociously towards her due to her upsetting , but ultimately accidental behavior. ( She would cause some incident by accident due to her drinking and then I would treat her as though i hated her and that our relationship was a joke.)
The last few days have been by far the worst in my entire life and I honestly hate myself for both my tolerance of her behaviour, and my cruel comments towards her when I was either upset with her or in a foul mood.
Even though our relationship was toxic and made me feel shit a lot of the time, I honestly cannot put into words how awful and depressed I feel now .
I keep telling myself that I didn't want to carry on the relationship, and that it would not have been able to continue once i moved to London anyway , and that I will one day meet someone who i feel the same way for but without the baggage  but I honestly cannot believe it.
Despite implying to her several times that she means nothing to me I cannot move on . I haven't been eating and can barely go 5 second without welling up in tears .
She has made it clear that she has no interest in continuing the relationship ( I attempted to arrange a meeting with her to get her back but she pulled out at the last minute saying it was too painful) because even though she cared for me she could not deal with how up and down my feelings were towards her , and that I deserved someone who wouldn't make me feel so bad regarding her own past and continuous embarrassing behavior .
My friends and family insist that it is for the best and that I should look forward to my new job, think about the unlikelihood of the relationship being long term due to our inherent differences and goals in life and try to look to the future but I physically cannot.
I was not happy for much of the relationship but could never bring myself to end it and now I'm suffering the consequences .
I don't think I will ever meet someone again who cared for me the way she did , and despite her flaws she does indeed deserve someone who will love her regardless of her flaws and celebrate their relationship instead of being ashamed of it like I was ( she was always very upset by the fact that I didn't include her in my life , or post pictures with her on social media, or even really acknowledge our relationship).
I am honestly lost right now: I think i will never be able to meet someone again and whilst I couldn't see a future with her before now i cant imagine a future without her .
I know I'm a shit person for treating her so badly, and I deserve being dumped  due to the fact I asked for it in so many different ways . The future seems so bleak , and whilst I could never bring myself to commit suicide, I just wish i had never been born .
Im not sure what i hoped to achieve by posting here, and it probably seems pathetic and immature but does anyone have any advice on what might help me get out of my current despair and attempt to be more optimistic regarding my future ?

291,"I can explain.

This story might be a little strange, so I apologize in advance. Let's begin with some background. My name is Euphoria and I'm a freshman in high school.

 I transferred to a different high school in my district in mid\-March for reasons I'd rather not disclose. A few days to a week after I started going to the school, I met a boy. Let's call him Todd. Todd is a Junior or Senior (it's unclear, because my school doesn't really go by year, more by upperclassmen and lowerclassmen, it's complicated and stupid). I wanna say he's around 5'8 and is a little round with a scruffy beard growing in. He usually looks really disheveled and messy. He kinda looks homeless, even though he has a lot of money and a job from what I know. Anyways, we talked for only HALF A DAY before he gave me his number. We texted back and forth for a while. Then he began spamming me with messages. I'd go away for five minutes to do something and come back with 10\+ messages on my phone, all from him. The next day he asked me out on a date. I reluctantly agreed; I don't like men, but I didn't want to be labeled a bitch on my second day. He began spamming more messages once I got home to plan everything. I was getting irritated really quickly, because he was being an absolute fucking creep. I asked him why he wanted to take me out so bad, and I got a reply I should have expected; He had feelings for me. This made me extremely uncomfortable because he only met me yesterday. It took me 6 tries to tell him I wasn't interested, because he kept pushing me. I eventually put my foot down and told him to stop, and that we could be friends if he wanted, but he replied with an ominous ""if you won't love me, then I don't want to be friends"". This scared the shit out of me. I blocked his number the second I could. 

The next couple days, I didn't see him in school. In fact, I don't think he had shown up for school in a few months. I don't remember seeing him at all. This whole thing only started recently, so maybe he was in school and I just didn't notice or care enough to notice him. Me and my sister in law spent a lot of time simply making fun of him and how much of a Nice Guy he was. 

When I finally found out he was back, I kept feeling as if someone was watching me. Like, I'm pretty sure everyone knows that feeling. That's when I began catching him staring at me... At first when I'd catch him and look over, his eyes would dart away from me, to some other spot in the room. Over time, though, he stopped doing that. I'd give him a look, and he'd stare back at me with a blank expression. It began to creep me the fuck out, but I just dismissed it as him trying to bug me. I didn't think anything serious would become of any of this. That is until... He transferred into my classes. All my classes. It was mind\-boggling. Somehow he was in all of my classes besides math and study hall. He sat very close to me in all of the classes as well. In English he sat right next to me until I begged my teacher to switch my seat to the other side of the room. That victory didn't last very long though, because his spot was moved two seats away from me 3 days later.

I know what you're thinking; She's being dramatic. But it gets worse. He would follow me in the hallways; Not even just to the classes we share, to my study hall, math, hell, I think he even followed me to the bathroom once. He always kept a distance though, as if he didn't want me to see him. But I'd catch him sometimes; and he'd stare... He also recently began sitting at my lunch table, kicking one of my friends out of his seat. He never spoke, he'd just sit and watch me eat... It was extremely uncomfortable. 

I wish that was the end of it. I really do. He drives a car, an old beat up Mustang in a sandy\-tan color. I wish I was kidding when I say I've caught him slowly driving by my house in the middle of the night. I have insomnia, and my parents haven't taken me to a doctor or gotten me any medication for it, so I've been staying up past 3 in the morning lately. Some nights the road outside my little house will light up, and I'll watch the sandy\-tan mustang slowly drive by, then speed back up after it passes. My street is very quiet. People rarely drive down it.

292,"One of my best friends (let’s call him Kevin), suffers from severe BPD, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. His life has been hard, and we’ve bonded a lot through our similar family troubles. He’s been abused, raped as a child, his parents are drug addicts, and he’s basically the breadwinner of the house and caretaker of his young brother. He’s never really had a real group of friends. At some point they’ve all left him, he’s had a bad history with girlfriends (and we used to date and it didn’t end so pretty), and his adult life is nothing but work, video games, and reddit.

I need help because he is very unstable and I don’t know what to do about it. Over the time we’ve been friends/dated, I’ve exhausted every word of support, every idea to help (such as therapy, meetups, meeting with a psychologist for new meds, etc) and nothing helps. He’s constantly on the verge of self harm or suicide, and he’s very verbally abusive at-least once a week. He also gets sad anytime I choose to hang out with my fiancé instead of him (and me and my fiancé are in an LDR atm due to university). He’s even threatened sending my fiancé my nudes, even though he doesn’t really mean it (or even has them as I found out later) and it’s the BPD, it’s scary and stressful every time he cusses me out. Even while together he was abusive and he realizes that and hates it, making him MORE suicidal. He’s like this because he’s sick of loneliness, but he’s had bad luck with in person meetups and stuff like r4r. I’ve even seen his chatlogs and they just ghost him out of nowhere and it really fucks with him mentally. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore and being his only support/friend/person that keeps him from being alone is taking a toll on my own depression and anxiety. He’s a great person outside of this, and I don’t want to be one of the people who just leave him. Besides, I'd miss him. He’s not manipulating me, it’s literally his mental illnesses taking a toll on our friendships, but nothing helps those mental illnesses. What do I do about this? I don’t want him to die but I just can’t find a way to help anymore.

293,"Hi, I'm a young man, living in a 3th world country, recently I found out that me, my father and couple of friends have different point of views on the politics problems.

297,"I will be attending TCU this Fall as an incoming Freshman. I am originally going in as a pre-business major in the Neeley School of Business, but I'm thinking about changing to Finance. The problem is that I have this inkling of ""I want to do STEM,"" but I don't particularly excel in that area. By excel, I don't mean I'm God-awful at it, I just have to work harder than others. This probably sounds dumb, but I still have this dream of working with the ocean (I've heard the Marine Biology is a pipeline dream jist etc etc, but still). Being a Lawyer is something I want to do as well and Finance would probably fit better with that dream. However, if I wanted to do anything STEM related, I'd probably major in Chemistry.

300,"So at the beginning of this year my (24f) bf (30m) had an opportunity to move to a new county for a job opportunity. We were living together at the time and have been together for two years. We talked about it in depth and I decided to go with him. I left my job, family and friends behind.


One of the issues was that I cannot work in this country as we are not married. I can go for 6 months at a time as his partner. We/I knew this would be difficult but I didn't realise how difficult! I have looked into volunteering but there isn't a lot around where we are. My bf thinks I'm not looking/trying hard enough to keep myself occupied, but we both knew the deal before we moved.


We talk about getting married. Maybe in a year. He just wants go and get the peice of paper signed, I've said I think  I deserve a little more than that. Maybe the two of us going on holiday and tying the knot - I want it to still be a special day. I'm always joking that we're not even engaged yet - considering we are probably going to get married in the next 12 months, it would be nice! But he shows no signs of wanting to ask me.
Sometimes I feel after all I've done for him I deserve it, but maybe that's unfair of me.


He promised after moving and me being on my own most of the day, we would get a dog. We both love them and haven't been able to get one together before. Now we argue about this everyday. He only likes one breed, he only wants one colour - he's so fussy and will not compromise. He says I just want one for company, which is half true. He's backtracking now saying its too much hassle etc. Its breaking my heart. I know it sounds stupid but it would give me a reason to get up every morning and get out of the house! He thinks I should just go for a walk on my own everyday instead! 

I just know, due his lack of Ability to compromise, that we are not going to get one. Its heartbreaking for me. 

He's also trying to get me to be friends with a girl he knew from 3 years ago. It's obvious they hooked up but he won't admit it. I have asked several times as I don't want to feel like a fool but he says they were just friends. Anyway, I know he likes her, she is very pretty and cool and adventurous, not like me! He's arranging for us to hang out and become friends. She is really nice but they Snapchat each other all the time and it makes me feel uncomfortable and foolish. Maybe I'm being paranoid and too sensitive. 

I am heading home in 4 months time and I'm seriously questioning whether I'm done and should stay home. In arguments I've said this to him and he just says 'fine if that's what you want!' I know he means that too and would totally watch me walk away. He says what would be the point in trying to change my mind?! 
Maybe he doesn't love me anymore? 
What should I do? Should I wait it out and hope  it gets easier?

I finished university last year and I'm a bit worried that its been a year and I've done nothing to contribute to my life, I have few interests and even fewer hobbies.

I feel so lethargic, dumb and just uninterested with everything and its really getting me down that all my friends are starting their careers and moved out of their family home and I'm just stagnant. I get very moody and irritated quickly with anything, I really want to be happy but that place just feels so far away and intangible.

Ever since I began uni, I have had major issues managing my money, not helped by a £1500 0&amp;#37; overdraft that was available. I have two bank accounts; the aforementioned student account with Santander and an ISA with Nationwide. The ISA previously had £5700 in it, but I have had to use money from there to help moderate my other account. This money was saved for me to use in the future, to buy a house etc and not on things like this. My family have made it clear that I was not meant to use this money, but I have. As of now, the Santander account has \-£280 in it, and the ISA has £4844 in it. **This means my current debt is roughly £1500.**  


My parents are the source of all of my income, providing me with money each week for university. Due to them being the source, they sometimes ask me how I am doing with my finances, to which i've always answered that they're okay. This is clearly a lie, and the guilt and stress of the debt i have accumulated is reaching breaking point.   


Originally, my idea was to hide the debt from my parents until i was working, where id be able to repay the debt in monthly installments and get back out of the overdraft, which i would then close to avoid such situations from happening again. However, I dont think I can go on like this much longer, so what do you think I should do? Should i come clean about it, explain my plan for becoming buoyant again, or what?

308,"My past senior year of high school, I was mentored by a retired professor from a local university. He taught me a lot, and I am grateful for the time and energy he spent helping me out. The trouble began sometime earlier in May. 
There was an academic conference that we had both agreed we were going to. My mom bought the plane ticket, and I sent him the invoice to show I’d paid. No biggie. The conference fee could be paid the day before the conference, so my mom decided she’d do that. Conference time rolls around, and one of my mom’s closest friends (and a family friend) suffers an aneurysm and stroke. Because my mother was planning to travel with me, I was rendered unable to attend the conference, which I told him the night before. 
All was good after that, or so I thought. He follows up with me the week after the conference, and asks me if there’s something I’m not telling him. Huh? I ask him what he means, and he asks if I ever even intended on attending the conference. Confused, I assure him that yes, I did intend to go to the conference, but because of what’d happened with my mother’s friend, I couldn’t go, and that my mom actually LOST money by canceling the flight. I send him the receipt for the plane ticket again, just to prove that I did indeed purchase it. To my knowledge then, the conference fee had been paid.  Some time passes, and then today I found out that he reached out to the board of directors of the society sponsoring the conference, who confirmed that I was not registered. He then tells me that it’s apparent I’d been “leading him on” all these months, and that he couldn’t accept such deception. He then told me that he could no longer offer me mentoring, and good luck with my future endeavors. 
I was both shocked and hurt by his words. Shocked at his level of interest in my attending a simple conference and apparent disbelief of my reason for not attending, and hurt because he’d think I’d lie to him. This sort of overbearing personality is not atypical of him, and I would just like to leave this whole thing behind me.  The trouble is, he’s a retired professor, and I’m afraid he’ll hurt my academic career at a later date. Am I worrying for nothing? I’m not sure how to proceed with this, as he’s not spoken with me  further since his last comments. ",12Jun2018,1
309,"Long story short, I think I am a major depressive.

I'm 17, and I'm aware that most teens tend to exaggerate their issues - I'm guilty of it too. But today I had a serious panic attack after a confrontation with my step-mom about how I'm not putting enough effort into my life.

After she left and I was home alone,  I started crying and screaming uncontrollably, I ended up on the floor with my head between my arms, I broke a cabinet with my knee when I hit it out of frustration. I also have a tendency to scratch and hit myself when I get really upset, I left scratch marks across my shoulders (http://imgur.com/gallery/cXpH8jc they're a little brighter in-person).

I don't know who to go to for help. My mom is out of the question, she is a drug addict who lives a few states away. My dad can be pretty mean, and I think he'll just think I'm being a wimp if I try to tell him I'm depressed.

I have been on every single SSRI/SSNRI known to man, go ahead name one, I was on it.

Now at first we all got along great and her and I were over there several times a week to hangout and eventually she started dating Joe. I didn’t start dating Harry until a little while after as I had another relationship at the time that was nearing its end, had been failing for awhile, not that important.

He would tell my best friend to her face that “he hated  me” and “seeing her is the worst part of my day.” This all came out of absolutely nowhere. He continued to constantly degrade me and put me down to my friends and boyfriends faces. Eventually my boyfriend stood up to him while my friend did nothing.

320,"Before I begin you need to know that I have a therapist who helps me cope with social anxiety and ADD.  

I like my therapist. She likes me, she tells me I’m easy to talk to and I’m a very kind and giving girl. She has this image in her head that I’m something like a saint, someone of pure innocence and light. This is important, because I want you to take into consideration what she thinks of me before I talk about the thing I’m debating bring up to her, because I don’t want this image of me to be ruined. 

Whoever is reading this, I’m scared of myself. I’m scared of myself because my thoughts like to wander a lot, and sometimes they get way to far. By that I mean they get dark and gruesome. 

(Skip the example if you’re squeamish) 
Here’s an example:
Sometimes I think about hurting others. Specifically, I wonder how it would feel like. To tackle someone on the ground, to feel their heart pound as I look them in the eye. To feel their harsh breaths brush up onto my skin. To hear their cries for help that tear their throats as their screams slice through the nearly silent air. I’m curious if death looks like how it does in the movies. I’m curious about how much trouble I could get in if I’m caught, or if I’m smart enough to get away with murdering. I’m curious as to who I’d chose my victim to be. Would I crack after awhile if I’m not caught at first? Would I feel guilty? 

(Example over)
I don’t want to think like that, it scares me. In my heart I know I would never hurt someone.. But what if curiosity overturns my innocent heart? I mean if curiously killed the cat, who would the cat really be in that situation? I don’t want to know, it makes me sick. I don’t want to think things like this anymore. I want to stop it, because I don’t want to hurt people. If I bring it up to my therapist, will she not think of me the same though? Will she be scared of me? I’m scared of me, that’s for sure. I wouldn’t blame her.  But I don’t want to scare her, I don’t want to be a kid she has to be careful of because they feel dangerous.

So the question is, what do I do?

Do I tell her and possibly turn off the illusion of a halo?

Or do I figure this out myself and potentially end up hurting someone if I can’t sort this out in time?

325,"So, a few months ago, it was revealed that, over a long period of time (she claims 12 years), my mom used all of my and my brother's savings. As we deposited it, she used it. It was all money that my brother and I had earned by working, so the money was not hers to use; however, the accounts were opened while we were minors, so her name was on both. What she did was not illegal, and I have no reason to suspect that she used the money on gambling, drugs, or anything dangerous. I think she spent it on maintaining the appearance of our family being financially okay despite my dad frequently being laid off and her health keeping her from working. Not knowing what money was coming in, I assumed she did a good job of saving and preparing since these things were not unexpected. 

While I know that we should have been closely monitoring our savings accounts, my mother did an excellent job of manipulating it so that we did not. She always had some reason for why I couldn't access my account online (""it's a small bank so they don't have that,"" and then later ""you have to come in to set it up"" when I work all of their hours). There were times I should have been suspicious, but she's my mother, and I felt like I could trust her. She would always give me a total if I asked for the balance. She did all of the banking for my dad, so I'd just give her mine as well. My brother did the same. She is off of our accounts now, and I am closely monitoring my savings. I already was monitoring my credit score and my debit account. Those are in good standing.

We only found this all out when my brother was getting ready to put an offer on a house. My mother told him, my dad (who had no idea), and my grandparents in front of the realtor. She also threatened to kill herself for the life insurance to pay us back. It was a very tense, messy situation for the first couple of weeks. It's still a mess, but things are more normalized now. My brother, with help, was still able to purchase the house. We made some plans on how my parents would pay us back (my dad is insistent upon it). Most of these plans fell through or did not work out as they seemed they would. My mom agreed to go to counseling but has only gone once.

All told, my brother and I are out roughly $80,000, split about evenly. Starting this month, my dad is now retired. He has a pension and an annuity that start to pay out this month. He's 55, so he plans to keep working. His body can't handle construction any longer though. 

While it has generally been accepted that June would be when we start to get paid back, the plan has not been set. My brother does not know that he won't be getting a lump sum of money this month. My dad had previously floated the idea of taking out a home equity loan to pay him back and then just working to pay off the home equity loan instead. I know that it isn't happening, and I've suggested it might not to my brother, but in an effort to keep things civil while some other things were going on, it was never made concrete. I think that he expects it won't happen though.

So, my brother is coming over today (I live with my parents still) with the intention of sitting down with them and coming up with a plan to pay us back. They do not know that he intends on getting this done today. I contemplated telling them, but my mom is still an emotional headcase with a lot of anxiety, and I know she'd find a way to avoid it or explain her way out of it. I don't want to give her time to come up with reasons to delay anymore.

So, I guess the advice I'm asking for is what to say in this conversation and how to plan/schedule getting paid back? I am mostly concerned with my brother getting paid back since he now has a house and the expenses that come with it, but this is all really screwing me as well. I also want to make sure my mom goes to therapy. It is not acceptable to me that she hasn't. My family feels the same.

Do I need to come up with a contract? If so, any advice on constructing one?",12Jun2018,12
326,"So just to frame it a little, I got him a gift last year, and it was literally thrown in the garbage because he didn't realize it was a fathers day gift. It was like a 70$ fountain pen with his name engraved on a solid wood case. I guess that's my bad for assuming that he would realize its a fathers day gift since it arrived on/near fathers day.

To top it off, I didn't even get so much as an acknowledgement when my birthday/christmas passed months ago, but tbh it doesn't bother me too much.

What bothers me most is I moved out of state to help him by working for his company, I've had a stellar performance in the words of everyone I worked with aside from him, and yet the 1 year pay raise discussed in phone conversations to convince me to move out here now seem to be not only off the table, but ridiculous and offensive notion that I would even bring the subject up.

Basically I think he's a shitbag.

But out of reflex I ordered a fathers day gift a few days ago and it's already in the mail, a Panasonic shaver and travel case... But I've been using the same old dirty used disposable razor blade for like 4 months, so the thought dawned on me, I should just keep it for myself and not get a fathers day gift... But another part of me thinks that is petty and giving gifts isn't about what you get in return or how much you liked the person recently... I'm conflicted.

To add to this, I just spoke with my sister.  After getting this bill, they decided they wanted to leave the hospital.

One girl seemed to stop speaking to me or would be curt when I would try to engage in conversation. I was involved in group texts and whenever I would pose a question or suggest that we go dancing, pretty much everyone ignored me. Then one summer, the girls had an intervention with me because they felt that I had an eating disorder. I went to the doctor to prove everything was alright and even brought along a friend to confirm my diagnosis and no one ever apologized or said they were happy I was alright. The final straw was when one of them lashed out because I gaged on the rice pudding she made for a party and while I tried to sincerely apologize, she never forgave me. Because of this, I made a decision to quietly leave the group texts and keep a low profile but I only made things worse. I was accused of ghosting everyone and one girl uninvited me from her wedding but I only found out when I noticed that I hadn't received a ""Save The Date"" card and the wedding date grew nearer. I even offered to meet with one of the girls, after she texted me, in person to finally come out and explain what went wrong but she declined my invitation and recently had a baby, so she has her hands full.

This is so difficult on me because all I wanted was some close girlfriends and I know I'm not perfect and maybe I should have come out and said what wrong but I just felt pushed out.

336,"Get ready for a long winded plea for advice, something that I've been struggling with for the past few years... (TLDR at the bottom). 

I am a 20 year old college student. I am also the son of two illegal immigrants from Mexico, who have at most a 7th grade education.

I am at the age where I must decide which career path I want to pursue. The problem with this however, is that I am forced to be successful. I don't place a lot of value on money; I understand it's importance in life, but as I've told my parents, if it were up to me, I'd study philosophy for the rest of my life. It's also important to note that because of my parents' immigration status, as well as other reasons, I am not able to receive financial aid, and am paying entirely out of pocket for school (which is no problem, I go to a CC and haven't had to take out any loans). 


So here I am, paying out of pocket for school to receive a degree that I don't want (marketing). I've decided that career wise, my best bet is to join the police force in my city, as they pay 6 figures after 5 years, and have great pension and benefit plans. 
(The marketing degree is a backup incase law enforcement doesn't workout, still something I'm not interested in, but forced to go into for money).

I'm not too excited for this. I don't want to spend 22 years in the same city for 5 days a week, 8.5 hours a day, with a mere 3 weeks a year to myself. I cannot begin to fathom how much of my life will be thrown away working a job I don't care for. I hate the idea of a job defining my life.

Here's where my parents' immigration status come into play. They're nearing 50, and their plan is to ""retire"" in Mexico. Because of their status, they aren't able to buy a home in the States, couldn't open retirement accounts etc. Neither has a retirement fund. They both have a few thousand in savings, no more than 20K each.

It's also important to note that my parents have had a toxic relationship for the past 20 years, and have only stayed together for the children (stupidest fucking thing, I know), and have erected their own respective small houses in what little plot of land they individually own in their country. Meaning, they won't be pooling their wealth, meaning they both will have to rely on me instead of each other.

My fathers plan is to open a butcher shop in the poor, rural town that he's from.

My mother's plan is to open a hair salon in the poor, rural town that she is from. 

They also plan on taking my 9 year old sister, who will be in her teens when they decide to leave.
(TL;DR)
So, herein lies the problem:
For the rest of my life, I will be forced to work a job (that I don't want) that provides financial security so that I can support both of my parents, who's ideas for retirement will undoubtedly fail. 

Even if they don't fail, I still have a younger sibling to care for, as I will refuse to let these people take her to a shit hole third world country, only to receive the same opportunities they did. 

What should I do? It's not like I can tell them tough luck, and to apply for gov't assistance; their government is non existent, and if I left them on their own, they'd literally starve to death. I've already had a talk with them, chastising them for their life decisions. They agreed to my conclusions, and didn't contest to fact that I will be forced to provide them with financial support for the rest of their lives. I asked for insight from  a friend of mine (a white American) who's a few years older than my parents, and his response was, ""Don't they have social security in Mexico?""

Yep. There it is. My life is burdened by two helpless parents, who, although tried their hardest to provide me with what they could, weren't able to do much. 

What do I do?

338,"Full blow tears. The entire gasworks. I haven't cried like that since I was a little kid and though I never reached out to anyone, I need help please.

So here is my small story: I'm 23 years old. I have just graduated university with zero debt. I am fairly good looking. I'd like to believe that I am smart. I come from a very emotionally handicapped family, all loving though. I have great friends. I live on my own. I have a decent job. Suffice to say I have a pretty neat life. I don't have any worries except the bs I create myself. Really I have so much going for me and it is makes me sad that I can't see all of it. All I can focus are my weaknesses, which are all mental.

I'm mentally weak. I was crying last night because I was contemplating suicide for the entirety of it. I know I'm never going to do it. I'm too weak and scared to ever go through with it and the mental image of my mother's distraught face is enough for me to never go through with it. But nonetheless even with everything I have going for me, I'm mentally weak. I can't think of one instance in my life where I actually put up effort to trying anything. School was a damn breeze. I was handed everything I've ever wanted. If anything proved just a little bit hard, I ditched it in favor of something much easier and that brings us to last night. I was with a group of friends last night. 11 people. All fun and smiles around me. I don't think I ever hated myself more than I did in that moment. All I kept thinking about was how much of a weakling I am for not even trying to reciprocate any conversation back. I was sitting next to these two girls I met a couple of nights ago and they were full blown flirting with me. Here is the thing. When I'm in the mood, like I was a couple of nights ago, I can easily hold any conversation, but when I'm not in the mood, I become like a turtle, I hide within myself. So I just sat there and wished I was somewhere else the entire time. I don't think I've ever hated myself more than I did in that moment. So quiet and low energy.

I'm terrified of failing. I'm terrified of seeing the look of shame and anger that comes whenever I fail at anything and this is largely due in part to how I was raised. Failure was never an option. If you didn't succeed in my household, you were beaten or shamed. The logical/rational part of my brain recognizes that failing is part of life and that to get to success, one must fail a lot.

At the moment, I'm just empty. I understand that the world owes me nothing, and I should just man up, and stop being a little bitch, but I've tried that over and over and over again. Just in pain right now, and would appreciate any advice I get. I believe one hundred that I can achieve anything I want in this world but I can't seem to get out of my own way.

I just don't really know what to do anymore. I don't know what is wrong with me, and I can't afford to go to a psychiatrist at the moment. ",12Jun2018,3

340,"Background: went to school for architecture and project management. On my fourth coop I worked on a nuclear refurb project on the engineer, procure, construct side. Boss was so great, let’s call them Tim, and really motivated me and made me feel empowered in my capabilities. Went back to school for 8 months and return to same company/project but doing a different role under a different boss. Did this for 7 months and was unhappy (didn’t feel utilized in my coordinator and skills from school). I switched over to Tim’s team but doing a different role now as he manages two groups now. I’ve been doing the role for about 3 months now. Tim is constantly busy managing between the two groups and hardly notices if I’m not up to much work. Tim is such a great role model and so talented but that can only go so far on my happiness and level of fulfillment in my job.

A couple factors to consider here are as follows, 
- this project is a complete disaster and such challenging work (don’t feel fulfilled much)
- it’s out of my background/education 
- my commute is 85km each way (long story, was suppose to get per diem but company is avoiding that now)
- recently found out new people are being hired with 2k higher annual salary in exact same title framework (complicated but we should all be getting paid the same in my opinion)
- Tim was recently trying to transfer to a new project and this made a lot of my worries about loyalty and hurting feelings go away, he was planning to leave the group 

I don’t feel like myself here. I love the people around me but I’m not utilizing my skills and I’m feeling super unhappy getting out of bed to go to work. This isn’t me.

Here’s some things I’m afraid of
- leaving and not liking a new job
- taking a significant paycut since this specific industry pays higher
- sounds childish but I don’t want people to be upset with me, i just switched groups 3 months ago 
- losing pension contributions, 2 weeks unused vacation, health benefits (full time job)
- resume looking bad for being at a place for around only a year (recent grad).

I have a Chemical Engineering degree, which consequently landed me a position at a sizeable healthcare company in California. The job itself is an entry-level position, and the learning curve itself was pretty steep to begin with; many small details are to be remembered and some new techniques to learn.

Two months in, safe to say i am struggling to fit in. I messed up a project by miswriting a number in a label, causing a downward effect delaying other groups projects. My boss, who is a very strict and is an old-fashioned style manager, let me know that i messed up pretty badly and this is to be noted in my performance review. After this, she continues to undermine every small little detail that i missed, for example when I forgot to write my name down on a document she disses me like ""you cant even write your name down"".

Right now, i am at a state where I am vulnerable, depressed, and anxious at my position. Coupled with the fear of getting laid off, it doesnt help my performance at all.

352," \*Disclaimer\- I know this isn't as serious a problem as a lot of posts on here, and I feel pretty petty about how I feel, but ""the heart has its reasons for which reason knows nothing,"" and its been a long time to be emotionally unavailable to anyone\*

So almost a year ago, I had just moved to college and fell for a girl pretty hard. I had been in a relationship before, but there was something about this person, whom I'll call K, that let me connect with her on a really deep emotional level. I know the difference between physical and emotional attraction, and in the next few months I had developed a deep emotional bond with her.

Over time I grew to see that she didn't seem too interested in me romantically, but despite this I couldn't shake liking her. I figured eventually she would fall for someone, and my feelings would grow weaker. That is until a group of our friends, K, and I were playing a game called Paranoia. She was asked who she thought was the most attractive of our friends, and she said me. I was confused, because I still believed she didn't want to date me, but I also thought she wouldn't choose me as most attractive if she wasn't interested and knew I was interested.

Luckily, this small flicker of hope only had to burn for a few days, because a few days later she made out with my best friend, and they've been dating ever since.

I'm still embarrassed about how I felt for her, and even more embarrassed that my best friend knew I had a huge crush on his girlfriend. I didn't (and don't!) know how to deal with my shame, which I know isn't really something I deserve. I don't blame either of them, I just wish I could stop feeling like, well shit. The only thing I resent a small bit, and I truly believe this wasn't intentionally hurtful, was K choosing me as most attractive. I've never been self confident, and somehow knowing that she didn't chose me not for any superficial reason, but for the person I am inside, has been the most painful.

I havent really gotten over this blow, and my current coping strategy is listening to Dont Think Twice by Bob Dylan, I Can't Make You Love Me by Bon Iver, and Operator by Jim Croce.

I'm very VERY dense and as I weave around, I hit people and my density, given my radius of 0.3m and 1.85m height, with a volume of 0.523m^(3), gives me great mass. This mass, combined with the acceleration driven by the weaving around, gives me an average force of 969 N, which is pretty tough if you ask me. 

Unfortunately, this force's path usually intertwines with people's path of motion, resulting in a resultant force (an indirect hit, of course), depending on the angle of striking, between 0 and 969 N, which is easily calculated using the cos function of the angle between my weaving's path and the path of motion of the person.

My attempts to alter the weaving have been unsuccessful.

354,"So... I am in need of some advice. Let me tell a back story first. In the beginning of October, the person that I thought I was going to marry and I split up (after four years of being together). Things never rematerialized after that. Shortly after, I met someone in the end of November. I insisted that this person and I just stayed fwb, but as most of us have experienced, feelings develope after being intimate with someone after a period of time. I kept telling this person even though I had caught feelings that I didn't want to hurt them and that I didn't want them to be my rebound. We had tried to strictly be just friends, but everytime we were together we couldn't help ourselves from falling back into the same pattern. I would recognize it and say that we needed to step back. This happened a handful of times, and they finally got sick of it and said that we could no longer be in the type of relationship we had. After not speaking for a while I took my lumps and moved forward. I met someone new and have been talking to that person pretty heavily. I told the other person about this new person and they were obviously upset. I invited the first person to a get together, and couldn't help myself from telling her how I felt and that I wanted to be with them, and they kept knocking the conversation down and saying that they Couldn't give in and blah blah blah. The second person showed up to pick me up because I had made plans with them later that night. I didn't know I was leaving right away with this person and never got to say goodbye to anyone who was at the shindig. I just left. No goodbyes, nothing.. I like both of these people but I'm not sure what to do. I feel extremely torn and don't know what to do in this situation. Any help would be appreciated haha.",12Jun2018,1

358,"So, my boyfriend and I have been together for about 9 months now. I plan to go see him this Friday for two weeks. We’ve been planning this trip for months, but I’ve been paying for and handing everything: 

The plane ticket, $360, bag checking, $25 ($50 total for the way back) Real ID, $25, food and other expenses ($50?)...

I am 19, and he is 18. He does not have a license yet, though his test is very soon, does not have a job as a result, so therefore has no income. As you can obviously guess scraping together all of this money together on my own is very stressful. Finding out about laws and regulations the TSA has set is new to me as this is my first time flying, and I have to organize it all...by myself. I worked a job and saved up, so all of this is coming from me; I haven’t asked my parents to help me at all. 

My issue is, him telling me he’s “stressed too.” I want to say, “what do you have to be stressed about? all you have to do is sit there and wait for me to get everything together,” but I don’t want to go off on him. Nevertheless, it still bothers me that he’s trying to relate to me when he doesn’t have to deal with anything. As mentioned above, I have to get a Real ID as i don’t have a passport. I have 2 days to get one and figure out any other fees, and once again I’ll be doing it all myself... 

We don’t normally fight, but paying for everything myself, him trying to understand something he couldn’t possibly relate to, and trying to scrape up any money possible because he doesn’t have any is getting to me. I want to go off on him; i want to ask him that question...but i can’t act out that way. I don’t know how to handle it properly, but i know this isn’t the way. ",12Jun2018,1

361,"Hi anyone who is reading this! I need some advice on whether or not you think a dog would be helpful in my life. I have many things I've been struggling with regarding my mental health. I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was 13 years old (Just turned 25) and it has gotten progressively worse in the last few months again. I also struggle with trauma and PTSD that occurred 2 years ago that i'm still trying to process. And to top it all of in recovery for an eating disorder. I have struggled with not having solid friends and being really lonely (bullied in school seems to be a trend with many people which breaks my heart) I know I have a lot going all at once and I'm not asking for sympathy or want to be looked at as a victim. I'm fighting hard, but because of all this I have wanted to get a dog for a very long time. I have the funds and place to keep her that isn't the problem. I went back to community college a year ago and have many goals and aspirations I want to achieve. I want to be able to travel and go on many adventures as I continue on this recovery journey and in the process hope to meet/make solid friendships. Do you think I could still be able to do those things in the years to come once I'm in a better place? Or do you think the dog would hold me back? Or do you think it could be beneficial with the different problems I'm dealing with by giving me a purpose? Would it help me overcome some of my obstacles, get out and actually meet people, and be a source to help me now? I know for me if I ever got a dog she would be my number one priority and nothing would get in the way of that. I'm just torn on whether or not it would help me or harder for me to do things in the future?

(Note: I have had dogs since I was born, I understand the responsibility and work they take to have so that wouldn't be an issue either!)

363,"I'm a first year Dutch student who studies in Belgium. Because I'm not a Belgian, I can't live in any of the university-owned subsidized dorms, so I live in a studio apartment in an apartment complex that's privately owned. 

In the evenings, I sometimes smoke marihuana on the outside stairwell, where so far barely anyone has even noticed me, because most people above the fourth floor just take the elevator (I always smoke between the fourth and fifth). Now, regardless of how you feel about the topic of weed, I don't bother anyone with it. It's a building with cheap, small apartments specifically for students, I keep out of anyone's way, it's outside, and  it can't be smelled from the inside.

The woman who came up to me while I was out there told me she had a couple of young kids and she lived on the floor above me. She complained about how she didn't like me doing that around here, (as for the reason why, I didn' t quite understand because she doesn't speak Dutch very well) and that she would inform the landlord and the police about this if she saw me doing this me again. I think the landlord could kick me out if he wanted to, because this is a private building and marihuana use is illegal here.

The the reason a family lives here is because she probably has a student in her household. To clarify, there are a lot of foreign students in the 3 appartment buildings on the property. Some of these bring their families along with them, and they can then live in the cheap, but small student housings. Now, in my opinion, having kids here isn't much of a valid complaint, since this is a building for students and the studios are all 1 or 2 person apartments, meant for students.

I'm really worried if I'm going to get into trouble for this, because marihuana use is pretty strictly enforced in this city. I also love living here as it's just about the only decent privately owned student building near the university campus where I can live at this price. What is the likeliness that there will be trouble for me? ",12Jun2018,1

His wife and their other child are just as bad I think. They may not hit anyone, but they're emotionally and financially abusive and so toxic. It wouldn't be the first time they said someone was dying or in poor health just to get their way either.

372,"Sorry in advance because this is going to be long. This is a very tough situation and we really need some help figuring out what to do. 
 
Background: We work for a small, local rental office of about six employees. The owner of the company is the mother of the employee in question. The employee, her son, is second in command. Recently, the mother/boss, has been out of the office for surgery. She was gone all of the end of last week and will be out this week as well. Sadly, every time she is away from work, her son abuses the fact the boss/his mother is gone. In the past, employees have brought to her attention his intolerable behavior and she has ignored and then accused them of bullying her son. 
 
Her son has a history of drug abuse (mainly heroin) and is currently on probation for a DUI. This is his second probation. I don’t know what the first one was for. His parents own properties where he has an apartment rent free, a free car, and pays no bills. He also receives a salary for working at their office. 
 
Once he got the second probation, his parents forced him to move into their home. We know he still goes and spends time in his old apartment, which is empty. We also know he steals money from the laundry machines in the building. He visited (everyone is under the impression he has kicked the habit) a methadone clinic and his mom thinks the heroin addiction was a stint in his past that he is over completely. This is far from the truth. 
 
Story: Since the mother has been out of the office, the son has pushed the envelope beyond belief. He doesn’t show up on time, leaves for random amounts of time, sleeps in his office and car, etc. This is not something unusual - anytime she’s away he does these sorts of things. 
 
Last week on Thursday, he showed up to work and he was obviously under the influence. Over the course of the day, he seemed to sober up until around lunch time. The other leasing agent (next in command) went on her lunch break and 15 minutes before she came back, he disappeared into the bathroom and told us to knock if we needed anything. There are two private bathrooms (one male, one female) in the office. We ended up needing him while he was in the bathroom, so one of the employees knocked and asked him for help. He said he’d be out momentarily but ended up being in there for another 15 minutes. The other leasing agent came back from her lunch, we told her what was going on and she went to help the person, cutting her lunch short, covering for him. When he eventually came out of the bathroom, he sat down next to one employee who described him as sweaty, out of it, and talking to himself. His eyes wouldn’t stay open and he looked scary (sp). He was being inappropriate and babbling incoherently. I think it’s important to note that in the small amount of time I’ve worked here (a few months) I have seen him in this state multiple times before, but to a lesser extent. 
 
Once he left to run some errands, we checked the bathroom and found [this](https://imgur.com/a/7XlAaMs) in the cabinet under the sink. We confiscated it and are trying to figure out what to do with it. We searched for other evidence in his office as well as the bathroom and found nothing. So far it doesn’t seem like he’s noticed the spoon is missing. After finding this, we made plans to tell our boss as a group the next Monday morning. Unfortunately, her condition worsened over the weekend and she is still in the hospital, so we postponed the meeting. At this point, she has no idea anything is up. 
 
The next day (last Friday), he came in and seemed normal. We watched him closely today to see if we could pick up on anything. In the middle of the day, again, when the other leasing agent was on her break, he complained of exhaustion and went down to his car twice before disappearing into the bathroom. He wasn’t in there as long as Thursday, but when he came out, his mood was noticeably different. He was singing and talking to himself. He seemed like he was high but not in the same way as Thursday. The other leasing agent said he, “sat backwards in a chair by the kitchen area and sang and talked to himself, ate candy, and flailed his arms around.” We checked the bathroom again and didn’t find anything. 
 
Monday, he was normal all day and left early to supposedly go visit his mom in the hospital, but when talking with his family members, they confirmed he wasn’t there and his mom talked to the other leasing agent as if she believed he was still in the office. 
 
He has lied to me on multiple occasions and seems to do so often to everyone in the office. We checked the bathroom and his office again and found [this](https://imgur.com/a/VgggkTI) in the trash can. As of right now, we don’t know what the substance is for sure, but the other leasing agent asked a friend that once had a bad addiction to heroine and confirmed the spoon contained heroine but was unfamiliar with the smell of the residue in the bag. Another coworker who used to use meth in the past looked at it and said she is 99% sure it is some form of meth. 
 
Why I (we) need your help: What do we do!? His mother is in denial, and more than likely her son will be able to talk his way out of what is going on. How do we move forward? There are so many ways to confront her, but how…and is it worth it? In a perfect world, the son would be sent to get help and we would all continue working our jobs, but we’re not sure how to go about this.

I'm an 18 y/o guy from Western Europe and I realized I don't really have anyone. I currently live with my family which are very toxic and I'm dying to be outside of the house more, but I have nowhere to go because I have no friends especially not here in my local city. 

It almost feels like everyone on this world knows me for being a bad person and avoiding me at all costs. What I mean to say is that I never feel like I get the opportunity to actually meet people around my age especially not with the same interests(which are Linux and other open source related stuff) because they don't seem to exist outside of the Internet.

Even online I managed to lose everyone. I grew apart from the guys I used to play video games with(which I also knew irl) and all the online-only fokes as well. And here I have the same issue, I am unable to find any opportunity to meet new people.

It almost feels like people are having some kind of experiment on me to see how long someone can survive in complete social isolation whilst still being in the real world. But I haven't lost my sanity yet so I know that's impossible.

Both of them are in-state schools for me. I have no college savings and my parents will not be helping me pay. I plan to get a bachelors at one of these schools and transfer to a better, more expensive out of state school for my master's degree.

School A:
-Good Reputation (Average GPA is 3.61, Average ACT is 25)
-Tuition is ~$9,000, but I have a scholarship that will make it $4,000.
-I did not get into the honors program
-Large school, class sizes could be 35-75 students (some large 100+ classes too)
-Much better resources &amp; facilities for students (technology, dorms, library, etc.)
-Numerous majors to study (I am undecided)
-Location is a large urban city (pop. 193,744)
-Roughly 45m from my parents
-Friends go to this school
-Pac 12 Conference

School B:
-Okay Reputation (Average GPA is 3.5, Average ACT is 24)
-Tuition would be free for me, and room &amp; board would be partially covered
-I did get into the honors program (smaller classes, better teachers, priority scheduling)
-Small school, class sizes could be 20-30 students
-Facilities are somewhat old, but there are new buildings too.
-Limited majors to study (I am undecided)
-Location is a small rural city (pop. 31,223)
-Roughly 4 hours from my parents
-Big Sky Conference",12Jun2018,1

dad called an exterminator and now hes *freaking* out because the exterminator said something about 'they're probably german roaches.' and 'sometimes people have to knock walls down to get rid of them.' i dont know exactly what was said, but dad is convinced that the house wont be able to be saved now.

that sounds like a bunch of BS to me though. like, yeah the guy would say that if he thinks he can charge more or something. but the idea that some roaches would *ruin* our *house*! i dont know.. how would an exterminator even know what kind of roaches they are if he hasnt even come look yet anyway?

is there truth to this? what can we do?

Additionally I work full-time during the summer at a local bank; part-time during the semesters.  What was once a great summer gig that catered to my schedule is now a disaster that I feel trapped in.  I have developed a bad taste for the position and a few co-workers due to company growth.  The transition has been very rough; sometimes even leaving me in tears after work.  The stress from work has taken its toll on my mental state.  

So why am I even asking?  I have no idea, and I have been left with no direction for my future.  My Fraternity got in trouble so I lost my entire resume, and currently this is the only thing I have.  

Should I quit my job and focus on myself and figuring myself out? Is right now the time to do it?  Do I apply for another job?  Any direction or opinion is welcome!  ",12Jun2018,1

They take this as cheating, because I guess I wasn’t following proper test taking rules or whatever, but they expect you to sit still for an hour after you’re done with your text. You can’t do anything in that hour. What kind of rule is that?

As I said, I was not cheating. A good look at my exam answers will tell you that. There are also two days of school left, both for test taking.

397,Hi guys so I am 17 years old and I just graduated high school a few days ago and I was planning to go to a local state school in the fall. I don't want to sound spoiled or unappreciative for what my parents do but they're very very strict. I feel like I am sheltered and in the past couple years that I have missed out on a lot and have not been as happy at all as ik i could be so that's one of the main reasons why I wanted to go to college but I was going to go to community college and stay home because it was cheaper even though I knew that I wanted more freedom and that Id potentially be happier after all the shit that has gone down at my house but on the flip side I don't want to be in a shit ton of debt and have my mom hate me for going to college and wanting to live my life so what would you do because I am conflicted.  Money isn't everything but I feel like since I'm so young i shouldn't just fuck up my life in a money sense for freedom if that makes sense. ,12Jun2018,1

I know I shouldn’t have taken their alcohol so don’t tell me I’m an idiot for that; I know. Should I do something more to cover it up or just leave it as is so I don’t fuck it up any more? I presume I’ll get in a looot of trouble if they find out. Thank you!!

EDIT: I should add that my parents rarely drink (and when they do it’s usually cocktails or just beer/wine) nor do they look in the cabinet that often, which is why I haven’t been found out for so long. The only time they caught me with alcohol it was from my friend. ",12Jun2018,1

3 - moving to somewhere like London (from rural Ireland), start an entry level position in the fashion industry with the intentions of moving up towards creative consultant, buyer or stylist.

i feel horrible about it since i never ever let my frustration get the best of me like that. i dont know if i should tell her how i feel because it will seem like im just going to do what i did before, which is say i want to do something then completely go against that once she flusters me with that kind of question. it flusters me so much because i believe so strongly that my love has been consistent and strong for so long. it hurts that she can say that and mean it. but i know that i am completely in the wrong here and that’s where i need your guys help. what im asking is how do i go about this while being as genuine as possible?

He had himself as owner and me as Co-Owner, obviously implying he wants to be the head.

I am not in a romantic relationship. I am kind of weird, and I accept it. I got out of a weird relationship thing with a girl my age where she said I was too naive and didn't have much world experience. I really needed that a while back. This was back in february or march. 

I feel like I am so far behind my classmates. I mean gradewise I am all right, but that's not all life is. I am currently working with primates now, so I am working towards my goals. I am trying to start fully paying for my own apartment, but it's not easy doing 20 hours of classes and a job while making good grades. I am thinking of getting a second job, but my mom says I am pushing myself too hard. I just feel like my classmates are way ahead of me. They are off travelling to other countries and making new experiences and partying and all that stuff (I don't really want to party though).  Like my friend, for example she is out at disney world right now. She's also working with some chemical company. I feel so far behind. Another guy I know is now flying planes and doing things for the airforce. Another friend just landed a sweet job as an internet security programmer thing (way above my head). I'm just stuck here working and barely able to stay awake anymore. I don't know why I am struggling so hard.

 I feel like this is the age where I should start meeting girls and dating more, but it's not that easy to juggle. I tried juggling it last semester and my grades fell. Things don't seem this hard for others and I don't know where I am going wrong. I am not as close as I could be with my grandmother. I asked her why I felt trapped in adolescence and she said I'll be an adult when I don't think things revolve around me all the time. I mean I know that's good advice, but that wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I don't want to be a burden on my family. I have scholarships, but my food, apartment, and schooling aren't completely paid for, so everytime I have to pick up that check from my grandmother I feel so ashamed of myself and like I am failing. I just don't know what to do and how to fix my life to be less of a burden on my family and where I am satisfied with myself.

Being cheated on and lied to was hard, as I’m sure it is for anyone. Having someone hide their phone and make me feel like I’m the one being sneaky. Making me feel like I’m in fault for all my flaws and everything they put me through. Not just with one person for three years but with another one for a year. 

After having a child with someone I barley knew leave me the moment my son was born, I thought self healing was a must. However I think I did more growing and learning to be a parent instead of really making myself remember who I was before the person entered my life. I coped with the trauma I faced previous to this man, however once he left I only learned to be okay being a single mother.

I have an amazing new man in my life and we have made it six months so far. I just find myself thinking maybe it’s too good to be true that things are just so well. I get nervous when I see pretty girls, when I see him texting HIS DUDE BFF OR MOM lol like clearly not a girl but still I’m feeling low! or when I see random people pop on fb that he is friends with. 

They have no connection other than social media and it’s 2018 everyone has social media.. I just second guess my appearance, my weight and my likability when I see beautiful women.. he loves me. He makes it known. 

I just keep feeling sick about how I feel about myself and I don’t want it to show because I know personal insecurities can cause potential issues within a relationship. 

He deserves a strong, independent, self-empowered woman. When we first started dating that’s who I was. Recently I lost my job, and I’ve been having self doubt issues. 

I want to stay positive and believe that I am enough for him, but despite the reassurance he gives me, at times I feel less than, and just flat out ugly.. like all of this is going to turn into a mess and fall to pieces like times before..

But the thing is, with him.. I’ve never known a man to care the way he does. I’ve never felt like I am something like I do with him. He is the best man I could have in my life and maybe it’s because our relationship is still new and I just don’t remember how well things may have been this early in previous relationships but I feel like I’m going to jinx myself..

I’m paranoid of my own flaws.. I need advice.
