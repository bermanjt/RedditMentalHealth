6,"My girlfriend and I have been so happy together over the past few months, and we often talk of traveling the world. She means everything to me, and her fear of flying has been a critical point throughout her life, as it's stopped her from seeing family, attending events, and other opportunities that involve getting on a plane. I want nothing more than to explore with her, and only want to help her through this difficult process. Just the idea of flying can make her tear up and get uncomfortable. She's told me that it's an internal issue, something I wouldn't be able to help her with; and I absolutely understand what she means, but my love for her well-being and happiness just makes me want to try and help her anyway. If anyone has any advice or has gone through a similar situation (on my end or my girlfriend's), I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thank you!",10Feb2018,1
7,"I'm going to be 20 next month and I live with my parents. Right now I have a job that pays very well by the hour ($25/hr), and I absolutely love it, but I don't have a lot of hours, especially during winter where I can go weeks without work. I definitely do not make enough money to support myself financially, aka move out. 

I have an interview in about a week for an electrician apprenticeship. It pays about the same as what I get now but it is full time, and it is a career as opposed to what I have now, which is just a job that won't last me until retirement or whatever. If I had to choose, I would rather live paycheck to paycheck doing what I love than to live comfortably with a crappy job. The problem is that I don't even make enough to live paycheck to paycheck, and the job isn't secure so I don't know how many more years I will be working here.

I could find another part time job in order to make ends meet if I choose to move out, but again I would not have a stable career. What will I do when I'm 40 years old? Shit like that.

So I'm torn between the risk/reward of doing something I love and living frugal, and diving into a career that I will probably hate but be pretty much set until retirement.",10Feb2018,2

12,"I'm in a dual degree program, getting my BS in physics and MS in mechanical engineering. Including classes I'm currently in, I'm 5 classes away from my Bachelor's and 7 from my Master's (my school uses the quarter system, so that means I'll graduate in June for my BS and November for my MS if things go according to plan)

Background info: I took the 2016-2017 school year off due to falling into a bipolar meltdown and drug addiction. That should have been my 4th year of school. It was the roughest year of my life, but I came back to complete one class in the spring quarter 2017, and then a full 4 classes in fall 2017 (getting Bs and a C, which is lower than my previous record of As and Bs) . 

I feel so much dumber and less motivated after that year. In fall quarter I managed to do enough work to get by, repeating the mantra ""C's get degrees"" to myself (though that isn't actually true for my MS classes, as a 3.0 GPA is required to graduate). But now it's the end of week 6 (out of 10) and I've barely done any work for any of my classes. I spent the first 4 weeks of class doing absolutely nothing and not going to class, so I'm still struggling to catch up with the first 2-3 weeks worth of material. Fortunately my professors are generally forgiving, and they are allowing me to turn in assignments late so that I have the possibility of passing. But I don't feel like I can do it. The amount of work I have put off now seems insurmountable. I simply lack the time and motivation to do it at this point. 

My first inclination is to just focus on my undergrad classes (3/4 of the ones I'm taking) and say screw it to the grad level one. But then i remembered the 3.0 to graduate rule and I feel like failing a class makes that extremely difficult to achieve. I dropped a class already, and I can't drop another without dropping down to part-time student status. I don't see a solution here, so I've just been putting my head down and doing what work I can, focusing on the 3 undergrad classes. One of them I almost have under control, I got a B on the midterm and an almost caught up on homework. But I fear that for the rest I am just frankly too stupid. With these upper level physics classes, I read the text book for hours and feel like I gained no knowledge. It's gotten to the point where I've been daydreaming of dropping out and just getting another part time job in addition to my current one in order to become financially independent. But then I think of the thousands of dollars of my parents money I'd have wasted by dropping out so close to the end that it makes me want to die. Then I start daydreaming about killing myself and I don't want to ride that train of thought too far.

I don't know how I'm going to do it. It might be too late to not fail. Do you have any advice for a hopeless, unmotivated, stupid student desperate to fucking graduate?",10Feb2018,2

17,"Hi, question regarding metabolism here:

I previously lost weight between the ages of 17 - 18, from 135 to 95 pounds in a year (yes, I'm aware it wasn't super healthy). I lost mostly fat and gained a ton of muscle because I was dancing/doing gymnastics 3 to 6 hours a day at the time. Lost my period for two years, the whole nine yards.

I maintained this for 18 months because of undereating for my activity, and each day was 1200 -1500 kcal a day (Jan 2015 - Jun 2016). Had a pretty screwed up relationship with food during this time.

I then gained eighty pounds in the next 18 months because of binge eating, depression and other things (Jun 2016 - now). My Current Weight is 178 LBS, and I'm a 22f, 5' 2''.

My question is is my metabolism slowed down? If so, how much did my metabolism slow down compared to what it would be at my size, and is there a way to find out my new BMR? And has anyone lost weight twice?",10Feb2018,1
18,"Long story I apologize in advance ... 

I met this girl in college, I was a junior she was a senior but about the same age. We were good friends for about 10-12 months then decided to date. Did a couple spartan races together, I really got to know her and be comfortable with her. 

Fast forward to when we’re dating and all is well. She supported the hell out of me, likewise for me to her and everything is great. 

She graduates and moves back home. About 3 hour drive from where I live and it was rough for me. Even though I loved spending weekends together, it just wasn’t what I wanted it to be. After about 3 months of ‘long distance’ I finally decide to break it off. 

Called her and explained how it just wasn’t fun and how our schedules conflict so much that I just didn’t enjoy it right now. We part ways. A few days later she texts me and asks if we can talk and honestly I wasn’t able to. I knew I would jump right back to her and just be emotionally a wreck because of not being able to see her. 

The thing is though we had so many memories and little things (I got us matching bracelets for example) that I just cannot get rid of.  

Fast forward to today, 6 months later and my feelings for her are just as strong as they were. I tried dating other people but it just did not work. Every other person I’ve met I’ve compared to her. So I guess my question is. Do I text her and hope for the best? Call her? Let it go and get over it in time? I just know if I text her she’s going to screenshot it, show everyone and I’m going to feel even worse than I do now. 

TLDR: broke up with a girl because of long distance. 6 months later still in love with her. What do I do? ",10Feb2018,2

22,"This may be a stupid question, but I’m truly clueless. After Googling, it seems that there’s no direct answer to my question but everything that does come up is terrifying.

I wasn’t feeling great so I wanted to boil water and breathe it in as I put a towel over my head- a little asthma trick I did as a child. Like your own personal sauna- really opens up your lungs. Anyway, for some reason as the water was boiling and the stovetop was lit (flame on high), I decided to start to breathe the water in. It was about two minutes that I was breathing it in; and it had a very fishy scent. No towel over my head here and my face wasn’t directly in, but it was close enough for the heat to make my face hot and sweaty. It wasnt till a few minutes that I realized smelling flame from the stove is probably really bad, so I stepped back and I’ve been freaking out since.

About of week after I broke up, I woke up one morning and realized I needed to get my shit together and have done a pretty good job at doing so (seriously). the past few months I’ve realized that she did the right thing for herself and I’ve felt extremely guilty for being that way to her. I have absolutely no intention on getting back together with her, I mostly just want her to know that I am extremely sorry for wasting her time and putting her through that.

27,"Hi, Im chels. Im 27.


Im in a strange place in my life right now. I just got out of a 7 year relationship with a guy who cheated on my and even physically abused me in a few cases. They were rare, but they happened. I met this guy in trade school and I moved away from my hometown, my family and my friends to be with him. Towards the end of our relationship, I met another guy who I fell for super fast. I mean, this guy, I find him adorable and sweet...hes really nice to me, and ive never had that before...a relationship where the guy is nice..

This new guy, though, doesn't want to be serious with me because hes getting a pretty hard degree and doesnt want to be distracted. I understand of course, and do my best not to bug him but sometimes Its hard.

Its hard because I left this 7 year relationship and hes my only friend. Im living in this city alone, with no friends and family nearby and has to walk 40 minutes to work because I also dont have a car. Every night I feel lonely. I try to get on steam and play games, but i feel even lonelier doing that. I have no life, no way to go back to college (no car) just work and come home. I was thinking, of going back home to my mom.

But...My mother is no saint. I never got to go to college becasue she refused to help me with the fafsa. After I turned 24 I had ballooned up to 200 lbs from depression. I lost it all two years, but all I had was eating. Now I dont have that...or a friend, or anything. I could go back to my mother...but, im afraid because even though she is very nice to me now, growing up with her, I was told i was stupid and ugly and I believed it...

I have trust issues, becasue the man I spent all my years with cheated nd hurt me. My mother hurt me. I dont know my father but he left and it hurt me and Im afraid.

A huge reason why I stayed here is becasue I have a job, and I REALLY REALLY LIKE this new guy.
No, im lying, I love him.
He was there for me when my ex pulled a knife on me and he helped me so much to move out. He made a giant list for us, for things we will do in the future...but it confuses me because im not his girlfriend...

Im just...can someone help me figure this out?
Im just so shy and I haven't made one friend in this area (except for new guy) in the 7 years ive been here...",10Feb2018,9

31,"Situation: There's two guys, Joe and Kevin. Joe is my roommate, and Kevin is my other friend. However, Joe doesn't like Kevin but Joe told me not to mention that. I said, ""ok I won't""

Last week Joe got angry at me for breaking my word and was like ""why the f*ck did you talk about me? you know how much I hate starting shit with people"" etc etc

I haven't really talked to Joe ever since then and it's been a bit awkward in my house, as he is my roommate. 

The thing is, I want apologize, but I'm not sure how he will react. He's a bit hostile when it comes to texting and also doesn't really accept apologies well. In my view, he's a good guy but he also does have sociopathic and slight asshole tendencies. I also find him incredibly judgemental about others sometimes, and he often talks about other people negatively. It's hard for him to make friends since he dislikes a lot of people.

Should I apologize or move on? I don't feel much loss with this broken friendship, but it just feels uncomfortable awkward.

38,"Many years ago I started having issues with breathing, headaches, throat burning, and so forth when I moved into new rental homes. My doctors call it environmental illness or MCS multiple chemical sensitivity. There is no treatment. They shrug at me give me a sad face and wish me luck.

This started around when I was in my early 30's. In the last few years I have tried several places and became very ill.
The main symptom is severe shortness of breath/sore throat and it makes it so I cannot sleep at all in these places and leads to devastating sleep deprivation.

I lost my job but have a $1,900 a month severance pay/pension to live on. I got a car thats reliable that I am living out of right now. I am too tall to sleep in it well and I have swelling on my feet and headaches but it's better than getting sick in a hotel which I would every time I don't last 5 seconds in a hotel nor can I afford the rates.

One of the big problems I find is that in the US (where I live) is landlords are really hardcore and require a years lease or at least several months at the least. I've tried explaining my plight time and again and get nowhere. So renting in USA is not a good option. I will not sign a years lease give them all my money get sick on the first night or first week and then have them keep everything first month, last month, and sue me for breaking the lease..no way am I doing that anymore.

If I go up to a property thats really nice and clean and newer and desirable and ""might"" maybe work I get laughed at if I ask can I try it for a ""few days'"" to see if I react and get sick. Almost 100% i get a WTF form landlords and they walk away. I've tried this so much over the years with zero success and mentally I have given up on this totally at this time.

Some might say landords will rent daily or weekly but that is always the seedy nasty sketchy places that will make me violently ill. It's usually rooms in old houses or shady motels.

Why don't I buy a house? Well my credit is bad mainly due to this issue an the problem it has caused. Also buying a house would not work because I could do a walkthrough like it, buy it, move in and get violently sick in the first few days and be stuck. Besides my credit situation makes this impossible at this time.

I know some people here might be skeptical about my health issues. But for the purposes of this thread I just ask you to suspend your disbelief if you have it and assume this is real..what I am going through. I have come up with several options and wondering what the good people here think of each option and the possibility of success.

Go to the southwest and live on public lands first in a tent and then maybe buy a cheap van for around $1,000 hoping it doesn't make me sick. In a tent in fresh air I am usually OK. Live a nomad lifestyle staying southwest in the winter and northwest in the summer living off public lands in a tent or a van. 

I can live on the US side close to Mexico for cheaper services if I need to make day trips. The downside is I'd be hella nervous out in the desert in a tent at night by myself but maybe I would get used to it. The feeling could seem unsafe to me.

Leave the country and either go to Mexico, Thailand, Phillipines, or Vietnam. I have my passport. In all the asian countries you can try rentals out short term and then go long term.. It's not like the landlords feel it's heresy unless you sign a years lease. I am leaning Vietnam or Phillipines because Bangkok is almost twice as expensive as those countries. In Vietnam nice hotels are $20 nightly and if you like it you can do months lease even cheaper.

I am a bit nervous of going to those countries and getting ""stuck"" if things don't work out the airfare is expensive. Mexico is close and much cheaper to try but I feel it is way more dangerous than the Asian countries. I could be in Mexico tomorrow but I don't speak Spanish. Downside to this is a speak only English.

These are the two options I am stuck on and kind of torn over. Any other ideas or opinions would be great. Maybe there's something I haven't thought of yet?

40,"So a few weeks ago I was fired from job scanning documents and academic journals from my university’s library. I didn’t really see it coming and I think it was really unfair of my boss to just terminate me with no warning. 

Basically I would work four 3-hour shifts per week (the job didn’t demand more time  than that) plus with classes it worked out perfectly. I started in August and got terminated in late January. Fall semester went off without a hitch. I would come in, do my work, and leave. I always did a good job and the full time library employees who I interacted with on a daily basis never gave me any negative or critical feedback.  Fast forward to winter break, because college class schedules change he asked what my availability was for spring semester. I told him I could still work mornings however I needed Tuesdays off because of an internship. He said that was perfectly fine. The job itself was very very laid back, no one really paid too much attention to when I came in or didn’t because I worked that out with the main boss and they didn’t have anything to do with it, in fact they were almost always a little surprised  to see me because again, the main boss never communicated my schedule with them. I never really saw the main boss because he had a separate office, we only communicated through email. 
Anyway, he never told me when I was meant to start for spring semester and I was going through some serious medical issues as a result of chronic illness so I didn’t return to campus at the very start of classes. He sent me an aggressive email with the subject “WHATS GOING ON??” asking why I hadn’t come into my “scheduled” shifts. We never scheduled a start date for spring semester, in fact, in our last email I asked if I could begin working the week after classes started. He didn’t answer. I was scared that he was angry and I didn’t want to be fired so I explained that I had just been diagnosed with a chronic illness and was in the process of sorting out medications etc. All he replied was “thanks for letting me know”.  Again, I asked if I could start coming in next week but he never responded to that part of the email. I didn’t come in the next day because I couldn’t and he sent an email saying that because “I didn’t show up for my shift I was terminated”. I think that was really unfair. He refused to communicate about a finite start date and even after I explained about being sick he fired me. My school recently raised the minimum wage to $11 from $8.65 so I’m thinking that maybe he needed to downsize and wanted to pin the blame on me. 

I just want to know if I’m in the wrong and if I should email him back now and say that I think it was truly unfair. There isn’t anyone above him in the university I can take the issue to and I don’t expect my job back. After writing this I know of realize I just want to tell him off! maybe that’s not very prudent....",10Feb2018,1

44,"Hello, users of r/advice, I'm sure you've seen tons of posts like this before, but I have never used this sub before today, so I hope you'll excuse this redundancy and help me out with a bit of a problem I have. You see, I am a 16-year-old high school boy who has developed feelings for a certain young woman my age. We have been very close friends for about a half-year now, and I found myself romantically attracted to her a few months ago. Up until this very day, she was in a year-long relationship with her now ex-boyfriend. However, the day of their breakup was foreseen by many a people, including me, because of the constant arguing the two had indulged in for the past couple of months. I also sometimes hear words from her friends that she speaks about me quite often.

Now that her relationship with that man is over, I find myself very emotionally confused on the matter. It upsets me because, after all, I am this young lady's friend, but I am also glad they broke up, so that she is not stuck in such a toxic relationship as theirs. However, I fear that I conceal a hidden joy within myself, one that is more selfish in nature, due to my aforementioned feelings for her.

As I'm told, I should soon be using this opportunity to make advances on her, though I do not know when I should do so. I am aware that the heartbreak she feels will need time to heal, which, in the meantime, I am there as her ""shoulder to cry on,"" so to speak. I would appreciate if anyone could clue me on the most opportune time to admit my feelings for this girl, or perhaps even ask her out.

But when I do end up either confessing to her or asking her out, how should I approach the matter? I have never been in a situation like this before, and it isn't helped by my lack of social skills. My situation of having very little friends, not to mention high-functioning autism spectrum disorder is particularly troublesome. So, once again, I would much appreciate answers to my three questions: ""When should I make my advances,"" ""should I admit my feelings before asking her out,"" and ""how would I go about doing these two things?""

Im not going to get into the details of how depressed I am saying goodbye to the twenties.

I just need some advice from you reddit people. 

All month.. actually since the year started my desperate alcoholic girlfriend has been going up in my ass about my 30th birthday. I told her many times over again that I don’t plan on doing anything or if I did I wouldn’t want something big... I told her no house party, no surprise parties, no bar hopping/clubbing, no crazy alcohol nights if she’s thinking about planning something. 

Weeks flies by and the time is here. I made a decision to go out for dinner with some close friends. Girlfriend makes a big deal and only wants the two of us to go eat dinner alone than maybe invite some people over for a hangout. I’m like “wtf is it my birthday or yours?” And so I cancelled our reservation and told my friends we’ll let them know whats going on...

Im pissed off. Shes pissed off. I came to terms and told her no eating out, I’ll cook and we can have less than 6 people over. She gets mad and says no cooking just hangout while inviting people I dont want over.

So we ended up with no party tomorrow and two of my friends, one bought me a very expensive whiskey bottle, the other flew in from a 3hr flight (mainly to see his parents). 


What should I do? I want to hangout with my friends but I dont want to have this birthday party 

Fyi my girlfriend and I dont live together.

52,"So. My ex and I broke up about 6 months ago. We were together for 4 months. Before I broke up with him, I was already frustrated with the strain of the relationship and the fact that I had to keep lending him money. 

Anyway. He was staying the weekend with me and he had to leave the same night he got there, because his baby mama wanted him to pick up his kids even though it was her weekend and he had just dropped them off earlier that day. So he told me he was going to come back later that night after dropping his kids off at his mom's and he was going to leave his bag that he brought with him. He texted me after he left and said he couldn't come back like he originally said. 

So I was left with his clothes and such. I texted him 2 days later and said that I just couldn't deal with the relationship anymore and broke it off. We agreed to try to be friends and so far we are on ""good terms"". I tried to arrange with him to come get his stuff 2 weeks after I broke up because I didn't want to be an asshole and ask him immediately. He said he couldn't because he ""didn't think he could handle seeing me"" because he was so tore up about the break up. So I waited a month and asked him again, same response. And I have asked him several times  since. The last time I asked, he had arranged to come get his stuff (because I told him I couldn't hold on to them any longer) and that day, he conveniently couldn't make it at the last min. I had even agreed to meet him halfway.

It's been 7 months since we broke up and I'm in a new relationship. I don't want to hold on to his things anymore, but I don't want to throw them away because some of the things, like special shirts his kids gave him for his birthday/father's day etc, mean a lot to him. But I think I have held on to these things long enough now. He lives only 45 mins away so I don't understand why he can't just make the trip to come get his stuff?

She would try and hang out here and there but also say that she's just so busy cuz she works and has a boyfriend, and now its gotten to the point where I maybe see her once every few months, and barely hear from her or talk to her. She claims she's so busy from work and having  boyfriend and can't balance it and we just have to accept it.

59,"I've seen the memes about ""may I talk to the manager"" haircuts. I've read the comments where people talk about cringing when their parent mentions cold soup or undercooked chicken to the waiter. And I have also known friends who got mad at me when I called out someone who cut in line. I don't understand why people get mad when you try to get treated better. 

Recently, I ordered an expensive booklet of checks and other bank-related items that would help me in my professional career. Instead of being received as a package (where it would have been placed on a shelf), it was bent and shoved into my tiny little mailbox. I was devastated to see all of my checks and materials crumpled, wrinkled and distorted.

Despite my anger, I spoke calmly and politely to the girl at the counter, asking her if there was anything we could do to make sure this doesn't happen again. I asked if we could maybe write a note about packages for me, asking for them to always be sent with the packages (where they belong) instead of in the cramped mailbox. She apologized and said this wasn't supposed to happen, but she offered me nothing at all. I think the anger was obvious on my face, but I wasn't mean at all. I was very factual, curt, and polite. All she said was, ""Yeah, this isn't supposed to happen. I'm sorry."" I asked her, ""So, is there nothing we can do to make sure this doesn't happen again?"" She looked at me like I was crazy. She said nothing; literally just looked at me as though I were a jackass for asking if my packages wouldn't be ruined in the future. No assurances that this wouldn't happen again. Nothing. I politely thanked her for her time and walked (okay, maybe stormed) out.

 I sent an email explaining my frustration at this failure and told them it was ""unacceptable"" that ""I would now look unprofessional in front of my peers, as though I were messy and ruined my checkbook, when in reality it was an incompetent worker in the mailroom."" I asked the department to ""either change [their] training practices or offer some sort of recompense when this happens."" I mentioned that it was unacceptable that I couldn't trust my own expensive dormitory to properly handle my packages over being completely screwed over.

My friends cringed when I told them this. They said that now the girls in the mailroom would hate me and that I should have shut up. I asked them why, and they didn't have any solid answers to give. 

So, why is it culturally frowned upon to complain about poor service? Why is it better to endure being screwed over than speaking up? Or IS it good that I spoke up in this case? Could it lead to positive changes? I would greatly appreciate advice and perspective on this. ",10Feb2018,0
60,"I have friend who was in a relationship with my brother. No I do not have a crush on her (  I'm attracted to guys ), about a month ago her and my brother broke up. No cheating involved or anything, but just a  very verbally bad breakup. They where together for 3 years and me and her were friends a little bit before she met my brother. When I heard about there split up I called her a few times just to see if she was ok, and I noticed she was alot more distant, and I figured she was hurting and things like that so I just gave her space until I heard from her.

Well 2 weeks she called me and we spoke and she admitted that the reason she was distant towards was because she for some reason felt  indirected anger at me because of her and my brothers breakup, like I was guilty because of being related to him. My response was  "" Excuse me?? Come on No no no that's not fair, that should be between you and him, your mood towards me should not be determined by your anger towards someone else even if it is my brother "". I hung up after that, then an hour later she texted me and apologized and I texted "" I get that but I'm not him and I have nothing to do with whatever happened between you guys, talk to me when you are able to keep your anger and disdain away from me when it should be directed at the person you really are upset with because I am not and was not your problem. "" 


I didn't hear from since then. I'm sorry about the way I said what I said, but I'm not sorry for the point I was trying to get across to her. I just don't understand how I receive animosity because of someone elses drama. For example my former step father cheated on my mother years ago, they divorced, his daughter (  she wasn't too close with him ) reached out to me and apologized the way things went down and said that she still considered me her brother and wanted to maintain touch with me if I was ok with it. Me and her are still close to this day, I didn't hold any anger towards her because she was not the problem, it was her father not her.

So I guess I have a hard time with understanding that thinking with the friend who just brokeup with my brother. We don't even live together either, I have my own place and he has his. If she wanted to vent, talk about it, I can work with that, but I just didn't appreciate me having to pay for my brothers sins or whatever, and I felt like our friendship isn't really as strong as I thought. I just think people need to keep there anger directed at the person that actually caused it. Anyway, I haven't heard from her and I haven't tried to contact her since then.

Despite that, I was able to meet a pretty awesome group of people (both guys and girls) that I became extremely close with over the course of 4 years. Unfortunately, right before my graduation, two of my friends started a shitstorm of drama that completely destroyed our friendship. A lot of stuff was said and there is no turning back at this point. At first, I was pretty excited about meeting new people. However, since my graduation (it's been several months), I have only met two guys that I hang out with pretty regularly. The problem is that they are new to the city and do not have friends of their own. They are also huge introverts, so there is no help from them when it comes to trying to expand our social circle. Although I like spending time with them, it gets pretty old hanging out with dudes all the time. I also really miss the type of conversations that you can have with female friends. I have tried meeting girls at clubs and bars, but they always assume I want to simply get in their pants. So I am really at a loss here...

75,"*I want to move out of my apartment. I live in Chicago IL (since laws are different in different places).

*  (skip to next paragraph if you don't want to read about why my current landlord sucks.) This place started nice, with a cheap rent but then the building got sold to the prior land lord's relative who doesn't want to do his job. My land lord doesn't do what he should- if something breaks he doesn't fix it. If we mention it more than once he acts surprised, ""That's still broken?"" As if he expects us to fix it ourselves, and if we don't he permanently raises the rent way more than it would cost for a one time fix. The lock on our back door can no longer be locked with a key- he told us to stop using that door. The maintenance man brought bed bugs into the apartment then lied to me the upstairs neighbor did it while telling her that I did it. We realized this when I talked to her. The land lord legally needs to have a licensed exterminator spray within ten days of being notified- he had our upstairs neighbor spray with some store bought poison. That didn't fix it so a month after being told about them he hired an exterminator for ONE spraying and raised our rent out of retaliation (also illegal). He didn't renew our lease, saying ""We don't need one."" I think it's so he can change how much he charges and what the rules are at a moment's notice. When leaks started happening he didn't fix them, instead he raised our rent to cover the extra cost of the constantly running water. The way our gas is hooked up some of it goes to heat the landlord's basement; our former landlord paid what the meter said she used. Our current landlord just takes it, yet charges me for the electricity and water used to run the washing machine I bought- I'm not sure but I think he thinks he owns it now. With only one professional bed bug spraying, it killed the adults but not the eggs. The eggs have hatched in the maintenance man's apartment and he sprays them with poison himself at night. This not only drives him out of his apartment into ours, but when I'm sleeping the poison comes down from his apartment and I wake up with those fumes in my room. I am literally being poisoned by my upstairs neighbor while I'm sleeping, I'm missing work because of it and it's making me sick! Sometimes I hear him spray before I go to bed, so I sleep in the living room (I don't smell it there.) My third floor neighbor and I are going to get an exterminator ourselves and take it out of the rent- but we're scared of further retaliation and rent raising. My other room mate bailed (no lease, so she can) and I'm legally not allowed to sublease while the apartment is infected with bed bugs, but it's not deemed unlivable enough that the landlord needs to pay for me to live elsewhere. I'm leaving my stuff here long enough to get sprayed down so I won't be bringing these things to a new place but I'm having a lot of trouble finding a new place in Chicago. 


Finding a studio apartment in the city for a reasonable price is near impossible- when I do, they don't allow pets. I have pet lizard, she's my only family otherwise I am totally and completely alone IRL. I would move in with room mates but most have a cat or dog- I'm allergic to the point my throat swells shut and in the past have ended up in the ER after prolonged exposure. This makes finding a place difficult to live. I'm also a contract artist whose current gig determines how much I have to pay my rent/utilities/bills; out of caution of possibly not finding another contract gig once this one is over in April I was trying to find a place that I could afford with my permanent part time job income. 

  With that I could afford a place for $600 a month INCLUDING utilities. This would let me eat and afford transportation and pay my college loans with no money for anything else.

While looking at rental listings I was seeing listings of property for sale. I have good credit, as I always pay my college loans on time, sometimes more than what I'm required if I can afford it. I've started thinking, why don't I see if I can buy a house with multiple rooms in it? I could get a three bedroom house, rent out two of the rooms and charge them the cost of what I would room mates in an apartment, but put their rent toward things like the mortgage, home insurance, maintenance like shoveling in the winter or things that need to be fixed. My current landlord doesn't do anything to fix up the place here, I don't see what the difference would be! I'm already doing that for someone else's property!

I'm afraid there's things I don't know about owning property while renting rooms of it out. A former friend had a room mate that decided to stop paying rent and became a squatter and legally she couldn't evict them for not paying. I'm afraid of a situation like that happening, or other things I'm not prepared for. On the up side, if I bought a house I could get something close and live how I like with my pet there. I don't have a large income, but if I had room mates paying rent I think that would help cover costs I could not make on my own, and rather than rent that goes nowhere it would go into owning property. I wish I had a parent that knew about this stuff who I could talk to and give me advice but it's just me and my gecko. Maybe someone out there on Reddit can help me prepare for this? I've got a solid mind, I'm intelligent- I just don't have the experience or guidance. And I'm afraid of the unknown pitfalls I might run into. If I mess up? There's no one to save me, and I could end up homeless, unable to pay back that massive home loan, possibly worse. Right now? I have a few thousand in savings, and am considering a loan- before college I was approved for a home loan and I bet I still am. Should I do this?

I was working in sales, able to set my own schedule, no supervisor breathing down my neck, etc. I had at the time the resources to do whatever I wanted. I quit because my mom was spiraling down into even deeper alcoholism (she's been an alcoholic for over 23 yrs). I moved in with her and spend everyday taking care of her. She lives in one of the worst parts of town, bc she get's a housing voucher and they won't let her pay the difference to move to a better place. I actually got shot in her neighborhood last year and have changed a lot of stuff about myself as a result. I starting eating right, hitting the gym, etc. 

At this point I just want to get a new job and move away. The only thing is I know as soon as I do she will go right back to what she was doing before, as soon as I walk out that door. I've basically been living off my savings during this time, and it's finally starting to dwindle. On the upside I've become very frugal because of the circumstances and have managed to stretch my savings a lot further than I would've been able to before. 

Even though I'm happy to take of my mother, these last (almost) 2 years have really been a waste, bc she will not change. Please anyone that has been in my situation give me some advice/perspective. What should I do?

I know a few of you might say ""just leave"", or ""why don't you get her some help?"". I want to leave, I really do but Idk how I'll be able to reconcile the fact that I'm leaving her to spiral down even further. She doesn't want help, and I've talked to her caseworkers about possibly moving to a different part of town at least but if she goes beyond her current cap on rent she loses her housing voucher and the only places the voucher will cover are all in the worst part of town.

82,"The injury was actually a deep cut, deep enough to cut 8 tendons in my foot to my toes and require surgery. It looks like it's going to be casted for the next 5 weeks as non-weight bearing. After the cast is removed i will have rehab/physio for a period afterwards until my mobility and sensation is fully recovered.

I work at a desk all day, but my foot gets numb and progressively more uncomfortable as the day goes on, as it is supposed to be continuously elevated. I can only slightly elevate/extend it under my desk, call it 45 degrees for most of the day, but it's not enough. I've chosen to work from home where i can keep it rested properly all day, but it still impedes me from completing most remedial daily tasks without struggle.

Any ideas what typical group benefits would cover that could be helpful to me? Through a phone call they are fairly unhelpful at identifying the services they do provide unless i request it, but since i do not know what i need, i can't directly ask about the coverage of that service. If it helps at all, i am insured through Great West Life.

Anyways, just looking for any general advice, thanks a lot guys.",10Feb2018,1
83,"Hello Reddit!

Sorry if this isn't an appropriate subreddit, I’m sorta new to this.  I’ve lurked around but this is the first time that I’m actually posting something in hopes for some sort of resolution to my issue at hand.   There’s this girl that I work with and have feelings for, and I’m stuck in a weird spot where for the life of me I can’t determine if she’s interested in me or not.  

For a little bit of backstory, we’ve been working together for two years now, and due to schedule changes we started working together quite often.  We have been both talking and texting regularly for about 8 months.  She broke up with her long term boyfriend last spring and as far as I know it was pretty messy.  This is where I find things a little perplexing.

She knows I’m into her and I’ve asked her out on a date but she responded she’s not looking for anything right now.  That makes complete sense, and I’d be more than willing to accept that if that’s where it ended.  Unfortunately I feel like I constantly receive mixed signals from her such as being clearly jealous of other women, flirtatious/suggestive comments here and there, and simple things such as lighting up every time she sees me (these things have been pointed out by others as well, so I don’t think it’s likely that it’s all in my head).

I’ve asked my friends what they think of the situation, and they’re divided.  Some think she’s into me but not ready for a relationship, some think that she’s looking for a hookup, and some think she’s just stringing me along for attention.  Right now I don’t know what to think, so any and all advice is welcome and encouraged!

Tl;dr – Girl giving mixed signals and unsure if intent.  Should I pursue or nop?

84,"My mother has had this boyfriend for plenty of years. He is very manipulative and makes her feel like every situation is her fault. Today is the day I want to take action. It's my mother's birthday and she came home crying after a night out with him. She is always complaining about how he does nothing and I always say she should do something about it. She's too tied into the relationship because of the length it has gone on. He provides $300 a month for himself (an extremely obese person) and his son (near 30) to live here. That covers essentially nothing in terms of bills or groceries. The only thing really stopping her from breaking up with him aside from the time already stuck in the relationship is because she cannot drive in the winter (too snowy) and she has to commute 45 minutes to her job. She cannot get another job here as we live in such a small town and the pay is good with her current job. I'm trying to let her know that she could drive half the speed limit or lower as long as she compensates for the time by leaving earlier but she doesn't want to do anything. She keeps on saying she'll worry about it later (like every night) and I really just want to let her know how good her life could be without him.

I'm sorry for all of these probably out-of-order tid bits of information. It's fairly late and I just wanted to see what people thought I should do in this scenario.

Sorry for bothering you all!",10Feb2018,1
86,"So as a lot of people my age (20) I was brought up in a generation where the parents made it out to be that college is Paramount to having a successful life. I like to think that when it comes to mental discipline and work ethic, there aren't a lot of people at least in my age bracket that are with me besides my friend who I will talk about later in this post. Right now I'm in my third year of college where I major in civil engineering and am planning on graduating in 2020, all of it paid for through scholarships. I have a nice job at an engineering firm where I have been working at for 2 years being trained and paid fairly nicely. 

When I was starting out my freshman year I met who is now my best friend, he was a software engineering major at the time and one of the hardest and smartest workers I have met. Now he dropped out and is all self taught, and has multiple apps developed under his belt through Upwork and local businesses. And while doing this freelancing work he created an agency on Upwork and through that came up with an idea for a business, and he asked me to be apart of it. And since I joined I have helped expand upon his original idea tremendously to the point where we have a 5 year road map in the works with almost the first year already good to go minus some natural tweaks along the way. We will have an LLC obtained by the end of the month and we already have a website for our business and a facebook page I created in the last couple days. As well there's potential as of today to have a multi-million dollar investor to invest in the company.

Here's the business for anyone who is curious (I am not making this post with the purpose of plugging). The business is AlwaysHighLevel. It is a company that is focused around being a platform for freelancers to get higher paying jobs. I don't want to go into great detail but we plan on focusing with mobile app development at first then expanding into web design, photo design, video editing, mobile games, if there's a market for freelancing, we want to hit it eventually on top of doing in house work like app ideas and so on and so forth. I am willing to hear constructive criticism on this and go into more detail but I would rather be directed to another subreddit for that.

But yes, this is a project, this company I feel through both my friend and I's ambition, grit, work ethic, and people skills can go a long way and I don't know if I should stay in school because I wouldn't be able to give 100% focus to either or unless I don't sleep. I would still have my job at the engineering firm if I did drop out I just would lose potential for long term economic growth due to not getting my degree. 

So what are everyone's thoughts, should I stay in school, or pursue running this company?",10Feb2018,2

88,"(Disclaimer- not sure where this post would beat belong so if you see this and know a proper home for this post, let me know)

So I’ve had these feelings since I was in high school. It’s like a wave of I guess sadness or despair.  I’ll become hyper aware of my existence and that I’ll die at any moment. It passes after a few seconds but for a solid 30 seconds it’ll randomly hit me and it’s pretty depressing. As I’ve gotten older it’s revolves around my success as an adult, or lack there of. I have plans and wants for my life but they aren’t something that’ll happen overnight. So when I get these feelings l, on top of my mortality, they revolve around my current situation, which isn’t where I thought I’d be or would like to be.

89,"a little backstory. since I was young I've always been on mood-altering pills since I had anger issues and they believed I was schizophrenic when I was younger (I am not) 
the past two-ish years I've been cheeking my pills (hiding them in my mouth or hand till I can flush or dissolve them)
I do not need these pills. My grandad believes that I do and even though I've only taken these particular pills once or twice, he always says that he 'sees a difference in behavior' when I'm on my meds.
My grand plan is to keep this up till roughly June or August and then sit him down and tell him that I don't need the medicine because I've been perfectly fine without them. No suicidal thoughts, I'm generally content and every 'odd' mood in me is completely normal and justified. 

When I have taken these pills they fog my brain up and make me extremely tired, and also make it harder to breathe (like I can't breath enough to fill my lungs)

I had a good system going for a while, I had a sprite can filled with water and i told everyone it was filled with sugar water to lure ants and they shouldn't drink it because ants were in it. I used it to dissolve my pills but the other day my grandad cleaned out my desk and also threw away the can. I don't have another soda can (grandad doesn't buy soda anymore) and besides it's not the best.

Is there another way to dispose of them?",10Feb2018,4
90,"First off, this is a throwaway account because my daughter knows my main account and I honestly don't want her to find this before I have a chance to talk with her.


My daughter is 15 and she literally lives for space. The issue is she *really really* wants to become an astronaut. I am totally supportive of this, but due to medical reasons she would never pass a few of the tests. I just don't want her to be heart broken when/if the chance presents itself later in life. She's already been begging me to sign her up for a few programs that revolve around space and going up. One being the one that has the one way trip to mars or something like that. I honestly don't think this is a phase, she's always been fascinated by space. She longs to be up there, that's how much she loves it. 

Any space show, book, event, you name it she'll be there or have already watched or read it. 

Again, I know she'll be heartbroken but she's really passionate about it. So, what do I do? How do I approach it? Do I even approach this? I'm honestly not sure, I just don't want her hurt when that time comes.

I will set my alarm to wake up at 10:30AM on a Saturday, but just keep delaying the alarm 15 minutes at a time until around 12-1PM. Even then I just lay there in my phone for around 15min.

So far, I have like 3 friends at Uni and they are part of a larger social group which I am not, and they tend to hang out and do things together. I don't want to spend my time alone or aloof, but maybe I guess I feel somewhat intimidated by the fact that they have their own group and I don't. I want to be more social but I don't want to force myself or shoehorn myself into a group they already have. So what's the best way to become more social? I have joined a fencing club and had dinner with some people a while back, but haven't expanded on it yet for example. Whenever I see acquintances, I can't get up the courage to start a small convo, I start feeling kind of anxious. What's wrong with me? I'm just so bored at university.

I want to be more social but I've noticed I have an issue with regards to small talk.

95,"I'm in high school. My situation is compromised…just full of teenage drama. Long story short--

Because of some drama, people in my year—in my school, actually—don't really like me. I have friends outside of my school—I had a full group of friends for 2 years, but we separated. Last month, at one of my best friends' Christmas gathering, I met a new group of people. They're so much fun and I love hanging with them, so we hung for almost every day of the rest of the holiday. I wasn't sad about how everyone at school hated me anymore since I had these new friends. After 2 weeks, they were suddenly cold and withdrawn; then, the best friend I had met them through, told me that I don't ""fit in"" with them (1, since they are all girls and I am a boy), and how they've been best friends since elementary school, and I've only just met them (junior high) so I can't ""expect to be treated like a best friend"". I guess then since that, I haven't seen them since.

But I still see them posting on snapchat and having the time of their lives. I have almost no friends to hang with anymore without them — I do, maybe 2 or so, but they're just not as fun as the others. With the other people—we did a lot of crazy stuff, but it was just fun, like clubbing, or screaming and making a racket anywhere we go…but the thing is, they could have just as much of fun ANYWHERE they go…be it the mall, a restaurant, someone's house…they were just never bored and never in a ""down"" mood.

I feel like with any other friends in my school, I'm always left out, or if I'm hanging with them, there's so much time where everyone's just on their phone, or they're just sitting there doing nothing.

I don't know how to feel or what to do…any help appreciated…thanks",10Feb2018,2
97,"SO firstly a little history. I do work in IT, I do support for a backup product. I've been working there for little over a year. I started out at the bottom of our ranks and slowly but surely climbed up to about mid-tier(before we start entering T2 territory). However, I didn't like the pace I was going at and wanted to go further and so I started exploring other avenues for knowledge. Some time went on and my co-workers/bosses started asking me to do more work for different products. Now I've got no qualms with this as I love my work, I love my job, I love everything about the IT field, this is my career path after-all(despite me stopping school due to time &gt;.&gt;). But in recent weeks/months I feel as though they've been taking advantage of me. 

I do a lot in a simple day, first thing I do, come in, sit down, start going through my email while simultaneously checking our customers appliances. and answering questions my fellow technicians have for me, meanwhile I'm also responding to emails about how mad certain customers are about X and Or Y for the specific product they have me supporting. I also have to keep a constant eye on the escalations for that product as not many support it and thus I am (in essence) the only one keeping an eye on it (Unless I start a fire) Ontop of all this I need to take calls from our que constantly, and I have to remain in almost constant contact with our engineer working said escalations, as well as taking cases from other techs to work on them, AND touching every opened case in my name in a day, which is usually 20-30 (Not counting the escalations, and edge issues). IN my position, this is far from normal. Someone where I am at is not supposed to be this involved with everything. My job description simply says I should take calls, and that is that. Nothing more, nothing less. However, once again, I love my work. 

Now, I addressed these concerns to a higher up, asking if it is possible to be fast tracked to the position in which doing these tasks would be normal for that rank, I got declined as their higher up would instantly decline it and I would be forced to essentially wait the extra year (Or longer even as these processes can take months before they officially go through) my boss said he wouldn't blame me if I stopped doing the extra work as, he agrees my rank says I shouldn't be doing it, but I do anyway because of my skill-set and my ability to quickly pick things up. Right now, my long term goal is to eventually become an engineer, but for right now, I would love to be paid for the work I do, and be compensated appropriately. However, given the way they handle things it doesn't seem I'm going to get that, now I'm unsure how I should progress. I don't want to stop doing the extra work as it is very good knowledge to have, interesting issues appear and they're always special and particular and I find nothing more enjoyable than troubleshooting an issue from top to bottom, and fully understanding how it works. BUT, I also feel I should be paid properly, and not be stiffed. 

What should I do? keep my mouth shut and keep going? find a new job and quit? bide my time?? I'm honestly opened for any and all advice here. 

tl;dr I do alot of extra work outside my position and they won't promote me to where doing it would be normal.

99,"I’ve been bottling this up for a while and I needed a place to let it out. So I’ve been dating this girl for 2years. We were close and had an amazing relationship until the last few months. We have the same friends and I’m from a small town so everyone knows everyone. The thing about our relationship was that everyone liked us being a couple. They would compare themselves to us and I would always put her needs over mine. I never argued with her, never lost my temper, never hit her, or treated her badly. When she would want to argue I’d always calm down and try to rationalize things because she was my partner, my girlfriend, my other half. The last 2 months she wasn’t herself and not the person I once knew so like anyone normal person would do I tried to save the relationship and figure out my feelings. Ultimately I got to the point where if I wasn’t happy then I didn’t need to worry myself about it and hopefully she would understand. We broke up but she didn’t understand my side and was promptly refusing to believe anything. She said I shouldn’t have ever dated her, that I was the worse, insults ect. So what she does is begin to slam me. For the next 2-3 months she insulted me, talked trash about me to MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY, and made things impossible because they always asked why did you break up, why were you so mean, and why don’t you get back together. All my friends were on her side and couldn’t see it my way and see my feelings. All she wanted was to get back together after all the shit she talked about me. 4th month after the breakup we get back together. She’s claimed to be changed and she really wants to try again. We do and it was good the first month and then I was back to the same problem. I wasn’t happy. So I talked to her about it and she just couldn’t accept it and instead of trying to help she says that I’m a no good person and don’t deserve to be her boyfriend and that I’m treating her unfairly. Another 2 weeks goes by and we break up. I’m not getting back with her again. But she’s gone around and started talking shit behind my back. All my friends are on her side and I can’t have a conversation with another girl or try to date because she has completely destroyed my name and my reputation by telling bullshit about our relationship.

100,"I'm wondering if any could tell me stories of you getting past the issue I'm struggling with, and any advice how to make it easier for me.

My issue is, how my bad past relationship experiences (which were also my only experiences with relationships) taints my current one.  

~my personal experience~
Well, I always desired a relationships, and I was very insecure.  I was so blind that I left a few guys lead me on and well, get used to sex.. abandoned after.  This, well it really warped my view on love, I had such high hopes but people used a guise of love in order to get what they wanted.  Then, I had my first long-ish term relationship, but I don't know if you could even call it that.  It was on and off again for a year, he'd only give me affection if he wanted something, he used it as a tool for his benefit.  Like, if he disappeared for a week, he could manage to get me back if he told me how much he loved me blah blah blah, and would be nice for a week and then continue to ghost me, and would say really horrible things to me if I demanded respect.. he'd threaten to break up with me and stuff.. and if I was the one to break up with him he wouldn't take it serious and would make fake accounts to readd me on social media, and like the insecure, and love seeking girl I was, I'd go back.  It's so strange how, someone can convince you they're good for you but treat you like a pile of garbage.  He would only call me his girlfriend if I was breaking up with him, but any other time he wouldn't clarify what we were.  Oh, and 3 months in he mentioned he had a few kids.  (I was 18 at the time) Somehow though, I think I understand him more after this... torture.  Like, he probably just made me suffer, because people in his past made him suffer?  I wanna completely forgive him, so I can move on.  

I am in a relationship with a guy who honestly cares and loves me right now, but the past emotions are creeping up on me.  I have so much emotional turmoil going on inside me all the time, and... I'm irritable and am constantly feeling panicky. We started out long distance, and these problems started showing up after 2 months or so, I almost gave up but then, we met IRL and my past issues really weren't much of an issue when we were together in real life, but now we're long distance again for a few months, and it's constant.  (We're from different countries) I have like, compulsive bad thoughts... I'm constantly doubting and worrying, I'm afraid to trust him fully, even though in my head I know he loves me and cares deeply for me.. but if *OMG* he doesn't say I love you one time before bed it truly affects me even though I know it's ridiculous.  I always want more time with him, but well, we can't play video games/skype all the time.  So it's hard. My past trauma comes up all the time, and it ruins me and my negative emotions really bring him down, and he really doesn't understand that I can't just... stop.  I've been trying my hardest to think rationally and I even started writing down my thoughts and reflecting on them, but I still have panic attacks and breakdowns fairly often.  He isn't the best at communicating... but that shouldn't be enough of a reason for me to have this emotional reaction. All I gotta do is wait 2 months but, sometimes it feels like I'm not going to make it.  I will, because I love him and want to be with him, but I really have to find better ways to cope with this instability.

I just, want to know... what helped other people in this situation.  Because, self reflection, yoga, and trying to think positive are only taking me so far.  How do I take all these emotions left behind from my past relationships, and tell them to gtfo unless they're actually relevant to the situation?  How can I trust after having my trust broken so many times...?  ",10Feb2018,1

105,"So I live across the street from this pool hall. Met an older gentleman (65-75 yrs old) who lost his wife six months ago (I'm 27). We started playing pool together and I really enjoy it and I know he does as it fills the void of his dead wife. The only thing is, he REALLY enjoys it. Like, if anyone tries to talk to me or shoot pool with me he gets very defensive. Like yells at them to fuck off so just me and him can play. He hits on me hard like, a few times he's gotten handsy and has even asked if he could get me a Valentine's gift. I said no. In the past he's gotten me gifts and has even waited outside my apartment to make sure I'd shoot pool with him that evening. I'm fine with some casual friendship and occasionally shooting pool once or twice a week, but tonight he kind of made me VERY uncomfortable. Tonight, a guy asked me if I wanted to smoke outside with him and I said yes. He basically chased him out And told him to fuck off then went to me and told me that if I wanted to shoot pool with him then I was with HIM and had no business with other guys. Thing is I wasn't there with him  I walked over on my own and didn't even  tell him I'd be there to meet up  we just ran into each other. I feel like if I break things off or tell him I'm not ok with him behaving like that, he won't react well. He mentioned once he owned guns (casually, not in a threatening way it just came  up) and that scares me. We've been shooting pool a few months now but now I'm starting to get weirded out by his behavior.........what do I do??

I've thought about passively putting distance between us. Like when I go there maybe I'll try to sit at the bar and do my own thing, maybe play a game or two then go back to the bar and talk to friends. Just so he knows that I'm not there with HIM only. Because some nights I'll meet him there (telling him to meet me at a certain  time) and we'll shoot pool all night just me  and him, and he seems to think that means that every single time I go, I have to only hang out with him. Like it's one thing if I invite him  over there to be with him, I get that I shouldnt ditch him. But when I don't even invite him and walk over on my own and just happen to run into him, I feel I have no obligation to make sure I'm not ditching him because it's not a date!! I can just see this developing into a very bad situation if I don't make a move soon. ",10Feb2018,2

One of my colleagues is the same age as me (we're the youngest in the company, the other ones are 10 to 15 years older than us) and I feel like he'd like us to be friends to an upper level when I want to separate my professional life from my private life. Recently he told me several times that we should go out for drinks after work, and even party together on week-ends maybe, to which I stayed evasive not to hurt his feelings. I'm being nice to him because this is how I am with people in general but I don't particularly like him, I have little in common with him and I don't want to be friend with any of my coworker. Going out for drinks once in a while with the whole team is ok, but that's it. How to deal with that kind of situations, I don't want to ruin the atmosphere in the office but I want him to understand that I don't want to hang around with him ?

They filmed me in my house and they shared the video with as many people as possible. Surprising thing is, the people who saw that video never reported this to the police. Well, they are not messenger of justice anyway. But somehow, they think it's okay. I don't know who's worse though but I don't care any more.



But the criminals are mental patients who need to get serious lobotomy since no drugs were proven to help them with their grave mental illness, and they have nothing better to do than just picking on me, who is a total stranger to them.

117,"Good morning, afternoon, or evening to whoever is reading this post! Basically, my head has been spinning and I would greatly appreciate some advice--I think I'm in the right place. :-)

Allow me to preface my story by saying that I went straight to a community college after graduating high school. I felt that I'd already sort of compromised my goals there, as I worked extremely hard in order to get into various universities, but ultimately felt that saving money and having the opportunity to live at home while still receiving my general education had too many advantages to discredit it as an option.

Fast forward two years and I am now in the process of finishing up my fourth semester at a community college in order to transfer to a four year university for my bachelor's degree. I hear back about whether or not I will be offered admission from the universities that I applied to in March. 

In one of my classes last semester I was required to do a sort of capstone, for lack of a better word. Essentially, I was to interview an individual who held a job title that I might aspire to be. Passionate about the hospitality industry and desiring a career in the field, this led me to setting up a meeting with a resort manager at one of ten triple five star hotels, as rated by Forbes Travel Guide--because if you're going to try and be the best, you need to learn from the best, right?

Long story short, after my meeting with the manager for a school project, I was invited to submit my resume and pursue a position with the company. Starstruck, I felt as though I'd be a fool to say no. So, I submit an application, and four interviews later, was hired to one of their restaurants that has helped them to earn their triple five star rating. 

So, here's where I'm stuck. If I choose to transfer to a university in the fall like I had originally planned, I will only garner about six months' experience at this property. However, being 19 and it only being my second year in community college, I'm wondering if it would be lucrative for me to take a gap year before transferring in order to move around and gain further experience at this phenomenal resort. Or, do I continue the path to my education and explore joining the company after I obtain my degree--if that is even an option.

My parents are my support system and I am getting two wildly different reactions. My mother is very supportive and excited for me, thinking that I should consider spending a longer period of time at the property while I can. My father, on the other hand, thinks that I have already made a mistake by working there in the first place. I have taken a decrease in my hourly rate in order to gain this experience, but this is because the job title as a hostess is much different than where my previous workplace had me after several promotions. Also, it is about a 45 minute drive from my house whereas my previous job was only 5 away. (If I decide to stay with the company, I am already looking at several housing options that are about 10 minutes away.) Furthermore, ,my father says that I should finish my education like I had planned, and worry about jobs later. 

I appreciate both perspectives, but feel that I need to receive some objective, unbiased responses, so please, lay it on me!

118,"Lately I have no desire whatsoever to study. I go to class and it's almost as if I'm not even there. The teacher talks and the words he's saying are just floating in the air. I have no interest to study.

I don't know if it's my fault for feeling this way or it's because I don't like what I'm studying now. Mom told me I should do this course, she 'chose for me'.

It's different from laziness. I've been lazy in the past but the desire to study didn't really disappear back then. I was able to stay concentrated in High School and got fairly decent grades.

How do I motivate myself to study something I don't like? I don't want to leave the course now, mom's gonna be very disappointed with me if I do. I want to at least finish this year with all subjects passed and I'll think of something else to study afterwards, something I'm more interested in.

121,"There's a woman who work with. She's not the type I'm usually interested in, which is probably a good thing. She's quite shy and reserved like me. Anyway, lately I keep thinking I'm catching her looking at or smiling at me across the office - she sits about 10/15 feet away from me. I'm conscious I've been doing the same, or trying to avoid her gaze just as much.

We seemed to have a moment last week where I was waiting for someone outside and she was leaving. I smiled at her and couldn't stop myself holding this for a good five seconds or so and she smiled back with lingering eye contact. Other times that we talk there does seem to be some sort of awkward tension there.

I'm asking for advice because I'm still inexperienced when it comes to this sort of thing and to be honest probably have some sort of anxiety. I had a chance to talk to her yesterday but she was with someone so I chickened out. 

Other things that stick out are her saying my name in a happy way when she saw me in the kitchen. When we have worked on a project together now and again, when she has come over to my desk, she has knelt down to talk to me and look at me, rather than get a chair or stand. She's also seen me walking to work sometimes and said she thought about giving me a lift (but didn't) and been interested in where I live.

Things that make the situation a bit complicated is that I did ask her friend out who no longer works there about a year ago, who there did seem to be mutual interest with (but we didn't date), and the fact we're obviously colleagues. I do have her on Facebook though, so I was thinking of messaging her and seeing how things go before maybe asking her out for coffee/something casual.

133,"Hi Reddit

Last week I had some heartbreaking news that a close friend and neighbor had decided to take their own life. My neighborhood has a really strong sense of community, so it's really rocked us to our foundations. We're immensely sociable, and my friend (not wanting to use names) was immensely central to that.

Around ten years ago my friend had (mutually) cut off all ties with his family following a court case. I believe that in such time there has been no contact with his mother or sister and very limited contact with his father. 

I heard on the grapevine this morning that his family are wanting a private funeral without any of his friends and neighbors present. 

We're all struggling deeply with their choice, some who knew his parents have tried to make the case for a more inclusive ceremony but it seems to have made no impact.

I'm not actually sure what I'm asking for advice on at this point - I don't expect to be able to change their minds at this point. We're all very weary of turning up to a funeral and causing any sort of discord which would detract from celebrating the life of a friend. I really don't know whether to be angry, upset, grudgingly respect their decision or what. The only thing I know is that it's very very unlikely that this is what my friend would have wanted.",10Feb2018,4
134,"I am an Australian student currently enrolled in a double degree that is business specialist (banking and finance) and arts (psychology) at Monash university here in Melbourne Australia. As the title says, I'm an Australian student about to start my first year of university in a couple weeks and I want to practise law in the US and New York specifically.





As I see it I currently have 3 options:







Option 1 is to do a bachelor of laws at Monash university which is quite good ranked the 23rd best law school in the world at least according to this list I found: https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/law-legal-studies this would be the easiest option for me as I will have the marks required and won't have to do the LSAT. As far as I'm aware some states need a JD degree in order to become fully licensed however New York does not, so this should be fine





Option 2 is to finish my undergraduate before doing a JD at Melbourne law school which is a top 10 law school in the world so very good. This is a tad bit more difficult as it involved doing the LSAT and I'm not guaranteed a government supported loan to pay for law school. Also it will take longer as I will have to do an undergrad then post grad.






Option 3 is much more difficult which would be to go to law school in the US. I would need to convince my parents to help me pay for this which they can definitely afford but my family is not one to give out free handouts. Especially since they've spent around $300,000 on my private school education and that is they're big gift to me. I don't know if I will be able to secure loan or scholarships. However if I'm able to show them I can get into a good law school they might be willing. Also in Australia universities give you entry based purely of academic merit while as far as I know US schools will look at your extracurricular and such. Also law school costs a lot more in the US than here in Australia.







After going to law school in Australia I believe it takes one extra year of school in order to adjust to the US system. But after I do this will I be able to practise law in New York the same as somebody who went to Columbia or NYU or other law schools interstate? 





In Australia an undergraduate law degree and a JD are treated exactly the same however I have read that in the US a JD is much more preferred compared to an llb. Is this true?




And since if I go to law school in Australia learning the Australian law system will too law firms not even consider me despite going to  a very good law school such as Monash or UoMelbourne?






Which of these 3 options is most feasible in being able to practise law in New York (hopefully at a top law firm)? Any advice would be appreciated. ",10Feb2018,1

I am living very close to paycheck to paycheck whereas before I had a good cushion.  Every time we do this I get my hopes up and then my heart broken.  I could go on but I have to go in to work (work in hospital).  I want to be supportive but I feel like I am in too much to be any help.

About an hour ago, three coworkers and a random guy showed up to pick up their cars after a night out. They came in and I found them in one of our dorms and the random guy was petting one of our protection dogs. Not only was this really inappropriate, had the guy been bitten it would have been a huge liability to the company. I kicked them out and they all seemed pretty upset about it. 

Now, one of my coworkers and I used to hang out, and I divulged some secrets i would rather my boss not know about me to her. Some time after, I discovered she spread rumors like wildfire and slowly distanced myself from her. 

I want to tell my boss, but I think it will probably get these three girls fired and I don't want the coworker I used to hang out with spilling secrets about me to get even.

I want to know if I am over blowing it or whatever. 
There have been a few instances where he has been a total butt. 

The first was regarding me being on my phone. I was reading an article on how close we are to getting to mars. I am a nighttime cashier, not much going on however he did say, and I quote 'seeing you on your phone pisses me off and if I see you on it again I will coach you'. 

I know I was in the wrong, but I would of rather of taken the coaching then threatened like that. 

The second time of note I was in the break room with my boyfriend. Now here comes the interesting part. I asked the support manager if it was okay and he had told me it was as long as I took the correct entrance to the break room which I did. 

When my manager entered the room, with his back to me, he said 'you're lucky you're night time because if my higher ups saw him I'd be in trouble'. 

So I went back to the support manager and told him what happened. He came back to me the next day saying it was okay and that he had talked to a day time manager and the store owner and both had verified that it was okay. 

Now the last one happened tonight and it is a bit tricky. A higher position has opened up for me and two other people. T and J. T is pretty emotional and not very mature. She called off today because of relationship issues and while going to the back my manager said that my interview would be tomorrow. 

I had previously asked for tomorrow off as a paid day because I wanted to be at a party for my boyfriend because he is leaving for boot camp on Monday. I had a week and a half notice and my request was denied because they needed 3 weeks notice. So I was going to call in. And I told him that. 
With a smile he said 'oh that doesn't sound very good against T'. 

Now at this point we both know T isn't getting the job. It's a no brainer. And I get it. HOWEVER I've called in 4 times in the entire year I have been there. And one time was due to a scheduling error where I needed a Saturday off and they got the wrong one. He brought up the fact that I took that Saturday off they had put me down despite things, but I was covering my own ass. I am an cashier. I go by the schedule because missing days are important not just due to missing hours but because any unapproved days count against us.

I work at a casino as a bartender, a week ago we've gotten a notice in the backroom that a person told our manager that someone from the bartender team was smelling bad. Now I shower daily, wear clean clothes and dont usually end up smelling bad from sweating, but I have a problem with my feet smelling pretty bad after a while, we work 12 hour shifts and after some hours I can smell myself and Im afraid he was reffering to me in the notice, some help on how to get not-smelly feet after 10 hours of walking in shoes?

I can easily get my daily schoolwork done in a couple hours. 



The only problem is that I want time to myself, and I have never had a job before so I don't know how everything works.... Plus I'm terrible at time management so I'm afraid that I will get behind in school.

166,"Oh god, here we go again. Another post in this forum. Ugh.

Recently, there was a huge fight in my family (like an hour ago). It started last night (but the root of the problem goes back fourteen years). My dad is the one who teaches us this language and we (my sister and i) were learning it when he found out that we forgot the last unit. So he was already mad but didn't do anything beyond saying ""you're bad students"" and ""im not going to teach you, there's no point"". 

Okay, that's normal, just fyi.

Then this morning, I was supposed to wake up at like 8. But I didn't, I was sooo tired. My dad got mad and started getting physical (he grabbed onto my arm and shit). Then my mom was like ""stop, it's the morning, leave her alone, I'll make her get up"" but my dad got mad at HER, too. I got up and walked away and my mom was still arguing with my dad when he SLAPPED HER ON HER FUCKING FACE.

That. makes. me. mad. 

Like, okay, maybe it's fine to be mad at me and hit ME, because I was the one who started this, but my mom had NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING. What. the FUCK???!! SO i screamed at my dad and he got mad at me and he slapped me and I yelled things.

Then my sister woke up and yelled at me, too, because I was the cause of everything bad in the family...

My sister is right. Even my mother said before that she and my dad were happy before I was born and started causing problems... and then there's this girl who told me that she wasn't my therapist because I told her my problems... then this guy told me I was too clingy (I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HIS GF OR ANYTHING, JESUS CHRIST)... then... I caused a fight between my friends by telling one of them what the other said about her... to top it all off, I'm ugly, fat, and really bad at anything and everything. I should also mention that I'm loud, outspoken, and have strong opinions...

You what I want? I want to be a quiet, hardworking girl. I want to never ask for my mom to make my favorite dish ever again. I want to become submissive and do whatever my parents tell me without complaint. I want to be a quiet add-on to this family, because evidently, as my grandfather said one day, I'm a poisonous virus in this family. And it's true. I cause problems because I'm stubborn and shit.. and oh my god... 

ALSO, I've liked being outspoken. I want my opinions to be heard. I want to prove people wrong. I've always looked down on quiet people because i thought they were scaredy cats. Now I should become one? How does being quiet set me apart from the crowd? Especially when 'quiet girl' is practically a cliche???

I hope you can give me advice, sorry for the messy post, I hope you can find which questions I'm asking. I'm a fourteen year old indian girl, for background.

173,"I’m 21 and my mom (47) is dying, and I’m kind of at a loss here on what to do. Not so much with the death itself and grieving, but with my dad and my younger sister.

My mom has been ill since I was 15 due to complications from diabetes. She has stage V kidney failure, and has been slowly deteriorating since she first went to the hospital in 2013. She has been in and out of the hospital and other medical facilities since. In the past year, she has had both legs and two fingers amputated. Recently it has become very difficult for her to breathe.

Last night she called all of us (my brother, sister, and dad) up here to tell us that she is just tired of fighting. She is in so much pain, her quality of life has hit an all time low, and the doctors have told her, and us, that there is no more options and that dialysis would only postpone the inevitable. She has decided to discontinue her dialysis treatment, and to have the medical staff start taking comfort measures. She is talking to her doctor today to confirm everything, and after that she will begin only taking pain medication. She has a week at most.

It has been so painful watching her die. This woman raised me and pushed me my whole life to always do my best in everything I pursue. That being said though, there is a small part of me that is relieved that she will soon no longer be in pain and she can finally let go. I love my mom and I don’t want to see her go, but this is her decision and she’s been fighting way longer than anyone I know could have fought. 

My dad is a complete wreck. He’s also 47, but the stress and the anxiety (which he struggles with, as well as clinical depression) has aged him hard these past few years. He has been having severe problems with his blood pressure lately, his hair is starting to go grey, and this whole situation has just been kicking his ass. 

My sister (16) is also not doing well. She struggles with depression and anxiety as well, and has had a history of panic attacks. She is taking this really hard, which is normal, but I worry about her. She has other problems going on in her life, and with those on top of the situation with my mom, she is having such a hard time coping with all of this. 

I feel like my life is at this permanent stand still. My mom was like the centerpiece of my extended family, and I just have this weird feeling that we’ll all just drift apart after my mom dies. My mom would not want that, and I feel this strange duty to be the one who keeps everyone together. I feel like the life I knew is shattering before my eyes and that the whole world is caving in on me. Sometimes I’m okay, but since last night I just have this feeling of dread, and all of these new fears.

177,"Thanks for taking some time to read this. 

I always avoid making friends because I can’t accept people’s bad habits and fear they’ll influence me negatively. A handful of my friends in the past have gone astray with alcoholism or frequent use of (soft) drugs, resulting in failing school or not upholding commitments. I enjoy drinking socially (and moderately) and very rarely smoke weed. I prefer intimate gatherings to parties. 

It took me a very long time to detach from them and their often negative mindsets. I’ve been feeling very lonely though and I’m trying to make new friends. However, no one is perfect, especially in our early 20’s. Sometimes I feel like I’m over-estimating the influence of others on my own life. I feel like if I make room for people with bad habits, I’ll be lured into their lifestyle. 

Ex: I quit hanging out with my friends who smoke cigarettes because I used to smoke a pack a day and quit and I know they smoke a lot and I’d be tempted. I quit hanging out with my friend who can’t keep a commitment for the life of her. I quit hanging out with my friends who watch too much TV and feel like they have no agency over their lives. I quit hanging out with my friend who would spend too much money and would convince me that I need to change my appearance to be liked. I quit hanging out with my friend that doesn’t like to work (very verbal about it) and that quit school (believes College is a sham). 

I feel guilty from walking away from these people, especially since they’re good people.

185,"I met someone on Tinder around Thanksgiving. I liked hanging out with her but we never really saw each other more than once a week and texted each other maybe every other day. I was uncertain how I felt about her/getting serious with someone in general. We've never had the ""what are we/what are your intentions"" talk, and I don't know how she's been describing me to her friends (I've been calling her ""this girl I've been seeing"", but I don't know how I would feel about being called someone's boyfriend).

This past week or so, we start seeing each other more often (but I think that's because there's been way more social events; I threw a party, the super bowl, the super bowl parade, etc.), and maybe it's because I've been stressed out by a bunch of stuff lately but I've been kind of pissy about little things she was doing and didn't really want to hang out with her all the time, even though I still liked her. 

So then the other girl comes along. She's a friend of mine from college that I had a giant crush on for a long time (never made a move because I'm not comfortable doing that/thought it would make the friend circle weird), and when she's leaving a moving party at my place she tells me ""Hey my boyfriend and I are open, and if you're ever not dating that girl we should get drinks sometime. I've thought you were pretty cute for a while."". This throws me for a loop but I try to get on with my life.

A couple days ago, me and the girl I've been dating have hung out basically every other day. It's been good times, but after a couple hours I'm always thinking ""ok this was fun but it's time for some alone time"", which I'm not sure is how I should feel if I wanna be serious with someone. The girl I've been seeing goes out of town for a week, the other girl asks me to get drinks again, I meet up with her, it's a fun time, one thing led to another and then we're hooking up in my bedroom (we didn't have sex. she asked if we could walk to the store and get condoms and I think that was enough of a hurdle where I could use my brain and say no). 

After everything settled down and she went home, I was talking about it with my roommate (who I'm pretty sure thinks I'm a scumbag for what I did but he doesn't want to say it) and then the reality set in that if I want to keep seeing the girl I've been dating then I REALLY fucked up. I know we never talked about exclusivity/""what are we"" but maybe that kind of stuff is implied when you're seeing someone and I totally didn't realize that. I want to get it off my chest and be honest with her, because if she wants to be serious then she *has* to know before we go any further (part of ""informed consent""). But I also can't tell if it's some kind of subconscious thing in me that all I *really* want is to just offload this guilt and pain onto somebody else, which is a really shitty thing to do.

So basically I'm not sure what to do:

1. When she comes back to town, I basically just straight up say ""Hey I hooked up with someone else and I'm really sorry, you need to know, etc. etc."" and pray everything doesn't blow up in my face.

2. Ask her ""so what are we/what are your intentions/how do you feel about exclusivity?"". If she says that she wants to basically be boyfriend/girlfriend, the tell her about the hookup; if she's like ""let's just be casual"", then keep my mouth shut.

3. Keep my mouth shut and pray I can live with the shame.

189,"I'm at a moment where I want to breakup with my girlfriend and leave my job to start my own company.
I'm going to deliver the reasons why in a couple of chronological stages. I seriously need help to figure out if this is really a good idea. 

Before living in together 

We started living together because we lived quite apart, and every weekend 
I had to do almost 160 km by car to see her. 
Not to mention we both lived with our parents so we really did not have any intimacy. 
And I had to sleep at her parents house in the sofa. 
A couple of months before trying to find an apartment I had seen a couple of red flags,
She really wanted to take over the relationship and dictate me what to do, what to eat, what to wear, to help her in the her mother house to clean and stuff. 
She convinced herself that I'm not stylish  or healthy, so unless she was eating anything bad I could not eat it. She once had a breakdown because I ate 1 1/2 croissant (i know), I could not have my alone time ( I'm a programmer, and i like to have a whole day for me programming), so i had to negotiate with her time that I have to program, which is ridiculous. 

Because of this we had being fighting more and more prior to the moving in together, looking back, moving in together was a big mistake, but at the time we thought that that was the solution to our problems. 

Finding in the apartment

Now finding the apartment to rent was not the hard part we had more or less the same idea, a nice and cozy one, 
near the city we worked. We found one a bit near hear parents, but I don't mind. The problem here was that i had some money i saved until that time, way more then her. She wanted to force me to merge of our bank accounts, justifying that if we are going to move in together everything I had had to be merged with her, and vice-versa. I thought that's too soon, we should do everything separately. So she really fighted a lot, ending the relationship for a moment, but in the end she came back with conditions and she specifically said that she would not contribute as much to the furniture of the house ( we had to buy everything new ). So I bought 80 % or 90 % of everything in the house that's almost 5 k dollars.

During the living in together

So we have been living together for a couple of months, and the fights are non stop, we fight during work by text, we fight at home, we fight because she wants me to go to her parents, but that she doesn't want to go to mine. 

Last week she left the cinema, because i ate popcorn, and that was irritating to her, even though she ate it to at first, almost 80% of it we ate together. Oh no, but the last one I could not eat by myself. And she just asked me if she could leave, even though i went there, because of her, she wanted to go there because at that time there was a huge traffic from her workplace to home. She said she wasn't mad at me, but that fact i ate popcorn just got on her nerves and had to leave the cinema. 

Just to remind I'm not fat in anyway, my bmi is 22.1 which is as normal it could be. 

We fight again for the reasons mentioned before, but now more, because WE LIVE TOGETHER. So i could not eat cookies sometimes for example. 

During this fights she ended everything a couple of times, but always came back. She breaks up with me for almost nothing, last time it was because I had spent more time in my mothers house then what she thought it would. But always comes back. 

She says she is depressed with life, used to be a student with no worries, and last year she was abroad which was amazing for her. So now after we move in, she wants to move out of the country, i have to decide about that in a couple of days. 

I really liked her at the beginning, we had a nice thing going but every fight, and lately every-time she says she wants to end and it takes a huge toll on the relationship, I don't think I like her anymore, I see her and see a really crazy person. 

Also, I really wanted to quit my programming job and start working full time in my ideas. Always wanted to do that, never had the guts, but know i grown a sense of what the hell. She doesn't agree with my so naturally its another argument to end with her. 

So guys I know it is long, keep in mind that I loved her at the beginning but right now, it is just a toll in my life, I'm just worried that I breakup and regret doing that.

Thanks so much!",10Feb2018,1
193,"This is my first time posting so bare with me. 
I am a 20 year old guy. Right out of high school I went into the army but was injured during training and separated. After I got home, I moved away to school. The first day, I met my now ex girlfriend. We have been together for a year and half and basically done everything together. We are so comfortable with each other and have a real genuine connection. I see her at marriage material. 
Anyways, I was attending a small private school so the cost was ridiculous. I simply couldn’t afford it. So I dropped out, even after having a 4.0 after the first year. Since then I have been working different jobs.. carpentry, electrical. I have hated it so much. I am not a “tradesman” and need to go to school as my dream is to become a nurse. 
That is when I decided I wanted to go back into the army. I have always felt a need to serve my country and have always wanted to enlist. Also once I got out I would have my schooling paid for as well as living expenses.(which is ideal because I have no parental support) 
I told my girlfriend yesterday I wanted to enlist, which I have talked about with her before, she has known I was interested in it. She was really mad and upset, which I understand. But she said she is not even willing to try to stay together. I know its not ideal but I figured if someone loves me and wants to marry me some day, they would at least TRY to make things work. At least then we could say we tried. My enlistment will most likely only be 3-4 years.. She broke up with me for wanting to make a better future for myself and follow my dreams. I just wish she were supportive. But I also understand how difficult it would be for her. 

So I have a choice.. I can go in the military and go to school once im out, or I can try and go back to the school I was attending and stay with her. Which by the time I’m done I would have over 100k in student loans.. 
Many people have told me if she really loved me as much as she says she does, she would be willing to at least try. I am really heartbroken because I did see a future with her. But I feel like if I dont go the army I will not be successful..
So, I am just asking for some insight and opinions on the situation and what I should do.

196,"I DMed this girl for her number on Instagram, she gave me it. I Feel we always been flirty and work, she touches me, we talk good like it seems good.

quick background of what happened before I got her number: I asked her if she was doing anything last week she was out of town and supposed to let me know when she was back on Sunday so we could plan something. Sunday came and I never got anything so I messaged her if she wanted to go to (x). She didn't read my DM until the next day an hour before her shift when we saw each other.

Then I asked for her number in person, she was busy and I told her she was cute and asked for her number. She was smiling but like in shock and said yeah when I go take this (item) real quick. (we clean tables lol that's why).. anyways she came back and told me she forgot it but would send me it after her shift on Instagram. She didn't I guess she forgot because she gets out at midnight, I left at 5. Yesterday we see each other and she said she forgot, I said its cool basically lol and I asked for it last night. I got it at like 2:30 am.
I texted her “Hey it’s (my name)”

And I DMed saying “litttt I’ll send u a text so u know it’s me”

I also saw her on my snap Quick add by number and added her. This was at 3 A.M.

It was 10 AM when she added me back on snap, and IG DM says seen. Do I still text her like today if I want to make plans today?

I feel she likes me it's like obvious but i mean girls are strange now adays to understand anything, i almost gave up lol. Still trying to shoot my shot basically.",10Feb2018,1

201,"Hey all ! So I have been single for quite some time and Im kind of a weirdo (I know all people are different and stuff) but I prefer to spend my time at home doing random shit like playing video games,watching animes and the usual no lifer stuff . 

I have been like this my entire life with some minor changes where I had a 3 yr long relationship and the girl I was with was a gamer as well so basically I did the same thing but we did it together . 

Ive been wanting to have a relationship for the last few months but Im having an issue to find a good partner or atleast a partner that shares my activities since I cant go out in a disco and expect to find a gamer girl there cause she will probably do the same thing as me stay home and play games/watch animes etc. etc.

I know that this is probably a stupid topic since most people will just make fun of me for being single for like 5 yrs and not touching a girl for that time. 

But in this time that Ive spent alone Ive learned a lot of things about myself and I have certainly growned into being a better and stronger individual Im not ashamed of anything and Im not sorry for the decisions Ive made until this moment of my life . 

So you are all probably asking why Im sharing these personal things and explaining all this, the reason being is that I want to find a partner like me, I dont want a partner that will make me go out on coffee's or make me go to the disco when I do not like such activities I just see that as a waste of time and I prefer being alone than with someone like that as stupid as it sounds I dont mind meeting new people but I dont like having one night stands with girls that I know only their names for me such a thing means disrespect towards yourself and the person that you are having the one night stand with .

For the people that think that Im complaining, no Im not complaining I have a roof over my head, I have food to eat, I have money, my parents support me with most of my endeveaours,Im well aware of the fact that there are people that dont even have a relationship their entire life but that is their decision I just have these random moments in which I feel sad and depressed that I dont have that special person next to me with whom I can just sit/lie in bed and talk with for hours without getting bored .",10Feb2018,1
202,"I'll try to keep the whole post brief. If more detail is needed, I can add it if necessary.

At the time of the accident, I was basically my friend's only friend outside of her boyfriend. He knew me and knew that I was her only friend outside of him. This was more or less by her own choice. I had known my friend for about 7-7.5 years. The two of them had been together for about 6.5 years.

My friend got hit by a truck that didn't yield for her. She was riding a bicycle without her helmet. She was in a coma for 2 months, then moved to a a neural trauma recovery house for a few months, and now she lives with her mom again in Section 8 housing in the city. Her boyfriend broke up with her and basically became a ghost shortly after my friend moved in with her mom again.

**Full disclosure**: I used to have a massive crush on this girl. I held a flame for her for a few years during her relationship because I didn't think it would last, it was a rebound relationship for her after all. I eventually decided to move on with my life, put aside those romantic feelings for her, and was able to find my wife because of it.

**Problem 1**: My family suspects that my friend's mom is purposefully not helping her get well in order to keep receiving some kind of monetary support. I have no idea about this subject at all, but I want to help my friend because her mom sucks; I can't speak to the money issue, but in lots of demonstrated ways, she's terrible. **Any advice in this arena would be especially helpful.**

**Problem 2**: My wife and I do not want to be the only people that she gets outside human contact from. We would pick up Jessica weekly in order to give her some time outside the house, but it was becoming a strain on our relationship. **Is there any type of resources that can help get my friend visits or become part of a group that goes out and is taken care of?**


Thank you for reading. Any advice would helpful and appreciated.",10Feb2018,30
205,"I [26F] don’t have time for dating. I have so much going on in my life with work, my health, going back to school, etc. 

The last few years have been a lot to handle (deaths, cancer, etc.), and I’m trying to process it now to be a better person. I told myself I’m going to take a break from dating and I was really happy about it- until I started fantasizing about that guy in the cubicle across the hall from me. God, it’s ridiculous. And I’m finding myself smiling at him too much like a bad rom-com. We work in projects together and my workplace is pretty much all male except for me, so I need to shut this shit down, like yesterday.


I know I should be able to just “stop it,” but I also don’t want to completely shut off the part of my brain that is sexual. I’ve done that before and I lose a lot of energy and basic confidence, because I’m pretty much bashing myself mentally for having any sexual interests (Roman Catholic upbringing...) 



My health is too precarious to get an sti, and I feel like fuckbuddies or friends with benefits are more drama than a calm relationship is, anyway. 

Maybe I need to pick something else for a fantasy? I sound ridiculous. I just, I went back online dating so I don’t flirt with my coworker, and I’m already spending too much time on there. It’s not the answer either.

218,"This is my first serious Reddit post but I REALLY need some advice. We have a friend, 35 year old male. He's been a good friend for about 8 years. He used to come hang out with my husband and would stay at our home overnight more times than I can count. My husband considers him a very good friend and my man isn't a social person so there are like 3 people on that list.
We haven't seen this friend much in the past 2-3 years due to not having a place for him to sleep if he comes out (it's a long drive for him, too far to come drink beer at a fire and then drive home safely so he has always stayed over). I have seriously considered him one of MY really good friends over the years. Oldest daughter ADORES him, our youngest is MEH but that's just her personality, lol.
Well a couple of weeks ago we were messaging on Facebook and he asked me if I'd send him a nude picture. Not even that way, he asked if I’d send a picture of “your lady goodies down there” @@!  I was like OMG but thought maybe he is very, very drunk so I laughed it off and let it go. I even MSG'd his mother who is on my friends list asking if maybe he'd been hacked. I just said I got a couple of strange messages from his account, no details. But the next night he DID IT AGAIN. I told him I was disappointed in him and he said ""sorry I didn't mean to cross a line""......Since then I've just ignored him. I would have deleted him but I really DO care about him and it would break my husband’s heart to know his friend did this. Well he keeps waving at me and saying hello in MSG. I've not clicked on them to open them but I can see some of what he’s sent in the overview.  I'm just too disgusted and upset. So now he's sending me teary eyed emojis. WHAT do I do? If I didn't genuinely care so much for him he would have been so gone already but this is disappointing AND it hurts that I thought I (we) knew someone when apparently I didn't? Plus I don't want to hurt my husband. His friends circle is so small because he already believes you’d better not trust people too much because they will do you wrong and do things to you that you would never do to them. My husband is a great friend to those he has chosen to let in but is just stingy with it so to speak. He's been hurt before. Many years ago his ex-wife left him for his childhood BFF and had his best friend’s baby. So it's touchy.
Background, (47F) married 23 years (56M) long term HAPPILY married and it’s obvious to anyone who is around us. We’ve had people joke that we’re so happy together it’s sickening, lol.  We’re just best friends and it shows I think.  We have two children in their 20’s

I don't know the full extent of their relationship, but I know they were really close. He told her that he was in a child sex trafficking ring, and she didn't know what to do so she kept the secret. Later, the people holding him were found and put on trial, and I'm unsure of the legal details, but because he was scared to testify, he was put in juve and he killed himself once he got there. My friend blamed herself for his death saying she could have done something about it, and has developed a lot of guilt, depression, and she told me she's drinking and harming herself.

Obviously, I don't like seeing her like this because she used to be the sweetest and brightest kid, and now she's way too far into this rut for a 16 year old. Recently, I've been considering reporting her to the school for destructive habits or something like that. On one hand, it would be for her to get better, but also I'm worried that if something goes wrong then I'll be the next one in the chain. I don't know how many people she's told about her drinking but I'm fairly certain given our kind of relationship I'd be one of the first people to know, so I think if the school or the police were to take action, she'd get mad at me and probably despise me. I'm scared about that although I'm coming to terms with the outcomes, but what I really fear is that if I tell someone in charge, then word goes around to the law and the school and her parents and she's punished for drinking instead of given support and rehabilitation. I don't know enough about her family to know whether she'd be supported or reprimanded, and I don't know what reporting it would do for her future.

231,"Pardon me if the title doesn´t explain much. English isn´t my native language, so there will probably be a lot of grammatical errors. 

Also, this might be a long one, i am trying to vent and come out as clear as possible, as this is a situation i don´t want to get out of hand. 

Ok, let´s begin.

I am most of the time a pretty mellow and likeable guy, i am quite and tend to help and give advice to the people around me, but i have this problem with my attitude that i dont know how to control, i tend to get annoyed and be quite rude if people insist or bother me with something, since my youth i´ve been like that, i don´t like it, i feel it is something that i learnt at home, as i can see the same behavior on my mom, and most of the maternal side of the family. 

This behavior i am speaking of, is being rude, and sometimes verbally aggressive, stubborn and not being open for suggestion, i have read about it and it seems to be some sort of anger due to depression (I suffered from severe episodes of it, when i was 10, 14, and 18. The last one lasted until a year ago, had to take medication for the entire year).

 Now, as i was raised in this environment were everyone behaves the exact same way, i always tried to not be like that, but it seems to be a part of me, as it keeps happening. What really scares me, it´s what can become of it... My aunts and uncles, almost all of them suffer from alcoholism and tobacco, one of my aunts died in 2017, due to a complication of heavy drinking and Dengue. I´ve never wanted to be like them, i don´t want to end up alone and drink to pretty much see my life go by. 

I got married in August 2017, to this amazing girl, she´s been there for me for almost 4 years, she helped me get out of depression and saw in me the potential i didn´t know i had. I was 170Kg when we started dating, things were rough, i was about to quit medical school, had been cheated on, and was contemplating suicide again, my life was a mess. When she arrived all was different, it was like i was worth something, and that was just what i needed. Making things short in that regard, we had several discussions through our relationship, some were pretty ugly, but i always improved if i had messed up, and wasnt behaving in the correct manner. But, there were some that i saw the same behavior my family had, i drink every now and then, not a big fan of it, but there has been fights were i am a little drunk and get rude, aggresive (verbally), and i don´t want to be like that, i don´t want to hurt her, nor anyone. I don´t know if there is a book i can read or something, but this ain´t easy. I feel like there is something in there, in me, that isn´t nice, and i dont want to feel like that, i dont want to be scared that i can mess everything up for  what i saw as normal when i was growing up. 

I don´t have a good relationship with my mom, she wasn´t the greatest, she always had to work, and didn´t give me much importance, and i know i feel resentment to her because of it, she never cared much for me. So i tend to be rude to her, but once in a fight, my wife told me: ""You are treating me exactly like your mother, you are being rude to me in the exact same way"". And i think she was kind of right in that regard, she is the love of my life, and i have never been so happy, things get better and better, and we are planning to conceive. I want her to receive the best of me, the best i can be. And i know if i dont fix this about me, things may go south, that might sound a little cataclysmic, but that is why i am asking for advice. 

Thank you for taking your time reading this wall of non-sense, it truly means a lot!

Hopefully, you can help me see things from a different perpesctive and i can be better.

232,"We are both 24 and have been together for four years. I take birth control religiously and we always use a condom. I don't know what happened. He has a good job but I only work part-time because I go to college. We currently are renting a house together so we have a place to put a baby. 


I'm just really scared. I had suspected I was pregnant for about a month now but I secretly went to the doctor to take a blood test and it came back positive. I was at work when they called me back and it took me hours to listen to the voicemail and finally got the courage to listen to it when I was in my car after work. I started crying and freaking out and didn't even know if I should drive myself home. Thankfully I got home okay. 


I'm just really scared and I don't know how to tell him. I know he will probably be happy but I don't know if I'm ready to be a mom. I'm not financially secure and I'm the youngest in my family so I was never really around kids or babies. 


I also feel really weird telling my parents and family members. I know my mom will be over the moon and super excited, but I'm not sure about my dad.


I know I'm probably freaking out and scared over small things but I just don't know what to expect. I think my boyfriend knows something is wrong because he keeps asking me if I'm okay.

235,"So I’m an arts student, double major in sociology and psychology. But one of the requirements for psychology is to take a course in either Stats, computer science, or math.  Throughout my whole elementary to high school experience I only ever got 2 B’s in math, the rest being all A’s so it only made sense for me to take a math course. And I also couldn’t take any stats course because one of my other courses I took prevents me from earning credits from the introductory stats class. 

So this math class I look, “Linear Algebra,” is my worst nightmare. The midterm is worth 35% and the final is worth 50%. There are 10 online homework assignments which in total make up 7.5% of my grade. And 6 written response homework which also totals to be 7.5% of the final grade. I haven’t had the midterm yet but I’ve done the homework and I cannot solve ANY of the homework with googling all the steps and using online calculators to solve the matrices. The homework is very time consuming and I spend so much time doing them that I have no time to study for my other classes. Normally I get at least a B usually higher in my psychology classes but I have a C in one and barely a B- in the other. I also have two other classes which I have not yet had assessments in. 

Throughout my life I’ve had horrible back issues, whenever I get stressed it gets so sore sometimes I can barely bend over. I have no energy because I have to work 3 nights a week, just to afford expenses, and then once I’m home late from work I’m up past midnight trying to study or do homework. In the mornings I have to wake up at like 6 so I’m barely getting enough sleep. 

 I don’t know what to do. Every time I try to sit and work on my homework I end up crying out of frustration. I’ve never felt so stupid in my life. And I don’t want to talk to my parents about it because they know how “smart” I’m supposed to be at math and I don’t want to let them down.  I’ve considered getting a tutor but I’m worried that would just take away more time from my other classes so I don’t know if that’s a good idea. I am at the point where I just want to drop the class, but then I’d have to take a whole extra semester just to make up for that one class. And I’d have to pay the whole tuition cost just for one semester. 
 
Sorry it’s so long, but I have no one to talk to. I honestly would appreciate anyone’s opinion of what they think is the best option. Because at this point I’m lost.

She is Chinese and very traditional, she says he is no longer her son because he declined to live with her and be the man of the house when he was 13 and she lost custody of him.

242,"OK so this is a long story but I will try to stay brief.

My room mate is also my best friend, we have been room mates for two years at this juncture in our lives but first became friends as room mates almost 5 years ago now. 

When she initially moved in 5 years ago I had a crush on her and it was definitely mutual, however I didn't want to take any chances of ruining a good living situation so I never pursued it. Following the lease ending she moved to FL to live with a previous BF and they rekindled eventually marrying, it was when she moved out that all of our mutual friends started telling me how I missed my shot and that she had told them she also had feelings for me. We stayed in close contact while she was in FL and I began to realize that my crush was far more than just a crush but she had found her special someone and I accepted that and moved on. Well her husband cheated on her and the relationship ended abruptly. She moved back home and suddenly we were hanging out again. I told her how I felt about her (not that I loved her or anything just that I cared for her and wanted to pursue dating). We dated briefly but things didn't work out, I basically served as a rebound guy for her. We drifted apart for a while and eventually came back to each other again as friends. She needed a place to live and I had an open room so I offered it to her and we have been living together ever since. I have repressed my feelings for her since she moved back in, but it has become much more difficult lately. We are both currently single and spend a lot of time together as she is basically my only friend because of some poor life choices I made in regards to my other friends. 

I desperately want to tell her how I feel about her but I don't want to fuck up what we have as friends nor do I want to make our current living situation weird as we are signed on to the lease until September and neither on of us could afford to move out. 

So I have no idea what to do about it and I was hoping that perhaps an outside opinion could help.",10Feb2018,1
244,"I constantly sub-consciously put myself lower on the totem pole than everyone else. I try to portray self-confidence, but lately people seem to see right through it. I often find myself being a follower, slowly changing myself to be like the people around me, instead of being confident in who I am. 

One of my best friends, we'll call him Jack, happens to be extremely good looking. He also does modeling and has a large following on social media. Because of this, people often will think of me as Jack's friend, instead of remembering me for me. It feels like I am living in Jack's shadow. I love Jack, but sometimes it is exhausting to my self-esteem to be around him all the time as everyone showers Jack with attention while it feels like I am just an afterthought. I've literally had people talk to me where I can tell their real intention is to try to get closer to Jack. 

Don't get me wrong, I am fairly confident. But at the same time, in a lot of ways I'm not. And I want to work on it. I hit the gym every day, meet new people all the time, and am able to talk to pretty much anyone and take the lead in the conversation.

248,"So I work for a large grocery store chain.  I enjoy my job, but a little while ago we were bought out by an even larger corporation, and it has made me dislike my job a little more.  There's not enough hours to go around anymore, they've changed a lot of our procedures, and they're slowly changing the atmosphere from one focused on helping customers and providing knowledgeable recommendations to an atmosphere of only profit and only focusing on the bottom line.

I'm one step below a supervisor, and my boss keeps telling me that a supervisor position is mine if I just apply for it, but I don't know if I want to stay with this company any more.  Right now I'm making ~$14/hr since I've been with the company for a few years, and if I took the supervisor position that would give me a pay raise.

There's a flower shop a few blocks from my apartment, and it's been a dream of mine since middle school to be a florist.  I noticed that they had a hiring sign out front last week advertising $12/hr starting, so it would be a definite pay cut (assuming I could get the position with no experience) but I think it might be worth it.

250,"Some background on both people in this story: I’m 43, a professional in a compassionate profession. I am one of those people that is always trying to do what I can to help other people.  This happens in lots of ways, some of which are noticeable publicly (started a scholarship fund, led a crisis team, etc). I have a pretty good life - lots of friends, fulfilling career, family that loves me. One thing I haven’t had in my adult life is romantic love. I was married for 10 years, but never loved him in that overpowering, lightening struck way that some people do. Then I was in another relationship for 7 years, same thing. I have believed that this kind of love was not in the cards for me and was actually fine with that. 

He is also 43. He led a difficult life. Both parents abandoned him and he was raised by his grandparents. Later his best friend killed himself and still later his daughter died at age 13, leaving him devastated. He has also been married and divorced and then married again, but split up several years ago. He is a flirt and a joker, he’s always the life of the party.  He’s got a kind heart, is very stubborn, and can have a quick temper. 

We met 8 years ago. At the time I had decided to leave my husband but had not yet done so for logistical and compassionate reasons. When we met I felt like I’d been hit by lightening, the attraction was so intense. I hadn’t felt that since I was a teenager. A week or so later we started talking on Facebook. They were good conversations, very comfortable, we joked around a lot but also talked about serious things. After a few conversations he told me when he met me he had wanted to kiss me. At that point I told him we needed to stop talking. I knew my marriage was over, but my husband deserved respect and I wasn’t going to mistreat him by starting another relationship right away. We stopped talking, I broke up with my husband, and several weeks later I sent him a text. 

It was messy this time around. My ex hacked my Facebook and sent him a message asking him to back off. His ex (he was 6 months split from his ex-wife) told me he wasn’t into me and I should stop wasting my time. We were talking, but not in the same way, and it became apparent that he was talking to several women. In short, he was a douche. The thing was though, that even though I’m not naive and could clearly see that he was not into me, I could also see that he WAS into me. I’ll explain.  As long as we didn’t see each other the relationship was trivial at best - some flirting over text, a little bit of drama, nothing that meant anything at all. But. Any time we ran into each other in person it was different. For starters, he would stare at me all night, secondly he would always end up coming to wherever I was in the room and spending most of the night talking to me. Once this happened when he was there with a woman and she was pretty angry about it. 

This strange and painful relationship went on for about 9 months. I should maybe mention that we didn’t have a physical relationship during this time, though one night he did walk me home and we kissed. 

There was one person in particular that I knew he talked to a lot. He had been seeing her when I met him (and broke up with her before we started talking) and he had been breaking up with her and getting back together with her for the entire time. I knew he had actual feelings for this one. 

Eventually the end came. I had gone on a weekend trip to the city with a guy friend and we ran into him and the woman I knew he liked. They were clearly together. This time, for the first time ever, he didn’t stare at me and he didn’t talk to me. It was over. I cried the entire five hour drive home the next day. The guy friend I was with picked up the pieces of my broken heart - 3 months later we got together. 

Eight years passed. During that time I would occasionally see him, occasionally talk to him, but no real contact. However when we did see each other the staring was still there and when we did talk it was still a really good conversation. He became this person that I kept in the back of my mind. Someone that I still felt strong and confusing feelings for, but also a sore spot because those feelings weren’t returned. In eight years I never felt any less strongly about him. Every time I did see it talk to him I would have to spend a few days reminding myself that he was not into me and was just a player. 

Then, last June, something happened. I ran into him at a party after not seeing him for quite a while. He looked terrible - bags under his eyes, hollow cheeks, sad. He wasted little time before coming to talk to me. He said that he had split with the other person about two years before, although there had been a brief attempt at reconciliation. He said that he was not doing well and didn’t like the life he had. Then he started talking about me. He said that he thought about me often and that I was special to him, that he regretted the choices he had made. 

I was PISSED.  First of all, I didn’t believe him. I was surprised that he was talking about feelings as he never really had done that before but I chalked it up to him being unhappy in life and wanting comfort from a person who a) is very empathetic anyway but also b) who he knew cared about him. I listened to him but scowled the whole time and laughed when he said I was important to him. Eventually he left. 

But... it bothered me. I didn’t like to think about him being in pain. Three weeks later I sent him a message and said that I wasn’t happy about some of what he had been saying to me, but I was also worried about him and wanted to know if he needed a friend. He replied with a long apology. He said he had no right to tell me how he felt when he knew I was in a relationship and seemingly happy and that he had been selfish. He assured me that he was fine and thanked me for reaching out. 

On Christmas Day I sent him another message to ask how he was doing. We talked a little bit for the next week, not about anything important, and then on New Years Eve he asked me if I had any single friends. This was hurtful to me, but I also kind of welcomed the question because I thought it meant closure for he and I and I could finally forget about him. I asked him what sort of person he would like to be with. His reply was “Someone who looks and smiles and talks like you. Simple.”  Again, I was not taking his comments seriously so instead of taking the bait I told him that I actually did have a single friend he might like. I gave him her number and they started talking. 

For the next week both of them were telling me about the progression of their relationship and I was genuinely happy that they liked each other as I wanted both of them to be happy. But after a while it started to become too painful for me. I asked my friend to stop sharing details with me and I stopped replying to the things he was texting me about her as well. These few days were hard ones for me. I stopped sleeping. I found myself pacing the floor in the middle of the night tortured by an argument in my own head “I love him. I’ve always loved him”, quickly followed by “I don’t love him, he’s just unfinished business”. This went on for several days. Finally I sent him a message. I told him that there were few people I could talk to like I talk to him and he was one of my favourite people to talk to. He replied saying that he felt the same and that it was hard to find that one person you can talk to about anything and everything in the way we had and he missed our conversations. I then asked him if he remembered much about what we used to say. He said he didn’t remember specifics but he remembered feeling happy and he wished we could have that again. Then he said that this was his third draft in replying because it was “important”. 

After that we didn’t talk again for about a week. I had a lot to think about. I wasn’t sure what was happening with him but it felt like maybe something was. I liked that he was being forthright with me and I wondered if he would tell me about what he had felt before. I wanted to know if he had just been flirting with me as he did with everyone or if he felt something back. 

When I texted him again (it’s always me that texts first) we started talking about silly things, but I was asking him questions. And he was giving thoughtful answers. Eventually I asked him about which five people he would pick if he could talk to anyone, alive or dead, and say everything he wanted to say to them. Much to my surprise, he didn’t turn this into a joke and instead gave a long and thoughtful response. I thanked him for sharing with me and he replied that he wanted to open up more, particularly to me. He said that he had shut me out before and now he didn’t want to. 

This was all really new. I couldn’t believe that he was saying so much and not making a joke of it. I got the feeling that he would finally tell me the truth, so I asked him about when I had seen him in June. I asked him if what I thought I’d heard him say was right. He said that he had no right to talk to me as he had that night. That it was selfish of him, and that he had had opportunities before to “tell me about his feelings” and should have just left me alone. I said that I was relieved to know that he had had feelings for me as I had spent so many years questioning my instincts. He said that there had been always been feelings, of that there was no doubt, and he had been as honest about that as he could be recently. We said goodnight. 

The next day I could not get him out of my head, and that night I messaged him again. I told him I couldn’t stop thinking about our conversation and he said he felt the same. I asked if he wanted to talk to me and he said “so much”. Then he asked me why I was thinking about our conversation. I started by telling him that when I met him it felt like I had been struck by lightening, and that was not something I’d experienced in adult life, but that I really never knew if it had been mutual and it was hard to read him because he gave such mixed messages. I said that I had made a total fool of myself eight years before and everybody we both knew had told me he was playing me, so it was a relief to know that I had read him correctly. 

As I was typing this though, he was also typing. He started by saying that he loved that I was telling me so much because nothing could satisfy the “hunger” he had to know about me. Then he said that the lightening was mutual and that he had been longing for that feeling ever since he first laid eyes on me, and that he didn’t think he’d ever feel it with anyone else. Then he said that he was the only fool because he had let me go. He told me he had so many regrets and had hurt for so many years but that he still felt relief and happiness to finally say what he felt. He said he was afraid of how well I could read him and how easily I could hurt him if I so chose. And finally he wrote “I have always loved you, and I have never felt I deserved you”. 

Well. My whole world shattered in that moment. I didn’t know what was up and what was down. After he said it the first time he didn’t stop. Over and over he told me loved me, that he’d loved me for as long as he could remember, that he would always love me. He told me that he had thought about me every day for years and that the other person had known about his feelings for me because he just couldn’t hide them. He told me that he had changed his life in the last three years, stopped drinking, stopped womanizing, tried to live as a person with integrity - and that he had done it all because he wanted to be a man that I could love. He told me he wanted to be with me as soon as he could be, started making plans for combining our lives and even asked me if I would marry him. He told me he’d never loved like this before and it was the happiest he had ever been. 

As for me, I was in shock. It took me a few days to acclimatize to the change and to decide what to do. For starters, I left my relationship (I won’t get into that here but this was not a loss and was a long time coming). I also talked quite a bit to friends and family and tried to get used to this new reality. He broke up with my friend that he had been seeing. He told her that he wanted to start a relationship with someone else. She knew immediately that he meant me and she and I talked things through. She liked him but didn’t love him and she and I are very close, so she wasn’t terribly upset, although I think she wished he had told her the whole truth. 

So for a very brief time we were crazily happy and in love. Every night we texted while he was at work, and every morning he called me and we would talk for hours. I don’t think I’ve ever been happier in my life. 

And then, one night, it fell apart. He had sent me an odd message. It could have been interpreted as just an oddly phrased comment or it could have been interpreted as a text meant for someone else. I questioned him about it, he laughed and said he was just talking about a passing thought. But I felt jealous and upset. I knew I wasn’t being rational and that this was a product of what had happened before, so I told him I needed to think and I stopped texting for the night. When I did eventually text him again a few hours later I sent a long message about how I need total honesty in a relationship and I don’t want to share him with other people. I was not actually thinking he was being deceptive or talking to others, I think I was just trying to set the ground rules because I was so afraid of a repeat from the last time. 

I hurt him. Badly. When he replied it was to tell me that he had spent so many years trying to change and it hurt him that I didn’t trust him. He said it wasn’t right that I could hurt him like that when we hadn’t even been in the same room yet. Then he said that we should slow down. He wasn’t going to come see me when he got home from work and he wasn’t going to come to my house anytime soon. 

We made up, but things were not the same. He meant what he said about slowing things down, and he was very likely right, but day after day he got more and more distant. First he stopped calling me, then he stopped calling me pet names and telling me he loved me constantly, then he said less and less. I started to get upset. I sent him long messages about how hurt I was. He would reply and tell me he loved me, that we were meant to be together, that he was not going to let me go. But still things continued to erode. I tried to walk away for a bit and clear my head but I couldn’t really. I would say I needed to think and he would reply with “I love you”.  During this time my friend says she sent him a message and told him I really loved him and he needed to figure out what he was doing. He replied that he didn’t want to talk about me. 

Eventually I decided that he just really needed a chance to relax and have less drama. I told him I was done thinking things over and I thought we should just get to know each other’s day to day and not worry about anything else right now. He said that sounded good and things were good for a day, but the next day he was very quiet again and finally I said “You don’t owe me anything. We don’t have to keep talking if you don’t want to”. His reply was that he didn’t know what he wanted. That as much as he loved me and adored me he wasn’t prepared to move away from his kids and family right now. This was a relief to me, I told him that that was fine, we didn’t  have to make any plans, we could just talk. He didn’t reply. That night I sent him a message saying I love you and goodnight. Again he didn’t reply. And now I understood, he was ending things. I sent him a long message about how much this hurt and he replied with “I’m sorry”. 

That night I sent another, pathetic message. I said that I thought he must be reconciling with his ex and that message must really have been to her. He was angry when he answered. Said no, but he was disturbed I was “bringing this up again”. Then he blocked me. 

And so that’s where I am now. Confused. Frustrated. Heartbroken. I can barely get through the days it hurts so much. I’m angry and sad and I miss him so, so much. Every morning he is my first, painful thought, and every night I have had to take sleeping pills and wine so I can actually sleep. I feel like my whole world is destroyed. 

Worse than that, I feel like I can’t move on. It’s kind of the things he told me have made it impossible for me to let go. See, if I believe the things he said then I also believe that he loves me as much as I love him and he is doing what he did before - running away in fear, and I want to try and make everything less scary for him so he can be less freaked out and we can be happy together. 

Or. Alternately. I have to believe that it was all a lie and I’m the biggest joke that ever walked this earth, doomed to love someone who plays with my heart. 

Some facts to add for clarity: he loves his stepchildren very much and his ex will only let him see them if he stays at her house. When he stays there he fixes things, pays for stuff, helps her basically. At the same time that he was becoming distant they were having a fight because he didn’t want to see her or go there but she refused to let him see the kids unless he did. He eventually gave in and stayed there. That’s where he was when he ended things with me. 

Also, he doesn’t have a place to stay right now. He lives on the job site two weeks out of the month and couch hops the rest of the time. He couldn’t openly talk to me when he wasn’t at work because we really couldn’t be open about being together. It’s a very small town and people would have been mad since I just broke up with my ex. 

I need help Reddit. I need perspective. I will answer any questions and can also provide screen shots of many conversations. Please help me decide what to do.

252,"Trying to get past being cheated on, the relationship is best over, I know I need to learn to trust again but I am really struggling to do this. I am not at dating yet (only been 2/3 months and it had been a years long relationship) I just mean for social situations. 

I have social anxiety anyway though I managed it before this and the way I always dealt with this before was to try to logically answer those thoughts. ""of course they want you here they invited you"" ""why would they hurt you it gains them nothing"" this no longer works because he did exactly that and I cannot understand why he would not just leave. I know I will probably never get answers to that, but PRACTICALLY how do I move forward. 

Should I move get a complete fresh start? Are there small steps that you can think of that I could try and take to edge back to trust again?

I keep panicking in social situations, trying to meet new people, worse is when I am out at something where there are shared friends, some are saying that we are fine, while being very strange with me or not replying, I don't know where I stand and I hate it, it's making my anxiety so much worse. I have not asked anyone to take sides and I have not gone public with his cheating, though some of my friends do know, even those I have not asked to choose. But this not knowing where I stand I hate it. I don't know if I will ever be able to stand to look at him, or her again, I hate them so much and both act as though they have done nothing wrong which just makes me want to scream, I am sick of trying to avoid him all the time, I unfriended him on social media for obvious reasons, but when he kept being overly friendly with me when I tried to be civil about returning this things and I snapped a bit and swore at him, for the first time I might add, and saying nothing massively unjustified, just more sweary and harsh than necessary haha, basically amounting to leave me alone, he responded by blocking me, except now I can't tell what he's going to be at, which was all I could see when I had just unfriended him, so I have to keep checking with people if he is going and its making it even more awkward. 

I am tempted to just move. The relationship had been long and there had been a whole plan for a life (something that he kept dwelling on, the long term plans always used to freak me out, but they had become my plans) that I need to replan, that's not terrible, not sure it's what I wanted anyway, but I do need to replan what I want to do. I could do my work from anywhere, I could just move? I resent this, I did nothing wrong why should I have to but it might be for the best. I have to rebuild all my social groups and routines anyway so it might be a good time, not sure where I would go. I own my home here and I do love it, I could always just rent it out and comeback later maybe. Any advice would be appreciated, sorry for ramble.",10Feb2018,1

She fantasized about us and kept dreaming about us while I was way too stupid focusing on the future, I was working hard and dealing with life issues while trying to keep her away from reality. Eventually I started getting annoyed with her showing of affection (which at the time felt like too much but I was dumb) and started to push her away. I tried to help her to grow stronger and build character, not letting others to take advantage of her, getting a job, and stuff like that. Eventually she stoped showing affection like she used to, and even tho she loves me with all her heart it's not the same, she holds resentmen towards me and I don't blame her. We have family arguments and my parents started living with us because of their stupid financial situation, and even tho we can help them she really doesn't want to. She felt like they would try to take me away from her and felt betrayed by me. By now I comprehend what I've done and I regret it so much cuz I really love her with all my heart. We've addressed the issues, she is desperately trying to find friends and now I feel replaced (classical you don't know what you have until it's gone).

259,"Thing is that I am about to have sex with a guy and I am not even sure I want this myself, LOL.

But in order to bring some perspective to this, let me explain how this goes; and this is where I do not want people to come over if they are going to be judgmental; I am a zoophile, there's no other way over it, I have known it since I was a child, but it's not just sexual, actually it's more emotional than anything, I find it very romantic, I have no clue, don't ask me for reasons because I have none, but I can def see myself in a relationship with an animal. (won't say which)

I think that I was somewhat obvious on that now that I think about it again :P they took me to psychologists and stuff but that wouldn't work at all, much less now since I am 10fold stubborn not a kid anymore, most of my family knew, plus they caught me onto some stuff (which I won't describe).

Because of my lack of need to attract guys I got into sports and health. But apparently there's also a market for being fit and a tomboy, something I didn't expect that guys would be interested in me nevertheless; this sucks.

Thing is that those guys aren't bad, they are really nice guys, but there's nothing I can do if I can't feel much for them; but yea this new guy knows it beforehand, he is completely different from all those other guys; and he wants to take on the challenge; he likes me for being genuine and he is fairly dominant so I guess that's how he manages, I'd say he is pretty clever on figuring me out; we live kinda far, met casually, so it's going slow, but it's just eventual.

However he is still a person, how is that going to work? what is he trying to prove? I can't but get the feeling this is going to end bad...  I feel powerless, so many guys yet no interest for them, and they try so fucking hard, yet it's some fur that really gets my heart pounding; so I don't fucking know. And well I am working towards finding a relationship with an animal but it's not easy, it takes planning and money; arg! this is so annoying.

Well I guess the comments will give me a lot of shit but hey at least I have it off my chest LOL; probably will become a shitcrap about consent or some shit, thinking in animals in terms of humans as if speech is required, at least they are the primary initiators as long as you appear receptive, unlike maybe eating them or genitally mutilating them. And yet, sex is pretty secondary to me anyway, what I want is a loving relationship.

264,"My name is Robert and I’m from Germany. Let me explain the title first.

I met a girl online on tandem (an app that gives language learners the opportunity to talk other language learners from all over the world). Her name is Laura. She started teaching me basics in Italian and I helped her with German. We got along so well. I guess you know how great it is to meet someone and it feels like you’ve known each other for years already. Anyways, last weekend in the middle of our conversation my texts “failed to deliver”. I restarted the app and my whole chat with her was deleted, she disappeared from my friends list and I lost contact to her. Sadly, neither of us has had the idea to exchange phone number or email ... Another friend on tandem was talking to her at that time and said that Laura had issues with the app. Before I could give her any details to give them Laura she lost her in her contacts as well.

I know her first name, her birthday, age, that she has 3 dogs, their breeds and the names of the dogs. Also, I have two pictures of her. She is a student (school, not University) and is from Rome (if I remember correctly).
I already contacted the support of the app, but it seems like they won’t help me.
Reverse Image Search is the first thing I tried after texting the support with no success. Then I went onto Facebook and tried to text Italian pages to maybe get them to post something about this. None of them answered yet though. And now, a couple of days later I’m basically out of ideas.
I was thinking about messaging some semi-big youtubers. Maybe any of them will read my message and reply to it. (I doubt it though)
I was also seeking for help on r/Italy and r/Rome and quite a few people tried to help me. But since I didn’t have any success yet whatsoever, I’m here now.

To some of you it might seem a bit strange why I put so much effort into finding someone who I just talked to for a week. But have you ever met someone and just felt like you have known each other for years? 
I don’t want to throw anything away that felt like it was going to be a friendship for life.

So please, let me know if you have any advice for me.
Also, feel free to share this post. The more people I reach with this, the better.


Thanks in advance!

I’m upset with the second dealer because they didn’t offer a loaner until I demanded one a week into the repair. I noticed the second repair (a hybrid battery issue) wasn’t fixed last night although the error message wasn’t exactly the same. The first time I had the hybrid error, I couldn’t start the car. This time, it was a similar message but I could start up the car. I called the dealer that did the repair and they said they don’t do loaners/rentals (even though they provided one before). The manager called back and said they could provide a rental if I brought it in on Monday (they don’t work on cars on Sundays and ultimately since the car driveable they wouldn’t cover a rental.) I said what if the error escalates to where it’s not drivable and the manager said they would cover the cost of towing; I don’t feel like that is safe.

272,"Hi everyone 

So I find myself in a weird situation.

I have a very close friend, let’s call her Liz. When she was about 6 her older brother (let’s call him Jeff) molested her, repeatedly

It was many years of abuse before someone found out and the police were involved (I don’t know all the details myself as it’s a very tough subject for Liz to talk about)

Fast forward about 20 years to today

Liz is at a stage in her life where she wants to give her brother a chance (she suspects that he was molested as well and feels bad for him) so they’ve been hanging out and getting closer

Now it’s not something I agree with but she’s a grown woman and it’s her choice and I have no choice but to respect that.

However the other night she asked me (in front of him and some of her friends) if the two of them could come to my family’s place for dinner some time

I told her yes at the time only to pull her aside later and tell her no. My sisters come to these dinners and they bring their children and in my view having him there presents a very unnecessary risk

Liz believes he’s changed and she’s mad at me for not giving him a chance. (This is actually a fight we’ve had before about other people, she is always giving folks who have done her wrong second chances and she gets mad at me when I don’t do the same. I agree folks deserve a second chance, however in my view once a person has done something they can easily do it again

Things are cool for now, she agreed that it was my decision (and also understood the fact that my family, who all know her situation as well, would not accept him there either) but I know in a few days it’s gonna turn into a fight. She’s gonna think about it, get upset and yell at me (I know her well enough to know that’s what will happen).

I’m just wondering, would anyone here consider allowing him near their family if you were in my shoes? Their other sister has several kids and he’s not allowed anywhere near them, so in my mind I’m thinking why should I allow it?",10Feb2018,2
273,"What’s up. I’m a male teenager who every now and then likes to throw parties and pre-parties (mostly the latter one) on a big ass garden my mother has. I’ll try to make this short: did a few parties during the last year, including mostly pre-parties, 80-100 people show up, all really polite people and I know them all. We are all underage but we all know ours limits. Nobody has ever injured themselves and only cheap low quality has broken down like chairs or wooden sticks (relevant later). Before we continue, my mother is not 100% mentally okay. I’m the one who cleans after the party is over, naturally.

My last pre-party was 5 months ago. My mother woke me up that day at 7 am (party started at midnight) saying that it had rained during the night and that in no way the garden would be dry in 20 hours, and demanded that I cancel that party urgently and she didn’t wait to see, for some reason, if the garden would be dry by midnight. The motherfucking garden was already dry when I woke up so I talker her down later and did the event anyways, we already had the alcohol and invited everybody. During the party she would show up and scream to me and my friends to lower the music because the neighbours were very angry and some dumb shit. The music was at 10 and I already talker with the neighbors prior. She later was very pissed at me when I asked her to stop showing up during the party and told me she would never let me do another party ever.

5 months have gone by ever since. I asked her to let me do another party, and she told me, again, that she would never let me do another party again. She told me that my friends were animals because  they broke a regular rotten wooden stick from 1984 [no sentimental value at all from her side] and that they broke plastic chairs [that I have accidentally broke priorly because of my weight] etc, dumb stuff that broke down but over-exaggerated by 100x. Whenever I would answer by telling her what’s inside the [ ] she would answer “I remember it all perfectly”. She doesn’t. She is know in the family for being very incompetent and because she forgets about everything, she even forgot that she had to cook my dinner a few times. And know, the other really idiotic answers she gave me: “I can’t let you, what if someone who comes here later tells their parents that there is alcohol here and the parents sue us and send us to jail and the police confiscate us the house?” [Probably 400 different people have set foot on here, that has never happened, and not even to distant friends that I know that also throw big parties on their houses] I also told her the police, in such ridiculous and bizarre case, need to do an investigation, collect evidence, etc, and first of all the police has more important stuff to do that bust down a regular party of teenagers like if they were hunting down Pablo Escobar or something. Now, she is a extreme fanatic of Church, and she has told us being a part of Church is her biggest achievement in life, not us, the Church. And she does parties for them, actively colaborate, etc. Also, combined with this, she cares more about the opinion people have on her, she puts his external image on people over her family. So, she tells me “I can’t let you do this party because a neighbour may call the Church and tell them I sell alcohol to kids” I have warned the neighbors that I was doing a party on all occasions, they all told me it was OK always tell me to go have fun and first of all none of them have relations with the fucking Church who is 20KM away. Can y’all tell me what to do, or what to say, so I can throw my parties again? Please I really enjoy throwing parties out. Thanks everybody in advance.",10Feb2018,0

I always thought him not remembering where I live, my favorite color, my ethnicity or my birthday were jokes he'd make but recently I made a fool out of myself by pointing out a location that is near his hometown.

When the Hurricane devastated Puerto Rico he never asked if I was okay or if my family was okay.

My point is, over the years with the constant talking I have remembered a good portion of facts about his life and his person, but to this day he doesn't remember anything about me and I can say for sure they are no longer jokes. He thought it was weird I'd remember certain things about him and that made me feel awful. I have stopped talking to him for about four days now and he just messaged me. What should I do?

282,"Ok, so I'm a 18 year old (gay, if that matters) male. I'm on my first year of university (English Studies).

I chose this degree because I'm somewhat good at learning languages, but mostly because I want to get out of this country (Spain) as soon as possible, I just need something new.

My problem is that I'm extremely unmotivated andI don't really have a vocation for what I'm doing; many of my classmates are way better than me at English/Languages overall. But I can't study anything else: I can't even afford moving to another community here in Spain to course another degree in humanities, and my community's university offers:

* Art Story

* Geography and Territorial planning

* History

* Music History and Sciences

* Philosophy

* Classical and Romance Studies

* English/Spanish Studies.

The thing is, I could perfectly switch degrees at any moment, but most of them won't get me a job fast, which is somehting I need since I'm poor and I need to help my family, or require some previous studies I don't have. I also don't like any of them tbh.

I just feel lost, I need something creative that can make me happy or somewhat feel satisfied with my life, I feel like the only way I can express myself is through my also mediocre and completely average clothes. Everything about me is average, and I hate that; not because I feel special or want to standout, but I feel like I'm not like this.

I don't know if I expressed myself correctly, I don't want to sound cocky or childish, I feel just really unhappy and unmotivated.",10Feb2018,2

I was hanging around with him and his friends the other day, and he seemed to be able to tolerate me fine. I requested to follow him on Instagram but he didn’t accept and ended up blocking me. He seemed annoyed by the fact I said I didn’t understand why people choose the vegan lifestyle.
Here’s how the conversation went on Insta that caused him to block me.

Me: Accept my follow request
Him: No
Me: Why?
Him: Because I don’t want to
Me: Why not? Nothing wrong with just accepting it
Him: I’m vegan
Me: Just accept the request please
Him: But u r talking shit about vegans
Me: how? All I said was I don’t understand why people choose vegan lifestyles 
Him: U made me sad
Me: I’m an innocent young boy, accept my request 
Him: No
Me: Sorry for my opinion
Him: Idc you hurt my feelings and many innocent animals
Me: I respect your opinion and vegan lifestyle
Him: it’s too late
Me: for an apology?
Him: Yes, you will burn in hell for all the animals you slaughter and eat.
Me: I don’t slaughter them. Most people you know probably eat animals too.
Him: the only people I like are vegan
Me: I think R (my best friend) is following you, and he’s definitely not a vegan
Him: I give up please leave me alone.
Me: please accept my request then I’ll leave you alone
Him: No
Me: I’ll spam the DM then
Him: You know I can block you?
Me: No need to block me, I’m only asking you to accept my request 
Him: *blocks me*

I then tried talking to R about this guy blocking me. Here’s how that conversation went

Me: tell him to unblock me
Him: No, stop worrying about 1 follower
Me: it’s ok if he doesn’t follow me back, I just want him to accept my request 
Him: No, stop.
Me: Why stop?
Him: He doesn’t want you seeing his personal things 
Me (out of curiosity): Does he have you blocked?
Him: That’s something you don’t need to know
Me: then what’s his issue with me?
Him: Fucking stop
Me: Just to be clear a lot of things I say on Instagram are exaggerated for humour, vegans are actually ok. I’d never choose that lifestyle but I can respect them.
Him: Shut the fuck up, I don’t care. He’s keeping you blocked and that’s the end of it.
Me: I haven’t done anything to deserve being blocked.
Him: Shut up now. 
Me: I’m only trying to get unblocked.
Him: If you say anything else you’re getting blocked and I’ll get others to block you, stop asking you dick, he doesn’t want you seeing his private things.
Me: No need for bad language, but if it’s irritating you, I’ll stop

I don’t think R is a good friend anymore, and I want the other guy to unblock me.
How do I a) Get my friend to realise this is a big deal to me and b) get the other guy to unblock me?
They’re both fine with me in real life, but on social media they seem to think I’m really irritating.
Should I report this to a teacher at school? Bearing in mind, they’re both good students, so the teachers probably won’t believe me if I say they’re mean to me.",10Feb2018,1
284,"Hello, I currently work on a zero hours contract. I had lots of hours last week, but this week I saw online that I only have a four hour shift. However the shift has a little 'A' next to it and it says Authorized Absence. Firstly, I just wanted to make sure that it definitely means I should NOT come in for that shift - I'm assuming it's just that they have to offer at least one shift a week but they either don't need me/ don't want me to work next week. Also I wondered if they would pay me for the shift or not since it's an absence that I did not even ask for.

The manager promised in my interview that I would get at least 12 hours a week but he obviously lied. I mean to be honest I knew that the company did offer many people rubbish shifts beforehand, and I only took the job to earn some cash and gain more retail experience but I still don't think it's right that he lied. I also don't like working there, you are pressurised to sell bags and the training they gave me was very poor. I just hope that I can soon find a better job elsewhere.

If anyone can offer me advice on this, I would be very grateful. Also sorry for grumbling about the work, I know I should just be happy to have work and I have been out of work for a while (because of studying).

Thank you.

286,"So as far as i know my father is playing games since i was born (im 18). I learned English thanks to his interest to the games and i love playing games. He mostly doesn't play games anymore since he is either exhausted or cannot find anything suitable for him. He lately got interested in a game i was playing called ""fortnite"" (**on ps4**) which is a game in which you fight to death ect. I love seeing him enjoy a game and play but there is a problem. I don't know if it is because he is getting older and gettin more and more exhausted each day but he cannot seem to get better. He sometimes gets lucky and gets a few kills but he can't control his aim most of the time and gets frustrated. I really want him to be able to play and enjoy and seeing him getting dissapointed makes my world go down. He sometimes tells me stories about how good he used to be etc. I don't really know what to do.

287,"There’s a new hire at my work (35 M) trying to sweet talk me into a date with him. I’ve tried to drop hints that I am not interested. I’ve told him I wouldn’t date anyone 6 years older than me (I’m 24), I told him I’m interested in someone else, and I told him not to buy a gift for me when he said he was going to.

No matter what I say, he still wants to be “friends” and it seems like he’s convinced himself that I’m “the one” and I’ll eventually fall for him.
He’s got 6 kids.  5 by one woman, and 1 by another. I don’t mind dating people with kids if it’s one child, maybe two. But multiple children by different mothers? Big red flag there.

288,"So a little bit of back ground. I'm currently studying in Paris for the semester, and I'm one month in. It's not too late for me to leave however and I'm seriously considering it. I've dealt with serious depression and anxiety issues for most of my adult life, and this trip seems to have increased those problems exponentially. I feel more alone here than I think I ever have in my entire life, I don't really have any friends (despite really really trying) and I just don't see myself enjoying my time here. Even leaving the apartment I'm staying in for food or something makes me feel sick. I honestly can't stand being in cities, so being here honestly makes me just feel like I'm choking all the time. I'm from somewhere fairly rural in America, and that's what I love. Woods, fields, streams, just being around nature makes me feel alive, so being stuck in literally the middle of the city just really does not vibe with me at all. I came here for a new experience and culture and honestly, all I want is more of the same back home. I want the old grocery stores, the boring suburban life that I love. As far as my classes here go they couldn't be more boring and the school is a hour away from me by train.

So, the point is, I'm fucking miserable, I just want to go home and I could seriously use some advice on how I can go about leaving in a legitimate way. The good news is, money isn't too much of an issue in this (I say that in a practical way, not to be an asshole about it), I'm already a semester ahead so doing this won't put me behind at all with my studies, so the only issue is really convincing my parents that I need to leave. My mom shouldn't be too hard as she has always been great about understanding how I feel, but my dad is going to be much harder. He's a real problem solver, so he really gets a kick out of pulling the whole ""Just be happy"" type of response whenever I talk about how much my depression is spoiling my time here. So, any advice on how I could realistically create a serious enough problem in their eyes that I would really really need to leave, would be sincerely appreciated.",10Feb2018,2
289,"Short background - after 9th grade in Europe a lot of students instead of just getting a high school diploma go to a ''professional'' high school, where you study for 4 years, get a high school diploma and also get a qualification in a degree you chose to study. I studied mechatronics and am now at my last year of school, working as an intern at a paper factory. 

Ever since I was like 10 I've dreamed of becoming a pilot, but I don't come from a wealthy family and I don't live in the wealthiest country. The most reputable airliner in my country AirBaltic has a pilot school that guarantees a job as a second pilot in their company after graduating, but the studies cost 70 thousand euros. The airliner will form you a loan, but you also have to pay 10 thousand euros up front. To put that in perspective, if I were to start working full time after my internship ends in the paper factory, I would be making about 6k a year, 9 at absolute maximum. 

Maybe this isn't even a question and I'm just ranting on reddit idk...

So my (24F) best friend (65F) got bad news and my first impulse is to drop everything and be there for her, but she said that she needs some alone time to process things. And I of course really want to respect her wishes.

I told her I understood and would be there for her whenever she wanted. I got her favourite junk food and made some meals for her and put them away in her house when she wasn't home (I have a key so I just let myself in) to try to support her from afar so she didn't have to see me or talk to me. And now I'm not messaging her, not visiting her, not calling her, nothing. But I am really worrying about her and hoping she's okay.

I am kind of clingy (fearful-avoidant/anxious) by nature and she is really introverted. I'm finding this whole ""space"" thing really difficult because of my abandonment issues but I am refusing to break it until she tells me she wants to talk/visit with me again.

I would really appreciate some advice for either how to continue to support her from afar (like dropping off meals when she isn't home), or how to distract myself and continue to give her space.

Thank you so much.",10Feb2018,3
296,"The title is a bit misleading, I know. I'm not talking about anything discriminatory, I'm actually talking about a Discord group that pertains to a niche interest that I happen to share with them.


The issue is, quite simply, I don't believe those people should gain anything from me. I don't feel that anything I may make, which would revolve around this shared interest, should be shared between them or viewed by them. This is because I was permanently banned from the group for, from what I can deduce, saying that depression isn't a permanent thing.


I was never given a warning, or even told what I was banned for after the fact.  All I know is that after I specified that I'm not a practicing psychologist, but I know people who have gotten over depression and that I wish this one person the best, I was banned.


I'm not sure what I did wrong, but all of that is said and done. (This happened months ago.) I'm not able to contact any of them without making things very awkward, and I'm not even sure if that'll lead to anything.

300,"Hey there, 

Here's some general info about me:
I'm a 21 year old male and I'm finishing up my Political Science degree (Bachelor). 

Here's my problem: 
I don't know what to do, but I feel very strongly that I could be destined for greatness in some way, shape or form. 

Here is some insight as to why I have this problem: 
Ever since I can remember, anyone who's met me has said that I'm very smart and very good at getting across my feelings/thoughts. I've always been good with anything that involves words and conversation. I also love writing and talking. 

I've always felt like I was destined to change or at least impact the world in some great way. This would most likely be through my voice, with my opinions. I have come to the realization that my degree won't lead me anywhere I truly want to be. Where that is, you might wonder. 
I must admit I strive for attention, in that I feel I am someone that can affect people's way of thinking through my voice. It's not necessarily about getting famous, but I do feel that there is a voice inside me wishing to be acknowledged. 

I could feel this voice developping as I was growing up. I have always been naturally attracted to the arts, specifically movies and music. I acted for a couple of years non-professionally and also have been playing guitar since I was a kid. I would entertain my family by dancing and singing since I was 4 years old. Upon growing older, however, I started to become more of a perfectionist and I started taking my ""art"" more seriously. I have been writing poems, song lyrics and what I guess you could call little interesting texts about the state of the world since I was 12 years old. I used to have a YouTube channel when I was a kid that was entirely about Yu-Gi-Oh (the trading card game). I know it sounds funny, but I would play back then and my channel actually got a decent amount of traffic considering I was 12 years old making videos alone. A couple years ago, I released a couple of songs on Soundcloud, but have since made them all private, in an effort to find my true voice and brand. What I have come to notice is that there seems to be a pattern in my life in which I like to create things and share them with the world. I truly take the time to make whatever I'm putting out there as good as it can be in my own eyes. I would cut, re-shoot and edit videos for hours and not even be tired of it, because I felt I was truly having fun. I do the same now with music. Even my Facebook status updates are well thought-out paragraphs that either aim to be funny or eye-opening. In short, I can now confidently say I feel I have gotten better at what I've always done, which is putting out my thoughts on the Internet. I don't like writing just to write and publish. I write the way I assume a stand up comedian writes, meaning I write while having in mind that I will read my words aloud one day, either to an audience or to a camera/microphone. 

My current situation is as follows: 
I  have written a ton of lyrics (mostly to beats and instrumentals I found on the Internet), but these songs aren't of a particular genre of music. Most of it is rap, but a lot of it is rock and some of it pop. Basically, I don't have a specific brand, genre or niche. I still have a passion for singing, rapping, acting and even dancing. I still constantly dream of working full-time as a YouTuber or a content creator of some kind. There is no other activity other than creating content such as videos and music that I can perform for hours on end without even feeling tired. This is why I feel it is my calling to use this passion for a greater good, both for myself and the world. Keep in mind, I am still a highly critical (of the world and what's wrong with it) Political Science student. I really want to do a bunch of things like release music, make videos but what's holding me back is the absence of a common thread/idea within my creations. I can write songs or raps about serious world issues and injustice, but I can also rap about sex, drugs and riches. The thing is, I enjoy doing both equally. I also want to do both equally, as I feel all of these things are part of what makes me me. I am basically a walking contradiction in that I have always been a nerd while simultaneously being one of the popular kids. I have always been invited to all the parties while never throwing my own. I have always been someone perceived as cool, never studying much but also getting amazing grades. My point is to say I now am 100% lost and have no clue what to do with my skillset, which I would define as touching people through words. I realize saying it this way makes it sound obvious that I should be trying to write a book or someting, but that's not the type of writing I enjoy or am good at. I am good at puttig short bursts of consciousness on paper which is why I enjoy songs and YouTube videos. Anyways, I just feel like there must be something I can do, but have no idea what. I can't just get on YouTube and start talking about ""whatever"". I've seen countless channels try to and die off with no more than 50 viewers per video. I just know if people got to know me, they would be intrigued by the absolute contradiction that is my personality. I can be very serious when needed and have always been commended for the great advice I give to those who seek it, but I also don't take myself too seriously on a daily basis and enjoy laughing and making others laugh. 

Please help, I feel like every second of my life is wasted if I do not accomplish something bigger. I am starting to go crazy! 
As a last piece of reference: one of my favorite artistic developpments in recent years is that of Titanic Sinclair, especially his Poppy project. Many of his videos themes are similar to the one I have written about and his enigmatic, cryptic style of delivering truth is also reminiscent of my own. I guess I've been doing what he is doing through my Facebook status updates ever since I'm 12. 

Help.

301,"Hey there guys and gals.

Firstly, even though I am looking for advice, I feel that writing this down may be helpful in the first place. I am using a new account as it is pretty embarrassing/personal and would rather not have any close friends knowing. Likewise, I don't intend this post to be me wallowing in self-pity or looking for sympathy. I intend it to be an exploration of why I think the way I do what I can do to manage it.

So, I'm turning 23 soon and something has never really clicked with me regarding the fairer sex (I'm a male by the way). I have always had a very close relationship to my mother, I honestly feel I look for her traits in other women ( que Freudian analysis). Now, I have always been attracted to women and have recently made an effort to start a proper relationship ( I'm a post grad student). However, I have mixed feelings towards getting into a relationship. When women talk about sex in public I begin to see them as unclean and somehow tainted ( I've never had the sex conversation with either of my parents, they've left me to it). I know this is a completely irrational belief and really does not make any sense. On another note, when me or my male friends talk about sex/relationships none of this uncleanliness applies. This to me is highly contradictory and I'm currently in the process  of getting to the root of it. I also oscillate between wanting to be in a relationship and have children and then play the role of the loner who sips whiskey and wonders about the life. 

I was curious if anyone has any advice for me. I accept I have an unhealthy relationship towards women, which won't benefit me in the long term. Perhaps I'm an idealist, looking for that non existent perfect woman; maybe my lack of experience in adolescence  has caused  me to internalise a power complex where I can look at women as not pure; or perhaps I'm going through an alternative development period - Who knows?

Any advice would be appreciated really?

Thanks, DifferentClothes

302,"I have a tendency to drag out stories, so I will try my best to keep this short and sweet.

I was 16 at the time and two years ago I got speaking to this girl online, we went to the same school and lived close to eachother [we still do]. Our conversations were great for a long time and I had really strong feelings towards her which I had never felt with any other girl before and I really wanted to ask her to meet but I never had the guts to ask.

Time passed and I still hadn't asked for a meetup and neither had she - eventually we both stopped making an effort and we were just talking on/off for the sake of it.

We stopped talking completely and my feelings stopped for a couple of months until they ended up coming back.. I never told her before how I felt and she still doesn't know now how I feel about her.

I began messaging her again a few weeks back and things have been going well, it's been over a year since we last properly spoke and after some long conversations over text I decided to finally ask if she'd like to meet when a time may be suitable for her as she is busy during the week and thankfully she agreed and said it would be nice to meet eachother and chill out. 

It's been just over two weeks since I said about meeting up but no date has been set yet. We're still talking everyday. The problem is, I don't want to come across as ""too needy"" and I don't want to ask frequently ""Are you free on __"" 

I know it's good she has verbally agreed to meet but whether or not it will happen, I don't know.

Should I just ask her if she is free at the weekend or?

Also, this is most likely me overthinking things but a lot of the time her replies can vary, for example, sometimes she will reply back to me within 15 minutes and sometimes I'm waiting hours. We usually tend to have quite long, thoughtful conversations. I can see she is online but she doesn't reply. I am always thinking this is a bad thing, am I right in thinking that?
