And got a ticket for going 17 over in a 55mph. In Jacksonville. 
I'm over 18 and this is my first ticket.
The office asked if I've ever been to jail.
I'm really scared. I'm already dealing with depression hard core.

I will but I'm still scared.

7,"Where to start...
We're into YouTube together and more or less we grew a friendship fast. However I have had problems with phobias like socialphobia for example and it had made me had difficulty being a regular person, hanging out with their friends and so on.

This person however was like a key to being auto-trustworthy and somehow I could just talk, not normally, but I could talk nonetheless which was a big deal for me.

Anyway, we met on the internet and quickly later discovered we were going to the same college. 

That's not the problem.

When doing our own personal things and endeavours, like collaborations towards our future hopes and dreams and just having fun together I guess.

About 3-5 months have passed estimately, I decided to block him because I started to realise our usual banter was extremely precise and targeted at me, and the usual tone of his voice altogether suggested he wasn't kidding and I was the punching bag all the time. I lived with it because I thought it was usual banter. Nope, I got beaten by a person I trusted, and I blocked him for it.

I asked anonymous forums of the activities of this friend before when doing our thing - and altogether every single person said he wasn't a true friend as to which I agree with as of right now.

Ever since I blocked him, he has sent me attacking messages and sending his friends to randomly spam and call me,  which I also want to bring up that I hate loud noises, even so that I consider myself petrified.



TL;DR Friend I made, game with him, realized I was his personal punching bag when viewing it from a banter point of view, after blocking him get attack-messages. Cannot do anything else than blocking from my knowledge about the situation.

What can I do?

P.S, I don't want to remain or reassemble our friendship. 

Thanks",27Jan2017,1
8,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years (long distance, it sucks); tonight we had an argument about whether we'll get the chance to visit each other next month since it's both of our birthdays and we're both turning 18.


My mother is not allowing this - justifiably so - and I realized my reason for agreeing with her: I respect her as a parent. She's raised me by herself for 18 years and I really do not want to ruin my relationship with her.


We've both said things that I'm not willing to share but it's come to the point where she told me to leave her alone and that if I ""actually care about how [she feels]"" (word for word, aside from the brackets) that I would check her personal Twitter account.


Within the past 20 or so minutes, the following tweets have been sent out:

* ""You are under no obligation to make her like you, especially if she won't meet you halfway.""
* I'm sad.
* I can't do anything right.
* I'm not allowed to be happy.
* Thanks for not caring, Matt.
* I tried. That's all I can say.


Not including the various retweets.


I feel like I'm being guilt tripped into apologizing even though I *know* that I'm in the right here.


The thing is, I know she's depressed and is taking medication for it; I feel like no matter what I do, I'm going to make it worse.


A part of my gut is saying ""*LEAVE*"" but see above.


I don't know what to do.


I feel like I'm suffocating.",27Jan2017,1

I have 3 siblings and all four of us have tried various tactics to get her to quit smoking, but to no avail; all she does is say nothing.

12,"I'm going to try my best to keep this short.

My high-school sweet heart and I are both in our twenties now. She very recently ended a three year relationship(partially because of me) so for the first time since high-school we're both single. The problem is she just not really into sex. She's specially told me she thinks it's really special, and a relationship shouldn't focus on sex. In highschool, we dated and talked non stop, but we always just did more romantic stuff and made out, but we really started having sex. 

When high-school ended and we started college, we broke up but stayed in casual contact since our colleges were close to each other. In college, I had like twenty different girlfriends and got used to constantly having sex maybe everyday. My highschool sweetheart on the other hand didn't. She pretty much had a boyfriend most of college, and she's told me they had sex maybe once every couple of months.

Skipping forward to now, She's broken up with her S.O. I'm not absolutely certain, but i'm sure it's in part because she cheated on him with me. I don't know if he ever found out, but it doesn't really matter. Her having sex with me was like a huge deal to her. I guess the advice i'm looking for is how the hell do I tell her I can't be in a relationship with someone with such low libido. We've been talking for a month now, and she will move my hand from her thighs and tell me she doesn't feel like it. We've had sex maybe only 4 times this past month. I've told her this once, and her response was to lower my sex drive. 

This is the only time we've both been single at the same time since highschool, and she's honest to god is a 10 outta 10. But I can't deal with being in a relationship with someone with such low libido anymore. I don't know how to get the heart to tell her this. Especially since she cheated on her now ex-boyfriend with me, and having sex was such a big deal for her. ",27Jan2017,1

16,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. We're both 16 (young - tell me if it's too young), she and I have been dating for about 8 months. We're very comfortable near each other, and we're getting curious about sex as all teenagers get. Tomorrow is a Friday, the day she's not held to do homework or practice or whatever, and we generally hang out on Fridays. It's quite possible that tomorrow could be the day because our talk recently has been... suggestive of it. 

It's really possible I'll lose my virginity tomorrow, and the only things I know is how to put on a condom, that I need foreplay, and that it won't last long (which is why I need that foreplay). What else should I really be knowing?

Ninja edit: I've been on reddit long enough to know general positions, but that won't be particularly useful if it'll only be relevant a matter of seconds, on the hopeful side.

Edit: It's Thursday night and it looks like all the suggestive language is her period talking :/ She still has a higher libido now but if anything is gonna happen tomorrow, it probably won't be me losing my v-card.

Edit 2: Turns out her dad's birthday is today so he was home and he's not one to have any of that happening when he's got a word (or ear) in it :(  I got some smooches on the way out but that was all. I'll wait for later, in the meantime thanks for the pointers.",27Jan2017,1

19,"I played soccer year-round from age 8-18. When I was in middle school, I began experiencing significant tightness in my hamstrings when I would sprint. It got to a point where I could barely sprint faster than a trot or a jog because my leg muscles would tighten almost immediately. 

My sister also has the same problem. When she was in elementary school, her gym class was out on the track doing a quarter-mile race. She got off to a really fast start and, about halfway around the track, her legs began to tighten up and she fell on her face. After getting back up, the exact same thing happened toward the end of the race. 

I'm now in my 30's and significantly less active than I was in my teens, but I still experience the same issue when I try to sprint. I visited a physical therapist, who wasn't sure what was wrong, but tried to help me gain flexibility (to no avail).

23,"I currently live with my ex-boyfriend as my roommate and it has been that way for the past 2+ years. Despite our relationship not working out, we are actually very good friends at this point and living together has proved to be successful. Both he and I have dated other people during this time as well and that hasn't been an issue either. 

However, my ex has a female 'friend' whom he has known since we were dating. This friend of his contributed to alot of turmoil during our relationship (she could never accept the fact that he didn't want to date her, so she would try things all the time to disrupt our relationship or act out in ways to get his attention from me) and needless to say, me and her are not very fond of each other. 

When I first moved in with my ex, we discussed our expectations and I mentioned that I wasn't comfortable with this friend of his visiting our apartment, considering how I feel towards her, and he told me that it wouldn't be an issue because he didn't intend on entertaining her cries for attention.

Fast forward to a few months ago and on two occasions I came home at unexpected times, only to find that my roommate had this friend of his over the house and hadn't informed me that she would be visiting (one of our agreements is that we give each other a heads up when we have guests over). Additionally, when he doesn't answer the phone for this friend, she has shown up to the house to ring the bell looking for him. My roommate always swears that it would be the 'last time' that she crosses these kinds of boundaries with him and he will cut off their friendship, but I always see that he continues to engage with her anyway.

I feel that this is intrusive on my living environment and it really frustrates me to have to deal with him hiding information and me having to entertain these feelings that bring up bad memories of my past relationship with him. I have suggested that we find separate housing arrangements so that I don't interfere with his life, however he always re-iterates how much he enjoys the current living situation we have (which is true - good value, location, space, we get along well, etc.) and states that he will speak to his friend to ensure that it 'won't happen again'. 

I guess I am seeking advice on how to proceed - do I just figure out living arrangements for myself elsewhere in order to not have to deal with the frustration of this woman whom I despise,  showing up and being at/in my home or is there a way to possibly work this out? Outside of this issue, we really have nothing else that interferes with our living together.",27Jan2017,2

27,"The phrasing of this question probably sounds strange, but I don't know how else to say it. So I will provide context.

I really enjoy learning new ideas, new things about the world and basically putting things in my brain. I've found I get a lot of different benefits of doing this in my daily life. I listen to podcasts, Ted Talks, Google Talks, audiobooks etc.

But I have ran into this conflicting problem recently. There is SO MUCH stuff to learn, there is constantly new stuff coming out or I discover new stuff. Hours and hours of information and discussions for me to listen to, but there is only so many hours in a day and there is even fewer hours where I can appropriately learn effectively and keep this new found knowledge in my brain on a daily basis.

I think it is important to try to be open-minded and give everything a real chance, from new things to things I disagree with or don't care for. But there just isn't enough time to intake everything.

So when is it okay for me to stop giving things a chance and moving on to the next thing?",27Jan2017,1

I don't plan on really vacationing there (although I will be eventually), there's something I need to settle first while I'm there before I can really relax. I plan on staying at an airbnb since hotels are too damn expensive.

***

Reasons why I want to go:

* I had planned on moving there sometime in the future. I could use this chance to see if this country is really right for me.

* I don't have a professional/office job, nor do I go to school (I was actually saving up for school until I started having doubts about a year ago) so it's easy for me to ""drop everything"" and go.

* I've always been dependent on my family for almost everything and although I'm pretty independent now, I would like this chance to really get to know myself and my limits.

* I think that if I go, even if this all doesn't work out and I end up staying in my home country, I wouldn't regret taking the chance now while I don't have that many responsibilities.

* I can save up a bit more money at my job because I don't plan to go for a few months.

***

Reasons why I shouldn't go:

* I'm not fluent in the language because I was born and raised in America. I can read and write but it's at an elementary child's pace.

* Besides wanting to settle something and seeing if it's the right place for me in the future, there's no other reason I want to visit. I guess I don't know how to go on a vacation? I like staying in the hotel and using the internet so...

* Even though I want to take this chance to ""become independent"", I know that to really stand on my own, I shouldn't assume that once I move to a different place that things would change. It's probably best to start developing those habits now, here in my home country, than a place I'm not familiar with.

* This is going to drain my savings account.

32,"So me and my roommate are doing a coop together and he offered to drive us. Of course we’re paying 50/50 for gas, rightfully so. The coop is in a different city (city b), so the first time we went up to look for places, we split 50/50 on gas and I left him with a full tank of gas when we came back to our home city (city a). When the day to come to city b for our coop arrives, I go in his car and we drive up to city b. The plan was to pay for full tanks each and alternate paying full tanks to make it even. The trip from when I first got in his car, up until the gas was empty in city b, I paid that first full tank and we kept alternating, now he just paid a full tank. Now, we are going to do 50/50 on every refill. He’s saying that we’re actually not even on gas because he filled up in city a before we went to city b, remind you that I was never in the car and during the first trip, I left him with a full tank of gas. He’s demanding that I owe him a half tank of gas to pay for his fill up in city a because he thinks that it’s not fair that I didn’t pay half when he filled up before our trip. Basically, he is asking me to pay for his gas that HE used in city a and he will not keep not bringing it up. I wanted to drop this situation a long time ago but, this is his 3rd time bringing it up and the past 2 times, he said he understood, then always brings it up again.

33,"I've been seeing this guy for about 6 months, we have been intimate together, and something happened while I was away at uni.

I was out with my friends one night, and there's no nice way to put it but some man forced himself on me, I didn't want it at all. The day after it hurt a lot, and was obviously scared of the possibility of having an STI. I was very scared and upset, and 6 days later I went to sexual health clinic at my university to get tested. I didn't tell the lady what really happened, but there was trauma to my downstairs area and i (sorry for tmi) had thrush but I was given cream etc for it and it cleared up.

She got back to me a week later, all clear. I asked her to test me again, just in case. Again, all clear. I asked her if it would be safe if I had sex with my boyfriend, and would he be affected by anything. She said everything was fine and to go ahead. 

After feeling okay enough to be touched again, we did it. After a late night conversation I confided in him what had happened and he was understanding about it, told me to go to the police etc but I feel its too late now. 

It sounds dumb, but I was assaulted in the same way earlier in life, and in order to cope I thought if I tried convincing my friends it was a consensual one night stand, I would convince myself also and I would feel better. I did not. If I went back and told them it wasn't, I wouldn't be believed obviously, and I regret doing that. It was stupid but I wanted to comfort myself but I was so confused and upset.

I also told the lady that tested me it was consensual because I was scared and didn't want to get into trouble. I'm struggling mentally, and having PTSD from the previous experience, I find I'm having nightmares from both instances instead of one, and I can't sleep unless I feel safe.

I feel really gross and I messed up my chance of helping of girls the man could potentially target. I feel sick and disgusting. 

There's been a change in my downstairs area that would be a symptom of an STI, and I'm terrified about it. I accept that I'm going to get tested again and I will, but I got tested twice within a two week period, unless that's too early for symptoms or tests to determine whether I have anything or not, but the lady said it was fine. 

My last partner was an exboyfriend I broke up with months before I met my current one, and the tests came back clear and that would mean they are both clean. Unless something went wrong, because something really doesn't feel right. 

I really hope I don't have an STI, but I just don't know how to explain it to my partner if I do have something. I'll be responsible for him having it, and I already feel terrible if I do, but the lady said I was in the clear. 

I'm getting tested again to be safe, and am quite scared. If i do happen to have something, and as a result he has it too, how would I explain it to him? I don't want to lose him, but I'll feel so guilty and angry if I gave him something.

35,"Okay so i am a Junior in highschool in my second semester and i have been in this ghetto school for about 2 years now. I had been in another school of a much higher class my first semester of freshman year and on my second semester i moved to the school i am in currently and ive been here ever since. Now, my old school was very challenging. English honors was a pain in the ass because the teacher was an Ex-Magnet teacher so she was pretty demanding. All my classes were pretty hard but i knew i was capable of passing them. I love a challenge. I managed that semester with 2 B's and the rest were A's. Now after that experience I moved to the school i am in currently and lemme tell you this school is so easy. All my classes are so easy that i find myself slacking off sometimes and still manage to keep an A. The teachers are so bad because i feel like they either progress so slow, dont know their stuff or sometimes i end up knowing more than them (*cough* 3D modeling teacher) or they are just plain lazy and dont teach us much that it basically makes the period a free period. One teacher, my AP Physics teacher, is almost always so unprepared and not pushing us to do alot of work. On Wednesday we tried doing a lab but it failed horribly because he was unprepared as heck so we're now doing it on friday. I rarely get homework aswell and when i do i could finish it in less than 1hr if i didnt get distracted with my iPod as i do it that is lol. I just feel like im not being pushed to challenge myself more and learn new techniques because I am 100% certain that college will be much harder than this.

I'm (F/22) currently living at my dad's place until I find a job and then I'm planning to move out.

My dad's place is so FILTHY! I can't stand living here, it makes me want to kill myself! My dad claims to make about 85-90K a year, yet the house is a DUMP! Where the fuck does the money go?

Half of the food is rotten... There's no space on the dining table to eat. I have to eat in ny bedroom. Its a fucking hassle to cook too, cause pots and pans are always dirty and just going in the kitchen digusts me. Please don't tell me to clean! I have cleaned the kitchen for a whole 4 hours last time... it came back to the same state two days later!

Bathroom : Mold everywhere! On the ceiling, on the walls...The ceiling seems to be falling... it's cracked and it's peeling... it's fucking disgusting. My ex boyfriend refused to shower at my dad's place.. and he's in the army, so he's used to rough conditions... so you can imagine the bathroom...

The whole apt is cluttered with crap. There are two bikes HANGING ON THE WALL in the living room! I can't even relax at home... all I see around me is dirt, clutter and mold. There is carpet everywhere so it's hard to breathe.

I just can't do it anymore. I had some really dark thoughts recently... Why does he make us suffer like this???? Aren't we worth the effort of cleaning? Why can't I have a decent place to live... somewhere clean... somewhere I wouldn't worry about my health. A place where I could cook and eat at the table.

I've recently started to resent my dad a LOT for making us go through that. I've realised that I'll probably never get the chance to go to uni, since I need to work full time to be able to afford an apartment. It pisses me off so much.

I've been crying a lot this week in regards to the filth I live in. I'm actively looking for work, but until I find some, I don't know if I'll be able to cope with living here.

I just really need to figure out something. I absolutely cannot go at my mom's place (I won't go into details) I thought about Couchsurfing, but I know it's not meant for that. I only have 300$ left in savings. I can always go to the youth hostel (22$ a day), but I won't go that far with 300$. I would feel bad asking a friend cause I don't want to be a parasite either.

It just feel so unfair... I feel like I missed out on something really important in my life... having a safe place to stay. I just wish I could come home and unwind like everyone... in front of the TV or something...

I need your advice please... I feel stuck",27Jan2017,1

50,"I'm job searching now in various parts of the country that I think would be nice to live in. I'm yet not settled on a single city and I'm still in the sending applications part of the search, though I've already gotten some responses for further questions.

An example of what I'd consider a critical thing would be a reasonable commute, for me I couldn't stomach the idea of an hour one way. I did that in college, and it was never fun since my phone would die almost every day on the train.

As an example of a less critical thing, one peeve of mine matters a bit to me. I live in an apartment right now that faces to the north west, so every evening the suns shines right into my room. There's no way to orient my desk or computer to avoid the glare that ends up on my monitor, so one major factor for me would be getting an apartment that ideally faces northeast.

Another example would be that my commute drives directly into the sun both to and from work, and the sun visor does nothing since the sun is too low both ways. So I really don't want to have a commute that involves driving into the sun.

Of course what's critical and what isn't varies person to person, but I'm trying to gather advice to help make a decision that won't cause an avoidable every day irritation.",27Jan2017,1

Sports, politics, video games, school, places of interest around my city, you name it. Sports is an absolute no-go for I have little interest in it. Politics is tricky hence I dont talk about it with the exception of ""kind"" words about public figures. Games, sure but I can talk about it for so long until it's time to change the subject. Places of interest (restaurants, bars etc), nope because I haven't gone out much. I'm not in school yet so I can't even say anything about it.

I'm at a loss. Really just considering finding a job where there's 0 interaction with people because at this point, maybe it's better for me to just leave.

53,"So there has been a dog in my neighborhood that I have seen wondering before. But as of recently my sister and her two kids (5 and 9) played with the dog for about an hour. Now the dog keeps coming to our house and sitting at our front door and whining incessantly. We asked around the neighbors and found out that the dog's owner lives a couple houses down. So we took the dog to the owner and on arrival he asked if we wanted her. It turns out that the owner is letting the dog out to roam the streets because he does not want her. The owner's daughter got her at the flea market for 25 dollars and just brought her home one day. She is neutered and is in good health. Says she listens well and is house broken. The owner hates the dog and does not want it and will let it roam around till someone takes it or it dies. I always wanted a dog. I had one when I was little but I did not know how to take care of one. I'm a bit concerned, I didn't see myself getting a dog this way and really don't know what to do. I hate thinking that no one wants the dog and it gets no attention. I kind of feel like it is my duty to take the dog in now... my sister was about to give it a bath when I said hold on. I took it outside and was planing to walk around the neighborhood with her just to see if she would stay with me and didn't run off somewhere. To my dismay about half way around the neighborhood the dog got distracted by something and left me. I called for her but she just kept going. So I walked home, where I am now writing this. Was I stupid to think that the dog would stay with me? I feel a little bad because we were just about to give it a bath and let it stay in the house and that I somehow took a course of action that wasn't needed or that was wrong. Should I keep it and let it in next time she comes to the front door? What do I do? How do I know if I really want the dog or not? Someone please help me rationalize all of this.

54,"Posting from a throwaway.

I was in a long... Long term relationship, It was my first serious relationship and it lasted for about 5 years, It was also extremely toxic and my SO at the time was more manipulative than I realized until toward the end of our relationship. There was a lot of lies and a lot of infidelity, some of it involving mutual friends.

I've since broken up with this person and found myself with a much more trustworthy and enjoyable individual, The problem is that I find myself constantly paranoid and jealous that history will repeat itself and this new person will wrong me in some way.

In my heart I know that my current SO would never do anything like that, They're an incredible person and one of the most honest and grounded people I've ever met, that said however it doesn't stop my mind from racing just because they went to hang out with their friends or didn't return a text. It's small things like that that turned out to be signs of much larger problems in my previous relationship.

I'm afraid that this unfounded paranoia brought on by the baggage of the past will somehow sabotage a good thing that I've found for myself. I've told my current SO the full extent of the troubles involved in my previous relationship and warned them that at times I may be excessively jealous or paranoid and promised to do my best to not let that ever interfere with our happiness and they understood entirely.

Still I would like to avoid these thoughts all together, they cause me a lot of unneeded stress and anxiety even though I realize that they couldn't be farther from the truth, but the small 1% chance that I'm wrong is enough to keep my mind racing in an endless spiral of paranoia and anxiety.

I currently make 33K now at my job now . I want to leave my current position now because there is really no growth &amp; not a lot of work &amp; I feel like I have no purpose. 

This new job would be a lot more work and possible room for advancement. The only down side is my current job has more perks for example:

Potential Job- health insurance $175  a month HIGHER DED at $2500, 401K, Dental, Vision, 1 weeks paid vacation, 3 days sick , 3 personal , non paid lunches, 6 month personal review.

66,"Or at least he says he won't. Before i didn't mind him saying that because i had this grant that would effectively pay for 90% of my Univ tuition for 2 years. It's an in state univ, i'm a resident of that state, so tuition isn't as expensive as out of state. the cost of attendance was going to be $26K a year, $14 of which was just tuition and fees. Originally my plan was going to have my parents help me with only rent/food expenses whenever i needed it because i know they'd help me pay my rent if i needed them.


I haven't submitted my FAFSA because i'm not sure how much my parents have. My Mom says i have below the disqualification of my grant, my dad says we have more than that. They both made well below the income disqualification but it's their assets that i feel like i'm screwed in. But they are buying me a car soon, so at least $5-6k is going into that.

That grant was going to pay for my univ education, for the time being i was probably only going to get a small loan of no more than $5k from the bank/government if i needed to, it would've easily been payable. But not, $25-26K for my 2 years of univ is way too much and i'm at my last semester before i transfer.

My dad has it out for me and i'm not exaggerating much. When my older sister got into her dream Univ farther away from the one i wanted to go to, she got to go with all her expenses paid, eventually only needing to pay rent/food. And my parents happily helped her, but they have a good relationship.

Me on the other hand, i have a bad relationship with my parents. i was defiant towards them growing up, i felt they abused me so i lashed out, everything's better now but they still don't treat me as nicely as my sisters. My dad wanted me to apply to our local univ that i never wanted to go to, and he just threw out i could have lived at home, he would have been happy to pay. The rest of my family is more supportive of me going, but my dad's pretty much in charge of our family's money.

As it stands now my family has 2 options:

* pay off car loans, mortgage, buy my car, and spend like $15-20K so the most i'll have to pay for univ is most of my rent/food
* or don't and i'll be at least $25K in debt for tuition alone while trying to find a job and pay for most of my rent/food.

My other option is getting accepted to my 2nd choice univ (but harder to get into) that's a 30 min drive away while i'd live at home (i have a friend who attends there who does this). The cost of attending without my grant would be $14K, with it only $5K

I'm asking for a lot money wise but i can't exactly not do anything, i've worked hard to get good grades, i have really good chances of getting in and i've always dreamed of going to this univ. And i  have too many transfer units as it is, 70 something for  UC and 85 for CSU, another year and i don't know if i'm even allowed to apply.

With this grant i wouldn't have had to bother my parents about paying for univ, they were worried about how people get into debt because of university tuition, but mine would have been payed almost completely.

What i'm majoring in would pay really well. From what my professor has told me, a career in accounting (with an Econ&amp;Acct degree) pays very well starting, $52K.",27Jan2017,1

My question is a balance between finance and mental health. I do not know what is going on with my brain. 

I get really stressed out of nowhere over things I thought I processed. Although the things that originally caused the most recent episodes of said stress have lasting effects (the attempted suicide of my father and reactions thereof), I feel the same level of inordinate stress as I did prior to said incident; simply a more aggressive provocation resulting in more frequent feelings of stress. What typically happens is I'll think of something stressful and then I'll think of a lot more things to be stressed about and it snowballs from there until my brain feels like it is literally burning. Sometimes I can actually smell smoke or something burning. This feeling has been happening a lot more than normal recently and it's starting to get concerning. 

I know I need help but I can't afford it by any means that I am aware of right now. That is to say that I have sought therapy from a licensed therapist. As much as my family thinks they can afford whatever treatment I need, they cannot. Due to extenuating circumstances, I cannot ask my family for help in the first place.

Some extra information. I am 24, have a full time job, and I am on my father's insurance. I could maybe afford 50-75$ a month.

So my self(21m) and the third roommate matt(23m) moved in about 4 months ago with the original roommate Abby(23f). All three of us signed a new lease that lasts until July 2017. 

I'm used to living with animals, so when abby said she had a cat and a dog I didn't think much of it. Especially since she signed a pet agreement saying she had a dog and a cat. Well that went to shit. In the first few weeks of living here her dog at a bunch of pills when no one was home and threw up on the carpet, a lot. Then matt and I quickly came to figure out she is not the best at taking care of her pets(hardly cleans the cats litter box, cat is regularly hungry, dog is usually in kennal). Matt and I picked up a little slack and helped the animals as we felt bad. This was alight with me until it became to much. Along with regularly inviting other people with animals over, Abby has decided she needs a new 6lb chihuahua.

That alone breaks the pet agreement and lease she signed, but it's not over. 

Not long after moving in we found out that the guy she was dating(who also basically lived with us) was a convicted felon for drug related charges. Matt and I got nervous when we would see the guy drive by the house when she wasn't home. She dumped him because he went to jail. About 3 weeks later she found a new man. Again he is a heavy ""partier."" After a week or so he started to sleep over. Then sleeping over became him living in our house. Since mid November he has spent 85% of his nights and a lot of days in our house. 

It doesn't end there though. For a while, one of his buddies was sleeping on our couch(before he left because he was embarrassed about pissing him self in his sleep on the couch). After a few weeks his other friend moves to town. Guess who has been sleeping on my couch, his friend. 

I'm sick of paying other people's bills, listening to her yappy rat dog, having a sink full of her dishes, and waking up to people on my couch.

87,"Hello Reddit,

First post here. I'm looking for advice and I figured Reddit might be a good place to get a consensus quickly. 

I am 23 years old,  she's 26 visiting the United States on a J-1 visa, which will expire September of 2017. We met at a bar back in early November of 2016. When we first met I had to convince her to stay, as she had no intentions of staying here for a long period of time. 

She's a half Brazilian half Spanish stunner, probably an 8-9.5 depending on who you ask. Very feminine girl, willing to cook great food and take care of me, and in general very easy going, though she is capable of forming her own opinions. She's easily orgasmic too, so let's just say the sex has just been insane. tl;dr we love each other.

I have been scouring every possible way for her to stay here in the US (this should be a post all on its own), but it seems like the only way for her to stay realistically is on a marriage visa. She has a background in Human Resources and is unfortunately not an Indian computer genius, so institutions across the board will probably not sponsor an h1b for her right now or anytime in the foreseeable future. 

So she wants to take  English courses here and get an MBA eventually, which will probably take a good 3 or 4 years on an F-1. And after that if she doesn't find work and I still want her to stay, I am going to have to marry her, and she knows this. This will cost us probably 40-50k at a public or state university. This amount of money is not really a problem for me right now. I work in a field where and I can make this amount of money back in a few months. 

This is my first long term relationship (not a virgin prior, I had many short term flings in college), so I've probably got a case of tunnel vision here all things considered. 

With that being said, the problem is that I have no idea whether my feelings for her will wane by the time I will consider myself old enough for marriage (late twenties). I can say that I love her very much right now, but when I'm 28 she's going to be 31. I'm afraid my perspective on our relationship will take a bad turn due to the difference in our age. I am going to be frank here and say that my value to women will probably be much higher at this point in time. Ironically, my boss is 28 and she pulls seven figures a year. I know this all sounds extremely calculating, but I'm just speaking as a man in this gynocentric society.

I obviously don't want to say these things to her, but she has probably thought the same thing in some form. She probably has a lot of pressure to settle down, and she fears that my feelings for her will change down the line. I love her, but I don't want to drag her along, only to dump her when she's in her 30s and have her sent home. 

I would like to finish by saying that, ultimately, I just want a long term relationship with a woman who I find physically attractive and emotionally stable and supportive, so that I can focus on the things that actually matter like my career and hobbies. That's it. 

So what do you think? I appreciate your inputs.

92,"So i'm 28 living in my parents garage no job no friends and no relationship with family. I'm on the autism spectrum which I didn't know until i was 24 and i basically spent those 24 years being a shell of a person just doing the minimum to get by. I have a GED and no further education. I don't even know HOW to go to college. I've worked a few retail jobs and was good at them but I quit because i saw 0 benefit from them other than some chump change. I know that was irresponsible. My last job was a factory job which I quit after 3 months because I felt like I was going crazy literally standing in one spot for 11 hours a day looking at bricks pass by on a conveyor belt with some unpleasant co workers. The last few weeks I went to work I cried on my way there. Now i'm unemployed and spend about 95% of my time in my room with basically 0 human contact. I live with my parents but I can't even look in their direction. I spent Christmas and New years starving in my room avoiding them and other family. They didn't really seem to care to raise me at all except for when they punished me. Never showed any love or taught me anything. I'm messed up emotionally, bad depression, anxiety, etc. Last job interview I went to I was shaking with anxiety plus I can't bring myself to get a professional haircut so I looked like a junkie. I can be pretty normal on a good day even though it's just an act. I have no money or insurance for therapy. I went a few years ago and a psychologist told me ""it doesn't matter if you're retarded there's no prescription for that."" Also, I live in some small shit town in Florida notorious for pill mills so those two things don't give me confidence in the mental health system here. I think I could be okay if I had a job that allowed me to support myself. I'm not stupid and I WANT to work but there's few jobs here and even less quality jobs especially with no education.

I also want to leave Florida. I've thought about selling what I own and buying a bus ticket to somewhere with opportunity even if I have to be homeless for a while. Leaving is something I have to do though this place isn't for me. 

I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm looking for. Maybe there's some programs that could help me find a job and some kind of housing? Maybe you know of somewhere with decent job opportunities I could try to move to? Maybe you're a cult leader and I can live with you?

96,"The title says it all. Let me preface this by saying that I really don't mean to sound like I'm saying ""I've got all my shit together, everyone else sucks"". I'm legitimately concerned, and I'm wondering if I should see someone about it. So:

I'm generally a super happy guy, and it takes a hell of a lot to get me angry. I don't get stressed, I'm not insecure about anything. I believe that if I work hard, I can achieve just about anything. I'm very much a silver lining and half glass full kinda guy. I look for the good in every possible situation, and even when things seem like they're bad, I look for good somewhere and don't focus all my energy on what's bad.

Pretty much all the people I'm close enough to to know well have some sort of issue that's caused by their parents in their youth, or by some sort of event or experience. I'm constantly hearing about friends who openly admit that a stress/issue they have is stupid and damaging, but they do it because of XYZ in their youth. 

Every time I hear these stories, I draw comparison to myself and see if I would handle those situations differently, and I generally would. 

The way I seem to have all my shit together is seriously making me wonder if I really don't but am unaware of it because I'm somehow suppressing it. If it's there, I need to deal with it. I really, really don't want to fall apart when I'm 40 after I realise I've got a bunch of unresolved crap I need to work through.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not a perfect human, but most of the times I'm an asshole about something, it's because of some sort of oversight or because I forgot something. I piss a lot of people off because of my procrastination, but that's just because I can be lazy sometimes.

So: Should I see a professional about this and see if they can dig really deep for unresolved crap that I might have? Is my situation more common that it seems to me?

TL;DR: It feels like I've got my shit together in just about every way I can image, and I'm having a hard time accepting that that's possible. I'm scared I'm suppressing some stuff that I just don't know about, and I need to know if I should be worried. Should I be seeing someone about this?",27Jan2017,0

However, over the past while I have been away from work and a male coworker has been incessantly Facebook messaging me. It's beginning to make me feel uncomfortable and he has referred to me as 'baby' and asked for my other social media contacts and phone number.

99,"I have an ongoing intermittent FMLA claim with my employer. March 2016 when the claim was approved, it said I was entitled to 426 hours. I thought this was strange, but I never imagined I would surpass it, and I haven't. Yet. In December I had to have two hernias corrected which had me out of work for several weeks due to post off complications.

Now, I'm sitting at 420 hours used, or so. I decided to dig into their methodology. My employer is located in Pennsylvania, but I work full time in NJ. I am officially a remote employee and resident of NJ. The company I work for has thousands of employees and is based in Chicago. This is where 1 person is responsible for processing the employee end of the FMLA claims to Liberty Mutual (now Cigna as of 1/1/17) and she has been there for many years per my supervisor who has been with the company for 20 years.

On Lync with my supervisor, she almost led me to how the figure was calculated. She congratulated me on"" connecting the dots"" as though she knew what had been going on. She even said ,"" I don't need to dig my own grave.."" when I mentioned that people have been fired after exhausting their FMLA. 

I love my supervisor and wish her no ill will.

After looking at my (hourly) ADP/timecard. It is obvious that they took my 2015 hours worked + vacation time/52 X 12 to reach 426. They used the pre 2009 regulation or hours worked instead of scheduled. So they used 35.5 hours a week instead of the 38 I am scheduled. I worked less due to calling off before I thought to just file an FMLA claim. So I should have been given at least 450 hours, not 426.

TL;DR employer used old method of calculating hours worked for FMLA entitlement. Worked instead of scheduled.

How do I handle this. I told my supervisor that I was going to sleep and figure out how to address this in the least accusatory way possible.",27Jan2017,1

101,"I'm a recent graduate of college, this May will be 2 years out. I live at home, I have a steady job that I feel so-so about (It works for now but it's a ""job"" and not a ""career""), virtually no expenses and a decent amount saved up. My major was quite specific (Game Design) and I've been struggling to find a job in my field directly either due to bad luck, poor timing, being ghosted, or flat out not getting wanted for it. Meanwhile many of my peers have gotten jobs and some are onto their second already (Only relevant due to their/my qualifications).

I applied to--and have been offered, today--a QA tester position. For those unaware, this is entry-level work but still hard to get considered for due to sheer numbers and because of the unwritten ""entry-level but requires experience"" rule. As it stands, I am technically qualified enough/over-qualified for this. Many people in my field get a foot in from QA positions and work up but also there are many who get in on a low level Design job. I know I *can* get a design job and so have kinda strayed from applying to these level jobs. I admit, I am a little too prideful in this regard.

Here is where I need advice. The job pays very poorly. I would be taking nearly half an hourly rate cut (~$20 to $11, minimum wage), and need to move out and hours away. The pay grade is low enough given student loans, newly created expenses, and cost of living in the area that I would be losing money each month, and while I have enough saved up to pad this it is absolutely sub-optimal. This alone has me hesitant to take the job. Furthermore I have about 5 applications in the pipeline that are looking fairly fruitful but it is hard to say. I've heard back from some of them, gotten informal interviews, submitted design tests, but nothing close to concrete yet. All of these positions pay better and are for higher positions, so I very obviously want these over my current offer. This current offer has told me I need to get back to them by Tuesday, and I'd be starting the following Monday, which is also a strain on finding a place to live. Essentially, I need advice on if I should take a job where I am overall losing money monthly for a bit to gain exposure &amp; get me a springboard that could very easily and possibly lead to a better one, or if I should decline and hold out on my pending offers/keep applying to other places. I can't work out for myself if the dumb decision is to accept or to not accept, but at least I have this weekend to mull it over.",27Jan2017,11

106,"I'd like to start this post by saying thank you to those that are willing to steer me in the right direction here. I will give some background on my scenario: I am a 25 yo that has created quite a dilemma for myself. It all started with a DUI that I had got in college (stupid me). I did not follow the judgement given to me by the judge when I was arrested because it was in a neighboring county and I was in college and just buried my head in the sand. 

Fast forward 2 years later when I am trying to apply for jobs to pay for college ( I have ~90 credits and have not graduated) and I have an active warrant from the county in which I was picked up for the DUI. It's not a shocker that I had a warrant but where it gets tricky is that I cannot drive and my options for employment are limited. No license, warrant, and no longer able to afford college. My parents are not the type to pay for college for me so they are unwilling to carry my weight so I can graduate. I do not think I can get loans without a proper job--if I did have a 40/week job I wouldn't have time to go to college full time anyway. So my thinking is that I can find a decent (more than minimum wage) job that can help me pay through school part-time. That, however, is not an option because of my old DUI warrant for not paying the fees. Another part of the sentence I was given was to do 100 hours community service. I now cannot find a respectable place to volunteer because of the background check they run to weed out violent and sex offenders. 

There lies my predicament; how does someone who can't drive, has a low paying job, has a warrant, AND not college educated tackle my issues? What should I do first? I cannot remove warrant without volunteering/ I can't get the job I want(interviewed and was accepted for the position only for the background check to disqualify me) / can't go back to school and get my degree because of no money.

The morale of the story is I was very immature and definitely not ready for college or adult decisions when I left home. I have had to grow up a lot in the passed 6 months and my past of dumb choices is coming back to haunt me and my future. For reference I had a 3.95 gpa in high school and was a 3 sport athlete. Once I went to college and lost that structure I sabotaged myself with my own stupidity. Now that I am seeing the error in my ways it is making me very depressed and I feel like I don't have any other options. I feel like a loser and embarrassed to see my family and friends.  

Everyone always looked at me like I was going places and my future was very bright even to me. I think I let my ego get in the way. I got lost somewhere in the vortex of praise and expectation and rebelled into a total loser. 

Thank you for reading and I hope I'm not the only one out there that flew too close to the sun.

109,"Background: I'm 31. I made some questionable life choices in school (my mom's advice was to stay in college, take out loans, and take a lot of classes until I ""found myself"") so I have a decent GPA (3.00) and am thankfully only about $30k in debt, but I have an Associates degree and that's it.

SO. I'm married, my husband doesn't have a degree or any college and doesn't know what he wants to do, so one of us needs to go back to school and right now it's going to be me. I'm finishing up the last two prerequisites I need for a degree to be an ultrasound tech, which would be about a $70,000/year career path. It's a competitive field, though, and I might not be able to get into the program. I also cannot get *any* financial aid or loans. My dad lent me the money for this semester, but I don't want him to have to pay for me to go to school (and, quite frankly, he's been really sick for a long time and I'm not 100% sure he'll live another two years) and I'll have to work the whole time long hours to keep our heads above water. But once I'm done (Christmas 2018) I'm done and it's an in demand career with a lot of good prospects.

My other option is to go back for my bachelors. I think I'd enjoy sociology, and I could get a decent job working out of it but I don't know if I'd make quite as much money in the long term but I do know that I'd be able to afford to finish the degree and I wouldn't have to work so much while I'm in school to do it. And my husband is starting to get interested in doing something in medical as well.

I was always known as a dumb kid since primary school, and when I went to sixth form, I passed my GCSEs just barely, literally all C's. During sixth form, I did a lot of dumb things that I now regret and am paying the price now. 


First of all, I failed sixth form and left with 0 qualifications. Then I moved to college and failed again for the same reason. So instead I tried to go for an apprenticeship which I got fired from for always being late. This resulted in me trying to find a new apprenticeship which has left me in the situation I am in now. I stay at home doing nothing. The only good thing that has come out of it is that I work harder now. Those experiences have made me rethink my existence, and now I work harder.

133,"I recently graduated from university and have a BS in management. I got hired right out of school into a food industry job as a production supervisor.  I ""trained"" for roughly a month before taking over my own assembly line on 3rd shift. I like what I do and know I have a lot to learn but it has been nearly four months and I feel do not get the respect I deserve. 

I just turned 24 and the other supervisors are 40-60 y/o. The other supervisors did not go to college and the plant manager has referred to me before as his ""Guinea Pig"" to see what a fresh graduate can bring. Supervisors at this company started as line workers, then became line leads, and eventually get promoted to supervisor. I get along with all of them very well but there are instances of disrespect that make me question their integrity. 

Example: One of my operators found another job and put in her two weeks. I was talking to my line lead and another supervisor about options to replace her. The supervisor suggested I put the trainee on 1st shift to train for two weeks and then bring her back to 3rd when my operator's two weeks are up. I told him that I would be worried about her staying on first shift for good if she trains there (when 1st sees someone with potential, they often take the employee for themselves and give off-shifts new temps in return) Then, in front of my line lead, he tells me to ""grow some balls"" and demand that the employee comes back to 3rd shift when training is done. I didn't know what to say to that. Later, I told him not to talk to me like that and he apologized.

Conversations that belittle me in front of the employees I manage have become more frequent. This supervisor helped train me but now that I'm on my own, he treats me like a child. I have the same responsibility, pay, and accountability as he does. 

What can I do? The plant manager and my manager like me, my employees like me (with issues here and there). At the end of the day, I wonder what it will take for the other supervisors to finally see me as their equal and not some kid with a degree who should be ""saving the world"" by now. ",27Jan2017,7

She develops obsessions with one thing at a time and develops her whole life around them (certain social media stars, tv shows, etc. Just one thing at a time that she absolutely obsesses over). In reality, she's making herself miserable, because from an outside perspective, she has a great life. My family lives comfortably, and everything is done for her. She has no chores or responsibilities.

My mom has reached out to me saying that she needs help, and that my sister is ungrateful and intolerable. My mom is becoming so frustrated because she throws money at her (therapy, tutors, buying her things she wants to appease her), and she continues to be absolutely ungrateful and have a bad attitude. My mom asked me to take her out for a day, get her out of the house, and talk to her, but this is not an ultimate solution. I suggested that she should get a part time job or have chores but my mom is afraid of any kind of tough love, and I know any of these 'consequences' will be treated inconsistently. Additionally, my sister complains that she has no time, too much homework, and is stressed out with school, but there are people who do schooling and hold part-time jobs, so I don't see what the problem is. She has no structure.

Bottom line is, I don't know what to do to help her or my mom's situation. Any advice?",27Jan2017,2
142,"Hey guys,

A while ago I purchased a tactical shooter in early-access on steam, in the hopes that it might become the next SWAT or Rainbow Six (classic). However, the developer has sadly been hit by financial trouble, which has been caused be a couple of reasons.

* They've carried a bad reputation from a previous project which people have been quite vocal about.
* They've set their early-access price pretty low, which certainly hasn't helped their financial position.
* They also haven't attracted any investors (though I'm hoping this may change).

Because of this the lead developer has had to let most of the team go, and I'm pretty sure he's the only one working on the game now. Because he's the man in the spotlight, he also takes the brunt of all the flak and abuse online, which has certainly been detrimental to development. And at the end of the day he's a good man who's just trying to feed his family and make a game.

Things are looking a bit bleak, but I'm still hopeful. I've been very supportive via social media, often trying to counter the negative, abusive people (people are horrible). And I've also bought the game a few times to gift to friends and generally tried to spread the word.
I've reported plenty of bugs and offered to bug test if the opportunity ever arose, and I've also offered to do voice acting for free if they ever require it.

I know I'm way too invested, and I should just stop worrying. I just don't want to see this guy crash and burn.

So, my question is what else can I do to help?",27Jan2017,4
143,"Hi Reddit! I need some advice from you. I live in a large apartment complex here in NC, with a parking deck that includes a first floor with visitor parking, and four floors of resident parking (which you access by opening a big gate with a keyfob -- all residents have this). A few weeks ago, my complex hit 100% occupancy, so they gave parking pass stickers to all of the residents (for general parking behind the gate, not assigned spots) and contracted out a towing company to enforce towing for people parking in resident parking w/o a pass. The towing company hasn't done a good job of towing out visitors, though, and many residents have had problems with not being able to find a parking space past 8 p.m. on weeknights, as many visitors are parked in the resident parking behind the gate (I know this because I talk to my neighbors, and because we have a community forum and people post about this on a daily basis). There is enough parking for residents, but not enough for residents + 20-30 visitors illegally parked behind the gate. If we can't find a space, we can park on the street, but you can get ticketed for parking on the street without a city permit after 8 a.m. (so not ideal at all). Management's response to this is that they've hired a towing company, so that's all they can really do.

None of the resident spaces are assigned, and our lease says residents are not guaranteed a parking spot. But the parking situation is horrendous, and it's gotten to the point where I worry about losing my spot if I come home late from work/stay out late on a weeknight. What's my best solution here as a resident, other than moving out (since I still have 9 months left on my lease)? Should I call the towing company on cars w/o permits if I have a problem finding a spot going forward? I'm not sure if we're allowed to do that, but management hasn't told us we're *not* allowed to, and the towing company's number is posted outside the gate.",27Jan2017,1
144,"So, this happened just this afternoon and I would appreciate knowing whether people think I did the right thing. 


Some information up front - I am living in a European country where I don't speak the language. This detail is important to the story.


So, I am on my way home from work, walking up my street when I see two children that live a few doors down the road from me (both boys, aged maybe 10 and 8) run out of a side road with a man behind them on a bike (Turkish, likely early in his early 20s, not someone I've seen before). I don't really think an awful lot about it, thinking maybe he is a child minder. But, when I catch them up by the house I can see the older boy is crying.


I ask if everything is ok and the guy says it's all ok and tells me to carry on. Now, since I don't speak the language I can't ask the children to confirm this. I say, that I just want to be sure because obviously I don't know him and the child is crying. He tells me he is the nanny and pushes me on the shoulder and tells me this is none of his business and I should go. I ask him to tell me the name of the mother, just to reassure me. He gets the kids inside the front door and tells me it's none of my business and pushes me in the chest.


A woman passing by stops and he tells her the child is crying because he is scared of me and that I should go away (even though the child has seen me in the street many times). She tells me I should trust he is who he says he is. At this point I am standing on the pavement and he is standing in the driveway of the house. He comes out and pushes me, telling me to go away from the pavement as I scare the children.


I walk away at this point and he goes back to the door, I tell him I am concerned about the children. He comes out again, very aggressively and pushes right up to me, leaning his forehead against mine.


I backed away and he goes back inside and shuts the door. I called the police because I was worried. They came, went inside for maybe 5 minutes, then came out and left. So I assume everything was ok and he was just a very aggressive nanny.


Did I do the right thing? Would you have called the police in my position or am I being too interfering?",27Jan2017,31

Enter events of yesterday. Three days prior was my last day of work on a four days on two off schedule. At some point my coworkers and I had a conversation regarding high school and hand made clothes. Yesterday I had found old pictures of me going to a winter formal with a girl who was my best friend and made my dress. I showed the picture to the my coworkers I believed to be friends including a woman ""V"". Woman named ""V"" was complimenting the picture and saying I looked nice but also completely floored that I went to a school dance six years ago with a woman. She then asked if I was gay. I said no. It is well known im happily engaged. She then pressed and asked if I was Bi. Im a transparent person so I said 'Yes'

Enter continuous sexual harassment and assault. As a result of me saying yes, ""V"" screamed Eeeeeewwwww and started hooping and hollering and acting like I just licked shit in front of her. I ignored it and told her to shut up before going to do pt care with another female coworker ""H"". She continued to harass me asking if I like ""H"" and want to sleep with her and if this means i like to eat pussy.  Then she jumped in an empty bed across the hall and screamed out the door how she is ready for her sponge bath. She then moved to sit on an empty bed in the middle of the hallway and started stroking her thigh and chest while trying to talk to me saying that if I give her paitents a shower then she has a proposition for me. I told her no. She grabbed my thigh and said ""I know you want to"" and walked off huffing. She then sat in a wheelchair blocking my path and ability to take care of my residents. She asked me if I could help her toilet an old lady I said no but put my hair up and she said ""Slow down. You dont have to get all excited because we are going in a ladies room."" To which I said ""im not going and I dont have to""

164,"Hi all. Need advice. Got a new roommate for my flat a few months ago. Seemingly normal dude, get along fine. I'm always at work, he's always at work. Everything works well, we stay out of each other's hair. Last week I bought a nanny cam so I can watch my cats while I'm at work. I informed him IMMEDIATELY. Dude knows there's a camera for me to watch my cats and is fine with it. The cam gives me motion alerts when someone or kitties walk past. Two days ago, I get an alert (okay cool, I think, kitties are playing having fun!) Was not the case, roommate was doing the following: Telling one of my cats ""I am not your owner, nor do I have any responsibility to you, nor should you worship me. Worship the Lord Jesus Christ as I command you to."" A few minutes later he says something like ""I rebuke you, I order you to leave this house and go to the nearest tabernacle and never return."" About an hour later he comes back out of his room, stands at the front door, and gives a ten minute prayer speech, which I've now learned was him going through a few different Catholic prayers, doing the sign of the cross, etc. I don't really care about the prayer speech, that's fine with me, practice your religion bro. But, what he said to my cat is really weirding me out, as well as commanding something or someone to leave. I ended up doing a little more research on him, going through his social media profiles and whatnot and found his youtube channel. About three years ago he posted a long (15+ min) video discussing a possible schizo-affective disorder diagnosis, his medicine, how his parents don't understand, etc. Should I be concerned by all this? Is this dude gonna murder me and my cats in the night?! Any advice or experience you all have with this would be helpful.
Update 1/30/17: I ended up calling my roommate's dad, who confirmed he's medicated and has a schizo-affective disorder.

165,"She is quite shy and a more to herself person (and always has considered herself a lesbian but she's had quite a few boyfriends) and i met her at work (she was my manager) after being transferred to a new store,this was about a year ago but i've been good friends with since.

About 7 months ago i had tried asking her out since things were going well but she said no since she was my assistant manager at the time and she wasn't sure if she liked me. Took my losses but stayed close friends with her since i still wanted to be with her regardless since she's an amazing friend.

Well a few days ago we were hanging out and having a good time and asking questions back and forth (mostly truth or dare like questions but we were only doing truth) and just at the end of the day she brang up that the main reason she didn't go out with me at the time since was the assistant manager (no longer is since the store we worked at actually is closing in a couple weeks, but all casuals like myself aren't getting anymore shifts there), but she was having trouble asking if i still liked her (not friend like but like like). Since we were still doing the truth thing i said yes since i'm completely honest with her no matter what. From here my minds gone fuzzy since i never had expected her to ask something like that.

Before she departed she did give me more of a loving hug as opposed to her usual one armed friendly hug though.

173,"Okay, so my mother and I (Who are both Mexican) rented a home near a lot of rednecks and we're the only minority on our block. I have no idea why mother chose this place but she did.

Anyway, our next door neighbors have a very dirty and unclean home, which are owned by an old couple, the wife is super obese and the husband is like pot bellied and gross looking, who seemed like a jerk. Our landlord even said he was sort of an asshole but would ""give his shirt off his back for you"". Yet the wife was super sweet to me, so I looked pass that and whenever I would clean the backyard, which had TONS of leaves, the wife would appear and have a chat.

As I was cleaning our backyard, I noticed that it looked rather damaged with somewhere that looked like a bonfire.

Suddenly, the wife neighbor came out for a chat and she told me that our backyard was like that because our home had former renters who were the neighbors from hell, she was someone that brought random men at night, had bonfires at 1-3 am, allowed trash to pile up, never cleaned their yard and would keep her husband up. Btw the former renter was white.

So I was thinking ""Wow that's really terrible"" but then I noticed that she seemed a bit upset like she was reliving it again. So then the husband calls out his wife into the home, which seemed weird and rather rude to not say hello to me.

The wife then says ""Hey why aren't you saying hello to him?"" So then the husband gives a fake ""Oh hello Dude"" and I greeted him, while the wife gave her goodbye and went back inside.

Yet today, after I had finished up with the backyard, I wanted to rake the leaves near our driveway, which was really close near our neighbors home but still on our property.

So as I was finishing up with raking leaves, both the wife and husband come out with the husband talking. He asked of why I would be raking the leaves since more would blow there again, so I explained that it would look cleaner. 

So then he starts asking questions about our former location, and at the time, it was early in the morning and I was tired from cleaning up the backyard and studying for classes. So I told him the area but he wanted to know the exact spot since the area was huge and he had family there, but I kept saying the area and he seemed to raise his voice of ""where"" in that area.

I sorta fumbled and they both seemed suspicious but I recovered and said it. I then apologized and said I was tired. So then I said jokingly ""Are you trying to figure me out or something"", he then said ""No no, just making conversation"" and changed to sound more gentle.

We went on to talk about my career and I told him that I might study to be a doctor, which they seemed impressed by. So then he went on about my schooling and I told them that I went to a top honored school, which they seemed surprise about. He says ""That's a pretty good school"" and I said ""Yeah, much better than the school districts around here"", he agreed and said something like ""Sounds like you've been moving around"" or ""Looks like you've been moving around"", at the time I didn't know what he meant. I'm guessing because I said I went to a top school, which wasn't in the former area that we moved from. So he thought we moved a lot. 

But I thought he meant of me moving around the yard and cleaning up, I didn't ask but just say ""Yeah"" with a smile. So the conversation ends with him asking ""Do you like this place so far?"" I said ""Oh yes, I love it here (not really)"" so the conversation ends with them both going inside.

176,"I need some help on this. As stated in the title, I'll be heading to EMT school next week on top of work. I have 3 days off work in a week for class reasons, but right before and after those days, I have stupid hours.

First off, I'm not a morning person. I've been working as a janitor here for nearly 2 years, making anywhere from 200-300+ every 2 weeks, both evening and morning shifts. It's not bad on some days, but it's miserable for more than half the time I'm there.

I have school 3 days out of the week in the morning, from 9am-1pm. It doesn't sound bad, but I still need all the sleep I can get because of studying and focus time. I was told by the instructor that it's not an easy class and I need to read the book constantly.

My workplace wants me to come in from 6pm-10pm right before I come in at 7am the next day. I have to wake up around 5:40-6:00am to be able to drive there safely and level-headed. I don't like driving half asleep. I also have bad anxiety and insomnia, and when you put those 2 things together, it makes sleeping on a uniform schedule hard. I do take medicine, but it doesn't always take effect in full form or at the times I want it to. 

My point is, if I get lucky and fall asleep at 11pm after I get off work at 10, this gives me at the aboslute most, 6 hours of sleep. I feel like that's completely unnecessary for a janitor working 20 hours a week. My managers say they'll fix it, but end up scheduling me late evenings every SINGLE schedule right before a very early morning shift. I don't want to fail this class because I'm too exhausted to study and be motivated for school.

The only bills/payments I have to worry about are  possible future mechanic repairs for my vehicles (the class is 4 months long. I'd like to plan ahead), future EMT class expenses (maybe $200 for the outfit, and if my health insurance won't cover it, $300 for a drug test, Hep C vaccine, and TB test) and my $60 a month insurance. I'll also be trying to take medicine to help me focus in school, which is anywhere from 50-100 a month if I take it absolutely every single day (which I'll be trying not to.) My mother said she'll help me out with the insurance each month if I end up quitting to focus on school, so that makes it a tiny bit easier. My parents are very supportive about me trying to make my life better.

So in conclusion, since I'm already barely being paid at all, should I just quit and focus on my life? The near 2 years I've been at this place have been happy, sad, and miserable.

So r/advice, where should I move? I can only pick one place and I really want it to work out. The south looks appealing right now due to cost, weather, and overall way of life. But what do you think?",27Jan2017,2
182,"My brother hates me, I don't know why. He's always so upset or calls me a slut and I'm usually minding my own business. 

Basically I like skirts, they feel comfortable to me and I don't really want to wear underwear, bra or panties. I feel more relaxed just in my clothes. He hates it, I can just be on the couch laid back (Like you would sleep on it) surfing on my ipad, he walks by and says ""what the fuck, what the hell is wrong with you... you have no respect for yourself"" I just flip him off and he storms off. 

Another time, I'm asleep in my room on top of my bed, I actually feel asleep that time so it was an accident my door was wide open, but I guess he saw up my skirt when he walked by because when I woke up there was a blanket on me and a note that said, ""You're disgusting"" 

Or just the time my family went out of town together the entire time he was telling them how slutty I was and how I had no panties on, I was going out in public like that. My parent didn't want to believe him and my dad told him to stop looking between my legs, but the entire time in the mall or wherever else we went he would be saying ""look' you can literally see the bottom of her ass in that. When in reality you can only see that if I reach up or bend over, I feel like he was staring at my butt the entire day.

I'm 18 (19 in a few months) and he's 23, I like to think maybe he just hates that he saw me as a kid and know he feels like it's gross to see his little sister like that. But it's not like I'm waving myself at him, I'm usually minding my own business when he comes and sees it. I do often wear pajamas that have pants and sometimes, I wear them 2 days straight (I'm lazy since I graduated school), he still complains, ""you wore that yesterday... have respect, take a bath before you start smelling, I don't see how guys even want you, besides your body. You're a bitch, you're disgusting, and you probably have a std because you're obviously a slut"" And tbh, that did hurt my feelings, I just walked away, didn't say anything. He was still talking shit as I left.

He hates me... is it that big a deal? Am I really acting like a slut just by not wearing panties? Never have I bluntly told anybody that or have I made it obvious, I just find it more comfortable. Do I really have no respect for myself? My brother is really making me feel like shit, almost everyday now. Do I really need to wear at least panties?

184,"I'm half white (Polish and Romanian) and half Kurdish. Not many Americans know a lot about Kurdish people so I could easily pass for white.

My high school was pretty diverse - there were kids from all over the world (mostly from Cape Verde or the Dominican Republic though, since many people from those places lived near the school's area), and even though I'm not the most social person, I was friends with people of every race. I never paid much mind to the races of the people there since it was normal for me.

Now, I'm in a college where a good 80% or so of the students are white. The transition to this was sort of weird, but it's even weirder that most of the friends that I made are white. I'm also Israeli, so I get asked a lot of questions about where I come from, what Kurdish are like, whether I know if this person's last name is Jewish (I don't really know anything about Jewish culture so I don't know where these questions are coming from)...It feels like I'm surrounded and it's kind of weird.

I'm not really sure how I could stop the weirdness I have with my homogenous environment. I could make friends with other mixed people, I guess, but I don't know how that would work out. Should I just cope with it?

187,"So, Ive been planning this month long trip with me and my friend for about a year and half now. Mostly it was my idea and right off the bat we were both fully on board to take this trip in the summer of 2017. I researched alot, hours upon hours of the best places to go, how to get there where to stay etc. Told all my other friends and families about my exciting trip to come. Anyways it seemed pretty one-sided when it came to planning it but that was alright because I enjoyed it.
 
Now its 2017 with like 7 months left and my friend is saying that he might back out... out of nowhere. Tells me financially and other obligations are reasons why, which I understand since we are both college students and $$ is tight. But like I feel almost betrayed.

191,"Tomorrow is my boyfriend's birthday. I had planned to take him out for dinner alone, but he said his dad wanted to have dinner with him, too, and now it has turned into a huge family dinner outting with his brother, sister in law, all their kids, etc. They are all fine and normal people, but that is the problem. I feel like an outcast and that I don't belong with a family like that. I find it beyond difficult to go to events with other people's families.

I am an introverted person who has dealt with anxiety and depression almost my whole life. I do not get enjoyment from interacting with new people and it gives me anxiety. My family was never warm and did not get together for joyous meals or family events and I never knew any of my reletives. My family never had guests at the house and as a result I developed very limited social skills except for one on one interactions with the few people close to me. My social skills with strangers were so bad during high school years that sometimes when someone I was unfamiliar with approached me or asked a question I would just blankly stare at them because I didn't know how to respond and my mind would just go completely blank. It was horribly embarassing. I am a little better than that at this point, but that is to give you an idea of the extent of my struggles with socializing.

Anyway, I am being pushed into this situation of having to have dinner with his family tomorrow. I have been dating him for a year and met his family only once (Thanksgiving). I tried my fucking hardest to be friendly and socialable but I felt the judgement. After any half sentence I could muster up and try to chime in with I was always met with dead, awkward silence. I mix up my words too when I am anxious and sound incoherent and stupid. After several hours of trying and failing at being outgoing and likeable I just receded into myself and stopped trying. Just sat there and gave one word answers or didn't really respond. I hated myself for it but I was exhausted and I was crying in the inside and my eyes were beginning to water as I tried to keep myself from visibly crying. I could sense that they didn't like me and it was a downward spiral. I felt withdrawn and suicidal for days afterward as I replayed the night in my head and thought about how unlikable I am and how uncomfortable I felt.

I don't know how to deal with this situation for tomorrow. I feel that either choice I make- to go or not go, will result in his family thinking I suck.

Can someone please give me at advice? Does anyone who knows how this feels?

TL;DR- Feel extremely uncomfortable and suicidal after having to spend time with s.o.'s family because of how inadequate I feel as a person and I don't know how to handle a family dinner with them tomorrow night.

196,"I currently work at an alcohol distribution company, not only it involves free booze but my co workers are completely nuts, they have the craziest sense of humor. I recently passed my SSCP exam (for those who are not familiar with SSCP it's an entry level infosec certification). I was studying for months and when I finally passed it my co workers threw a mini party for me. My main goal has been to eventually get in infosec. Also, whenever I have difficulties, they are extremely helpful. On Halloween, my boss dressed up as Goku. Whenever I say or do something silly they always play along. Also, they have been brutally encouraging since day one. There was this time when I messed up and applied a group policy to a user I was not supposed to and our team lead blamed himself. I got all emotional and went to talk to my boss about it (who of course, was really cool about it). Also, when our new president got elected, given the fact that I am not an American citizen (here legally though, so no need to be hateful), they knew I was all sensitive because I didn't took it well. I got breakfast and cards and nice texts. Also, my current job gives me the time to study for my next certification (CISSP). It's unlikely that I get moved to infosec department because they are petty much complete.
People from other teams always stop by to say hello or talk about random stuff but when it's time to work, we work our derrieres off.
A few days ago, I got an interview with a very popular financial institution. They are a big name and I got offered an infosec position (entry level). Not only my interviewer had a very dry sense of humor, it also felt more like an interrogation rather than an interview. I tried to throw in a little joke (extremely professional, it was in regards to risk management framework) and he cut me off while I was answering ""WELL IN CASE YOU ARE NOT AWARE, THIS IS AN HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION"". He sounded like he was reading from a script and asked question after question (many of them technical). Also, one of the questions was how do I handle friction among teams which raised a red flag. And they asked me how I manage my time, given the fact that there would be days where I would not be able to ""in theory, have lunch"". I was told I would be testing 60 app components per week and they are aware that I want to get another cert, so I was told ""it was important for me to know how to manage my time"" Now the thing about this position is not only it means more money, it also means getting my foot pn the infosec door, which is extremely hard to do. I just felt very uncomfortable during and after the interview (I even cried when it was over, yep, that's me I'm a cry baby). I am confused, part of me wants to stay here where I'm somewhat ""safe"" (people have my back, team lunches, drinks, dragon ball, and laughing).

Cut a long story short we were going through a bad patch not talking, and in her usual fashion she adds back on social media some guys she use to just chat to(but he use to try it on)

Anyway this guy is friends with my brother in law, this guy is chatting to my girlfriend an propositions her to meet up for a coffee, she subsequently declines which im pleased about. 

This guy tells my brother in law, so being family of course my brother in law mentions it to me 'just letting you know so an so said hes been chatting to kim an asked her for a coffee but she said no anyway,just thought id let you know' 

So when i bring it up to her she goes hysterical an freaks out as if shes been caught for something, which is nothing at all im not bothered as she didnt actually meet him, more so annoyed that she played her usual games of re-adding old guys whenever we argue.

Anyway since this incident she has had the biggest grudge against my brother in law, saying he was causing shit, stirring, etc. When i think he was being loyal to me by telling me, as i would do the same to any of my friends or family.

I say to my partner how about if it was the other way round, 'what if your sister inlaw was told that a girl she knew had been talking to me an asked me out,would she not tell you?' And she cant say nothing.

I know that about two months before we started dating she was ""emotionally invested"" in someone else. This is always on my mind because it makes me feel like a second choice. I know she stopped talking to this guy because he touched her in her sleep one night when they got drunk at a get together. It's a very sensitive subject, obviously. After we started dating she tried saving her friendship with this person, which hurt me. Am I wrong to feel that way? I screwed up a couple of times, pretty badly. I went through her phone twice, which I know is a terrible invasion of privacy, but I was losing my mind. I found things that upset me both times when I looked through her phone.

For example ""my best experience at a concert was hooking up with John Doe, but I can't post that because .... would kill me"". Seeing those things really hurts me and makes me worried that she wants other people. But she insists that they are just ""jokes"". Where is the humor in that? Is it that I would be hurt by seeing that or is it funny that there's someone better than me? Am I crazy and over thinking all of this?

218,"**Where would be a good place to go, or who would be good resources to reach out to to have a bullet removed from my back, besides a doctor or surgeon?bold** 

Years ago I had the wonderful luck of surviving a center mass gunshot wound over my heart. According to the CT scan, the projectile missed my heart and arteries by millimeters, so I was extremely lucky. However, the bullet did not exit my body, but instead ended up embedded in the left anterior of my body; about 3 inches below the armpit. In the emergency room, it was deemed more a risk to attempt removal then to leave the bullet in; and understanding the situation and extent of my injuries, I fully concurred at the time. After the swelling went down at the site of the projectile, it was apparent that the bullet was just on the surface layer of the skin. Sadly, it has since went deeper into my body as the years have went by since incurring the injury.

Normally I wouldn't care to have the bullet removed, because I understand it has very little chance to be harmful. However, because of my past occupation, my lower and mid back is in extreme and constant pain anytime I lay down and try to sleep. In the past, it use to go away as soon as I got up and moved around. But now it lingers on for sometimes almost the whole day and is an aggravating factor in my already poor mental health.

I need an MRI to try to determine the cause of my lower back pain. I obviously already had a CT scan from the gunshot wound, and many x-rays since and have turned up with nothing. The only other diagnostic imaging I can think of that maybe has answers to the cause of my back pain is an MRI. The only issue is it is a risk (supposedly) for patients to get MRIs if they have gunshot wound fragments and bullets. But as it is showing and common sense would dictate, it is only really a risk if the location of the projectile is near the vicinity of vital organs. Also, most common rounds are hardly effected by MRI machines at all, with the exception of the steel core rounds. Regardless of these facts, my doctors did not feel comfortable allowing an MRI until I get my bullet removed from my body.

Things I have tried:
**Different doctors and surgeons**; most unwilling to remove, others all want to keep projectile for custody.
**Many different extreme body modification and piercing places** All reluctant as soon as they find out it is a bullet
**Old army medics I served with** None have access to equipment to feel comfortable doing it.

Other then that, I have no one else in my network. In part due to my poor social communication skills and introverted nature, I have no friends that can help me remove the projectile from my body. I don't communicate with anyone else other then my husband, for the most part.

If you are wondering why I just don't allow the surgeons or doctors to keep the bullet, I have attached included a few thumbnail links of my conversations with my medical care team to articulate the matter further. It would take a giant wall of text to explain, and it is just better explained in my already preserved communications with my doctors. Just start from the bottom of the email chain if you are curious as to why I need to retain the projectile.

Because of this I don't have any social skills or confidence, and I find it really stressful when I do have to talk to people.

There's a guy who sits near me in my classes who I've never even talked to. I know he likes the same stuff as me (same music, video games etc.) from overhearing conversations and, over the last week or so, I've suddenly started to feel really emotionally connected to him.
I know it's not a crush because I don't find him physically attractive and I'm not even interested in guys, but I just keep thinking about him and I feel really attached.
I know it's weird to think of a stranger like this, he probably hasn't even noticed my existance, but I've ended up feeling really reliant on him and I don't know what to do.",27Jan2017,3

I have a Regions account which apparently has ""smart ATMs"" that allow you to cash checks. I don't really understand how this works - would it be possible if I used one of these to make a check out to myself and get money that way without needing my card? There is money in my account.

235,"So my roommate of two months got a cat and is a HORRIBLE owner. She leaves for six days every week and will only be home one or two day before leaving again and will not leave the cat food or water. She yells at the cat every times she's home for crying but I think it's just looking for attention. Plus when she's home sometimes she will lock the cat out of her room for hours and he will poop and pee in the kitchen because he can't get to his litter box. 

I do my best to take care of the cat. I let him sleep in my bed, feed him, give him water, buy him toys, play with him etc. But I grew up with dogs and am slightly allergic to cats so I can't give him as much attention as I would like because I start to break out in hives.

My roommate informed me she is moving out (no complaints from me) next month and I really don't want her to take the cat. I fear that she is going to kill it or neglect it even more and I won't be there to help take care of him. Is it wrong of me to ""make the cat disappear"" and find him a better home?",27Jan2017,5

242,"Recently I was messaged on FB that someone had swallowed somewhere between 10-25 anti-depressants. 25mg each. I don't know the exact number or how much was thrown up in the mean time. I'll be referring to the person who took the pills as ""Jake"" and the person who sent me the message as ""Nathan"". 

Here is the story as I know it. Nathan and Jake where messaging each other back and forth, at some point in time Jake tells Nathan that he's going to steal pot heads from Nathan's grandmother, because his brother has better weed. Nathan takes this as a threat to his family, and ends their friendship. At some point, Jake threatens to end his life with his medication. Nathan tells him to go ahead and take the pills. Jake does, and sends a video of him taking all of the rest of the pills in the bottle, something like 13-20 pills. Nathan doesn't care to try to stop him or talk him out of it, he's fed up with it all. Que me. 

I'm sitting in front of my computer, playing FO4, and listening to mini ladd play cards against humanity. When I get the first message. It goes. ""Your Jakes friend. Do you think you can talk him into throwing up his O.D. of pills?"" I've only know Jake for a little less then a month. I take it seriously when someone is attempting to kill themselves. I contact Jake as soon as I read that message, and ask him what's up. I find out what kind of pills he took, and how many. I decide that the best coarse of action is to go to his house, and be there just incase O.D. symptoms take effect. While I'm there I find out what had lead to this point. I go home, and ask Nathan why he did what he did. I get excuse after excuse, about how he has no sympathy for people who threaten his family, and how he's done with trying to stop him, that it's not his fault Jake wants to kill himself, and that he's not obligated to try and stop him anymore. I blow up on him, telling him he's a piece of shit enabling someone to go ahead and kill them self. That's he's a petty person dumping off something that he enabled, to someone who isn't even involved with the entire situation.

I call him out for it on FB. I edited everyone's name, and face out of the pictures, so no one knows who's involved at all. Well Nathan calls himself out, trying to defend what he did. It ends our friendship, which I'm okay with. I'm not going to associate myself with a suicide enabler.

Cut to today 01/27/2017, and Jake wants to see me every night after work since this happened. I've only known this person for little under a month, and I'm not very intrested in being his friend. He wants to have drinks tonight at a bar near his house. I want some advice on how to explain to him that I'm not the kind of person who likes to go out every night after work, sit in my car, talk, and smoke cigarettes all the time. I like my space, and free time, I get off work super late in the afternoon at 11pm, I was there for him when no one else was, but I'm not intrested in having him cling to me like he is.",27Jan2017,1

She can do a lot of stuff on her own, but I'm there to help her with what she can't do and also to be a little company because she always says she's so lonely.  Problem is she's a smoker.  I'm not used to second hand smoke and it gives me bad headaches and I also just hate thinking about it affecting my health.  I got an air filter for my room, but the problem is that I want to be able to spend more time with her in the living area but can't stand being around when she lights up or even a bit afterwards.  

I don't know how long I can last living with her because even my room ends up smelling like smoke at times. I think it goes through the vents.  But if I move out she may have to move into a home.  I don't know if there is much to be done about this other than more air filters.  She says she'll try to cut down, but she won't quite. I'm just here to see if anyone has any helpful advice with having to deal with second hand smoke and ways I can limit headaches and try to keep myself healthy.",27Jan2017,2

250,"Okay so me and my dad JUST rented this home about 2 weeks ago and I viewed the landlord as a really good guy.

The home itself needed some repairs but little fixes in the basement, so since I was home most of the time, he would come over with fixing it but he would still give a call before coming.

Yet Tuesday, he knocked and I answered the door for him to come over without a call but I was here and he started to make fixes to the basement like painting the walls. He stops and says he had to go but he would come back, yet he didn't say when.

I had wished he called but I thought ""Alright no big deal"" But then I had to go away for something with my Uncle and when I came back, I find that my landlord's truck is outside.

I thought ""Uh...why is he here?"", I enter inside the home and find he was installing some curtains in the living room because they looked old and he was finishing up the basement

So I thought ""Okay that's great but..WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL FIRST?"" I hinted it to him that I didn't know he would be coming over but at a hint like ""Dude, you could've called..."" He explained that he was there for just some time but he still could've called.

I had security cameras installed and it looks that he knocked on the door then used his key to open up but I don't have cameras pointed inside, just outside but I do hear him just working on the curtains then going to the basement.

But this is still bothering me because as a girl, I could've been changing or taking a shower and with him coming in without calling was rather bad.

I told my dad this and he's really pissed, I have the video evidence of entering our place without permission, yet should we take it that far or just give him a warning of just calling next time?",27Jan2017,3

258,"Hi reddit. 
I'm a young professional with a job I LOVE. I work crazy hours though, 2am-11am, and I work weekends so my ""weekend"" is in the middle of the week. I used to love alone time and was so independent I needed ""a day off"" to shut down my phone and have some time to myself from my casual relationship to feel like I still had that independence. 

My boyfriend was in the middle of a horrible divorce last year, and I've always been great at legal issues so I supported him through it and helped with daily bullshit... I even worked out his settlement agreement when he was out of the country. My point is that it was emotionally exhausting. Also emotionally exhausting: we work together and had coworkers who disapproved of our relationship and made my life hell. Not just that, but my family too. My father didn't like our age difference, to the point that he had threatened to disown me if we stayed together. I lied to him and said we broke up, but I've since come clean with him although it's still really awkward and hard to rebuild our relationship. 

My point here is that a lot of this conflict, combined with our schedules, forced my boyfriend and I to really become each other's worlds. And so many days, I'd come home so depleted I never wanted to see anyone else. He has since returned to regular life, happy to have his freedom to see friends which he didn't have in his marriage. However, it was my support system that crumbled... things are still awkward with my family, I can't trust most of the people I was close to who are also on that awful work schedule, and to top it off, my best friend here just moved across the country for her dream job. 

My world revolves around my boyfriend, and I don't want it to. We love each other and want a future together, but I fully recognize I'm too dependent on him. I've started going to yoga which I love, scheduled a girl's weekend with my best friend from home, and I've grown closer to one of the coworkers I trust. I'm really trying, but I can't shake this feeling that there's something wrong with me for my social life being off-track. 

I broke my arm at work, and my boyfriend has a friend in town so I'm sitting around having a pity party for myself that I finally have a Friday and Saturday night off with no one to see while he has boys' nights with his buds. How do I shake this awful feeling that I'm a fuck-up for being so dependent, and my social life sucking? Any suggestions for getting it back on track? 

Thanks guys. ",27Jan2017,2
259,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. He's American and I'm a Canadian living in the Yukon. We had met when he was on an existential roadtrip to NWT. 

He had started living with me almost immediately after we started dating because he had nowhere to live (which is understandable because of the town we were in). He had a somewhat stable under-the-table job and I worked full-time. 

One day he went to his work place completely out-of-his-mind on acid. Later he told me it was because he was going through another existential frustration. So I became the breadwinner for the next year and a half. He was helpful with cleaning and cooking. Which was great because at one point I was working 3 jobs and going to college. 

It was perhaps a year into the relationship where he first hurt me. I have emotional-health issues and was screaming and crying at him to kill me. A lot of it had to do with the fact I had a very unhealthy interest in his ex-girlfriend and felt unbelievably consumed by it. Well, he grabbed me by the throat and threw me against the floor, then the dryer. He was immediately repentful. Said he would never do it again.

It did happen again. A few more times. I would try and break up with him but he would guilt trip by telling me he had nowhere to go. Which was true. And I did feel for him. He said he didn't want to live in America and I suppose I empathized a lot with that. He had come from a very physically abusive family, as did I. And so a lot of the physical abuse I understood. I didn't think it was acceptable but it was understandable. 

We went to a vipassana retreat one spring. It really helped us both, he hadn't hurt for a long time after that. It felt good to find a solution, I could finally help him without demonizing him. 

This winter, after a long period of time, in which he did not hurt me, we got into a fight. Ironically, it was about women's rights. I got really mad. Too mad. Sometimes I get too passionate. Anyways I sent him really mean and awful things while I was at the office. He came, took the computer I was using (which in all respect, was his) and left. He said later that is was because he was going to leave Canada. I felt so overwhelmed with anger. I took care of him for almost 2 years. Worked my butt off so we could go and do things together, vacation, etc. I went back to school so we could have a better life. And he wouldn't even allow me to keep an 8 year old (he owns another, better computer as well) computer so I could continue to work and support us? I got too upset by my resentment and phoned the police. When they came I told them the entire history of abuse.

He was immediately arrested. As a Criminology student I was vaguely aware of the Criminal Justice System here in Canada. I know, statistically, that if a man is arrested for spousal abuse, he is not very likely to commit spousal abuse again. 

He was released from jail a week or so after his bail hearing. We fought for a few weeks to obtain public and phone contact. I brought him a really good lawyer to do this. 

I know this is very TL;DR but I felt like I needed to tell the whole story. From both ends. My emotional abusive tendencies and his past of physical abuse. We are now in a spot where he has claimed 'not guilty' in order to try and fight being deported. There's a little more to the story but it's very complicated. 

Sometimes I want to leave him but I do really care for him. It would be nice to hear a neautral perspective.",27Jan2017,3
