1,"Hey everyone, I recently got a call from someone who works at my nearby Acme and I have scheduled an interview tomorrow at 2:30. This isn't my first interview, I had one before at McDonalds and I was actually hired. I feel confident, but at that time I was 15 and maybe it'll be different cause now I am 17? Should I just go with the flow like last time? I know key things are the handshake, to answer in complete sentences and make eye contact when speaking and being spoken to. Also should I bring anything? It's only for a cashier position and an interview, I really want this job for over the summer. Thanks!

Edit: It's the summer time, do I still dress nicely like usual? Khakis, boat shoes, nice dressup shirt and tie?",26Jun2017,1
2,"I'm 26 years old, 5'5"" and I now weigh 109lbs (I have lost 6 pounds in 14 days). I have been hospitalized twice these past two weeks because of various choking incidents and difficulty swallowing foods. The doctors have diagnosed me with dysphasia, which means difficulty swallowing food. The ENT doctor saw that there was nothing clearly obstructing my throat, and I was then ordered to do a barium swallow; however, I couldn't even complete the barium swallow test because they make you swallow various fluids and I had a panic attack and couldn't complete it. At this point, it is unclear whether I have an organic, anatomical issue with my throat, or whether this is all anxiety related. I certainly have extreme anxiety and I don't know what to do! I have developed a phobia now of choking on food; I was normal, well-adjusted person only a few weeks ago. What is happening???

I haven't eaten anything all day today, except for a few protein shakes. What do I do? I don't have health insurance, or a support system really, and I'm terrified that I will develop an eating disorder if I don't address the problem NOW. Please help! ",26Jun2017,1

5,"Let's assume the lack of contact is intentional and indicative of them not wanting to hang out again, because it is.

Let's assume also that ""don't take it personally"" is a bullshit statement because the issue is, almost certainly, an issue of their interest in me personally.

Finally, this is a recurring issue for me. Not a rare or one-off thing. I get it. I'm weird. I'm picky, and I don't tend to fit well with the people whom attract me. 

But I'm still lonely, I'm still tired of rejection, and I'm frustrated. What can I do, in addition to continually searching, to keep from beating myself up over it?",26Jun2017,1
6,"So for the last few months, I've been worried that something will happen and will cause World War 3. Most of it is just with North Korea and their nuclear missile stuff, being 15 and possibly having anxiety, it doesn't help at all, everyday I look online to see if anything major happened with North Korea, most of the time it's nothing major but for every once in a while there is a test of a missile but that's really it. Then the threats come in, they scare me, I can't tell if they mean it or if it's all for bluffing (hopefully bluffing) and then I usually feel sick, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I lose all motivation to do anything,because I'm so scared. Not all of it scares me like the nuclear bombs and stuff, but it's an EMP attack, loosing all electricity scares me so much, when ever I look up something I'll be in a good mood then something about an EMP just ruins me. Then good old YouTube comes in and I read comments, there was one that I read about a month ago that really got to me, this one person said that they know an Native American that predicts the future and he said ""in the middle of august there will be an explosion that will take out all electricity in America"" and he hasn't been wrong yet, who knows that could all be a lie for ""fear mongering"". Another reason and EMP scares me is because I wouldn't be able to talk to my siblings, my parents are low on money so we can't really get food for a while, and we would eventually run out of food, and it just affects me so much, I know there is nothing to prevent it but then the stupid headlines ""North Korea plans to. DESTROY AMERICA"" most of the time I believe them, I can't tell if they are true or not. I've talked to my parents and they say nothing will happen but no matter what they say it doesn't help. If anyone knows how to help or facts that will prove most of this wrong that would be wonderful! Thanks!",26Jun2017,1
7,"So I've been going to the gym for the past few months and cutting my calorie intake in an attempt to lose weight.

But the issue is that I seem to be going through phases of going to the gym 4-5 times a week for a while and being really good about my diet, and then somehow without even noticing I'm getting back to snacking and suddenly I'm barely going to the gym with little or no motivation to change back. 

I'm currently in one of these ruts right now, and I keep making excuses to not go to the gym.

Could any of you guys give me some advice on how I can keep myself on track?",26Jun2017,1

13,"I recently had a medical set back and had to quit my job. My husband was tr√Ωing to start his own company and it was super slow, so he took a normal job and huge ($11) pay cut to support our family. 
I finally got a job, although only 2 days a week and bare minimum pay cheques. 
We had a cottage booked (with in laws and sisters, 10 ppl all together) and we talked about our trip since January, my sister in law bought the kids stuff to go (swimming stuff, toys.. lots of item's) 

We were really broke for about 5 months, the older two kids knew and were really good about it. Not whining when we repeatedly had to say no we cant do that this year. They knew we had no money, my oldest asked why mom wasnt eating dinner or why i wasnt having meat?, just rice... (i did that so they would have enough to eat) 
My breaking point recently was when my 9 yr old said i have been making sure i only eat 2 things at first break so i have 2 for second break and i drink lots of water so im not so hungry. 
My 8 yr old gave me her birthday money and said use it for gas for work Mom. 
 
Now that im working again, we're trying to play catch up on bills, that are 3 -4 months late. Ive gone over our budget over and over and over and come up with a way we can still go but it isnt feasible. 
( we have no debt other than our mortgage, and a credit line, no bad habits, we dont drink) 
Our cottage trip was supposed to be in 3 weeks, and they keep asking about the cottage, but i keep putting their questions off. I have broken their hearts over and over with no we cant or we cant afford it. 
I know what i need to say, i guess im just venting.

14,"Hello, this is my first post! 
I have freckles and I'm used to getting mixed comments from strangers. Some people like my freckles (yay!) and some give me ""tips"" on how to get rid of them (rubbing lemon on my face, mayonnaise, bleaching cream... the list goes on). Depending on the comment, I'll either show appreciation or let them know that I'm okay with the way my skin looks.

But a few weeks ago I received a comment that I didn't know how to respond to. I was paying for my things when the cashier said he ""loved my freckles"" so I thanked him for the compliment, then he followed it up with ""I just think they're a beautiful imperfection"". I didn't know how to respond so I just smiled and grabbed my things. I think it was meant as a compliment but it didn't really feel like one. Was it an insult?
 I thought about this exchange longer than I probably should have. 
Has this happened to anyone else? How do you respond to weird ""compliments""?",26Jun2017,1
17,"so i met this girl a couple of months ago. little did i know she was lost. her mom kicked her out of the house at 18, she ended up moving into her old step dads pull barn. graduation day she totalled her truck and lost her only means of transportation. she's become increasingly depressed and i dont know how to help her anymore. me, being 17 doesnt give me much monetary liberty to help her the way i wish i could. She essentially has no family willing to take her in and her job doesnt pay enough for a small apartment. I love this girl, we used to date... but likely because of her situation it isnt working out. i still care about her and go out to make sure shes ok, but shes becoming increasingly suicidal. she takes pills and drinks till shes numb and ive had to save her multiple times. she has no health insurance either.... if anyone could help me find a way to help her find a home and stable income it would mean the world to me.

18,"Live in florida, a no fault insurance state  

Vehicle A (Me) is driving down a road in community I reside in, when Vehicle B (other driver) is leaving a parking space by backing out of it, as Vehicle A is passing. I honk immediately upon noticing the car baking out, and try to maneuver to the left but Vehicle B had already struck my rear passenger door, tire, and back-right bumper. (the back passenger half of Vehicle A). I immediately exited Vehicle A, at which point the other driver also exited Vehicle B. Driver B apologized over and over again for hitting me, and mentioned she would most certainly take care of any damage. (she didn't want her father to find out about it though, and offered to try to handle it privately, seemed a bit nervous but other wise very apologetic for hitting me). Regardless - I photographed both Vehicle A's and B's Damage, as well as Driver B's insurance, license plate, and drivers license. I also recorded Driver B's phone number. I did not notify the police of the accident. 

Is it worth reporting? why or why not? The damage is a scratch, dent along the seam of the door and the panel it lays flush against when it's closed. ",26Jun2017,1
20,"So last night I was driving home from a friends house high as a kite and was stuck at a red light. This light was longer than usual so I decide to open my bag of gummy worms that I bought. As I was munching on them, a car pulled up next to me with an old Chinese man behind the wheel.

So out of immaturity and boredom, I decide to mess with him. When the light is about to turn green, I throw like three worms onto his windshield and he suddenly brakes really hard. The car behind him taps the back of his car and now they are really fucked.

I nope the fuck out of there, and as I am making the left hand turn, the Chinese guy screams ""I got your license plate"" at me. Can I actually get in trouble for this if he goes to the police?",26Jun2017,0

Every time I go to fap they come out the second I touch it or get erect and they comstantly walk by and interrupt. They also walk by right as I'm about to finish and I have to hold it in so it hurts and every time I fap and lose my boner until they decide they're done.

I recently graduated the Diamond program. I will be looking for a nice diamond job on 47st. Anyway...I have access to many diamond cutters in the district. I got an investment from a GIA wealthy friend. I went on Alibaba and found rough suppliers in Africa. In NY many of the cutters are dying for work there is very little rough and I saw a big opportunity. They sent live videos of the stones with my name on it and they had all these documents and company names and addresses and it seemed to legit. I wired money using bank transfers and or western union to a few sellers to see.. They all turned out to be scammers... When they were ready to ship they all wanted a few thousand USD more for ""shipping and insurance"". I told them they can pay and when I receive the stones I will give them even more than what they payed but they told me they could not as they have to pay their miners and all their BS excuses... I argued with them all and they argued with me...and I was not going to send more money... I called DHL and it cost about 50 bucks to insure a few thousand dollars and the guys told me other stories like I don't know how it works there and all these african laws about sending stones in the mail... I heard after I loss this big amount you cant even send rough stones with DHL... I love diamonds and I think it is a fascinating career... Does anyone have any advice or any leads for 47st.

This is a huge amount of money to me. I was just hoping for ten dollars for lunch later which wouldn't have been a problem at all. I live in North Carolina and i don't think you can buy tickets where you work. What can i do to cash this? I was super stoked at first but this is quickly turning into anxiety.

27,"I'm 26, currently living with my mother. I don't work currently but I do volunteer at my public library and animal shelter. Two days ago, my grandmother and mother apparently had some argument over borrowing some money that she would pay back at the end of the week. She's on disability for a variety of health issues and can't really take care of herself. Of course, my grandmother pins the blame on me when it comes to most things saying I *won't* work (as if I have chosen not to) and that I ""sit around and do nothing"". I've been dealing with pretty severe anxiety all my life and I do what I can. But she doesn't seem to understand that, nor does anyone else in my family. They treat it as a joke.

Anyways, this argument of theirs pushed my grandmother off the deep end, as is the norm with her, always ending with her completely losing her shit. (*only* with my mother. she treats her son and step-daughter and their kids way better than us) She is now supposedly sending her son to come take our (her) car tomorrow leaving us with no transportation and with no reliable public transportation left to us, saying that if we have no car we won't have to worry about paying for insurance, as if that's going to help.

Now, I honestly have no idea what to do. I don't have any way to get my volunteer work and/or any possible future jobs I might be able to land and my mother will probably be unlikely to make it to her doctor appointments because of my pscho grandmother. ",26Jun2017,1

Afterwards I realized he asked me something's you wouldn't normally ask someone: Do you live alone? How many people stay with you? What street do you stay around? It dawned on me that's not normal to ask in an emotional response and we also took two selfies one with my glasses and one without.

32,"I currently work 9-5 for a great company. I love what I do and the people I work with. The only ""issue"" I have is my immidiate boss... the last year have been quite a roller coaster ride. You come in and have no idea if she woke up on the right side of the bed... it is like walking on eggshells. Even on her ""good"" days she could be a little bit too much. I have way too much stress when I am around her I started losing hair and my joints start to hurt when they never hurt before.

Last Wednesday, I was offered a job at a different company. The pay is seriously like less than a dollar more than what I currently make. On the plus side, they are paying 99% of medical benefits. So Friday, I gave my 2 weeks notice to my boss and her boss. My boss' boss, sat me down in his office and made an attempt on keeping me. He said, I should go home, talk tjis through with my spouse and give him a number on Monday. He did not make any promises, but he he'd try. 

From what I was told and what I have witnessed so far, when people give their resignation notice, they just leave, no negotiations and sometimes they even get cut off a week early. I wanted to tell him that money wasn't the only reason why I wanted to leave. To be honest, I would rather make about the same in the same company just as long as I do not have to report to my boss.

I need advice... should I still negotiate getting a possible pay bump in my current job and still work for my boss or should I take the new job? How do I tell the big boss that I just don't want to work with my immidiate superior without sounding unprofessional?",26Jun2017,3

-My Mother has gone into a mental health hospital today, she was been experiencing depression and tried to use Christianity to help her, this backfired on her and she is believing to be hearing voices in her head, she knew it was a problem and a potential threat to herself and others so she is getting checked out and the Hospital is keeping her for a night, currently unknown if she will be staying longer

-My Sister is an extreme alcoholic, every time she gets better she almost immediately relapses, she is extremely aggressive and verbally abusive to everyone in the house, when my parents accuse her of any Drinking which is almost always right, she gets angry, will deny it, and if pushed further will just ignore everyone

-I have been accepted into Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, however there are some obstacles to this, I cannot get any FAFSA Loans due to my family being above the income line, normally this is no problem because my Parents are willing to take out a Private Loan for me, however with my moms mental health in question I dont know how it will exactly work out, 

-Currently Unemployed, Perfectly Willing to get a job, right now I have around $450.00 from graduation money from my family, however the only problem is most companies whore over whether you have a degree or not, I tried to do one of those job placement programs recently but it was not a good fit at all

-I am interested in Gaming, however I do not know what games I exactly like (Gonna try to make a backlog) and when it comes to other interests, they all seem bland to me, How can I push myself to try things ?

Keep in mind I am not in a Brutal Financial emergency, as I have some family to fall back on and my dad as a somewhat stable income, however I eventually want to be independent and live a happy life, so here are some basic questions.

What types of Jobs should I go for ?

Assuming College falls through, should I be satisfied with a two-year degree or is to too much to go for a four-year ?

How can I make friends that are into gaming there is only one convention in the area every year and all the meetup groups are confusing to me ?",26Jun2017,1
36,"[27/F] In the space of two months this year, I got two seizures, one abnormal EEG, and a diagnosis of  epilepsy. But I think I'm in denial. At least, a little bit.

I'm a nurse, so the whole aspect of epilepsy as a neurological disorder is very much demystified for me, but I know nothing about what it's like to have it. Am I supposed to be scared of being alone, even though I'm not scared? Am I supposed to track every single headache or dizzy spell I get, even though I don't? Am I supposed to be so blas√© about it all? 

I've joked about me having epilepsy. Side effects of medication - just shake it off! Life is short - carpe diem! I did something silly - sure that's just my neurological disorder! 

 But I'm worried I'm avoiding the reality, yet, I don't know what the reality is. I'm on medication. Will this be it and I'll never get a seizure again? If so what's the big deal! I've had two seizures in my lifetime so I'm not --that-- epileptic, Can't I just drive again and get on with it! 

I'm struggling with acceptance, on the basis I don't know how. I'm not sure what it is but there's something holding me back. I can fake it on instagram all I like but the fact is there's this little part of me that's ignoring whatever having epilepsy is.

Been dating 1 year, both mid 20's. I am his first ""real"" gf, he is my longest bf. When we hang out together, I am so happy, time flies. I truly think the world of him, which makes this situation more difficult.

I am very upfront about my feelings. I have told him I loved him after about 7/8 months together. I have joked about living together. He does not talk about emotions unless prodded, which is fine because I understand there is other languages of love.

The issue is not that he does not say he loves me. He does not act like I am important to him. He is busy with work and hobbies (I am too) but he will invite me to hang out as an extra to his friends. We sometime hang out one on one, but he would not turn down a friend event to hang out with me.

He spends time on his phone when with me. I try to do nice things (plan activities, invite him to events, support him at his hobbies). It hurts a lot to feel like he could go weeks without giving me a passing thought.

I never expect him to be an avid texter or to hang out every day. In fact, I try not to bother him much expect to try to see if he can hang out. 

I am just so sad. I want him to be happy and it kills me to know I am not what makes him that.

Because this is only my side, I will try to paint his side as well. I am very vocal about how I feel, which can be intimidating. I also tend to give a lot of honest compliments. I make him talk about his emotions, which I know he would prefer not to. He is also VERY busy, has a lot of friends that I know he likes to see. He likely thinks I move too fast. I am a pretty open hearted person, so I do think that holds merit. I have brought up this issue many times, to which his rebuttal is that we are young and that he does not even say that he loves his parents.

I am lost, sad, and confused.

TL;DR: My SO acts like I am not important in his life, does not say he loves me. I still love him and it hurts.",26Jun2017,8

I am a 24 year old immigrant guy living in the states, moved here around 5 years ago because of family reasons and took the (maybe) stupid decision of studying Psychology as my major. Little did I know that a bachelors in Psychology would only get me jobs in Social Work and Sales. I graduated a year ago and I feel so mad at myself and life in general because of how miserable I am right now. I have been unemployed since I resigned from my job in social services and the only things that I could find were door by door sales or restaurant server positions that last only for a few weeks or days. I had to move back with my mother a few months ago and my life has been hell ever since. On top of all that, I can't drive. I do have my driver's licence (got it last year) but it has not been until a few days ago that I got a car. I have been practicing a little, I'm still scared but I guess it's a matter of practice and patience. I can only go as far as the Walmart close by to my place though.  

Anyway, I have an interview tomorrow with a company looking for a bilingual person to fill a human resources position. The problem is, that place is 2 hours and 30 minutes from my place. I never have driven that distance before and for the love of God, I can't follow the GPS while driving to save my own life. Needless to say I have no friends who can go with me and my family hates me. 
I feel like I should take the risk even if I'm not ready to drive that distance because I am being suffocated by my current lifestyle and I want to get out of my mother's house as soon as possible, but I am scared just to think that I will be driving for over 2 hours to a place I've never even heard of.

Furthermore, my mother insists that I will kill myself if I decide to drive there by my own because I am ""useless"". I am really tired of her insults but I have no other place to go. I am so scared  that I was going to call tomorrow and apologize to the hiring manager who offered me the interview but I also need to get away from my family's toxicity or it will end up driving me crazy. 

If I end up getting this job (of which I'm 80% sure I will) I will definitely need to relocate but they don't offer relocation assistant for my position (HR generalist), so I have been looking for rooms there but everything is over $400-$500 a month and I only want a simple room until I have enough money to rent an apartment.

What should I do?  ",26Jun2017,1
52,"Living with my parents after trouble paying shared rent with a friend. No working car, still no job. I've called around and I've got a friend who might have found something but we won't know until next week. Poor in terms of money, so I can't get an actual gym membership nor would I want one. My exercises is pretty much me walking an hour or so a day. 

I'd consider myself slightly out of shape, been spending more time messing with some games for free time. I'd like to have a balance between games, exercise and healthy meals. I spend majority of my day sitting at the computer. What is the best way to go about my exercise routine? Obviously I only walk, but is there anything else I could do? I've never really been worried about getting in shape but I notice myself getting a tad bit larger sitting around all day.

And something that just crossed my mind: how much would standing while playing games help? I just realized my monitor was more flexible than I thought, so it shouldn't be too hard to stand up and play. I guess that would actually help, so I suppose I should start doing that aswell.",26Jun2017,1

54,"So I called up my mom today and she spoke about events that happened on her day and went into a religious lecture that I just kind of just spaced out from. 

She usually dominates the whole conversation and I just kind of blurted how something along the lines of ""...sometimes I wonder if you talk so much because you like hearing the sound of your voice"" (which I apologized for) and then I mentioned how there's no balance between our conversations and that when I do bring something up, she doesn't really listen or engage and goes back to making the conversation about her. It makes me not divulge much about what goes on in my life and if she asks, I make it brief. 

I call my mom because I care about her and genuinely want to know how she's doing but I've come to realize how one sided our interactions are. 

How can I bring this up in a better manner the next time we talk?

55,"So to go more in depth on this, I'm 24 years old and moved back to my hometown this past year to help my mother tough situation (it also just so happened that this is where I landed my current job). My father left her about a year and a half ago (marriage was garbage), and left her in a home that's falling apart. He was initially paying the bills, but has since stopped. This is obviously difficult for my mother, since she was largely dependent on him, and now she is paying the bills on a part-time waitress wage. 

Health wise she is not good at all. A life-long smoker, her teeth are in terrible shape, has been extremely thin for a reason I have yet to determine, and I've noticed she has difficulty putting one heel down. She also drinks excessively every evening. This has all been present for quite a few years now. I think it's fair to say she's clearly depressed, and also struggles with anxiety.

She really struggles to take any sort of independent action, and will hide from problems (according to family, this has been a life long pattern). She even went 10 years without her license, simply because she never renewed it. I have since helped her get a new license, but I had to essentially hold her hand and push her every step of the way. I've tried repeatedly to get her to a doctor or mental health professional, but she just avoids and refuses it. I've also tried to help her get the ball rolling on a divorce so she can get what is legally hers and be able to somewhat support herself (My dad is far better off financially, and does not want to actually get a divorce for obvious reasons). Her tax situation is terrible, since she relied on my dad to do the joint filing and never checked in on it (my dad also has tax issues, so years of taxes never went through). I tried to help her get her taxes in for this year and pay the money she owes for not paying federal tax, but it was rejected for an unknown reason. I have recently found out that the restaurant she is employed at will be going out of business, and she's not exactly in a position to get another job.

I've been living at the home to help her out and to save money for myself, but I'm at a point where I just need to move out in order to protect myself and to get some distance from the depressing situation. I work in human services and make barely enough to support myself, so I can't support her. I also have two older siblings who are farther in their careers, but they have essentially given up on the situation since they tried to help for many years. The rest of my family feels the same way. 

Since she is avoidant of taking proactive steps and refuses to seek treatment, I'm thinking at this point my next step is to contact the Department of Mental Health to see what advice they have. Considering we are in Massachusetts, I figure there's gotta be some sort of resource that can help. I also have no clue what she should do when she loses her job.

What should I do? What resources are there that she can take advantage of? I'm getting my distance, but I don't want to just abandon my mother.


&amp;nbsp;


(edit) **TLDR**- Father left my mother. Separated but won't go for divorce. In terrible health. About to lose job. Clearly depressed. Avoidant of any proactive steps or treatment. About to lose her job. Unsure of what I should do to help her now.",26Jun2017,15
56,"My mom has 4 dogs. A lab, a great dane, a coonhound and a dutch shepard.

The lab and great dane aren't really that much of an issue, but the coonhound and shepard are the 2 that cause the most annoyance in the house. The coonhound squeaks at everything. Instead of it being a way for begging, it's just how she communicates. We let the dogs out at night when they need to use the bathroom. They wake me up by walking to me and poking me with their nose or just breathing in front of me. Recently though, instead of going out because they need to use the bathroom, the coonhound and shepard want to go outside because they want to bark at nothing. Possibly other dogs, possibly the horses out in the field, just whatever. If they want to go back in, they stand by the door and make sounds by rubbing their claws on the door or the glass part of the door. They all do that. Some louder than others. The lab will bark once every now and then if no one is responding to his noise. The coonhound will bark 2 or 3 times every now and then, and the shepard is miscellaneous. The great dane will make the most noise with his claws and doesn't bark at all.

They used to want to go out as a pack at least 2 to 3 times a night. But now it just seems like the coonhound and Shepard want to go out every 5 minutes just to bark at shit. Then they will want to go in 10 minutes later, then will shortly want to go out. The coonhound is the one that wakes me up and they both go outside together. The shepard doesn't wake me up and just barks inside.

I have been losing a hell of a lot of sleep because of the nonstop having to let the coonhound and shepard outside and in. I know the best alternative is to get a doggy door, but these are big dogs and the great dane will probably not fit in it. Also we have 3 cats, and we don't want them going outside at night because of coyotes. We also don't want animals like raccoons skunks or possums walking in and eating our shit or killing our cats.

Anyone got any ideas? I'm pretty tired of this.",26Jun2017,2
59,"I am struggling with friendship. I am in college and have many ""friends."" In any given day I can have a happy small conversation with about 20 different people. I love that type of gentle, humorous small talk; I know a lot of people hate it, but it is my comfort zone. Yet when I'm on breaks (like now), I don't have anyone. I will try to text or snapchat people but they won't answer, even the people I thought were the closest. Or they will feel like it's an obligation to talk to me and hang out with me. It makes me sad because I don't have a ""best friend."" No one has ever called me their ""best friend"" for more than 2 years at a time, maximum. It feels like everyone around me has lifelong best friends and I do not. I know kindhearted people who would be there for me in emergencies or life-changing circumstances, but no one wants to be around me when life is just regular. I think this is because I am disinterested in a lot of things that people talk about and do, like pop culture, sports and drinking. What should I do? Am I just going have this loneliness forever? I don't understand why I have so much trouble connecting with people, and it is making me more and more depressed.

Thank you in advance if anyone responds to this. I will pay your kindness forward.",26Jun2017,2
62,"My brother is a bit on the autistic spectrum. He often tells me that while he really likes his face (he's got a handsome face lol), he doesn't really feel like it's what he should see when he looks in the mirror. Like it doesn't match up with who he feels he is. No identity crisis here as far as I know. No gender dysphoria either.

Again, from what I understand, he doesn't have anything against it. He just feels like his face doesn't/shouldn't belong to him. Anyone know why he may be feeling this way? I'm completely stumped.",26Jun2017,1
63,"I'm going to this week long camp in a couple weeks and I'm pretty ecstatic about it, but the only thing that's keeping me anxious is the fact that I do not know anyone there. 
Everyone in this program has been in it for YEARS and they all seem to have such a close bond with one another. I'm quite introverted and shy, so I know that I'll find it really tough to try and go up to everyone and try to become friends with them because I already know that they all have their own ""group"".

64,"Hello viewers. I'd appreciate your help on this. I'm a 20 year old male btw. I had only 1 friend in high school for a short period. Since my 2nd year in high school I been a loner. Last year I thought I'd work on my loneliness. I seeked help from a therapist. He insisted that I talk more and so I did.

It so happened that it was around the same time a new coworker joined my job. We talked for a while and he asked me for rides home. I gave him rides about 3 times. He always bragged about how many women he met and the fun he been on with them. I enjoyed it because I thought he was cool and I liked hearing stories about women.

Unfortunately he called me 2 times on random days asking if I could drive him from his house to a certain destination. Not to hang out with me just to give him a ride. So he expected me to ride all the way to his house and give him rides like a taxi driver. I thought it was ridiculous. Each time I made up an excuse. Telling him I'm too busy or doing something. We still talked when I saw him around college. Recently we gradually stopped talking because we work in different departments now and go to school different days. I gave him a ride the 3 times because we got out the same time those days. It was passed 12 AM and I didn't want to leave him there with no ride.

It's been months and I recently got a call from him still asking if I could drop him off somewhere. I feel really disappointed. I thought I made a friend at first. Other than that I was thinking of how to avoid this from happening again. Someone who wants to take advantage of me. My mom heard about this and said it's because I'm soft. I didn't know what she met by that. I don't know if I wasn't cool enough or something. It kind of ruined my confident to try making new friends again.

65,"So this is a combination rant and looking for direction. Right out of high school I fell madly in love with a girl. We got married when I was 21. My entire college experience I was married, and despite the fact that we had an open marriage (mutual decision), I really didn't take advantage of it. She was my first, there were two others during the open relationship but they were one-night stands and incredibly unsatisfying. 

Fast forward nearly 8 years from getting married and she's found another guy. He's basically better than me in all regards and so my already low self-esteem took a hit and my inferiority complex gave a full-throated roar. On top of that she was dating the guy while we were still married which was allowed by rules of the open thing but in hindsight it did a number on me. We tried moving to a different town to see if distance from the other guy would change anything and alas, it did not. Therefore, we agree to get divorced. 

Fast forward three more years and now I'm writing this. She's getting married to Vastly Superior Man, while in those three divorced years I've been on exactly one date which last an hour and ended with a consolation prize type hug. Later find out that girl was doing the shotgun approach to dating and going on first dates with several dozen men. I apparently didn't win that lottery. 

So, just going with that and not getting into the depressing details about how the rest of my life got to be the way it was, I find myself wondering what I even do now. Through online dating and the occasional forays into the bar scene (not great, actually got laughed at on multiple occasions for reasons unknown), I have come to realize that I am not an attractive person. Combine that with a tendency towards introversion, a complete lack of self-esteem/confidence, and the very real possibility that I'm actually complete crap when it comes to having sex, I find myself wondering what I can do about any of it. 

Is it better to just give up on dating? Do I need to bite the bullet and realize that since I'm ugly, I should get used to dating ugly (terrible thing to say but I'm being blunt)? ",26Jun2017,1

So I just found out my partner (27F) of three and a half years has been cheating on me (29M) for a year. She was the one that brought it up, apologising profusely, and is very distraught. She wants desperately to have our relationship work out, wants the life we'd been planning together etc etc. Our finances are such that I can't just leave, or have her leave. Neither of us have anywhere to go or the money to get there. We also work together which makes things beyond difficult. She also has borderline personality disorder. I've spent two of those three years paying all our expenses (rent/food/bills/medication) on a single and relatively low income because her depression, PTSD, and BPD were so bad she couldn't work.

What do I do? I can't leave, she can't leave. I love her but I'm so fucking mad right now. We're just stuck in the shitty single bedroom apartment together and have to work together. She's very adamant about working this out, but I'm so fed up and tired that I just want to lay down and sleep forever. But I'm trapped.

69,"Hi Reddit, I apologize in advance for the long text but I must explain how I got in the situation I am today and to ask for some advice.

I bought my first car with my own money like 4 years ago and was very happy and proud of it and had everything in my life planned from then on, but my plans changed entirely.

Around 2 and a half years ago I moved to a different city to start a medical residency program. The program is full time but the pay isn't good and the city I now live in is expensive, also very far from where my whole family is. That's why I had to take a second job every other Sunday in a hospital nearby to help me pay my bills. But it makes me miserable and anxious everytime I have to go there. It's a 12 hours shift from 7pm to 7am, crowded, overwhelming and exhausting, with people yelling at you and threatening you.

Also, in this new city I barely use my car, it stays in the garage for very long periods and I pretty much only use it to get to the hospital where this second job is.

My residency is due to end next February and I still have no ideia if I will remain where I am or go back to my home town. The main point is I would like to quit my second job now, but I would be very tight on money. The solution I thought about was to sell my dear car, which I now barely use, but in 8 months from now my residency will be over. By then, I will be able to look for a job in the area of my choosing and quit the job I dislike but I might need the car to go to work (I guess I can always buy another, but that would take some time). 

I feel like I have no one to talk about this and get an impartial view so I thought why not ask Reddit....",26Jun2017,1

73,"So, as the title states, my mother found a gay pride condom case, in the toilet. 

Earlier in the day, I went alongside my friend to Pride. At pride they were distributing free condoms, which we obviously took; however, these condoms were in explicitly gay casing, with a rainbow and the center for reproductive health logo on them.

Later on, when I felt like using it, I tossed the casing into the toilet and flushed it. 15 minutes later, after my mom had used,  I went to use the washroom. Only to behold the casing, drenched in toilet water, sitting at the base of the toilet, obviously after having been fished from the toilet after it impeded it's flushing. 

My mom is very homophobic, as is my dad, and she shares everything with him. I have one sibling, but he almost never leaves, so he wouldn't be a suspect.

74,"I dated this guy for four years and it ended months ago. During the relationship he started out as the best man I could ask for. Slowly, he started becoming more controlling. First, it was ""don't wear that necklace, only prostitutes wear them. you're mine, if you love me you'll stop wearing it"". It then progressed to makeup, certain clothing, and even to the point to where I couldn't see my girl friends. Once I was isolated, he would hit me, push me down, kick me and point his gun at me just to name a few things. Once i got pregnant I finally got out. I ended up miscarrying, but I believe everything happens for a reason. 

Through mutual friends I recently found out he's dating his best friends ex girlfriend (they dated for about 7 years and just recently broke up).  I met her a few times and she is a very nice girl. I don't want her to go through the same hell I went through, no woman should have to go through that. 

I've already typed out a letter to her explaining that I'm not trying to break them up and that I just want her to be aware so she doesn't get caught in my same situation. I'm hesitant to send it for a few reasons. One, I can only imagine what he's said about me and I don't want to come off as the jealous ex girlfriend who wants revenge or wants him back. Two, I'm not one to get involved in others personal lives unless they want me involved. Three, while I highly doubt it he may have changed. However I sadly don't think he has, because up until about a month ago (theyve been dating for about three months now) he was making textfree accounts threatening suicide if I didn't get back with him, telling me ""I'll get what I deserve for hurting him"", and he even parked a few houses down from mine just sitting there for a few hours at a time.

85,"I'll try to keep this as brief as I can. I am from an immigrant family but strongly identify as American. The culture from which we emigrated is known for stigmatizing mental illness and emphasizing ""face."" My much younger half-brother died by suicide last year, in his early 20s. We were close, having been raised by my father and stepmother, whom I regard as my parents. In the time since, my parents have told their respective siblings (who are emigrating to the US) about my brother's death, but have not told their own surviving parents (my step-grandmother and my paternal grandfather, who both live in our native country) anything at all. The justification from Dad for the secrecy is to do with Grandpa's health--he is in his 80s and though generally clearheaded and in okay condition, liable to physically deteriorate with any stress due to a minor stroke he had last year.

This spring, I found out from Dad that he is separating from Stepmom--he told me before he told her. This didn't come as a huge surprise, as it was clear that for many years their relationship had not been a great one (exacerbated by conflicts over how to raise my brother as well as by the manifestations of his depression, anxiety, and social difficulties). The really crazy detail here is that Dad is having a child with a much younger woman (she's only 4 years my senior), and my new half-sibling is due in 2 months. He has not yet told Stepmom this news, though I have convinced him to broach it before the child is born, rather than 1-2 years down the line like he thought he should (""to protect her"").

I have tried almost continuously since my brother's death to get Dad to tell Grandpa the truth--at least that my brother died, if not the specific reason (as much as I hate the stigma around suicide). In my view, ""protecting"" Grandpa now from this reality is no protection at all. It is essentially hoping that he will die or become incapacitated before he finds out the truth from elsewhere or comes to suspect that something has happened.

I am for various reasons the only one likely to see Grandpa in person within the next 2-3 years--in fact, I'm going to be seeing him in less than 2 weeks. I have been talking more frankly with Stepmom in the wake of my father's moving out, and she today informed me that she will be traveling to our native country in a month to tell my step-grandmother in person about my brother, and about her divorce from Dad. I also found out yesterday from a cousin of similar age, who lives in the same city as Grandpa, that my step-grandmother has been asking around for news of my brother among my uncles and aunts (who are all keeping mum). Step-grandmother and Grandpa are close and talk to each other frequently.

Thus, I feel that things are truly coming to a head. Grandpa is liable to find out very soon indeed. What do I do? It feels wrong to ""out"" my dad to Grandpa. But it also feels deeply, deeply wrong to go along with my dad and say something like ""oh, my brother's doing fine, I just haven't seen him in a year because we're so busy"" as he wants me to do. I love my father--we are very close--but I have been very disappointed and frustrated by his actions this past year. What can I say or do to make my father pull his head out of the sand? And how should we frame the disclosure to Grandpa?

I'm sorry this is so long after all. Thank you all for any advice you can give me.",26Jun2017,3
87,"A little bit of context.. Her and I have been great friends for about 4 years. We pretty much do everything together and we're extremely close. The problem is that I know she doesn't have interest because I have a flirty personality and I can tell if my jokes get across to others in a friendly way or more. In fact, the first time I spoke to her was because I found her extremely beautiful and knew we had similar interests. The problem is 2 years ago I expressed to her that I had feelings and she said she would rather be friends. Now my question isn't ""How do I get her to fall in love with me?"", it's ""What should I do? Should I a) confess to her about my feelings and risk ruining the friendship that I value so deeply, or b) Attempt to lose feelings and move on."" 
On another note, I'm entirely fine with just being friends if it's what makes her happy. For some reason I hold such value to the ""status"" of being in a relationship with someone because you can be more intimate. Also, she has never been in a relationship but being her best friend I am aware of what guys she's into (looks wise) and unfortunately I do not fall into that category. 

Thank you in advance for any replies. If anything is unclear or I'm being to broad, let me know and I will elaborate more. 

Edit: she actually uses reddit and knows my user so I'll probably take this down within 72 hours.

91,"I'm feeling stuck in life and (thanks to the added depression) a complete failure.

I hate the apartment I live in.  I hate my job.  I think I should quit my dream. I can't seem to do anything right. I'm in terrible debt.

Let me go into depth so it doesn't just sound like random whining.

**I hate the apartment I live in.**  It is small, I have 1 window which is ground level so I can see grass out it.  And it's in an odd place.  No fresh air.  The people who constructed the place had weird choices and the kitchen is a clusterfuck.  AND my father in law lives in the apartment upstairs.  I'd love to leave but I can't.  My husband is co-owner with his dad on this place.  So he owns it and the only way to get out of his loan is to sell his half to his dad, whom can't afford it so wont do that.  We looked into getting a loan but they refuse as he already has a home loan for this place he is paying off.  But it still has quite some time left on it.   I don't even need a place much bigger, but I really need windows.  I feel like I'm trapped in a box.  I'd really like a kitchen where you don't have to twister around to open the fridge or a cabinet.  So I'm stuck here.  It is depressing. 

**I hate my job**  correction, I loathe my job!  It is a grave shift, so I have almost no time with my husband as we are ships passing in the night.  It is a place where hard work is punished and laziness is rewarded, and I'm a hard worker.  I never get acknowledgements for when I go ""above and beyond"" which is these cards they hand out that is a positive on our record.  And I have.  MANY times.  My prime example was talking a person out of suicide and got him help. But did I get one? Nope.  My coworkers get them.  For doing their job.  Someone got one for staying over a few hours.  I drove in on my day off, during a hurricane, to work a shift, and was chastised for not doing a double (I hadn't slept in 24 hrs at that point)  My supervisor is a dick and plays favorites.  I'm not on that list because I once asked him to explain a decision that was counter productive to the situation.  He's been there 6 months, I've been there 7 years.  He screamed at me in the office (he was having a bad day and took it out on me) and sent marks against me in my file.  Once day I was depressed and mopey.  When around customers I put on a fake smile but it's too much to do when I'm in the office.  He pulled me in to tell me I need to smile more.  Not at customers but just in the office.  So now I get anxiety when I get depressed because I don't want another strike because I can't keep a smile on my face for 8 hours.  And don't get me started on mandatory overtime! I would totally quit this hell-fuck-hole if the insurance wasn't so good!  My husband and I looked into getting insurance at his place, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as good and cost almost 600$ a week.  We can't afford that!  So I'm stuck here. 

**I think I should quit my dream** of being an artist.  So recently my therapist asked me if my art/art dream as worth the stress and aggravation.  I sell art at conventions and the prep work is time consuming, taking time away from other things including free time with my husband. So it's stressful.  I've been doing it a few years.  Not really any easier. It's a costly process too.  I'm not popular enough to where I'm out of the red yet.  So it's money out is greater than the money in.  But that is to be expected at first.  However, if it is stressful, and I'm not really making money from it, and my husband doesn't particularity enjoy it and it means all my vacation days from my full job go to working longer hours at conventions, is it worth it?  I really wanted to make enough to quit my day job but I don't see that happening.  People only buy fan art from me, so I'd have to keep on top of trends.  They don't follow or support me on social media to spread word of me, so more will see me so more will buy, etc.  All signs point to quitting but it's my dream.  I've worked hard for many years on this but I'm not getting any sort of break.  It feels like I'm swimming upstream, and my arms are getting tired.  This is probably the biggest contributor to my depression and stress atm.

**I can't seem to do anything right**  So I'm overweight.  I recently had weight loss surgery.  It means eating almost nothing.  And that is pretty much what I eat.  nothing.  I feel stuffed on one egg from breakfast, or 2oz of tuna fish.  I don't know what is going on, or wrong.  I was losing weight for a few weeks, when I was on only water, but when I was allowed to have food again, I started gaining weight.  I'm not eating junk food.  I'm eating their high protein diet.  But I'm failing at it.  How?  I am going to the gym too, although it's slow right now as I'm recovering from a hip injury as well, but there is no reason I should be gaining weight!  what am I doing wrong?  I'm afraid to go back to my doctor without results because most doctors don't believe me.  They will call me a liar and think I'm just eating candy all day every day.  Besides part of a cupcake on my birthday, no, I've eaten healthy foods.  I'm working out (slowly).  I consume 400-600 calories a day and drink water for all fluids (except 1 coffee in the middle of the night)  Why am I such a failure?  Why can't I even do this right?

**I'm in terrible debt**  This is mostly because of the surgery mentioned above plus student loans and just a pile of other bullshit.  Money always stresses me out, but because of this debt I had to stop seeing my therapist.  My insurance, as good as it is, doesn't cover mental health well, so it was still about 100$ a session and I can't afford that, and I only found out this week, so I've a pile of debt from them alone starting back in January during my first session.  I've thousands of dollars in other medical bills to pay first!  UGH

So I could use some advice.  I don't know what to do.  I hate feeling stuck, and with the stress of the debt, failure and possibly ending my dream of being an artist, I've been super depressed for about 22 days now.  Which causes me extra anxiety at work.  Ugh.

92,Hello. I'm a 18YM who is going home today from university. My birthday is next week and in my halls we often throw parties/celebrations for everyone. I'm not really too big on birthdays but was a little surprised when my friends didn't even get me a card even though we get a cake/card for everyone else. It doesn't irk me so much but they were then making plans to get someone else a card when their birthday is on the Sunday coming. I'm just a bit confused.,26Jun2017,1
93,"I'm a 23-year-old female virgin. I've done hand stuff a few times in the past but I had no idea what I was doing each time or what would even feel good for the guy. I felt so awkward about the whole thing every time. I didn't know where to look or what to do. I was way too in my head about the whole thing.

And because I was way too in my head once genitals were involved, it didn't even feel good for me. Like, soft touches all along my body would feel amazing. I could feel myself getting wet and everything. But then the moment my vulva area is involved, I could feel myself tensing up and drying up. Is there something wrong with me?

I've also tried masturbating but I don't even know if I've ever reached orgasm. That's probably a no. I even bought a vibrator this past Christmas and it hasn't really helped. I also haven't been able to stick even one finger inside my vagina so I have no idea how a penis would ever fit.

I don't have someone I could explore my sexuality with right now so that's another problem. I would want to explore this and have my first time with someone I felt intimately connected with. But because of my upcoming work plans abroad, I'm not looking for a relationship right now either. I swear, sometimes I honestly believe I'm going to die a virgin.

One more thing, I'm very adventurous with non-sexual activities. I love trying new things and stepping out of my comfort zone. (E.g. I ate scorpion the other day!) I think that once I overcome this initial discomfort with sex, I would be willing to try new things sexually too. It's overcoming this initial hurdle that's the problem. Any advice for me?",26Jun2017,1
94,I have been with my girlfriend for a few months and have been recently getting tired of how attached she is. She often has anxiety attacks when I don't reply and has a slew of emotional issues. I went to a party tonight (didn't know anyone) to find some acid and ended up meeting a girl at the entrance. We were both very drunk and hit it off in the three sentences we shared. I then made the decision to give her a ride once I was almost sober but she was still hammered. We had sex in my car (that she initiated) before I dropped her off. I am now feeling guilty that I cheated on my girlfriend and the fact that I had sex with this extremely drunk girl. What can I do to make this right? ,26Jun2017,1
96,"Hey guys. I'm stupid. The thermometer was 100% definitely mercury.

For some reason, I thought it'd be smart to test the temperature of very hot water with a mercury thermometer. Well, big surprise, the little metal end exploded in the jar. Bear in mind that there was a lot of water in this glass jar.

My body sort of went into survival mode. I put the actual glass part of the thermometer back in the plastic case it came in nearly immediately. I took the glass jar with the hot water and mercury out of the room and out of the house within 2-3 minutes.

My mom told me to ask my grandma for help. My grandma didn't tell me her plan beforehand. I brought the jar back inside. She put a paper towel over a little plastic dish and told me to pour. So I did. And then after filling most of the small dish said, ""what the hell, you have no idea what you're doing, I'm not pouring mercury down the sink"" and took it outside again. This all happened within around 3-4 minutes. I don't recall seeing any mercury in the little dish. I'm pretty sure my grandma just poured that bit of the liquid down the drain and threw away the plastic dish and paper towel into the recycling. Because for some reason she doesn't think mercury is dangerous. I don't think any mercury got into the dish because of the different densities and, again, a lot of water in the jar and I poured a small amount out; maybe 1/4 cup.

Then, outside, I poured the liquid into separate plastic ziplock bags without a clothes change but with gloves on. Eventually I saw a few droplets of mercury at the bottom of the jar with a small amount of liquid still left as well. I poured those into a ziplock bag. I put the ziplocks along with the glass jar and my gloves and my socks and the plastic case with the glass into a garbage bag and left it all outside.

My questions:

- Is there any chance of vaporization? The mercury never exited the hot liquid as far as I'm aware.
- Can the probable microscopic amount of mercury that my grandma poured down the drain vaporize and kill everyone?
- I'm mostly worried for my cat. His food bowls are in this room. Is he ok? He seems totally fine now. It's been around 6 or 7 hours.
- What do I do with the clothes I was wearing? Again, the mercury was only ever in the liquid, no not a traditional mercury spill. Should I just regularly wash my clothes in the laundry? Is it possible that they have any mercury on them? Will it contaminate the other laundry or washing machine? Will it vaporize off my clothes even though it never came in direct contact????
- Are there any other steps for me to take?

Thank you.

Edit: the water was NOT boiling. Just very hot.",26Jun2017,1
99,"I'm an 18 year old guy who just graduated highschool for reference.

Overall I wouldn't say I'm a nice person, but I'm not a bad person either. I feel remorse when I hurt someone, I don't enjoy being mean or anything like that... sometimes my jokes might go a little too far but we all do that I wouldn't say it's anything out of the ordinary...

But when I feel like I've been offended or attacked or anything I seriously turn vicious for no reason. One recent example was in a group chat this girl (who I know finds me at least decently attractive) made a joke about how I'm a catfish cause I looked better in this one photo than I usually do. It was obviously a joke and not intended to hurt but I felt attacked and I said a seriously fucked up thing to her, the kinda thing that hurts your self esteem Years into the future, in front of the entire 20 something people in the group chat. I was told she was crying in her first period class. 

I have my own insecurities that are honestly pretty strong I just don't show it so people wouldn't think it but they are there, always in the back of my mind. And when someone says something that pushes these insecurities it's like I don't even think about what I'm going to say in response I just say something that'll hurt. When I'm about to say or do whatever shitty thing I'm going to say or do in these situations, there is a voice telling me to cool down, but then I think about how the other person obviously wanted to hurt me or some shit that isn't even true to convince myself that whatever I'm about to say or do in response is justified. 

I ended up apologizing to the girl profusely and as far as I know we are okay now but this is literally a cycle that happens so often in my life. Someone makes a comment about something I'm insecure about, I respond with something way over the top that I know will hurt them, then I feel like absolute shit afterwards and apologize to them as much as I can to try and fix the bridge I possibly burned with people I care about.

I don't understand why I do this because I know what I'm doing obviously if I'm laying it out like this and I recognize a problem, but it keeps happening and I don't want to be an asshole who just hurts people due to me perceiving them to have tried to hurt me. 

Would going to a psychologist help with this or something? Like I know being an asshole isn't something any professional can fix but I feel like I legit have some kind of mental issue with relation to my insecurities because it's like when my insecurities are tested, I lose all control of my empathy and I just say or do whatever that I think will hurt the most. And then very soon after the empathy returns and I want to just take back what I did but at that point it's too late.

I don't know why the fuck I've ended up becoming such an asshole and I don't know how to improve on this part of my personality. If anyone else has successfully went from asshole to decent person I'd love to hear your story because I'm about to go to college then start my adult life and I don't want to die alone because I've burned all my bridges due to being a pussy who can't handle being made fun of sometimes without hurting someone.

Edit: let me specify here I'm not making this post looking for sympathy, I legitimately want to change this super negative aspect about me.",26Jun2017,1

I looked around me, there was a glowing box saying ""start simulation?"" ""Oh my god! This looks so realistic!"" I pressed yes, suddenly a burst of energy flew through my body. I could feel it going through my veins, it was like someone hit me with a baton in the neck, if the baton had flames and was passed down from Zeus himself. I fell on the ground, knees weak arms are heavy. My head felt like it was bulging, I looked up and saw two people, however these where not people, these where horror characters. The first guy looked like a freaky butcher with a bloody coat and the second guy had a hazmat suit. I jumped up and ran to a crate, I jumped and landed softly behind it and then peeked over the edge. The butcher had the man pinned on the wall and was beginning to choke him. The man's face began turning black and then fell to the floor. Then something else caught my eye, it was an exit door. Right as I began sneaking towards it, my arm accidentally hit a bottle and it fell on the ground creating a big sound, the butcher immediately looked at where the noise had come from, I quickly inched towards the crate. I looked beside me and saw an axe with a bloody tip. I quickly grabbed it and heard the footsteps coming closer, I jumped out and moved the axe towards his head. He quickly grabbed it and started to choke me, I kept trying to push the axe closer to him but with failure. My breathe started to stop as I slowly was weakening and fading away, when suddenly air shot into my lungs. I fell down panting, I looked up slowly to see a scarecrow with a bow and arrow slowly reloading and aiming. i jumped up and ran to the exit as i saw an arrow fly past me, i opened the exit door and quickly locked it.

Obviously the software development job is better, its what I want to train to do and not only is it industry experience, its also a paying position, but its really hard to commute to and the pay is just over half of the manufacturing position, which is much easier to commute to daily and the work is much easier for nearly double pay.

Important note: Guys I'm a solid 6...I'm just happy someone likes me. Both love candidates might seem scummy so please...just give me something.

Ok...and away...we...go

I'm torn between 2 girls at the moment.

Exhibit A: Her name is Sam. We had been dating for 5 years. We have a kid together whose 3. 

She is 3 years older than me. She was the love of my life, I saw us spending the rest of our lives together. We share similar interest, she's really funny. Super hippy chick, yoga and all that jazz. Wears nothing but yoga clothes. Heartbreaker. Namaste.

Exhibit B: Her name is Audrey. I met her at work about a year ago. Shes 3 years younger. She's super fucking cute, like holy shit she's gorgeous. Shes a super rocker chick...she literally wears what the perfect-girl-in-my-head would look like. She listens to the exact same music as I do. She arts like I do so that's a huge win. Super talented. Only problem is she's a huge flirt.

Now to the specifics.

Was with Sam for years as stated. She left me about 6 months ago for ""self searching"" reasons only for me to find out she was dating someone about 3 week after we broke up. But hey at least she didn't ""cheat"", right? I (still) love her to this day, I was absolutely heart broken. It hit me fucking hard man, but I managed to crawl out of that shithole.

So I hit the FA and as an awkward 23 year old with a 3 year old kid who had never been to a bar, had no success.  I managed a couple one nights stands but contrary to popular belief. IT FUCKING SUCKS. You know that feeling of disgust after beating it to some weird porn. It's like that but x100.

I fucking hated the situation I was in, I still loved Sam...And even tho I was slaying like 3 putangs lol I was just unhappy. Unhappy knowing that she was in a relationship and I was just fucking lonely.

We have a kid together so we see each other usually. We had sex a couple times no strings attached...but then ofc id get my hopes up and bleh. Back to square one.

Audrey worked with me for like a year. We would flirt all the time, but we were always super respectful cause we were both in relationships. I never thought she'd be into me and we hungout one day and that turned into her telling me she liked me and then us dating. She's super cool...we have so much in common. The only thing I don't like is she's a huge flirt...she thinks everyone is getting at her (which to be fair, she could be right). But she just doesn't handle it well, like she encourages it. She just has that personality. We've only been dating for a month  but it bugs me. I don't wanna say anything...yet..but I feel like in the long run I don't think I can be with someone like that. She's also younger so it could be that?

But besides that honestly the ecstasy she gives me is surreal...I wake up just naturally cheeky and I feel so good inside and out. She brings me so much joy.

About 3 weeks ago I picked up my daughter from Sam and had a very candid heart to heart conversation on the demise of our love. It was honestly amazing. We didn't really have closure and each time we talked prior to that it would end up sour. 

Not sure if it was the conversation..my demeanor..or just time doing its thang..but her attitude completely changed around me. She was being extra nice and touchy. About a week ago we were on the phone and she told me she broke up with her boyfriend. I asked if I had anything to do with that and she denied it and told me some stuff that made sense. I saw her that night and she tried kissing me and she told in tears that she's been feeling the regret for a long time but especially seeing me changing for the better. So I had to tell her that I had a gf and she was happy for me but you can tell it upset her.. 

Tonight she sent me a buncha messages saying sorry and that she loved me. And honestly I feel so bad...almost sorry for her. I definitely forgive her for doing what she did...but idk if I want her back. I love her so so much but she broke my heart.

But then again I'm gonna be honest with you guys I was a shitty boyfriend who did the bare minimum. I sucked and in some twisted inception way, I planted that shit in her head..that I didn't know how to love her and that someone else could. 

So now I come to you my annon Reddit friend.

I love Sam no doubt about it...if the past 6 months never happened I'd be as happy as can be. Just being around her I feel like I'm at home...it's just so natural and I can definitely see long term with her

I love how I feel around Audrey...it so fucking refreshing. I thought I would hate this cupcake stage.. having to redo and put in the work to meet someone but I honestly love it. She's super cool and I can't stress how cute and artistic she is. I like having comfort in my partner and idk if I do yet with her...it being so new...especially with how her personality can be. As much as I would want it to work out... I can't help but feel like it's more of a fling.

I know it's selfish of me to have to feel like I need to not mess up the other one by picking but I'm genuinely seeking advice and just more insight.

119,"Hey,im a second year dental technician student and i've recently read Robert Greenes book Mastery and it has really inspired me.Its basically about his life story working several jobs and finding out that he could never really be succesfull unless he had some sort of emotional attachment to the thing he was working towards.


Thats basically what im struggling with right now,im not emotionally attached/interested in dental tech so every time i try hard my brain just wont cooperate,i make several mistakes and im the worst in my class by far even tho i genuinely try.I dont know if this is truly caused by lack of interest or my depression but its starting to eat away at my sanity.


Recently i got kicked out of the lab i was practicing in,they had me in trial period for 1 week after that they would pay me.I went there every day for a week putting in 10 FUCKING HOURS of work and i still managed to fuck up and wrote names on a few models so the boss lady got pissed and basically had it with me and kicked me out.

122,"Just to warn you this will be a wall of text.

So the problem in question here is my Brother, just for some background info:

as of today, I'm 26 y/o, my brother is 17y/o, my Sister is 32 y/o, my mum and dad are divorced and live separately. My mum has had another child with someone since then, and is now with my current step dad after he cheated on her a few years ago. She is now married to the current step dad.

About 4 years ago my brother started getting into bad habits, such as coming home late, smoking and skiiving school. He had a good circle of friends and some not so good friends. Everyone in the family at the time (ex step dad had been kicked out for some reason, probably being an arsehole again, i cant remember.) had spoken to him about our concerns but didn't really go on about it because it wasn't a huge issue at the time. Over time these things became a bit of a recurrence and started to escalate a bit.

About 3 years ago my ex step dad was found to to have cheated on my mum and had a child with another woman, this prompted him to be kicked out permanently (which was good because he was a terror to our family). However this took its toll on my mum and brother (his son) as it tore them up and I found it difficult to help them as I didn't know what to do or say. My mum entered a depressive stage and I regret to say that in Hindsight I probably should have tried to spend more time with my brother at the time but I guess I didn't realise at the time.

Over the next few months things escalated more so, my brother almost never saw his circle of ""good"" friends and only hung out with others who we didn't know and who were older than him. Alot of these people did drugs (weed &amp; cocaine only ones confirmed). My brother started acting up at school, ignoring family members and just turned into an arsehole. Meanwhile my mum had met my current step dad and started spending alot of time with him (he lived in a diff city).

Things had been going missing from the house, money here and there and bits of food ect. Small things. We assumed we just misplaced items, and eventually we assumed it was one of my friends or his, so i had to keep a very close watch on my friends which was quite uncomfortable.

One day my ex step dad came into the house whilst my new step dad was over and fell into a fit of rage. This was a scary night, he tried to attack him and I froze for a moment not knowing what to do. I phoned the police whilst in the background my mum was trying to keep him away as he was trying to barge past her with a baseball bat, the police kept me on the phone as the conflict was going on in the background. Eventually he left with the only person being hurt physically was my mum (who was pushed to the ground) I have always regretted by actions this day, staying out of the way on the phone.

My sister soon moved back into the house as she broke up with her bf, and started living in the front room of the house as there isnt enough bedrooms.

The police did nothing. They apparently went to his house but because he didn't answer the door they couldn't do anything about it... Eventually he dropped off their radar.

More stuff had started to go missing from everyones possessions and it became apparent that it wasnt a case of misplacing. Eventually through one way or another we realised it wasnt our friends and it had to be someone in the family. Eventually after alot of lies we found out it was my brother who had taken things to fund his growing weed problem. My mum though upset like all of us tried to help and talk him out of doing these things.

I spent my thursday evenings with my sister watching films (ever since she moved back in to cheer her up and still do now out of habit) I also tried to arrange to spend more time with my brother on Tuesday evenings doing the same things but we didnt really have alot to talk about now as it was clear he didnt want to spend time with me (us). He started acting distant, being cockey and avoiding simple rules (come back at 10 ect)

His room also became a pigsty.
He got into having sex, drugs and hanging out with more dodgey people. He also did silly things like sneak out at night by stuffing his bed with pillows (schoolboy trick i know). His attitude in general was also alot different. He would talk back, ignore people and come out with stupid speeches to avoid simple questions. His attitude to people though was the worst as he even developed a smug smile which accompanied his ignorance.

In november 2 years ago my mum and current step dad got married. They were to be married in the next city over and the plan was Me and my brother were to drive up in the morning to help out before the wedding began. The night before I spent a little time with my brother and we actually had a somewhat heart to heart. We spoke of the wedding and how it made us feel, with me saying I was concerned she got engaged this quickly but if it made her happy then we should be happy with her choice. Its not like I didn't like him it's just he had some little things about him I didnt like but it wasnt too much of an issue. My brother sort of agreed and didnt say anything bad about it. When we got home we ate some food and offered to watch a film or play a game but he said he wasnt feeling well and wanted to go bed early.

The morning after I woke up early to get ready and I went into his room to wake him up and he was gone. I couldnt find him anywhere and I tried to phone him and his friends but all of them said they didnt know where he was (this was eventually revealed to be a lie as all his dodgey friends covered for each other).

I had to let everyone at the wedding know about him disappearing which obviously upset things that end. Eventually after exhausting other options I had to get his dad involved who also tried to look for him. I found out eventually through putting pieces together from snippets I got off multiple friends of his that he was at this old guys house who was known for drugs.

I drove over there half dressed for a wedding and banged on the door and shouted through the letter box. There was no answer and I was running out of time. I spoke to my mum and she told me to just leave him there if this is the game he wants to play.
I told his dad about this place where hes thought to be and I had to leave to go to the wedding.

when I was nearly there I received a call from his dad saying he found him at that house and that I clearly didn't try hard enough and was selfish for leaving. I said I cant come back now as It's too late and I was told to leave him now. I called up two friends who I live near by and asked for them to look after him for the day. He was badly hungover and had been doing both drink and drugs from the early hours. 

The weddings atmosphere was horrible. My step dad tried to arrange for him to come but he wasnt in any state to attend by this point. I caught my mum crying several times throughout the night.

The day after I went home with my sister whilst my mum and her new husband spent the day together in the town. They asked me to bring my brother home and tell him to stay in his room until they come home to talk to him, they also asked me to take his phone off him as he was grounded. Well, I went to my friends house to get him and he was like a different person. I asked for his phone and this turned into an embarrassing struggle in front of my friends and he was like ""NO ITS MINE, FUCK OFF I DONT NEED TO LISTEN TO YOU"" I told him to march home whilst I tried to explain a little bit to my friends about this situation.

My sister confiscated his phone when he got home and told him to stay in his room until our mum came home. I accidentally put my phone on silent and my brothers phone was dead anyway.

He tried all sorts of things to make it clear he wasnt listening to us. Such as bathroom breaks every 5 mins (he clearly didnt need it) and any excuse to enter all rooms of the house pretty much such as ""I need air that why I'm in the garden"", ""I'm hungry and need food"" ""I left something downstairs"".

My ex step dad (his dad) came to house and accused of us of ignoring him and keeping his son from him. I told him it was a mistake as I never saw his calls and his phone is dead and confiscated from him anyway. He spoke to his son in private then eventually asked me to speak to him.

Ignoring all wrong doing his son had did he criticized me for keeping him prisoner in his room and now allowing basic needs even though I tried to explain that he was doing these things to taunt us, not because he needed to. and that he had only been in his room for an hour before he came. He also told me to stop acting like his dad and that I was selfish for the way were treating him. All the while my brother was stood behind him was the smuggest of looks on his face that I cant get out of my head even today. His dad then went on to say, If he was with me this wouldn't happen so i interrupted and told him to take him please! We can't deal with him so he should. He did although make it look like he was doing us a favour instead of being a caring dad. He was clearly happy the wedding didn't go smoothly.

The next few days he berated my mum for not taking care of him ect and dumped him back on us because ""he didnt have the room for him"".

It came out over the next few months he was still stealing from us and that not only was he doing drugs, but also dealing them.

My mum arranged counsellors and drug advisors to see him but his lies had became so professional he could trick a nun into believing in the devil.

He had also started to get stopped by police in the street and caught him once or twice with drugs in his possession but got away with it as ""it's you're first offense so we will let you off""
A few months later he was caught by the police after using a knife to rob a shop with some friends of his. Well by this point I felt like I didnt know him anymore and started trying to avoid him and ignore him. He picked up on this and used it to taunt us more by trying to purposely ask questions to me to make me talk back to him just so I would break my silence. 

His court case happened some months after and my mum literally saved him by doing all she could to keep him from going prison, such as getting the school to help with good reports ect. his dad didnt do anything.

On the court day I went with my mum to offer support (to my mum, not my brother) We all dressed smartly and his dad came dressed in jeans and a very casual t shirt. He mocked us for dressing up.

I actually wasn't allowed to enter the courtroom so had to wait for hours. After the court case was complete he wasn't convicted (to my annoyance) and was free to go with a years referral. (basically if he gets caught by police for any reason within a year its dont pass go, go straight to jail). Alot of things went in his favour such as my mums efforts to help him, his ex teachers and dressing smartly.

Over the next year he shoplifted, still continued with drugs and stole from all of us. His attitude only worsened. He never got caught by the police because my mum paid fines to stop it going that far. We all kept telling her off for doing this as it was breaking the rules that were put in place to help us.

Things got so bad we tried to have him kicked out but my mum couldn't do it. Eventually he decided to live with a friend instead, like it was his idea to leave us. My mum visited him everyday to make sure he was okay. My sister moved into his room due to our ""you move out you lose your room rule"".
after about a month he came back home and it turned out he had racked up alot of drug debts which my mum paid (ignoring our advice). She didnt want trouble to appear on our doorstep.

He also got kicked out of school for various continuing issues and did more thefts to us and outside people. Including stealing an Autistic childs bike.
My mum kept paying all of his debts and kept on stealing from all of us. I eventually installed locks on mine and my sisters doors to help give us peace of mind. Me and my sister are close and we keep each other sane.

Last year he accidentally fell onto some class and cut his hand open quite badly. I took him to the hospital (and his friend who was there too, as he wanted to come aswell). My sister also came.
Well once again my hyde came out and he kept trying to ignore me. At one moment we had to go from x-ray to another part of the hospital to dress the wound as it had became undressed since the last dressing before the x-ray. He was adamant that he should have a cigarette first before going as its not a big deal. His hand was dripping with blood and I told him not to and to deal with the problem first before smoking. He tried to barge past me and i stopped him by putting my hand on his shoulder (opposite arm from his wound). He basically shouted at me in the middle of the hospital that I'm causing him harm and shoving him. I let him go.

I called my mum to tell her whilst he did this and then went out to him. He was smoking laughing and joking with his friend with an increasing puddle of blood beneath him. and waltz to the next area after finishing. I didn't sit next to him.

the next few days he was to go back to the hospital and i took him there to make sure he got there okay. My mum was to meet with him after she finished work but he left the hospital to go town with his friends instead of waiting to see our mum and didnt get what the big deal was.

Over the next few months we had alot of moments where he was caught dealing, stealing and bringing everyone down. He was causing alot of tension in the family and i tried several times to ignore him again which gave me headaches and made me depressed as I hated outright trying to avoid and ignore people.

My mum asked if he could use my PS3 as he doesnt have a room or anything so he wouldnt get bored. I let him although wasnt happy about it.

We tried to kick him out after yet another drug debt had came on the scene, but the counsel wouldn't do anything about it, and housing places wouldn't accept him. My mum refuses to see someone on the street unfortunately and he always ends up back at home. 

a few months ago we realised he had stole some of my step dads stuff again and I also noticed the ps3 was missing. I am currently going through the police to take him to court over this theft as I am fed up with doing nothing about it. My step dad was also doing this but pulled out as he didnt want to upset my mum.

He was found out to have been self harming recently although I had no sympathy for him as I know he's not trying to kill himself and just wants attention like always. although everyone seems to disagree with me and call me horrible for thinking that.
Two weeks ago the police came to our house with him and said he swore at them as they drove passed and arrested him for disrespecting the police and took him home to us. They said to us they think hes a good kid as he DOESNT HAVE A POLICE RECORD. My brother also recognised one of them for when he robbed that shop at knife point a few years ago and they laughed about it.

This weekend just gone he decided to be an arsehole on purpose and took my step dads PS4 and sold it all the while whilst taunting him on the phone. I told him to call the police and he has done. Not seen my brother since.

Every week something seems to happen. Im sick and tired of seeing my mum in tears.

My new approach to the situation is to speak to him like normal, and continue going through the police as mine and my sister's opinion is ""we wont be living here forever, so we just got to put up with it until were gone"".

I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like he's stopping us from continuing with our lives. I actually HATE him and I wouldn't care if I didnt see him again. My mum had to take some time off work last month on stress and I always get scared she will turn suicidal.
No one will take him in if he does get kicked out and my mum has a fear that his life will be ruined forever if she allows him to live on the streets. His dad has pretty much washed his hands of him and even threatens him because he owes him debts too.

I don't know what im looking for, or asking for advice wise but I just wanted to talk to someone about it other than my sister. (we talk all the time but it's nice to have an outsiders perspective and opinion).

Thankyou for taking the time to read this.",26Jun2017,3
123,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for about six months and I'm beginning to kind of struggle getting along with some people from his friend group. I really just want to know if I'm making a mountain out of a molehill or if I'm justified in feeling the way I do. We normally go out together to a bar on a weeknight where a number of his friends are also present. In total there's about eight people - one being his close friend and one being his ex girlfriend, who he isn't friends with but she's part of the group.

This is essentially two parts, sorry that it's long.

His **close friend** and I have never really seen eye to eye on how he treated his own now-ex girlfriend who was really nice to me, and how he treats people in general. He's quite stuck-up and is nice to people's faces however stabs them in the back quickly - these are traits that I don't have and don't like in a person - but I respect my boyfriend's and his friends friendship and although I keep my distant I'm never unkind or rude.

About two months ago, me, bf and his friend went out drinking and some comments were made behind my back whilst I was getting us all some more drinks, my boyfriend and his friend were outside. I was quite intoxicated, as were the rest of us, but the friend told my boyfriend that he should ""take her home and stick it in the wrong hole to teach her a lesson,"" which I was told after we had already left and me and my boyfriend were back at my house. I felt (and still feel) so embarrassed and demeaned but my boyfriend reassured he got stuck into him for it and stood up for me and that's the last I've heard about it.

Moving forward, although I've felt uncomfortable and anxious around his friend, we've still gone out quite a few times. Two weeks ago, however, his friend got caught cheating on his ex (they had already broken up after she had found out) and he came up to me and my boyfriend saying horrible things about her and how it wasn't his fault, he did nothing wrong, etc etc. Since this girl had been so nice to me, I felt compelled to stand up for her. I said I thought what he did was wrong and that he needs to stop treating people so poorly. Things began to get heated and we (bf and I) left after a few minutes. Since then, I haven't been acknowledged by him which honestly doesn't worry me, since I don't want to even associate with people like that, but I don't want to even sit around him. My boyfriend says he's proud that I stood up for this girl because not many people would - his friend is physically and mentally intimidating - but I'm hurt because I feel guilted into going out with this group every week when I'm clearly uncomfortable.

Part two: his **ex girlfriend** always hangs around this group as well. This is only a recent thing - she took a break from them all for months so when I started hanging out with them she wasn't there - and she's been incredibly nasty to me and my boyfriend in front of their mutual friends. 

I'm upset about being kind-of-but-not-really expected to go out there every week (I feel like I have to because my bf probably will feel like he can't go if I don't) and put up with this bullshit - my life is incredibly drama free because I choose to make it that way. I feel like it's me vs. them and I don't want my boyfriend to be upset with me for not wanting to hang out with his friends, it's just that I feel twice as bad when I leave than when I get there due to being treated like this. I feel like there must be something wrong with me and the way I handle these things to make them dislike me, but literally every single one of his other friends and I get along really well and say nice things to and about me.

Another dilemma I have is me not wanting my boyfriend to hang around these people. His friend has treated me so badly, even *to his face* and I didn't get a lot of support except a text saying ""hey man I didn't like what you said about [me]"" which he got the responding message of - ""oh fuck off"". I don't want him to hang out with his ex because these are all people that they hung out with when they were together and I feel threatened and jealous, not to mention she's said nasty things about both of us. She and the friend are really good friends, also. They worked together, hang out all the time and had a FWB type situation (after my bf and his ex broke up). I realise that this is selfish but I can't help but feel annoyed about him not doing *more* to stand up for me, whatever that means. I think I'm just expecting too much though and I can live with it.

Am I just blowing this out of proportion and thinking about it too much? Should I just keep going to save face and to not make my boyfriend uncomfortable, or am I justified in not wanting to go and should I vocalise it? My boyfriend already knows I'm uncomfortable but tries to encourage me to go and hang out with them because ""it'll be fine, everyone really likes you.""

tl;dr: my boyfriend wants me to keep hanging out with his friend and his ex girlfriend who have both treated me (and my boyfriend) badly. not sure if i should go to make him happy or stand my ground and say no - i feel weird if my bf goes to hang out with them without me though.

125,"14yrs m , im pretty much the loner guy at school. at least i used to be. last year i spent all my time on my laptop. now its broken. this year i have nothing to do, so i thought i'd just go by. and then i met him, we became friends. he seemed like a nice guy, and he was for a while. 

but recently he just seems like the type of guy i'd really hate if wasn't for our history of being friends for a few months. im personally really sympathetic, more than i want to be. i also realised after having an actual friend after so long that im the type of guy who doesnt want friends. i want the mostly the perfect type, or nothing. i dont want to keep talking about myself and i dont want to sound like a stereotypical edgy teen, so ill stop here.

back to my friend, he seems to be more shittier the more i get to know him. he's not THAT bad a person, but still not the type of person i like. he's making fun of me, every mistake i do, spreading this and basically encouraging others to do the same. i share a lot of stuff and help with no problem, but he seems to hold back most info he has that gives him an advantage over me (we're pretty much the top 2 in the class intelligence wise). he acts like he's smart in the field of logic/arguments and the like, either bragging or trying to get me. but his arguments are of too low quality, and me being me, i just act like it was decent. i have the ""treat people how you want to be treated"" thing in me. he doesnt do that. he's also giving me a lot of shit for everything, unnecessarily so. i have a lot of stuff on him, but i hold it back. he also said he doesnt like the type of person who's easily offended(separate conversation), so i get the feeling that me telling him everything will either make me seem like a weak person, or make him too ""offended""(cant think of a better word here rn) to keep being ""friends"" like we were. he's also kinda annoying on discord, just the way he does things i guess. 

so basically, what do i do? i think there might be a way to keep getting along, but im not too sure i want to. should i stop being friends? being a loner is much more calming/comforting. how should i do it if i want to stop? there's a lot more stuff about him but im kinda up late rn so i cant write everything. actually i wouldn't write everything anyway. but i guess you cant expect a person to be simple.

also, major detail i kinda left out, i dont think he knows he's being a dick. he just sometimes acts like one. more often recently. so dont really want to suddenly go ""i hate you""/""were no friends anymore"". but i dont want to stay friends that much either so dont guess that i care about him that much. im just too sympathetic. i even sometimes feel sorry that evil ass person that begging for his life which the MC mercilessly kills for revenge in some animes. i try not to................

130,"Throwaway account. 

I have been interning at a non-profit for two years. I graduated with my BA in May, but in February I was offered a full-time salaried position with them. Great, I love my job!

Unfortunately, the governor issued a hiring freeze. My company was not supposed to be affected, but a clerical error categorized us incorrectly (we receive no appropriated funds). So my salaried job was put on hold until September. That sucks, but they offered me a $2/hr wage increase as well as the opportunity to stay on full-time. I accepted. Unfortunately, I was told on the day that was supposed to begin that I can't work full-time, and was capped at 30 hours/week. I was not okay with that, and I'm looking for a new job now.

I got my paycheck Friday. I was not given the $2/hr wage. This is devastating, as I'm moving into a new apartment soon and this completely destroys my budget. That's a couple hundred less per month than I was expecting, and as a recent college grad every penny counts. 

How do I bring this up to HR (in control of payroll)? Would an email suffice? I wasn't told ever that I wouldn't receive the raise. It's definitely not a case of ""that can't go into affect until this date,"" because I was specifically forced to wait two months for it to come into affect. Thanks so much.",26Jun2017,1

I also do not have my own room and sleep on a sofa. With no local family support (Here being Misouri)

Pros To Where i live. 
For the first time in my shut in life i've had friends that i can wake up in the morning to hug and see with my own eyes not through a screen, I feel driven to finally get my GED and eventually a job.

Cons to Back Home.
Small town where my Teenage actions damaged my image. No where to work, high housing prices. No real friends to speak of in my area also having a hard time bringing myself to look outwards to others. If i did find groups and places to spend my time they would be mutli hour drives. Also depression from leaving current friends behind

Pros to Back Home.
Financial support from family, as well as emotional and a bedroom of my own. Larger pool of resources, Medical that full covers all meds and doctors appointments. No risk of losing place to live, potental to move to larger nearby city with family to allow for social expansion.

134,I have a 50 pound lab that is 2 years old. I have known that he is territorial and have had him fixed. We have also taken him to behavior classes for training. My sister had a friend come over with her mom and was going be picked up for summer camp. Sister won't tell me what happened but my dog slipped out and attacked the girl. Her mother intervened and was attacked as well. They ended up in the hospital needing a few stitches each. When people come over he is supposed to be crated in the house. When he is in the yard he is monitored and only chases cats really. He is responsive to verbal commands and will stop when I tell him. He has his shots up to date.  I am willing to pay medical bills but my dad told me that he is either going to shoot the dog or the dog will be leaving the house. Animal control will be by later for my dog's vet information but Idk what to do. This dog was raised from two weeks and came into my life during a suicidal point. If it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't be here. I feel like I owe this dog his life but I am also terrified I may have to bury him soon for something that should have been prevented. I live in Ga if that is any help.,26Jun2017,0

145,"This is my first time on quora so i don't really now how 

this goes, i'm assuming its a website where we people can 

anonymously discuss their issues... i'm a 19 year old boy 

from Pakistan, i'm a muslim and im gay and i want to die.
When i was a kid, i was coeerced into 'playing' with an 

older boy, i didn't know what i was doing and honestly it 

wasnt bad, nothing REALLY happened and i defintely didnt 

feel any pain or anything. But it is something that i 

attribute to me being gay.
I don't think my problem is me being gay, ever since i was 

a kid everytime i would feel upset i would want to do 

something suicidal, i have memories of a time (probably 

when i was six or seven) when my parents would punish me 

and i would try to smother myself. This continued for a few 

years, when i was 13 i once tried to stab myself but found 

out that i didnt have the courage to do so. But thats just 

how it is, ive been wanting to die for a long time and my 

problem is i dont know why.
I've had a happy childhood my parents are loving, good 

people, i dont get along with my dad at all (he was very 

strict and still is though its lessened now).

I know im giving who ever reads it a lot of information but 

thats only because im wondering if all of this is normal 

and part of a phase and im over reacting, because i 

honestly dont know what to do. In pakistan there is no such 

thing as a suicide helpline or any person i can discuss 

this with. so before i plan to do something soon i want a 

second opinion.

when i reached grade middle school things changed for some 

reason, i got bullied at first but then when it stopped 

everything seemed fine. I was a high achiever till grade 9, 

athletic(i used to win races) and popular meaning that i 

had a group of good friends. then around the end of grade 

9, in sheer coincidence all of my friends somehow ended up 

leaving the school,and got transferred to different 

countries or different schools. i made a big fuss at home 

made my parents change my school to a new one (i didnt have 

any existing friends there). around this time (grade 10) i 

went from a* to cs and d's and now in my last year of high 

school, grade 12, im pretty sure ive flunked my a levels  lowed me to enter some university (and 

now im bidding time till the results come and my parents 

find out). for some reason i lost interest in  leading 

crowds and having a group of friends. im now a staright u 

grader and have gained weight so fast that ive got stretch 

marks on my body. my parents are sick and tired of me and 

have told me so, and i honestly feel like im in a pit that 

i cant get out of, and the odd thing is i dont know why. 

around two years ago at night i often feel like i cant 

breathe, like air is entering me but i cant feel it and am 

left gasping i think its due to worry or something. it 

feels like i have this big noose around my neck and the 

only way i can get rid of it is by dieing. im not sure if 

anyone is ever going to read this but if someone does 

please anwser me, i swear its not a joke or not inspired by 

any book or tv (for the record i didnt like or find 13 

reasons why entertaining). i just need to know what to do, 

im constantly tired these days. thank you",26Jun2017,4

152,"Hi everyone, I'm kinda stuck and not sure what to do. Here's the backstory:

Went drinking last Saturday night with some friends, included this engaged couple. We've all been friends for a couple of years now and she's always been flirty, with everyone as far as I can tell. 

A couple of months back, she told me that she got in trouble with him for being to flirty with me. I've tried to keep myself in check around her since then because they are good friends and I don't want to screw anything up for them or our friendship. 

On that Saturday we drank a lot! The bar we were at was basically giving us straight up booze instead of mixed drinks. We left around 1am and Ubered back to the place we were staying. It was just me and the engaged couple in one car while the rest of the group was in a different car. On the way, he passed out and my memory kinda fades in and out. One of the things I remember though is that while he was passed out, she turned and kissed me. My drunk ass kissed her back briefly, but then I stopped once I realized what was happening. 

Anyway, in the morning when we were all waking up and recounting the night, she confessed that she doesn't remember anything about the end of the night, including the ride back to the hotel. I tried to press her about it later in the day while he wasn't around, but she still said she doesn't remember. 

Like I said, I really don't want to screw anything up, but I kinda feel like she has the right to know what happened. At the same time, if I kept it a secret and she truly doesn't remember, then no one else would know except for me. 

Anyone been in a similar position or have any thoughts? I'm really torn and it's been bugging me ever since. Thanks!",26Jun2017,1
154,"Hello there. I have this issue that's killing me. Everytime I start getting attached to someone, whether it's friendly or romantic, I get so scared. I just am scared that they might have been fake the whole time even if I felt that they weren't, I'm so scared that they'll let me down, or that I won't meet up to their expectations, or simply... I'm scared to disappoint them, and to make them leave. 
I've had abandonment issues in the past. My dad was often absent because of his job, but seven years ago, he left my mother and kept going back on-and-off, without even wanting to take me with him. I also had issues with friends, who were pretending to be my friends, until I was in the shit. I once had a friend who wouldn't stand up for me when two other people bullied me. She was just laughing along with them, because they were her friends too. I never forgot this... and typing about it makes my throat seize up.
 
Recently I met two guys on Twitter. One fo them is a nice one, he was my first follower and he's someone I like a lot (not in the romantic sense though, I'm not attracted to guys, or if I am, not sexually), but... now that I want to go further and get to know him to truly consider him as a friend, I get scared as hell. I'm scared I won't be good enough for him. He's from another country, and I'm scared I'll make a cultural smash, or do something that will upset him or offend him unintentionally. I'm usually very polite with other people, but it can come so quickly and unexpectedly...
And for the other one, he's younger (probably, I don't know the age of the nice one), and at first he appeared quite friendly. I liked him too, but wasn't feeling as attached because something felt wrong at the very beginning. He was drawing things I didn't much approve, but I decided to encourage him anyway to continue, because people should do what they want regardless of the others' beliefs. It wasn't aligned with my way of thinking, but I let it slide off and tried to appreciate him for his personality. Then out of the blue he started ignoring me. I felt deeply hurt, and now to me he's just a big asshole. But... I think it might have amplified my anxiety issues.

She grabbed my wrist and made an example of me in front of another coworker and it really put me on the spot.

161,"[I posted this on r/dreams but If anyone here can decipher this then I'd be grateful]

I can't really remember the entirety of it since it was all mixed up but one part in particular stood out to me; my SO and I were sharing a moment of intimacy (I guess in the back of a car) and things were going well, but I noticed she was slowly crawling into the passenger seat while sucking another guy off. I tried to pull her head back but she kept telling me no and wouldn't move her head, and eventually she completely left me behind in the back seat while she was up in the front of the car with this other character engaged in a conversation and occasionally sharing intimate kisses. When I tried to get her attention to ask her what the fuck she was doing she turned to me and said ""nothing, you're going to believe what I say anyway so calm down"" and just kept kissing the guy like I wasn't even there. 

In reality my SO isn't that slimy; she's genuinely an amazing person and cheating isn't even something she could commit to enough to pull some shit like this. If anything (as unhealthy as it sounds) she's more afraid of me leaving or cheating on her. But this dream really affected me in ways I can't even begin to describe, so much so that it woke me up out of my sleep. Maybe it's just my insecurities getting in the way? ",26Jun2017,2

I hate and fear humans because I know the capacity for evil they possess. I hear about tortures and serial killings carried it by average seeming folk on the street, and I feel sick. I feel sick knowing there are humans that can horrifically kill each other out of boredom, and, they say it's not everyone, but it is, give people orders and they'll do awful things and justify it to themselves. How can I feel anything but hate and fear for a species perfectly evolved to be the most awful monsters the earth has ever churned out?

169,"Hello dear friends!

&amp;nbsp;

I found myself in a very tough spot. My last relationship of one year ended several months ago (7+), a bit badly if I may say so, and I've sure done my grieving.

Now, there is this friend of mine, who I have never been extremely close with but we kinda clicked from day one - have a lot in common, similar points of view regarding life, whenever we spent time together there were rarely those horrible awkward silences, we supported each other through tough times.. Generally, two kind people who ran into each other by chance. 

So a month ago he sent me a message asking if I'd like to go out with him for a walk. He told me that he too broke up with his girlfriend out of blue and that it really messed him up - that he is not sure he could ever open up and actually love someone. 

What he proposed is that we just become closer friends and if something happens - awesome - and if not - oh well. No strings attached pretty much. I guess the proper term here would be 'friends with benefits'.

I was curious to see where it would go so I agreed and I must say - I really love spending time with him. Quite sure he treats me better than any of my ex-boyfriends. It's a lot of fun and I actually find myself happy again.

&amp;nbsp;

Which leads to the problem - I've got attached to him. I guess he noticed and told me something along the lines of 'I can't promise you anything, I can't promise I can return those feelings. I don't know who I will like, or if anyone ever.'

Which got me thinking - this could end with him saying 'you were just a temporary thing - I like that other person now, so bye bye'. And that would break me. 

&amp;nbsp;

So my question is, should I get as distant as possible, try to suppress my feelings and hope they will go away or should I just risk it? I'd hate to lose him, even as a friend, so that's making my decision horribly difficult.

Sorry for the long post. And thank you all so much in advance!",26Jun2017,3

176,"Hey everybody,

[WALL OF TEXT AHEAD]
[TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM]

I come from a very very VERY religious family. My parents have been [Seventh Day Adventists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church) their whole life and basicly every member of my family (with a few exceptions) is too.

I have found myself not agreeing with their beliefs over the years. I could say I consider myself a [Deist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism) and I'm really tired of following their set of religious rules anymore. 

Ever since I was a child I was never allowed to eat certain kinds of meat (pork in special), I could not watch The Simpsons, Harry Potter, LotR ... basicly anything that could contain social commentary or the least amount of magic. I could not watch anime because it was ""Devilish"" blahblahblah, you already know the story.

The thing is, I recently told my parents how I feel about their religion and how I'd like to follow my own set of rules, grow as a person individually and be able to mature as a human being. I told them I would like to stop following their religion. I am no old man [19m] but I think I can still make a decision or two.

After telling them this, my mom started crying and telling me that I must follow her rules as long as I live under her roof. So the basic solution to this dispute was to move out. When I told her I planned on moving out so I could live by my own set of rules she seemed absolutely demolished. I understand it is hard for a very religious parent to see their child not follow their same religion but I truly do not understand why she would still want to stuff her ideals down my throat after explaining to her the way I thought and viewed things.

3 weeks have already passed since that day and from that day to today I can count with one hand the amount of conversations longer than 5 words that we've had. She can't stay in the same room I am without starting to cry and she's constantly weeping. Now, *I don't want to you think I'm complaining*, I'm actually pretty concerned for her. Both my parents have stopped going to church as a result of me not going anymore and they've basicly terminated any relationship they previously had with any person from the religious community they were part of until recently. When I asked them why they did this they said it was to *""avoid the questions their friends could ask""* and because they perceive they've ""**failed as parents**"".

I really don't know what to do. On one hand I understand their feelings about this, even though they're a bit exaggerated... but, on the other hand I am not willing to give up *who I am* and most importantly *WHAT I BELIEVE IN* because they're not able to accept that my point of view might be different from theirs. 

[**TL;DR: I told my parents how I felt about their religion and how I didn't want to follow it anymore and they aren't able to accept my decision. Mom is showing some serious depression-like symptoms**]

They're really shitty too like we could have no food and as soon as they get paid they just go to the casino and lose all their money and then we just eat the same meal for 3 days straight which is actually an upgrade from nothing so there's that.

I also have a cat so leaving is 800x harder and he's my ptsd cat and my mom would probably get rid of him just because she hates me so much and ANYTHING that makes me happy she destroys I don't know why. I just want to go far far away to Atlanta or something and I at least never want to talk to my mom again I'm not sure about my dad. ",26Jun2017,1
181,"I have recently graduated with a 2.2 in Biomedical Sciences from a redbrick university. I signed a contract to stay in my university's city a few months ago as I intended to do a Masters course at the university. Unfortunately I did not meet the entry requirements and believe I am now stuck in the contract.

Furthermore, I have considered several options and I believe that staying in the city will help me find an internship and/or provide me with independence from my family. I will also be able to gain work experience and continually search for jobs. I find it easier to search for jobs etc in this city as opposed to back home because I feel as if I have more connections here.

However I am getting pressured to move back to my home city by my little brother, and live with my parents again. The environment in my home is rather toxic and I do not get anything done. Nobody likes to give me a lift outside of their daily routine, and I am not ""allowed"" to walk anymore alone because it is ""dangerous"". I have found part time work with two catering companies, and believe this should suffice in terms of making a living while I move onto a graduate job or even an internship.

However, all of these pressures from back home and the uncertainty of the future is taking its toll on me, and I have broken down several times due to the emotional guilt I feel from my brother. My family is dysfunctional and he claims that when I move back home it calms everything down. If you could give me any advice on this situation it would be great, as I am currently at a loss.

tl;dr Did not meet masters criteria at my university, currently considering internships, signed housing contract but part of my family is pressuring me to return home (dysfunctional family) while other parts encourage me to stay. Not sure as to what to do, much emotional guilt and upset, affecting my mental health.

I would really like finding more sites like this, so I have resources to use so I can draw more often! I don't care if it's just sites for random anime/manga, whether all the characters are male or female, just need some good reference pictures really.

190,"Hello everyone. I'm going to try to be short since I know reading on computers can be tiresome. Anyway, I'm a 25 years old guy living in Venezuela. Right now I'm living with my grandmother and she's been depressed since a few years ago. I came to live with her since I had a job opportunity here some years ago. Fast forward I quit the job and began working remotely as a programmer for a US company, they pay me 500 dollars per month as a programmer which may not seem like too much but in Venezuela is quite a lot of money, specially considering that the minimum wage is around 30 dollars per month. 

While my grandmother is depressed, she's going to be seventy years old tomorrow, their sons haven't really taken care of here, except my mom, but she's living outside the city and it's difficult to us to reunite due to the current protests and economic situation. My maternal uncle is almost absent from her life and only calls her like one or two times per month. I don't really know how is this like in American culture but in the Venezuelan culture families tend to be very united and thus calling someone two or three times per month is not enough.

My grandmother can be very controlling to me, in matters regarding how I go outside, what I eat, if I cook or not (Most of the times, she cooks, but I really don't like how she cooks now, I remember when she wasn't depressed she would cook tasteful food but now it's like she boils meat and then serves it, and it is tasteless when you try to eat it). I remember many times how she checked how much money I had and other personal information.

Recently I was diagnosed with epilepsy and I'm presenting symptons of depression as well. I'm with a psychologist in the process of being checked for a possible asperger diagnosis. I have some sensibility to sounds and I can lose concentration when things like a radio with loud music and television are turned on while I'm working. I have to take note of everything in order to stay concentrated and it's very difficult to do so, specially if a small seizure comes. 

Anyways, I want to move, but my grandmother is very emotionally dependent on me and protests are ravaging the city so I don't know what I should do. I might have omitted information for brevity, but if you have any question, let me know.",26Jun2017,1

195,"Looking for a bit of advice as to how to handle the following situation:
My brother moved across country to try and better his life. I offered to let him stay with me for a year max, but was under the impression he would be trying to get his own place sooner. He has been with us for 4 months now and my wife complains about him daily. We offered him the garage which is a huge space for what he pays ($500 a month) in California. Today he complained to my wife that is was too hot (we gave him 3 fans) in the garage and that he was going to sleep in the spare room which we use as an office. He has lost the key to the house, doesn't do his dishes, broke the stove, and is overall a messy person. I feel we have been more than accommodating. Would you kick him out? If so, how would you approach the discussion?

Thanks in advance.

I have cleaned the apartment thoroughly and will be leaving the place in arguably better condition than I found it.

I marked the floor in doing so and the scratches, though faint, are noticeable.

I do not believe the landlord will attempt to fix or replace the floor considering it's condition was already sub-par prior to my tenancy and the damage i have done isn't as bad as some of the other marks already on the floor.

199,"So I am a college student, and I have been fortunate enough to have obtained scholarships to be able to pay most of my tuition. However I am coming with a problem next academic year. Freshmen year I was able to make it through with about $9000 in debt. Sophomore year I made it through without any, but now Junior year comes and I have the chance to either live at home (45 min away from campus) or get a couple loans and live on campus. The thing is I am a student athlete, so I have daily 6 am practice, I am involved in multiple organizations that have weekly meetings usually at late times, and my old car has a 50 50 chance of working so It would be hard to make all of my commitments.  A lot of the organizations I am part of are the ones that give me scholarships to pay for school. On the other hand, living on campus would leave me with another loan of approximately $10,000. Is it better to live at home and save myself that loan or would it be worth getting the loan? Is $19,000 a lot of money to owe for undergraduate tuition? I need to make a decision relatively soon or otherwise I will loose my housing deposit. (being a college student any money I can save is good money)",26Jun2017,1
201,"As a child, I loved all things scientific; airplanes, weather, archeology, space, etc. I can even recall contemplating a perpetual motion fountain, and windmill, with impossible physics. However, I wasn't a prodigy, so most of my fascination consisted of watching pictures and reading superficial scientific books for kids. I even remember my first-grade teacher making fun of me because I was one of the slowest at arithmetic; so at 7 years old, my mathematical anxiety for mental arithmetic began. 

That year I passed below average, but until I was 12, my all-around grades improved. I began to love studying. Contrarily to my first-grade teacher, my sixth-grade teacher told me I should study Latin. Latin was considered one of the hardest middle school paths, reserved for the philomaths; the nerds. I can not recall why I did not walk that path then and there, but I'm quite confident that the choice was made for me; for the reason being: too hard. Which might have been accurate then. 

Junior high indeed proved to be difficult. As I said, I am not a prodigy, so I had to learn a lot. That wasn't a problem though, since I still loved getting up at 6 AM to study biology for example, which I mostly passed narrowly. Also, math and other subjects consisted of mere rote learning, not understanding. I can even remember studying for my first history test. It consisted of one page we had to learn back and forth. I took that literally and tried to memorize it back and forth. I think I scored a 9/15, after studying a whole day. My friend, read it for an hour, while voice chatting with me, and scored a 14. I was thirteen at the time. My mediocre grades would have bothered me a few years before, but I was more and more being drawn into games and pubescent hormones. 

For high school I was advised to step down the ladder once more. I took the more technical route instead of the academic one. My grades skyrocketed and I even was the best of class once. Everything was much easier suddenly. I remember going to my math teacher, asking if it was possible to step up the ladder again because the math was too easy. Nothing came of it, and I became more and more lazy, spending an increasing amount of time gaming. 

Starting from the middle of freshman year I was bullied for the next year and a half, which strengthened my MMORPGs avatars even further. Throughout high school there were only a couple of classes I liked: natural sciences, math, P.E, English and geography. Other classes were thing like bookkeeping, finance, French, etc. The latter ones made me despise school altogether. My head was into first person shooters and MMORPGs instead. Which I don't regret by the way, I experienced wonderful times playing those. Around age seventeen I came into contact with my first beer. This helped me fix my left over paranoia from being bullied. I could talk to girls again, and I grew my personality in ways I otherwise wouldn't have. But by this time, I had totally forgotten any notion of science. At the age of eighteen, I had no idea what to pick for higher education. The only guidance we got was the task of writing down a top 3 list of thing you want to do. I think my list consisted of: P.E. teacher, the army, and something else.

Since there was no job certainty as a P.E., I settled for A1 nursing school. I liked anatomy, and my mother was a nurse also at the time. Go figure, I thought it would be a good fit. Initially my mother said I couldn't handle A1, which is more theoretical compared to A2, the course my mother followed. This choice was one of the first ones I made for myself, opposing the advice of adults. This sounds stupid, but up until the age of 21 I though adults were always correct and much wiser than kids. I couldn't have been more wrong.

To the surprise of my mother, I passed the first year of nursery just fine. In hindsight I know my study method was horrid. It wasn't even a method, but merely reading things over and over again. Anyway, good grades were fun, but I totally hated the internships, which means I hated the job. School said: ‚ÄúJust stick with it, it will get better next year. Then you can work at an emergency room or surgery in the third year.‚Äù So I stuck with it, to no avail. I thoroughly hated getting up in the morning, and kept counting down the time. I dropped out in the second year. Hastily I did some odd jobs, hated those even more, so I enrolled back in on the grounds of nursery beating the alternatives. In the third year I started to drink more and more at parties, sometimes even arrived hung over in class or internships after 3 hours of sleep. One time I even forgot what I ate for lunch when a colleague asked what I ate an hour before. It was a downward spiral, and ended up being depressed during the last three months of the total three years nursing school. I even passed my thesis, but dropped out after I had a breakdown while receiving a horribly negative review of my last internship. Tears starting poring and admitted I wanted the train to derail each morning when going to work. I fucking hated everything. The only good memories I can recall of those days were when I watched Scrubs. I admired doctors a lot, but why oh why couldn't I be one.

Again, hastily I had to choose something. A job, or study. I loved games and I once had aspirations to be a programmer. So I chose game development. The first year was one of the best years in my life. I learned to draw, I learned programming, I learned math, I learned 3D modeling, I learned that criticism is a good thing and all first creations suck, but most importantly I met my first girlfriend with which I basically lived together for 5 months in her small room. Life was awesome. A lot of hard work and sleepless nights, a lot of love, and an occasional party. Sadly, she had to go back to her country as she was an erasmus student, and we chose to part ways. She told me to study in her country, I contemplated, but I was too immature back then, so I didn't do it. 

The second year of game development I chose the programming major. I soon came to realize my own ineptitude and holes in math. On top of that, my laptop crashed and couldn't follow anything anymore. This was also a time I believed in a fixed mindset. Basically the idea that if I'm not able to understand something quickly, I'm too stupid and I will never understand. Not long after that I dropped out of the programming classes and aced the level design and 3D modeling classes instead. The following year I switched majors to game graphics. More modeling and drawing, no programming. By this time I was 24. I started to miss my friends, and began to drink more with them. That year I sporadically enrolled a certified lifeguard course and firefighter school in my spare time. I quit game development and successfully passed the latter courses. I loved it because these were two decisions I made out of my own volition without any pressure. I gained a lot of confidence doing that. I was used to hearing my mother say I couldn't handle this or that, so by doing this I proved to myself I could do the things I want to do.

I worked as a lifeguard for 1.5 years and saved up a decent amount of money. I quit drinking for the same amount of time. During these years I was introduced to science again through Tesla and SpaceX. I also rediscovered reading after approximately 10 years. I learned about Khan Academy and the growth mindset; the notion that you can change your brain. A big discovery was realizing how detrimental my study methods were. Nearly everything I did was scientifically proven to be useless. (e.g. re-reading and extensively using markers). Anyway, I decided to enroll in three courses in university to get a feel for its difficulty. I took linear algebra, statistics and philosophy. I failed the first two and nicely passed philosophy. I learned that I had many holes in my mathematical toolbox. Everything I previously knew of math was pure memorization, not understanding. So I bought math textbooks and started to re-learn from the ground up. During this time up until now I did not work or go to school. It has been like a sabbatical for 1 year to learn stuff. I'm also attending voluntary philosophy caf√©s, scientific lectures, co-founded a small non-profit, took up photography and chess. Generally, I'm trying to improve every day. Besides math I also got into web development, and discovered cryptocurrency. The latter is my theoretical source of income, which will hopefully allow me to move out of my parents house in a year or two. I understand many will find it pathetic that I still live with my parents, but I refuse to pay a mortgage while doing a job I hate. 

I also realize I'm spoiled. If my parents didn't let me stay at their place, I wouldn't be able to do all of this. But to be brutally honest, I don't really care because I mostly despise them, especially my mother, for never supporting me and always instilling self-doubt. It's not their fault because that's how they were raised, still. 

I'm getting to the end of my overly long rant. Bit by bit I'm resuscitating my old fascination for science and technology. Ironically or moronically, because I'm confident I can do the things I put my mind to, I'm unsure whether to get into a STEM-field in university or to further self-study web development on my own, and finish a project‚Äîin other words, be my own boss. Over the years I've come to realize I love creating things, and have lot's of difficulty working for someone else. There‚Äôs just so many awesome things to do, and so many unsolved problems in this world; it‚Äôs hard to choose with so many ideas in my mind. My gut tells me I should go to university because I need to level up my problem solving skills, which will help me with everything I do in life. On the other hand I want to finish my project, which could end up possibly, but unlikely, profitable, while polishing my programming skills.

203,"Hello,

I am very new in the USA and temporary. I am doing an internship in an international German company in the USA (I am not German or American) and rented a room from an employee of the company. We have no work relation though, I don't even see him in the company, we have different departments.

I paid a deposit, which is the same amount of one month rent and I am paying my monthly rent in cash at the beginning of each month. 

My landlord neither gave me a contract/lease for the rental nor a paper stating that he has the deposit. I am aware of my mistake here, not insisting on a written agreement but I was shy to do it and had a kind of unnecessary trust since he is an employee (at manager level) in the same company that I am interning.

I rented the room initially for 10 months which we both agreed verbally. However, living in the house started to became unbearable. I wrote some main interaction between me and the landlords to explain the atmosphere.

The house I am living in is a family with 2 teenage kids. I am the first tenant since 15 years but they said that they had tenants, before they had kids. 


The family needs to pass through my room to use the laundry. Before I move in, they had said that they will only do the laundry when I am not at home. But it turned out that whenever they forget/need something from the laundry room, they shout downstairs to ask for permission to come down because they need something from downstairs. Moreover, they feel that they do not need to ask for my permission if I am not in my room but in the kitchen for example. I warned them once, saying that even if I am not in the room but in the kitchen, the room may not be available for them to go. They got uncomfortable from this, as if I might be hiding something from them. I had to find a reason to explain like my underwear could be around or something. 


They are also disrespectful to my privacy, calling me from upstairs by shouting my name anytime they want. I told them that this is not acceptable and disrespectful. Respect should be both ways, if there is an issue, you can text me or tell me when they see me in the common are but calling me by shouting me from upstairs, without knowing if I am sleeping, resting or on a phone call is inappropriate. The wife replied that this is her house and she can call me whenever.


Another issue is kitchen use. They had already told me that they do not want me to cook after 9 pm. However, they recently started complaining about me being in the kitchen at night even if I am not cooking but eating a sandwich, which I brought with me from outside (I have to add here that I am also not allowed to eat or drink anything in my room). They say that they have to wake up early and they can hear even the slightest sound in the kitchen, which disturbs their sleep. 


When I realized that this is not an ideal housing option for me, I asked how long in advance I should inform if I want to move out. The reply was that in case I don't stay 10 months, they wont give me my deposit back. Alternatively, I can find somebody else to stay but this person should also be an intern in the company for family to trust the new tenant and also they should approve the person. Considering the number of interns in the company and length of their internship, this is almost impossible.


I know, in legal perspective, I do not have much advantage, especially without having a lease (but I have an initial email stating the conditions of the rent and some text messages the content of which proves that I am living in the house) but I still would like to ask for advice if I can do anything about the situation.


Thanks everybody in advance!",26Jun2017,1

210,"So I have a situation in my family and I am not sure how exactly to handle it.
I have a family member who is not the easiest person to get along with and is hard to communicate to. I was at a BBQ last month at this family members house, I found out at the event that there was another family gathering the next day. I had not been included in that event and got upset upon overhearing the difficult family member say ""Oh I am so excited about the family dinner tomorrow""
Upon hearing this I became visibly upset and was pulled aside by the girlfriend of one of my other family members. This girlfriend is a nice person but has had many disputes with the difficult person in question. I have previously joked around with the girlfriend and poked fun about the difficult family member.
Me and the girlfriend took a walk down the block and I heard from the girlfriend some gossip about myself that the difficult family member was saying. Upon hearing this coupled with the event earlier, I became upset and started to cry. After becoming this upset I then told the girlfriend that the other family member hated her too and thought she was trashy. The girlfriend was not shocked to hear this because the difficult family member has always been standoffish and has actually called her trashy many years ago. It was no surprise. I also told the girlfriend that I really disliked this family member and that I thought said family member was narcissistic and a poor mother in general to her children. I said all of this out of hurt and anger because I felt ostrazied and left out. Also the gossip I heard was hurtful to me and caused me to say things out of emotion and basically throw the difficult family member under the bus.
A month later, I receive a call from said family member informing me that she knows about my conversation with the girlfriend. The male family member who is dating the girlfriend also found out about the comments and is angry at all of us for saying anything. I am kind of falling into the role of scapegoat in this situation.
I explained to my difficult family member that I did say some things in anger because the girlfriend told me about other family gossip involving me. I told her I may have told the girlfriend that she thought she was trashy and basically disclosed all the gossip involving the girlfriend. I apologized and took accountability for the things I said in anger. The difficult family member told me it was now my job to call everyone and straighten out the drama I caused by my outburst at the BBQ.
How else should I be handling this. I left a message for the girlfriend explaining that when I had the conversation with her, I had just found out from her the nasty things being said about me. I also explained to her that the family does not feel this way about her and those comments were fueled in emotion and anger (even though the difficult family member has vocalized these feelings in front of the rest of the family.) Pretty much as it stands now, I look like the bad guy and I kind of am because I shot my mouth off and said confidential inner family gossip to get even after hearing the gossip about me. I am aware that this is extremely petty, immature and wrong in general. I will be taking this as a life lesson and will just keep my mouth shut moving forward.
How else should I handle this situation? I am worried the girlfriend may disclose my comments about the difficult family member being a poor mother and about her children being rude. This would probably cause a huge uproar considering you should never make parenting comments about others in your family. I also called her some choice words as well.

226,"**TLDR:  Shitty former co-worker got hired in at my new company and got into the department I wanted (which pays better) because I'm so ""awesome"" in my current department they didn't want to let me go.**

&amp;nbsp;

Some backstory... for 3+ years I worked at randomcompany in the interesting department. There were only 5 people in the interesting department and on the day shift with me was just me and my direct supervisor (we'll call him Carl). 2 additional people in the evening shift and 1 guy, we'll call Kevin on the overnight shift. For 1.5 years I came in to all the work Kevin didn't do, the many hours old customer tickets, the tasks that need to be done every 30 minutes ignored for 5 hours (imagine the restroom had to be checked every 30 minutes to make sure there's paper and it's clean - when it's not done for 5 hours it adds a lot of extra work to your shift). I eventually got sick of hearing my supervisor tell me he would ""talk to"" Kevin about why he didn't do his job and just stopped saying anything about it. Then about 11 months ago our company was bought out and we were all laid off because we were redundant.

&amp;nbsp;

I found a new job 8 months ago after being recommended by former co-workers and found a number of my kick ass former randomcompany people working there. I like the job, love the people and the pay is less than I was making but it's better than working somewhere I don't like. My new boss (we'll call him Terry) has said how grateful he is to have me, what a good job I'm doing etc and I can see the metrics, I know I'm doing well. Terry has on occasion asked me about people who applied from my old company and if I knew them etc. One day he asked me about Kevin who had applied. I resisted the urge to shit-talk Kevin and simply said that he was certainly smart and capable but that I hadn't been impressed with his work ethic. Kevin didn't get an interview.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to 3 months ago, Terry asks if I am in contact with Carl as he needs someone with his skill set. I put him in touch with Carl and Carl and Terry hit it off and Carl was hired in and has been kicking ass. Carl wants to ""get the old team together"" and wants me to move from my current job in general department to the new interesting department here at the new company. For 3 months I have been exited at this prospect and the $2-3/hour pay increase and doing interesting work again.

&amp;nbsp;

Carl has mentioned wanting to hire in Kevin because Kevin had a real hard time since the layoff. I later heard that Kevin got an interview but apparently did so poorly that Terry said no. Carl went to bat and finally wore Jerry down, assuming personal responsibility for Kevin and Kevin arrived for training today.

&amp;nbsp;

When he is finished with training Kevin will go directly to the interesting department (the one I've been supposedly ""groomed"" for over the last 3 months) and will likely be starting at that higher rate of pay. Carl keeps saying he's trying to get them to let me transfer to the interesting department but I'm just so ""awesome"" or ""valuable"" that they don't want to lose me.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm pissed, frustrated and not sure what to do about it. I won't go on a rant to a co-worker or on any public forum, obviously I'm posting this with a throwaway account. Looking for advice.

&amp;nbsp;

Do I talk to Terry? to Carl?  To be honest it's made me think of looking for another job, but dammit I LIKE this place and I don't feel like I'm being deliberately misled or yanked around but having that lazy motherfucker Kevin get the job I've been wanting (and more $$ than me) because I'm doing such a great job seems like a kick in the teeth.

227,"I need ideas....my husband and I moved from California to Oklahoma. All of our family, his side and mine are still in California. Last year I got pregnant even though i was told I could never have children. We now have a healthy 7 month old. Being that she was not planned, we were not financially able to afford a babysitter so we thought our best option was for me to stay home with her until she was a little older. He has a daughter from a previous marriage that he has been unable to see since she was a month old when his ex left him while he was deployed in Korea. She lives in Illinois. His ex's  parents also live in Illinois. He was still in contact with them because of how awful their daughter is. He looked at them like family. We even went to visit them a few times. Well, they offered to pay for a lawyer to help him get visitation for His daughter. And then our financial situation worsened and they offered to move us to Illinois with them because they are both retired and have a large house that would accommodate all of us comfortably. So we moved thinking it was a good decision and they were being so kind. They said that i shouldnt go back to work until the baby is done breast feeding.  We've been here since March and it has become unbearable. The wife is hypocritical, judgemental and rude. She is always shooting down my husband when he has any plans of making our lives better and calls him ignorant. We have tried to keep quiet because what they've done for us but now they are refusing to pay for the lawyer that is already working on his case,  she goes into our bedroom when we aren't home and the stories she has told me make me not want to have my children around her. 

My mother offered to move us back to California to be with the ones who truly care about us. 

My question is how do I tell them we are moving? I have a feeling that once I tell them she will throw in our face what they've done and how much money they've spent on us, but we never asked, they always offered. Had I known how she really was I would have never accepted any of it. 

So I've been trying to find something to tell them so they don't freak out and make  my life hell until we get packed and out of here.

228,"Hi. I'm Ryan. I have a question about one of my employees. We have a casual dress code in our office here. The men wear business casual clothing such as khaki pants, polo shirts, etc. and the women wear casual tops, slacks, and skirts. The usual. I've been a manager for 6 years and this is the first time I've run into this situation I'm about to describe: 

We just recently hired a male employee by the name of Nathan. Nathan's private life is none of my business nor any of his coworkers' neither. Just like every employee, leave your private life at home right? Anyway, Nathan is somewhat effeminate for a male. He wears his hair long like a female and talks in a higher feminine sounding voice. Some employees have even mistaken Nathan for a female. Just recently, Nathan was talking to Sarah, a woman in our department, and I overheard him comment on how much he liked her suit she was wearing. It was a gray skirt suit. It resembled the one in this link:

I also heard him ask her where she got it.
Our dress code doesn't say skirts aren't allowed for women in the office, they just need to be appropriate length. No brainer right?
Anyway, when he was talking to Sarah, that was about 2 weeks ago. Friday, Nathan had the day off, so I found it odd when he showed up in my office. My office is located in a spot where you don't have to walk through the rest of the building to get to it. Anyway, he showed up wearing the same suit Sarah did...skirt included! He didn't appear offensive to me in any way, but I am worried he may offend someone else in the office. It does follow dress code so technically, he's not breaking rules! The purpose for the visit was to ask if I would ok the suit, so he could wear it in front of everyone in the office. I told him I'd get back to him about it asap, but I don't know what to do. Should I allow him to? How would you handle this?",26Jun2017,2

232,"Dear Reddit,

Corporate says I have about 13 days of paid time off, however I work for a small organization where me taking off 7 days is a near impossibility. 

My typical work schedule is as follows:

I work 9 to 4:30 Monday through Friday and have most weekends off. Because I'm in a service industry, we also work most holidays or the day after in some cases.

The problem is, I never know how to take time off. As I said before, I work for a small organization in a large company, so although it may sound great for many people to take time off, it's much harder for me. 

I've found that taking time off work usually means I am leaving someone else with more work, or I'll have more work when I come back.

In addition, I like my job. I'll be the first to admit it's not the hardest job in the world, (or maybe I'm just getting better at it after 6 years? I dunno.) but I really don't mind being here most days. I'm also not one to get sick often, so I rarely use sick days.

234,"After reading a bunch of graphic memoirs (like Maus and Vietnamerica), and faced with my grandma's declining health, I've been thinking a lot about how I'd like to know her story and the stories of my other grandparents. I know they've all lived interesting lives, and I've heard bits and pieces of them from my mom, but in all honesty I feel like I'm missing out on so much. I'd like to ask them more about their lives, maybe just for my own knowledge or maybe to start writing it down, but I just don't know how to start. We're not a very talkative or open family, so it's hard for me to just jump in with a bunch of questions. I just don't know how to have conversations about people's lives. 

I guess what I want to know is:

1. How do I start these conversations?

2. Should I be doing this interview-style, or just casually when I visit?

3. What kinds of questions do I ask? (I feel like there's so much stuff that it's hard to come up with any good ones...for example, I want to know about my grandma's childhood and where she grew up. Is just saying ""hey grandma, what was your childhood like?"" too broad of a question? If someone asked me that, I wouldn't know how to respond).

A little background information about me. I am a 20 year old female living in an Arab country. This is my second year in art school and I love what I do. I come from a religious family and long story short I am not religious at all.
Alright so this all started two years ago when I started university. I met this amazing guy online and we have been together ever since. Our relationship is mostly online even through he visits here as often as he could. 
He is not muslim (and neither am I lmao) and my parents found out about us. I've had to endure with physical and emotional abuse from my father and threats to take me out of university. My parents don't know that I am not a Muslim and if they knew they'd throw me out of the house (I am not making an assumption, I know for a fact that this is true. Both my sister and I are not Muslim and when my sister once tried to tell my mother about it her response was that if she's not muslim she'll get disowned).
Anyway, my boyfriend has agreed to ""act"" muslim in front of my parents just so I don't lose them. That was two years ago when we were just getting serious. But now I'm not sure he wants to anymore bc of all the shit my parents have put us through. I don't want him to act a certain way to please my parents anyway; that's not how it should be. 
The thing is right now my father is willing to give him a chance. He wants to meet my boyfriend but he is under the impression that my boyfriend is Muslim. Not just that, but my dad wants to take him to a sheikh to prove he actually is Muslim.
I don't want my father to meet him. I know meeting my boyfriend will result in my father's disapproval and I will have to go through the abuse all over again.
I am just so emotionally tired of acting a certain way to please my parents and to have a roof over my head. Sometimes I want to scream and tell them how I really feel but I know that would only bring them hurt and it will result in my life being completely destroyed.

Like his radar detector (a really fancy one) was still there and he didn't think anything from the glove box was stolen either. 
Fast forward to today. A man knocks on his door, handing him the registration, proof of insurance and car repair receipts. This man tells my friend that he found these papers on the ground and was handing it back. My friend, sensing some creepy vibes, thanks the man and closes the door. He didn't think this guy looked shifty or anything, but was getting a bad feeling nonetheless. 
My friend then called the police and told them the situation. He also called the lease office of his apt complex asking them if anyone had asked for his address. They said that they weren't aware of such inquiries, but were going to ask other members working in the office these past couple of days to see if anyone had asked. 
Now it all comes down to this: should my friend be worried about getting his identity stolen? He is not the primary on the insurance, and the address on the registration and insurance is his parents' address. 
Also how did this man know where my friend lives? As stated above, his address is not listed on the papers. The ""creepy guy"" would first have to know this was my friends car by seeing him drive it, and then would have had to seen my friend go into his apartment. What is this guy trying to accomplish?

274,"I'm almost 26 and female and not at all where I want to be in life. I have suffered from anxiety and depression for pretty much my whole life, but lately it's getting pretty bad. I see a therapist every week and am on anti-depressants so I am controlling it, but I feel so stuck at a job I hate, living back at home,  stuck with a similar dating circle I've always had, so it's hard to meet new people. 

I have car payments and student loan payments, so making ends meet scares me, and of course the thought of moving somewhere by myself, but I'm wondering if I should take a chance and do that? I just feel so stuck and depressed all the time.",26Jun2017,1

277,So I was planning on moving out of home with my boyfriend an hour away until I just got offered this new job where I live. Should I take the job and work here for a few months then try and get a transfer when I move. Or should I decline the offer and look for another job when I move out? ,26Jun2017,1
278,"I recently came back from a short vacation where I got the chance to catch up with a cousin who I hadn't seen in 5 years. Growing up I always considered myself ""cooler"" than he was. I had more friends, had a girlfriend, and I felt he king of looked up to me in a way. Well in the time I hadn't seen him many things happened in my life and Ive accepted that I was in fact depressed. I began isolating myself and had little desire to socialize. I currently have just 1 friend and I don't do things people my age do.(19) My cousin on the other hand, has plenty of friends and is always going out and having fun. After the vacation Ive come back to the same old shit whereas he took off on a trip out of state with his friends. I know it sounds like I'm bitter towards him, but I'm honestly happy for him and we get along just like we always have but I cant help but compare the way our lives have turned out and when I do, I feel like Ive been left behind and I know I'm missing out on something.",26Jun2017,5

280,"I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. I'm currently between years in College - Just finished my freshman year. I should mention I'm a high functioning Aspie. Didn't learn until Junior year. Ridiculously intelligent, but I have horrible habits. I smoke almost constantly, at least daily. Insomnia. I'm also very harsh unintentionally. My mind is usually running ahead of me. It's rather stressful tbqh. All I've been doing this summer is Life guarding. Free time is reading theory, playing guitar, possibly drawing. Likely alone. 
This might get ranty. I will appreciate all responses. 

I was removed from Public School after 3rd grade because they had suggested I should be put on medication due to behavior. Loud, controlling, etc. Parents were medical and wouldn't have it.  I spent 4th, 5th, Middle school, and ALL of high school at a Half ""non-denominational"" Christian school. The rest of the building was a church. I was disliked by practically all of the faculty, and felt friction everywhere I went. I hated my professors and it effected my performance in every damn class, every damn year. The way the teachers judged you collectively was based off behavior in Bible Class, which, was required every year by every student to graduate. I would ask questions, they would get increasingly mad. I wouldn't stop asking because - see: Loud and Controlling.

I started as an excited, happy, curious kid, but came out disgruntled, confused, and tired. I wasn't ever super religious, so I lost it when I thought about it in like 6th grade. So, as I progressed year by year, my GPA dropped, and my mood trailed close behind. I had been suspended 4 times (all very tedious situations, not worth suspension), had 2 close friends in the class of 40ish. It was like going to Youth Group every day all day. Most of those kids were merely long term acquaintances. I began smoking the   w e e d s   in between sophomore and junior year, never to party or with other people usually. I just did it alone to deal with increasing stress from school.
Towards the end of Junior year the teachers had a vote whether or not to expel me, 8 of 11 teachers said they wanted me gone. (A teacher I was close with told me the day after.) My mother got involved and got me a meeting with the superintendent where I had to say some shit like, ""I will not adversely effect the faiths of the other students."" I only finished my last year there because I thought my parents knew best. 
I had became increasingly depressed into sophomore and junior year, climaxing when I attempted to OD halfway through senior year.
I graduated with a 2.8 and 12 years down the drain. If I could GO BACK TO START, I would have dropped after 8th, got my GED then hit community college. 

So here I am, Sliding off my only scholarship. No idea for a major. Parents had always said they would pay for my degree if I was doing well enough, but NOW its, ""We might be able to help you some. Possibly not at all."" My first semester wasn't great, but I finished strong. Considering I've had to teach myself how to properly study, not bad. I want to get a degree but I don't want to fuck with loans. Recently my mother has became more verbally abusive than normal, she's constantly bringing up arguments about minor things and mentioning me moving out. My almost full time job wouldn't support me if I moved out AND had school to pay for. So WHY in FUCK would you pay for a private education that re-educates within it's worldview and picks favorites, when you won't pay for the education that matters? A 4 year college degree would have been less then what they paid for in brainwashing. I'm realizing more and more every day how fucked I was. I don't know what move to make. 

Not sure what else to say. 
Advice me. 
Besides KYS... Don't worry, I'll use a gun next time;)

281,"I have a 7 year old who is extremely smart, but very behind socially in school and in counseling because of issues they're still trying to define - he was diagnosed with ADHD, but they've also tossed around autism spectrum and emotional disturbance as possibilities.

I know I'm not a good parent because I have very little energy, am emotionally drained or on edge most of the time, and work late so I don't see him much during the week. This means out house is very cluttered and mess y &amp; I don't get to spend much time with him. My husband refuses to set boundaries or interact much either, so his days now consist of mostly sitting in his bedroom watching Youtube videos or playing Minecraft, while his dad is in another locked bedroom on his own computer. I get home, cook, feed everyone, and then he goes to bed.

I try to do things on weekends, but we don't have much money and my husband thinks leaving the house is a waste because it burns gas or costs money. We don't have friends over and he can't either, because of the mess (but before our son was born and when the house was much neater my husband still didn't allow people over).

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD, but I can function at a fairly normal level, I'm just always tired and get short tempered easily (not violent, just either get snappy, raise my voice, or cry from frustration). It just seems like I don't have the energy to parent, and I see a lot of these bad parenting and CPS threads and am afraid I'm going down that path.

How do I fix any of this?",26Jun2017,1
