Hi guys, I have something that is really bothering me. Recently ( past two years ) I have had migraines and I couldn’t complete last year’s work and so I have to retake freshman year of high school. If I continue to senior year, I will graduate high school at 19. I feel this is too old to graduate and I could be doing more with my life. Should I continue to senior year, experience high school or should I try to speed up the process with online classes? Thanks if anyone responds, this is really bothering me. ",24Oct2017,1

9,"The decisions of life


I probably failed the test again (3x). I tried several times to get into this university course, but I'm still outside. I am agitated and nervous, I have reached an age when many would be having fun and are already in a course. It's difficult and I know it's all because of my incompetence. I no longer want to hear compliments from teachers (it hurts in my mind), for I have never been able to achieve what they say I am going to achieve. I feel I disappoint everyone around me because of me: if I had been less lazy I would have finished this two years ago. So, since I'm at this age, I've decided that I'll try harder, but I do not want anything from anyone, I do not want friends, I do not want compliments, absolutely nothing. All I want is to be able to choose me so I can choose the next one day. I want to give up this life of possible amusements and happiness. I want to devote the rest of my existence to study even if it brings me to loneliness. I will take responsibility for this decision. But how do I do this? I need to be better and to this i need to be cold. How?",24Oct2017,3
10,"This is long sorry

I went to an event and planned on meeting friends there. They ended up being an hour late and then left early leaving me there. I didn't have any fun with them so after they left I decided to drink more to try and enjoy myself. I was also angry with the fact they were late, didn't stay long and didn't offer me a ride. At this point I get pretty buzzed.

While I was in line grabbing a beer I run into a 2 cute girls and one gay guy. We ended up talking a bit and they paid for an uber for us. I also grabbed one girls number because I thought she was cute.

Us 4 ended up going to a restaurant and I recall having a good time. She was feeding me bites of her food at one point. At the very end the girls left. Leaving the gay guy and I at the table. He starts into a weird conversation with me. It was hard to hear and keep in mind I was drunk before I met them. He basically tells me that he thinks I'm straight but at least a little bit curious (I'm 100% straight). He goes on and on. I'm getting insulted at this point and am on the verge of walking away. I try to come to my senses and calm down. I try to ease tensions between him and I so that I don't blow it with the girl. I may have unintentionally insulted him while I was at it idk. Again I'm drunk, didn't know what was going on and didn't know how to handle it.

I pay and get the hell out of there. I texted the girl the next morning apologizing to her and to him if I insulted him, mentioned I had a good time with her and did add her on snapchat. She never responded but added me back on snapchat.

Can someone help me understand what the hell occurred? Did I get used or did I somehow blow this? I really am embarrassed that I got into an argument with him and now she won't tell me what the hell happened. I've tried reaching out to her multiple times but nothing. I've done all I can as far as apologizing but I really don't feel I did anything wrong. Any insight on this confusing situation will be helpful. Thanks everyone.",24Oct2017,1
11,"These past 7 months my parents have been jobless and living off of some sort of church program to pay bills/buy food and such. Clearly the money they recieved didn't just pay bills as on 3 occasions we were without internet, water, or power for a week.

The problem is that they were supposed to be actively looking for jobs during this time. This past month they were dropped from the program due to lack of progress (aka they aren't looking for a Job).

Now apparently it has been two weeks and my siblings tell me there hasn't been wifi (I understand wifi isn't a human right) and this is problematic since they are in middle/highschool and don't have access to data through a phone plan either. They fear that power or water or rent may wither up soon.

Here is the issue: there is no indicator that my parents care for the well being of the family and are making an active effort to get a job. My father has recieved 3 total job interviews over these past several months. And with no money in savings and low credit scores, my parents are getting by on the money of my family and myself.

17,"I'm a white Canadian male so I hate to belly ache about my personal shit as a literal genetic lottery winner but I feel stuck. 

I am a security guard turned property manager. A transformation that came with a substantial pay increase. Which is awesome. But being a security guard was generally very relaxed as I not very much was required of me aside from sitting in an office and waiting for bad things to happens which at my site were rare. So I would read and write and nap and watch movies. But as a property manager there is much required of me, expectedly. I've acclimated and am now quite good at my menial position. 

My problem in a nut shell is that I want to use my off time productively. I want to write, read, hit the gym, play my guitar, perform on stage, eat better, and just generally be a better person than I was the day before.
But the reality is generally me getting off work, walking my dog, and sitting in front of my TV, playing games or watching Netflix program after Netflix program. After this season I will start -insert personal conquest here-

I always find something to justify delaying the things I want to do.

However, this is the girl that my friend has been into since high school (think girl next door type). We are now juniors in college and clearly she has no interest in him, and sees her as a best friend type, however it seems that he still thinks he has a shot. I am not entirely sure how he still feels about this girl still, as we haven't talked about it in a long time. I am interested in asking her out and seeing where it could go, but I don't want to lose a friend over it. When I asked the girl if it would be weird because of how close she is with our friend, she said not to worry about it because he had his chance and it will never happen.

24,"I'm pretty new at talking to new people. I forget how most of me and my friends became cool but it definitely didn't start by me initiating some sort of conversation.

Anyway, there's this kid who I think is pretty cool. We have the same birthday, like the same sport, chill. He's extremely quiet though like I used to be. Never speaks unless spoken to, will comment randomly, laugh at the dumbest things, all things I either do or used to do. I don't know, I guess I kinda see my old self in him. 

But yeah, I see him by himself a lot of the times. He doesn't come off as weird to me so I'm guessing he's just antisocial. We were at a meeting today and while everyone was together, laughing it up etc. he was just in the back, by himself not talking for the entire time. He even looked kinda sad. I felt kinda bad and I thought about going over and speaking but it's like ..? What can I say? Lol

Everyone needs a friend or someone to talk to at the end of the day and he seems cool so how can I initiate a conversation so he won't be so alone? I don't wanna go about awkwardly cuz that's just not me. I can walk by him and say what's up but that doesn't really start a conversation etc.

27,"I got myself into a little bit of a scary situation. I'm just going to tell you a little bit about it and I would like to know if you could give me some advice on how to handle this. 

I'm currently 20 years old and I lost my job. I lost another job. I've had severe depression since I was in secondary school and recently it's been really debilitating in a way. I missed a lot of work and my contract was terminated which is understandable. I don't want to claim benefits or anything like that because I like work and I enjoy it and it helps me but recently it's been a very hard time for reasons I won't go into now. I've wanted to kill myself and I planned to kill myself. One night I was extremely drunk and sat on a train platform waiting till a stranger came by and talked me out of it.

I've been staying with my boyfriend's parents for a past few months and the problem is I have to move out in a couple of weeks because it's really tight in here as it is and there are small children living here so really I can't stay here any longer because it's unfair to the family and they been really kind to me anyway. (There is no violence or arguments involved, just letting you know.) 

I've had quite a problem finding work at the moment, I've been to interviews so fingers crossed I hear some good news but even if I start work now I won't have enough money for a deposit and upfront rent to move out when I'm supposed to in a few weeks. I highly doubt I'll be kicked out on the street but you never know. 

I don't have any family who could support me nor friends in this area as I moved here in the summer and haven't made any close friends I could stay with.

I have no friends, no family, no money, no home, no food and no job and stupid amounts of debt.

I'm extremely desperate for some advice and guidance on how not to end up homeless. The stress from this situation is fueling the mental illness and it's an awful cycle.

31,"Or maybe I never had any passion to begin with. Here's the short story... I'll keep the sentences simple and short:

Dad got diagnosed with cancer when I was 11 and I just started high school. High school was a nightmare, found it hard to interact and make friends. Didn't want them to find out and feel sorry for me, or to be that one kid with all the problems, plus I was pretty unpopular anyways. Stayed indoors all the time because of fear of not being around if my dad died, as well as the fact I had no friends and nowhere to want to go. I live in a shitty town with little to do.

Dad died before I turned 16. Oddly this was a massive weight off my shoulders. Went to college and studied computing for 2 years and a degree for 3 years. Graduated with a 1:1 BSc in Software Engineering, £30k student debt. Spent a few months just chilling, then got pressured into finding a job. Got a retail job that I had for less than a year and didn't really like.

Started talking to a girl online in Canada and entered a relationship. Things were amazing, I had something to aim for. I found a software job not too far away, got a decent wage, visited her last Christmas, everything went well, but started going downhill when she had to find another place to live and decided to live with her ex. We broke up almost 3 months ago while I was visiting her again, and it was depressing.

Mom is a massive narc and I can't stand living with her shit any more. I move out and move in with my brother, but I don't really have any purpose or goals. No idea what to do. This starts showing in my job and I got suspended (on full pay) last week due to low performance and misconduct (watching YouTube during work hours).

Thats vaguely it. I can expand on anything here upon request, if needed. I should also point out that for the last month I have been speaking to a girl who I really connect with. This isn't rebound, because I've completely washed my hands off my ex and moved on. The girl I'm talking to is amazing and we both know we like each other.

But I'm at this point now where I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I don't really know what to do. I leave things until the last minute because they're a massive effort for me to deal with. I have low energy. I used to enjoy my job but now I don't. There are many things that concern me about it that I've raised with my manager several times, which may also be contributing to my lack of performance. But I'm afraid that when I go for my hearing, they will decide to fire me, in which case I will have nothing.

I'm sick of my living arrangements, I'm tired of this dull town and I feel like I'm constantly under mental pressure. I'd love to just take a break and focus on me for a few months, I do have hobbies I want to work on such as writing a book and developing a video game, but money doesn't grow on trees. And I'm still bothered by the fact that I get bad anxiety whenever I think about finding a job in a potentially better place that requires a long commute; I'd love to move but I don't have the mental capacity or effort to function like someone my age should (I'm 23)

So what can I do about this? ",24Oct2017,3
32,"This is my second year living away at school and to just be as blunt as possible, I don't like it.

I'm part of a competitive, dedicated athletic team that practices 3x a week. In season, we have a game every Saturday, and out of season (second semester) we still play plenty of scrimmages against men's teams and other schools. We usually party each week and I'm pretty close to most of the team.

I have 2 close friends that I hang out with -- one is my roommate, though I'm starting to drift away from him, and the other is a good high school friend. Most of the time I hang out with one or the other on campus for lunch or studying, mostly because my apartment is a 20 minute walk away so it's a bit of a pain.

I'll usually finish my classes between 2 and 4 PM, go home, and study/work for a good chunk of my free time before bed. 
So basically, I'm involved with a club, on good terms with the members, working out regularly, seeing my friends, and I still hate it here.

Background: I'm very close with my family. I've never once looked forward to moving away from them, never had any problems with looking forward to 'getting away from parental control' or any of that. I go to school literally ten miles from my home, meaning that my drive to school is as long as my walk is from my apartment now.

I'm always homesick in a pretty bad way for the first week or two of school, but that always fades (duh). Problem is, even when that's gone I still miss my family like crazy.

I've found some way to see them almost every weekend this school year, but every time I'm back -- even the two week stretch I didn't see them for last month -- all this shit just comes crashing back.

I'm so close to just commuting the next year and a half after this, but:

Won't I just be postponing the sadness of moving away as an adult? I won't be surprised if I end up moving out of state, and I'm really dreading that. I can't imagine a life where I only see my mom or dad a few times a year, and I'm terrified of when that happens.

This one's weird, but I've never had a girlfriend, and I feel like entering the real world in that state would just screw me over. I feel like being intimately close to someone would help me with my feelings of loneliness, and fuck me I'm terrified of never finding love and being alone like this forever. I would be commuting 20 minutes (and maintaining my part in the sport I mentioned above) -- would that make it even harder to connect with someone, or even just make new friends?

I'm seriously lost here but this is literally all that's on my mind right now. It's like I'm completely lost...

34,"Hi, so I'm 20 years old female and have had mainly heterosexual relationships. I have been attracted to women, and one time a female friend and I had sex to experiment and I really enjoyed it. So I think I may be bisexual.

I'm not confident but I'm not shy either - I can easily talk to men, online and in bars etc. But women I find so intimidating. I'm not sure if it's because I find them all so beautiful or if I think I'm not good enough for them but whenever a woman speaks to me I freeze and go all anxious. I've tried Tinder and gay bars and while the odd woman does speak to me (I'm not ugly, but I am overweight) it doesn't ever go to anything because I'm so anxious.

36,"Ever since I reached the age of like 8 or 9 (I'm 19 now) where I started to think about what it would realistically be like for a young adult going out on their own and starting a life, I've always aspired to move far from my home town of Prior Lake, MN, which is a suburb of Minneapolis. I always sorta gawked at people that proudly always stayed close to home their entire lives. I always told people that I would move to a place that's at least 300 miles away. That goal of mine came true when I was accepted to a college in Council Bluffs, Iowa, which directly boarders Omaha, NE on it's west boarder which is also of course the IA-NE boarder. 

My school is 350 miles from my home town, so the distance seemed perfect. I've lived here since August 22nd, and I'm already really badly homesick. I never expected this. The worst part of it is that I've impulsively driven home certain weekends for really no reason but to see my friends and drive around on a nostalgia trip.

I initially thought that by going back, it would be a good coping mechanism for my homesickness, but what really happens is that the entire trip feels super rushed because I attempt to squeeze all this friend time into all hours of the days and nights of the weekend basically. I also don't tell my family I'm in town because they'd want me to come home and do a bunch of stuff with them, which would eat up about half of my weekend. What keeping my presence unknown does to me is it makes me feel like a ghost, or someone who doesn't belong. 

When I get back to college, the entire trip feels like it was just a dream since everything was so rushed. It sucks because all I want to do is go home, but I'm obligated to staying here since I already paid for both semesters at this school. ",24Oct2017,1

40,"*I want to preface this by saying, regardless of how it may sound like, I am talking about a friendship, not anything more

For the past five years, I've always felt a little bit of regret. Four years ago, I met this person. At the time, I was sad because all of my older friends had left my school. She used to be so funny and carefree and made me laugh. I don't know if we were friends exactly, because a lot of what happened back then was a blur. She pretended to dislike me in a joking kind of way, but we used to text each other after school and we hung out a couple of times. She was older than me (but in my class [mixed-grade class]) and everyone used to look up to her with admiration.

Anyways, I didn't see her for a couple of years after she left my school, but now, for the first time since then, we go to the same school. She's no longer friends with most of the people she used to be friends with. She's still in the highest possible classes, but she's also very popular now. And she ignores me, maybe because I'm a grade lower possibly, but I don't really know. I haven't tried to talk to her, but I'm so close to following her on Instagram and seeing if she follows me back or something. Some of my friends have classes with her. Even though she hadn't talked to them before, when I'm with them, she talks to them, but not to me. Also, maybe I'm just imagining this, but it seems like whenever I'm with my friends, she starts talking to them. I ask my friends afterward, and they say that she's never talked to them before.

It bothers me so much, because I so greatly miss what it felt like to hang out with her. She seems to have changed so much. I hate the way she looks at me now, with no trace of recognition. I miss the way her forehead used to crinkle when she laughed, and how unbearably funny she was. I don't see her very often, but when I do, my stomach takes a dive like when you almost fall because what I want to do and what I should do seem to have diverged.

Is being her friend no longer an option? Should I just try to forget about it? Do you think she's purposefully ignoring me?  Should I try to be friends with her? Should I try following her on Instagram or follow one of our mutual friends, comment on their post, and see if she decides to follow me? Should I try talking to her?

This is just so confusing and hard for me to figure out. Thank you for reading all of this and hopefully responding.",24Oct2017,1

42,"Hi people of r/Advice I have been going to college for the last 4 years and i haven't made a single friend. SAD I KNOW. LAME :/.  I guess i can say im weird/awkward in a way? Im 22 but look like im in my 40s and have a serious character but then im a nice guy. I also have a blank facial expression. Look weird when i smile so i abstain as much as i can from doing so.  

Let me give an example. Last semester in physics i was helping a lot of students understand physics and helping them with homework and preparing for test. As soon as it started becoming the end of the semester people started ignoring me. One day im walking and see a woman who was in the study group. I wave and say hi she literally turns her head and says nothing. Totally awkward and was like dam because this isnt the first person who has done this to me. Thats just one of numerous occasions.

Currently as of right now its like the same thing all over again. A person who was in my class two semesters ago is now in my class again. I initiated contact stating i recognized them etc. As of right now im doing this person's projects because she barely knows how to do the projects. Yes its a girl again. But she is different she shows a lot of interest and has asked for my digits numerous times and wanted to hang out one weekend but i coudln't. Never can btw just to busy. But one day the same scenario happened where im walking and see her with her friends. Totally awkward timing but. She looked at me and saw me then quickly turned around and started walking faster with her friends i kid you not. As i got closer all she did was look away. I just chuckle this off. Im like wtf did i do. Im doing your work for you and then i just get straight up ignored. Like wait till the end so your grade isnt messed up. I was literally about to mess up her grade by giving her shitty code but being the nice guy i am i just did it to the best of my ability. Of course they are all A's(100). I didn't initiate contact when she was with her friends because maybe she just didnt want people to know i hang with her or something? But of course now she wants to make me lunch etc which no one has done ever. She sometimes thinks she is being annoying but i tell her she isn't and never feel she is when we talk. We are literally almost the same in almost every way as well. This is just weird after ignoring me. I consider myself to be on the ugly side bahaha no need to even lie about that. She is on the cute side. So of course more than likely no go haha :/.

This has also happened with people i went to high school with  that i see at college. I dont know what the hell im doing wrong. I can start a conversation and all they want to do is get away from the start. This person im mentioning unfriended me on facebook but then saw them at college. I didnt even know they went there. 
 I think i should seriously ditch people and prioritize my business and take coding to the next level. Has anyone ever had this problem or currently has this problem? Can barely make friends. There are people ive helped financially and that was a horrible experience as well. Never help people financially you'll never see that money again and more than likely will unfriend you. 

The examples i gave are mostly woman but it also happens with men in my age group. Me and this dude would game on steam together. After 1 semester he unfriends me on steam. I thought it was a glitch and tried to friend him. He then blocks me. 1 year later i see this guy at college and say wahts up. Adds me on steam again after a semester unfriend and block. LIKE WTF im not some annoying dude or something.  Since then ive never been on steam. Makes me rethink spending $$ on those games. Why the hell are people so fake? Seems thats the type of people ive encountered or people that act like friends then just flip the bird and say bye.  This post has no thesis it seems and im all over the place because i seriously dont know what the hell im doing wrong or what to mention. Being a college student my grammar should be superb but may the grammar warriors demolish it :/.

I guess my main questions are how do you make friends?obviously idk how to despite my age and what and how to deal with fake people?",24Oct2017,2

Since now, I mainly used it to talk to a friend but me and him got in a fight and I have said that ""I would take a break online from the crap going on."" I apologized also, and he saw it, kept me still on Discord a close friend of 3 years. Cause the stuff online breaked me, I didn't want to say to him that ""saying that Isaiah is literally the calmest person you ever met is an insult to me"" because I felt like it would make things worse and makes me mad because Isaiah unexpectedly unfriended me and removed me due to me saying that I won't be on much of the school year, he also said from this game that he will ""quit it and take a break from the forums"", yet he goes on each day.

51,"Ever since high school I've dreamed of having a girlfriend. And all throughout that time, I've had several girls come and go in my life, and opportunities to start a relationship with those girls come and go with them. In high school, a very pretty girl held an interest in me for all 4 years, and though we definitely grew closer by our final year, I didn't make a move despite her giving me many hints she wanted me to. I just never felt ready. I never felt confident enough in myself. I was afraid of what would happen if the relationship went sideways, and I just didn't trust myself enough at my level of maturity then to face all the good, and bad, that relationships entail. She ended up finally reconnecting with her ex and going to prom with him instead. That was almost 3 years ago.

Fast forward to this summer, and an older girl acts all flirty and kisses me at a wedding. I'm flattered and overwhelmed, but I don't know how to reciprocate those feelings. She flies home, and though we still keep up with each other, our relationship went nowhere. For weeks I was extremely disappointed, partly in myself, but I've come to terms with it now.

My experience with this girl made me more confident in myself. She reminded me that it's ok to live life, and gave me some important experience with being intimate with somebody for the first time ever. And I was left wanting more - how could I not?

I'm in college now and there's this one girl whom I see often in class. We're about the same age, and unlike the other girls I've met, she seems pretty down-to-earth. We sit besides one another about once a week, and there's been a lot of physical flirting. Though it may seem silly to some, we've said so much without actually talking. We've grown close such that she's come to sit very physically close to me every time we get the chance to (think lots of side glances, moving papers in a way that allows her to lean close to me to write something down), or making sure to get to that one spot early so that we can sit beside one another. And every time we sit with one another, when class is over, she and I will both linger after everyone's gone - hoping that one of us will break the silence and say something to one another. She's waiting for me to do something, and I know it. I don't want that window to close again.

I know I've been wrong before, but something about this girl just feels *right.*

Obviously, and my mom has already told me to do this, I must get to know this girl better first, to talk to her more, and to start by making a friend. But I've held back.

The thing is, at this age, I'm so ready for physical love and intimacy (this is what I want more than anything in the world right now) - I've taken care of my body up to this point, I take pride in my appearance and dress, etc. - but I don't know if my mind is ready. I've grown so much after all these years of observing these would-be relationships and I've grown to understand who *I* am more, but I still have many doubts. What if she finds me boring as we get to know one another better? Will I be able to pick myself up if things were to go wrong between us - can I handle heartbreak responsibly? Am I ready to open up to someone and show them what I'm really like?

I know in many ways I'm ready for love. I grew up in a household of women, so I feel confident that I know how to treat a woman right. I'm prepared to give a girl my all and to respect her, protect her, never hurt her (especially physically), and to make her feel valued and loved like never before. But I also don't know what that means, and I think that's what really holds me back.

It's fear of the unknown and of screwing up since I've never been in a relationship before and also, I suppose, me trying to get reward without any risk. Maybe it's just time for me to man-up. 

Am I wrong to want this right now? I'd be grateful for advice right now.

57,"My situation is so messed up that I need advice on how to ask for advice.

Some years ago I had a landlord who, for reasons unknown, began harassing me with techniques that I have since learned are called ""gaslighting""--and were made by what I eventually realized were likely hidden audio devices (and probably surveillance). The story gets much worse from there, and it is not easily believed. Which is fitting, as that seems to be the whole point of gaslighting. 

I have some evidence--audio recordings, circumstantial observations aplenty--but no video footage. No history of mental illness, no drugs. Yet I know that without hard proof, either of those will be assumed. This alone has prevented me from going to the police, although I have always been on the brink of doing it. 

Occam's razor is not on my side, and just about every aspect of this experience is a red flag for a skeptic.

Who should I contact just to talk without risk? I am not insured (and I'm in the U.S.). Should I contact police, or some sort of agency? Should I contact a lawyer (for my own safety)?

3 children under 8 yrs old. All boys, one is full spectrum ADHD and requires an amazing amount of focus.

Refuses to seek out help/groups/therapy to learn coping skills etc.
Sleeps all day. Sleeps all night. Avoids the family lately as much as possible.
Refuses intimacy. (Has been 8 months since we had sex. Last time before that- I don't even know).
She parties with friends at least once a week and returns the next day.
She has been using cocaine. She would occasionally indulge in the past but now it is every week. She looks for reasons to go out for the coke I think. 
I stay at home with the kids and don't allow it anywhere near the house.
I am working as hard as I possibly can but am barely making my bill payments. I am falling behind now and I really need her to get hours to bring on money. But she hardly works and her attendance is shit.
I am not a saint by any means. In the past I would do a few lines at a party too. That seems like a lifetime ago... When I had money. Less worries. Less responsibility. I don't touch it now.

71,"Ok this is a semi prolonged story but I will give you the basis. 

Basically I’m talking with a friend, that I have known for about a year now, about some random stuff when he lifts up his phone in a way that resembles taking a photo. I ask him are you taking a photo of me? And he says no. I say ok then turn the camera around so i can see it and when he does the camera points towards him (meaning he was trying to take a photo of me). Now usually im not the type of person to overreact, i just have extreme discomfort with photos of me due to self conciousness. So i try to be polite and I say cmon bro dont take a photo of me please. He says ok and now im thinking problem solved. Except a second later he tilts his phone up like he is taking a photo and then down and I say really man? And i give him a light slap. Note this wasnt even something meant to harm him it was more chiding, not even enough to move his face. At this point he just stops talking to me. I say are you really going to get annoyed after getting on my nerves? Then I straight up stand up and leave because he refuses to say anything. That night I snapchat him asking why he was mad at me when he did something I wasnt comfortable with. He proceeds to call me a dumbass and say that he didnt actually take a photo of me. I explain my point of view because all I saw was the camera face up and a childish grin. He then says the “way he was raised he didnt take shit from people”. This is what got me roiled because he acted as if he was the victim when he provoked a reaction from me. So I said i dont care about how you were raised that has nothing to do with the current situation (which I now regret saying). But then it was radio silence. The person i grew close too for a whole year proceeds to cold shoulder me. In total I have apologized 4 times but yet he still ignores me completely, not even acknowledging my presence. All I in the end wanted was a compromise. He didnt try to take photos of me and I would promise not to become physical with him. That is my current dilemma. I’ve asked my other friends and they say that acting like that is just being petty. Im not sure why I cant move on like he has. Ive tried apologizing in person and he brushes me off. I know Im probably wasting my time but I guess I need people to confirm that for me. :(

84,"Hello!

I am a new subscriber. I just found this place 2 seconds ago. I needed some advice on this topic so I decided to post it. I hope I'm not breaking any rules! I appreciate all advice in advance.

Let's get into this!

My sister and I share a house that my parent's pay the mortgage + insurance for. My sister and I split all other bills 50/50: Internet, TV, Electricity, Water, Gas, etc. This all works out fantastic.

Well, my sister's friend just moved in to my bedroom and I moved into my parent's bedroom in August. So far so good. She helps out and pays us $300 a month for everything. I have no complaints about her at all. She is a great person to live with.

The issue I have is that since I was forced to move into my parents room, I can't exactly make it my own so I've felt out of place. My parents come down about 4 times a year (if that) but my mom is still picky about her room, understandably.

My parents aren't even sure they want to come down here but that's another story for another time.

Anyway, due to both of these issues (not sure if want to come down but still picky about their room) I can't make this bedroom my own.

I was able to move my bed and a few of my possessions into the room so it isn't like I'm sleeping on their bed but right now my desk and desktop computer are all in the living room.

It is right outside my door about 5 ft from my bedroom. Not far by any means but still in the ""common area"".

When my sister/her friend have people over, I can't use it because either I don't want to intrude or I am trying to record videos for YouTube and feel awkward using it/doing that in front of other people.

So, I've been thinking of moving my desk into my bedroom. Originally, I moved it out there (earlier this year way before sister's friend moved in) because I wanted to get better sleep and it worked but now I have a massive TV in my room that I can't help but use so that is failing now, big time.

Now that I am starting with my YT channel I want to record videos and doing that would be easier if I could have peace while doing it. The common area has no doors. It is very open concept which is awesome but problematic for a YT Channel.

My worries about doing this is that I'll become even more of a hermit (never come out of my room since it has an on-suite) and my sleeping habits will worsen. Obviously, both are pretty bad.

85,"I am currently taking Calculus I and it is sorta giving me a nervous breakdown.

I'm a moron, but it is not all my fault. My professor doesn't have the firmest grip on the english language, trying to pay attention to him is like taking a shit made out of barbed wire. He has the worst rate my professor score I have ever seen.

Got an A in precalculus in my junior year of high school but I am currently a sophomore in college and haven't taken math in 2 years. I got a D on my 1st calculus midterm and I haven't done that poorly on a test since before high school. I'm falling behind in that I am wrapping my head around lessons that are from a week before the current time table of the class and feel I am not getting any closer as I run after this train. So naturally I am stressed and consumed in self hatred. Thinking of pulling the trigger and dropping it and taking it at a community college during the summer. It won't help that half of my thoughts are bullying myself for lack of intelligence, but I've heard it called an easy A Is that true? If so I will take it since I do not need math for my majors at all aside from this one class and 2 semesters of STAT at the 3xxx level. 

I wanted to have a GPA worth honoring this semester. I got a 3.3 and a 3.45 in my first year of college and wanting a 3.7 but this class is making that a nigh impossible prospect. I feel like not getting at least a B in this would be a scarlet letter on me or a permanent dunce cap ",24Oct2017,1

87,"Little background here: I played D1 sports and graduated with a degree in Finance. I enjoyed playing sports my whole life and thought finance would be great but realized I hate Excel and everything about Finance. As a result I've been working in the family business, medical related, as my mother is a doctor. All should be well as I'm making good money, have flexible hours, but honestly I'm pretty unhappy and here is why.

I can not give up playing professional sports but do not have the guts to tell my mother because of the fucking Cancer that has been on an off for the past 5 years. This may sounds selfish but my family is well off and could easily support my endeavor for the next two years however I know it's my mother's dream for someone to become a doctor in the family. To add gasoline to the fire, we have very different views on life ... as she is all about money while I do not give one dam about money. 

All in all this has ultimately led me to this predicament ... of me going back to school this coming semester to take all the Pre-Med courses. I feel like I'm gonna die depressed as fuck because I am essentially throwing away the PRIME years of my life (mid 20s early 30s) because I do not want to kill my mother. 

Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated. I know its not my parents' obligation to support such an endeavor but I have done literally everything they have asked of me my whole life. I have set a perfect example for my 3 younger siblings none of which have any interest in the medical field. I would happily go to medical school but after I have come to terms that I can not be a professional athlete.

TLDR: Been a model child for parents and simply have one small request but am too scared to approach mother dealing with cancer.",24Oct2017,2
88,"So my mum died a couple of days ago. Lost her due to 'Adeno carcinoma of unknown origin'. In other words, doctors failed to detect the tumour(s) until it was too late.

To explain what I need advice on specifically is gonna take some extra details about the situation.

I live at home with my dad and two 30+ year old brothers. My dad is not their dad so the relationship between them is not the same for them as it is for me as one could expect.

I was never happy living at home in the first place. Living away for uni was amazing and I miss it. I went travelling recently and came to the conclusion I must move away for the sake of my own happiness and for work opportunities (my town is a dive). As soon as I got home from my travels was when my mum was taken to hospital and died a few weeks later. 

My dad is the main issue. He's a long time alcoholic. His relationship with my mum was deteriorating due to it. Many years ago he had a failed suicide attempt when I was a child and he is in way worse of a situation now than then. I am always worried he will try it again soon. 

My brothers want away from him ASAP because he is a complete burden to live with. He is a complete and total manchild. Think of Jerry from Rick and Morty but worse. In his 50+ years he has only lived alone for 2 weeks of his life and he barely knows how to cook, use any appliances and he refuses to tidy up after himself. He used to be a hard working labourer but he hasn't been to work in over 12 weeks. His body is broken and getting worse. I always fantasised it would be him to die first so it is a shock my seemingly healthy mum died suddenly.  He is self-employed, he's broke and owes me thousands of what I borrowed him. Mum's funeral is being paid for by the money I had saved from my student loans. He continues to go to the pub every night and get wasted. He has been totally dependent his whole life on other people while convincing himself that because he once made money to support the family he could get away with letting others be his servants at home. 

I recently found a job but it's not full time. I also have my mum's shop which we need to look after but at the moment its out of season and we're losing money by opening. This is just another problem I need to solve/get through though so I wont go on about it.

I feel some responsibility to stay with my dad, but at the same time I had lost any hope of him changing his ways years ago with his pathetic behaviour. The amount of times I had heard him say he wanted a divorce so he could be free to do what he wants, and how instead of sitting with my mum while she was being fed a cocktail of drugs till she died he would be down in the pub drinking, *I think it's about time I divorced him*. But still, I would feel so guilty by leaving him.

I myself am dealing with the loss the best way I can. I am choosing not to let it break me down. It's happened and there's nothing I can do. I am not depressed, I still see there are good times to be had, but I also believe things will only get worse before they get better with the current situation. I see that in this situation I have the power to make changes to my life. I just don't know if I could live with the consequences of breaking away from my dad, but as the same time I believe i'm wasting myself trying to carry him. 

Any advice is welcome.

P.S - I feel extremely lucky to not be American and have to pay for medical bills. I could only imagine how fucked that would be.",24Oct2017,0

100,"Before I start: 
1. Hook up means making out in this context
2. Her and i don’t go to the same school
3. This is long but my heart won’t rest until someone talks to me about this so please help out. Even if i’m in the wrong, I just want an answer from  a third party

So my girlfriend used to hook up with this guy. This was last year. 

When her and I first started meeting up but weren’t exclusive yet, on our dates this guy would text her and tell her to ditch me to meet up with him. He even told her to come to the bathroom at a park so they can do stuff. (She is definitely not that type of girl whether she was with me or not). She always told him no, told him why would she ditch a guy that actually cares about her for someone that just wants to do things for her

When we first started finally dating, he would text her telling her that she’d have more fun with him, just overall trying to get her to end things with me. A few weeks after we started dating, she had to break up with me because of religious reasons. Her family is Jewish and when they found out I wasn’t, they threatened to disown her and forced her to end it. She was sad because she really liked me. 

The next night her group of friends goes to his house for a kickback, and she goes too. At one point they end up alone in a room and they kiss for a few seconds. she said she kissed him to try and forget about me but it didnt work so she left and called her parents to pick her up and left. She called me the next night saying she still wants to be with me and told me what happened. I really liked her too and understood because i wanted to hook up with someone also to forget about her. We started dating again but i told her that i’m not okay with them being friends. Yeah yeah, “your partner should never tell you who you should or shouldn’t be friends with” but in this case I think it was okay in this context, especially because she didn’t even want to be friends with him either. 

They stop talking, she builds up a dislike for him always telling me what a douchebag he was

This was all during the summer

School starts again, and she tells me that he sometimes he says hi to her. I asked what else they talk about  and she says she just says hi back, he asks her whats up and she says nothing, then the convo ends

Anyway she just brings him up a lot, he’s in waterpolo so he wears a speedo and she had a picture of him in a speedo in her camera roll a few months ago, idk if she still had it. She had the pic because she laughs at it because “it’s just funny”. Sometimes she would show me him on her friends snapchat stories and it bothers me that she knows exactly who to go to to view the story. Like why do u care about pictures of him can he just be in the past. A lot more things about him that just add up. Then released tonight

She sends me a screenshot of a notification of him liking her instagram picture. Okay, i don’t really give a shit i just change the subject and she notices. Then, she sends me a screenshot of his new instagram post that has her best friend in it with him. I’m just really fucking annoyed that she keeps bringing this dude up. The only thing that kept me from popping is that when she sent the instagram screenshot, she hadn’t liked his picture

I tell her how glad i am she didn’t like it

She said oh i liked it before i saw your text

Then i just say nice, start taking longer to reply because i’m in a bad mood and she says “yeah because liking a picture means you want to marry someone.” I just change the subject again but am in a noticeably bad mood. She asks why i’m salty and whats wrong and i say that i just wish she didn’t like the picture. She says “i love you but i can like anyones picture, just like you can”. Yeah well i wasnt with a girl that actively tried ruining our relationship. I say “yeah you can like anyones picture, i’m not telling u not to. I’m just saying i wish u didnt feel the need to like it”. She tells me its just a like and doesn’t mean anything. I say “if its a guy that tried ruining our relationship and a guy you kissed after we met then its not just a like to me.” Tomorrow is our anniversary though, so to lighten the mood and suck it up i change the conversation. 10 mins later, before she sleeps, she asks if i’m sleeping too and i say “once i stop thinking about that guy and my heart rests, i’ll sleep” to which she replies “dude he’s a nice guy he just made a mistake”

are you fucking kidding me

i just say cool and change the conversation. Few minutes later, she asks again if i’m sleeping and again i tell her “when my heart rests”. She asks why its not at rest and i say “i already told you why”

She says “i can’t believe we’re still on this” and i tell her that it didn’t help that she defended him. She just says good night. I say good night back. Then she asks “what’s with you”. And again, I tell her that i’m in a bad mood because of him. 

She replies “dude i just liked his picture i didn’t hook up with him. Chill the fuck out” 

We never cuss when we fight. So her telling me to chill the fuck out when in my head i have a right to be upset about this fucking asshole really pissed me off. I just sucked it up, it was our anniversary tomorrow, apologized, pretended like i was okay and said i acted like a dick, then she slept

I’m in a really bad mood right now and need someone to talk to about this because i can’t talk to her about this. Now, I do trust her completely and know she’d never leave me for anyone. I don’t think her liking his picture means she likes him. Just the fact that she liked his picture, then talking about him always gets me in a bad mood and she knows that, then she defends him then tells me to chill the fuck out. 

Idk how i make her sound in this post but she’s one of the most thoughtful, smart, strong, positive, understanding, funny, beautiful, and amazing girl i’ve ever met and i may make her sound rude in this post. She isn’t. She gives my life light

But A lot of our fights have been because of this asshole

102,"To start off I [18m] have a part time job, and are planning to move out soon. Given my job pays just a little over minimum wage I still have some money., just not much. I live in the south and February of next year I plan to move up north. I was going to wait to tell my mother [38f] until I had $1k saved up for my move. But something got in the way of that and I had to tell her sooner. 

For a little context .  OP [18m] Highschool dropout, has part-time job, working towards obtaining GED. Mother [38f] Unemployed due to disability/sickness for the last 2 years. 

So now to the point. I tell my mother that I'm planning on moving out, and very soon. She asks how soon, and I tell her the begging of next year. After that she starts getting angry saying that I've lied to her based on a previous conversation we had. I was cleaning my room and she came in and said ""what are you moving out?"" and I tell her ""Yeah before I turn 20"" she kind of brushed it off and I didn't really think much of it. I told her that I wasn't specific then, because I wasn't prepared to tell her yet. I didn't feel I would be prepared to tell her until I had a decent amount in savings. Nevertheless I told her sooner than I wanted to, and she seems absolutely broken by it.

Most of our conversations about my move go like. 
**Mom** ""You have no idea what your in for""
**OP** ""I know that, but I don't enjoy living here and I've already made up my mind""
**Mom** ""You don't have to make your life this way, you're throwing away every opportunity you have right now""
**Mom** ""You're smart, but you don't understand what the real world is like. You believing everything will be okay is just you being delusional""

105,"so my friends an I like to walk around and have ""philosophical"" conversations, and yesterday we discussed preserving innocence, which really interested me. basically we started discussing drugs and whatnot and our views on such things, and I told my friends I'd be open to trying out certain substances in the future, but I'd most likely feel very guilty, and in the past have felt guilty doing such things to some extent. it felt as though i was losing innocence. my friend asked my why I was worried about losing innocence, and that really got me thinking, as I didn't and don't know why I'm concerned about losing innocence. I've been exposed to things such as cursing (since age 6) and have seen the effects of drugs and violence, as well as have been desensitized to things thanks to the internet since age 9. Within a year and a half I will be considered an adult, so it makes no sense to dwell over innocence when making decisions. I'm genuinely confused as to why I feel guilt or a loss of innocence when considering doing things that would require a disregard of innocence. I guess the only logical explanation would be doing things that go against what I've been taught as a child for the first time, but these things happen as you mature. anyone know why I feel this way? 

side note: one of the two friends I talked to yesterday about this topic made a good observation, which was that myself and the other friend in the group ( who shared this view of preserving innocence with me)  both enjoyed reading catcher in the rye, and could relate to Holden Caulfield in a way, meanwhile he ( the friend who doesn't consider innocence at this point) found the book boring and redundant.",24Oct2017,3

I understand consequences and can make concious decisions. I wouldn't be saying this if I didn't think I was 100% safe here and have always been. Yes Dad gets angry at times and annoys me, but I've never once felt like he was actually dangerous or wanted to hurt me. And on top of that with grandma and grandpa here he especially won't do anything, even though I know he never would anyway. I do not feel unsafe here. I know he isn't making good decisions, but it isn't effecting my life negatively other than when he gets angry, and even then he just is in a bad mood for a while and it doesn't affect me. I don't want to throw away my life over a hypothetical. My life has been spectacular for the last few years. I can't just toss it down the drain because of a fear you have of something that might happen. I won't just throw away my life because of a fear you have that ""might"" happen. I think I deserve a say in this because it's my life caught in the middle. And I say thanks, but I'm old enough to look at a situation rationally and know what's best for me. I'm not a little kid. If I thought I was in any danger at all you would be the first person I call to come grab me. And I never felt I was, and that's why I never did call you and say that.

Alright see you then."" I have been under so much stress and issues these past weeks trying to explain to all the important people that I've known for years that in 3 weeks I'd probably never see them again. I don't like that you chose to just take control of my life without consulting me and thinking it's ok. It has ironically made me more stressed and upset that I have ever been in the past 4 years living with dad. It's thrown so much pain into my life and stress onto my shoulders it's unbelievable. I don't know much about laws but I'm pretty sure I'm old enough to make my own decision in this case, and my decision is putting my foot down and saying no. I won't do it. I love you mom, but if there was problems that required this I would've had you come get me much sooner. I'm not stupid. And I'm perfectly capable of making decisions that will directly affect my own life. I don't need a puppet master, what I need is to be recognized as someone who's not 5 and who doesn't have an IQ of 12. I can make my own decisions based on what's good for me, and in this situation I am. I'm not gonna tiptoe around this stuff anymore. For my whole life I've just gone with the flow and tried my best to adapt to whatever life throws at me. I'm done with that. It's too much. I'm putting my foot down. I'm not trying to rediscuss the situation with you, I'm saying that I am going to stay in oregon and that is my final decision. I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm trying to be aggressive.

I added her on social media trying to get her attention away from my cousin then I messaged her I asked her about her future (which I know I made a mistake) I made her anxious. To recently she refused to look at me, say hi and ,only to me in one word answers. It became so toxic that one time I just walked out of the cafe late at night. Some of my coworkers said that she was worried about me walking out and doing something stupid. so I thought were we're okay but now she won't even look at me again. I really just want to know what's wrong with her as a friend

TLDR: Fell in love with a coworker, made her feel anxious, just want to know what's going on with her.",24Oct2017,1

Obviously bc we are gay there is no fear that they are an item (and she has a boyfriend back home). AND I have also gotten over my trust issues when he goes out with other friends bc I have enough respect for him to trust him. Here's the problem:

I'm already an overthinker but I am aware and can catch myself. This girl from overseas is leaving this month. So I understand if he wants to prioritize time with her before she leaves. Also, with exams coming I dont have the time to care if he does spend time with her. However, I need at least some attention so I planned a 3 day trip stay in the city with my partner. In this month I have seen him 3 times where as he sees her everyday. Which is fine too bc what can I do about her living there. I just feel super angry bc on the 3 day trip I planned he still asked if we could meet late in the afternoon bc he's getting lunch and going to a book market with her beforehand.
IN THE ONLY THE TIME WE GET TO SEE EACH OTHER THIS MONTH. His texts have also been slow I assume bc of her once again. I feel super underappreciated and I'm afraid if I voice it, I'll be the crazy one bc this is her last month here.

Hi all - could really use some help here! This Thursday, I have an interview for my current dream position, with a lot of growth potential. For privacy reasons, I don't want to reveal the industry, but I'm really jazzed about it.

Anyhow, even though I've been prepping/applying for this for weeks and finally got called back for an interview yesterday, I'm FREAKING OUT. My hands keep going numb and clammy. I feel constantly nauseous. I can barely sleep.

I need to calm down in order to keep a level head and make a good impression on the interview, but I can't stop thinking about the what ifs. I know there are several other candidates for the same position. I believe I am the most qualified, but the numbers are still discouraging (I know there are at least 6 of us). Also, I'm worried I'll sabotage my chances by doing something stupid like fainting or vomiting under the pressure. (This has happened to me before in other contexts). I'm currently getting treated for my anxiety and don't need any medical advice, but do you have any tips to keeping cool in a stressful situation? I need to be on my toes for the working interview, and I don't want to make a fool of myself. This opportunity means the world to me.",24Oct2017,1

124,"So I live with 3 flatmates, my brother, his girlfriend, and a friend. Often my brother and his girlfriend are affectionate, to a point where I find it uncomfortable and generally annoying. I find general PDA annoying, but they take it to another level. They argue that it's not PDA because this is their home, and they can do what they like *in their home.*

They often do things I just find uncomfortable, like lying on top of eachother, kissing, and sometimes just general cheeky stuff like ass/boob grabbing and foot massages **in the living room.**

They constantly follow each other most places, randomly meeting in the bathroom if the other goes there, or the garage just before one of them is about to leave. 

I find this so annoying to the point where I always comment on it and tell them to stop, but my other flatmate has absolutely no problem with their ongoing affection. 

Am I unusual for being uncomfortable with this and finding it annoying? Should I ignore my annoyance and stop commenting on them?",24Oct2017,1
126,"So, I'm 20 years old introvert (I guess) living in a flat with three flatmates in Prague. I moved there year ago from other smaller Czech town because I wanted to ""stand on my own feet"" and not be dependent on my mother.. I have never finished high school. I'm working since 18 years and I had 4 different jobs already. I was fired from two of them (not literally. Contract ended and they didn't want to give me a new one).
And others two I quit. Last time I quit because they moved me from Sale Assistant position to expedition at Warehouse cause they were not happy with me. And I don't want to work at warehouse. Now I'm unemployed.
First word that comes to my mind If I should describe myself is ""lazy"". Yes. I am really lazy and I'm trying to find a way to do everything as easily as possible or a way how to avoid doing a certain tasks. I am also delaying everything as much as possible.

My day looks like this: I wake up when I feel like I don't want to sleep anymore usually around 4pm. Yes, 4pm. I turn on pc and for about 2 hours I am just casually browsing, order some food, listen some music. When evening starts I turn on Dota2. I'm usually playing it till a 6am and then I go to sleep. This is what I do almost every day when it's not workday. At workday my day looks almost exactly same. But I sleep for 4 hours. Wake up to work, come home, play Dota2 and go sleep again for 4 hours, repeat. 

I don't really have a lot of friends. 3 + flatmates. When I started working in my last job I felt like an outsider so much. I thought it will change through time but it really didn't. Yes, some of them were cool with me but I still felt like I don't really fit in. And that's my problem everytime when I meet new people. I am not really confident at talking with people of my age that I don't know. Last week I was on a date with a girl I met at a store. It was absolutely terrible. I realized my life is extremely uninteresting and I don't really have much to talk about. When I'm with my friends we usually just hang out, smoke weed and listen to music. That's all we do. My best friend is a real pothead and if there is no weed anymore he usually just goes home. I smoke weed almost every day too but I can actually find a fun without it too. 

Because of my ""working style"" I am also in a debt. I owe a money to a flatmate for a 6month rents. Small money to a telephone and internet provider.

I need to change my life because I will end as a homeless this way. But I dont really know what to do. They say first step is actually to realize that something is wrong with you. Yes I do realize it and I admit it. But what do I do now. I got a lot of depressions because of it. I'm actually lying to everyone that I am still employed. Nobody knows I'm actually not anymore and I can't tell it to anyone because they will think I am just idiot who can maintain a steady job. And I am.

There is a lot to say but guess what. I'm lazy as fuck to write everything here. I will answer everything you want to know I promise. I just need to tell this to someone. To someone I know I will not be judged. I need some advice. I want to hear your opinions. I am desperate.

128,"I’ve been undeclared since the start of school, it’s the first semester of my sophomore year and I’m still undeclared. 

I can’t find anything that I have enough interest in to pursue. I am absolutely miserable in all of my classes and I find myself not wanting to care about my grades or anything at all. I still work at it, but I’m miserable and I have to force myself to go. 

At the moment I’m paying for them with student loans and a little help from my parents, who I currently live with. 

My home situation is also complicated and unhealthy which I won’t delve too much into. Part of me wants to take a break from school so that I can work full time or at least a lot more hours so I can afford a place of my own and take some time to figure out what I want to do. Because at the moment, I’m working part time and going to school and I haven’t been able to afford living on my own. 

Another important thing to note is that I have anxiety and depression and I used to take medication for it, so I don’t know if that’s just what is contributing to me hating school. Maybe I am just being lazy and my depression isn’t helping in making me care about my grades. 

Am I being unreasonable? I’m worried that I won’t go back to school if I take time off and in turn I’m worried about the consequences of that. 

TL;DR: I am a sophomore in college and I’m undeclared. I’m absolutely miserable in school and I want to know if taking a semester off of school would be a smart decision or not.

130,"I've struggled a lot with severe anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies while going back to university. I've tried to utilize the school's resources between medication, counseling, etc. However, I feel it rarely has helped me with the issues, especially in a deep seeded manner. Although, I was surprised last year, my last visit, I was told that their goal is only to get me through the semester and that's it. So I felt that I wasn't going to get the right kind of attention or advice from this place and quit going.  
  
Fast forward now, I'm having a really bad bout from stress and so on and I don't have anywhere to turn. I've been really isolated and dread has kept me from sleeping for a couple of days. Should I go back, knowing I will only be hesitant and critical to any advice because I don't see it coming from a place of genuine care? I don't know where-else I could go and I have little to no money to spend on this. ",24Oct2017,1
131,"25M here and I'm not the average university student. I'm suffering from bipolar II disorder that has gotten worse the past year and I've had a weed and alcohol abuse that I'm trying to pull myself out of now and I'm still in the critical period. On top of that I'm studying something that I've figured out isn't really something that I'm passionate about anymore and I can look forward to a future with little to no chance of getting a job in the field I'm interested in (team dynamics, leadership and coaching). 

At the moment I feel like I'm really close to breaking down and if I do I will break down for good. So I'm thinking that a break from university would be good for me but there are things to consider. I'm ""lucky"" in a sense that I haven't finished my bachelor's degree (need one exam which is in january) even if I'm studying on the master's now. This means that if I take a break I will be automatically accepted into the master's degree again by Danish law. On the other hand I am not good at doing nothing and not having a purpose with my daily life. 

What I am considering is to finish this exam I have in 3 weeks and then stop following the master's and focus on the last exam on my bachelor's from november-january and after that take a break until next november where I can continue my studies where I left off - OR apply to officer's school in the Danish air force which starts in August. If I do that I will at least be working with what I like: Team dynamics, leadership and coaching. 

My problem is that the life I live now is based on half truths. My parents don't know that I'm not done with my bachelor's, they don't know that I have had a weed and alcohol abuse for years, they don't know that I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I'm not sure if I can gather the courage to tell them. On top of this my dad is a former military figue, a special forces man that is strict and disciplined, so I've grown into being a young man that doesn't give up nor lets his guard down. I have no idea how I can make myself throw the towel in the ring and take a break. This wall of text is written on an iPhone so I apologise for the bad English.

So a little background for you, in college I loved photography so decided to choose it as a degree. Throughout uni I didn’t like the course and felt I was wasting my time, however I didn’t want to drop out or change courses as I didn’t want to disappoint my parents. After uni I got a job I loved (which wasn’t related to my degree) but then my partner got a job so we had to relocate. I then spent the next year doing temp jobs as well as walking out on another job. We have now relocated for his job again and I am left back at square one job hunting. I have little to no confidence when it comes to life and I spend most days aimlessly scrolling through job websites seeing jobs that I wish I could apply for if I hadn’t chosen such a useless degree. My parents don’t know how much I hated my degree and how stupid I feel now as I know for definite that I wasted their money. I’ve never really had any career goals, I just wanted to have a big family. I don’t feel proud of my degree cause I know it was all a lie and time trying to pretend that I was alright with it. I wish I had just realised in first year that it was alright to switch courses and then I might have done something worth doing.  My partner keeps telling me I need to have more confidence in myself but I can’t just magic it up out of nowhere so I’m really lost with what to do. I know there are people out there with much bigger problems than me but I just thought writing everything down might help.

When he told me he wanted me to move back to the city I am in and get a job there, I mentioned if he put me as a reference, I would make $3,000 over a period of time and that'd be neat.  He basically demanded I split it half or he wont do it.

So he eventually was hired without putting my name down and is acting like nothing is wrong.  I feel actually quite betrayed.  It's a lot of money that I could have used.  If the company intended on giving him money, it would be a sign on bonus and advertised as such, no?  I brought it up again and he mentioned I was being greedy.  Am I in the wrong for feeling salty as hell about this?  Some would say ""Well, should have taken half.."" but it's the principle  of it really.  What right does he have ransoming half of it away for his personnel gain when it's free money?  Just feels like a shitty thing a 'friend' would do to another 'friend'.

146,"I will try and keep this short. The situation is pretty cluttered and there is a lot going on. But ultimately, it is boiling down to three possibilities. Tomorrow, it will be shaved down to two. In an effort to prepare for the worst, I need some advice. 

&amp;nbsp;

If my job chooses to not hire me on as a full-time employee I can do one of two things:

1. Continue with them part-time and move into my friend's parents home. 

2. Quit and move into my girlfriends home in another state. 

&amp;nbsp;

My girlfriend (of 3 years) wants me to move in with her pretty bad. It will make it easier to finally start living together as that is the next step in our relationship. However, the current hiring season will not improve until January. That means two months of paying my student loans through freelance work and savings. Worth note that her state has less networking in my field. It is there, just less.

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, living in a friend's home lets me avoid living on my savings. I can earn a little money staying part-time while continuing to look for work that can support myself and my girlfriend. Not to mention I stay nearby friends and a strong employment network. The downside is that I have to live on the grace of my friend's parents... and will be living within reach of my emotionally abusive family.

&amp;nbsp;

I am leaning towards moving in with my girlfriend. Yet, I am concerned that I am making decisions too much on the fly. That it would possibly be more responsible for me to swallow my pride and stick it out another couple months here with a bit more financial security.

148,"So I started a new job last Monday doing Business Admin.

I have just finished an apprenticeship and the role looked great for me to do. It asked for everything that I was doing then and I thought ""Perfect!"". 

Well, I started on Monday and there were a few things that put me on edge - even on the first day. 

- I was bored. They didn't give me any instruction and when I asked for any work for me to do, they didn't have any - and I noticed this for the whole week. One or two hours of the day we would be busy - but then the next five hours or so, absolutely nothing to do. Heck, I was so bored and clock watching, I just wanted to go home. I asked if this is like this a lot and get the ""yeah - we sort of mooching around for work a lot"". I don't want to be doing that! I like being busy, having a purpose. 

- I didn't know my hours before my first day. I received an email that I would be starting on 16th Oct at 9.00am and would shortly received my contract - perfect. Well I started and then found out I was 9-5 and that I wouldn't be getting my contract for another week or two. I don't necessarily mind the hours, but I'm an early bird and would like a job earlier than that. 

- I was thrown into the deep end. Literally, second day and they have these meetings going on. They're like ""Illusionofcolours"" these people have been sent to the wrong address, call them up and give them this address"" I was put on the spot more times than I can count during that week and while this is good, the amount of times they did it really put me off. 

- The team and manager are expecting me to do stuff and know stuff right then and there - I couldn't do or say anything other than look at my mentor (who is quite nice, but training wise, isn't so great) and she did the stuff they asked of me for them. I feel and felt like a huge nuisance. 

- They gossip - usually this doesn't bother me, but one of the individuals who is equivalent job wise to me is leaving this week, and all they keep saying is that he is bad at his job, is making mistakes, uptight and to not listen to him - but then being nice to him and telling him hes doing well? It's making me wonder what they say about me! 

I think I've got to the point where I might just leave, however I am sort of stuck in a rock and hard place. My previous job won't take me back on only because I was an apprentice (they had no role for me after - hence why I had to look for another job), but I am quite anxious about looking and finding something else, what if I don't find something else? I'm so confused cause I need a job, I want a job, but this one I feel won't work out for me.

My mum was like you got two options - stick it out or leave and try and find something else. Shes very judgemental and while I love her, shes very negative - like ""if you quit then you'll have to get another job and who knows what happens, and the grass isn't always greener, you could go somewhere worse..."" ect. I don't know what to do! 

The thing is though is that I am an extremely hard worker, and have worked so hard throughout this past year in my apprenticeship - I try and I tried last week, but they didn't really help me and my intuition is telling me to go and find something else.

Please any advice or guidance would be really appreciated right now!

151," Alright! Right now I work for a grocery store chain in Canada called ""Sobeys."" I'm 23 years old.

 I'm a cashier, I'm also one of the only two people they have who can work the customer service desk/lotto booth, they're in the process of training me for supervisor (Slowly). 

 I make 13.90/hr and 14.40/hr when I'm in charge of the floor. I get on average 30-32 hours a week. I get benefits, I have to wear the worlds most ugliest uniform in the form of an oversized white blouse and a lime green apron, my wrist and knees are killing me due to 5 years standing on these horrible floors, and I don't HATE my job but I'm not happy here anymore.

  I've been here for 5 years, I have senority, my family lives in another province so they're more than happy to give me time off during the holidays to go see them, I suffer from chronic migraines so when I call in with one they don't question or give me a hard time, and they're pretty accomodating to my needs and wants. 

 The regular customers love me, and I love them, and I love my coworkers (Except Angie. Nobody likes Angie)

 The manager of Ardenes, a girly fashion store, approached me on the service desk and said she was so impressed with my service that she wants me on her team. She offered me a full time position with guaranteed 35 hours a week. I would be back down to minimum wage however at 11$/hr, there are NO benefits here, BUT I do get a 30-50% discount on stuff from the store and I shop there A LOT, I don't have to wear a uniform I can wear my own clothes, its something different and something new for me, and the girls who work there come through my cash all the time and they love me. 

 However, there is no time off allowed during the holidays which means I can't travel to see my family. They don't know about my migraines so I'm not sure how they'd handle me calling in sick 2+ times a month. She told me that once I'm done my probation she'll call head office and see about getting me some sort of a raise because I make so much more at Sobeys. 

 The promise of full time status and guaranteed hours were tempting. The fact that she liked my service so much she wanted to steal my from my place of employment and bring me to her own was flattering. I'm really unhappy at my job, and theres a high possibility that I'd be happier there.

 50% of the people in my life are saying ""Stay with Sobeys. You make so much more, they have benefits, and they're more than willing to give you time off to go home and see your family.""

 While the other 50% are saying ""The hell with Sobeys, making more money isn't always the most important thing in the world, benefits aren't THAT important and neither is time off to see your family, go where the happiness is. Go with Ardenes""

153,"Hi, I'm on mobile so bear with me please. Also, please tell me if I should post this somewhere else. Onto the problem, here's some background info. I'm a 16 year old girl who attends virtual highschool. That means being responsible for doing all my work on time, attending live lessons at scheduled times, calling and all around communicating with my teachers and more. This is a bit difficult because I have ADD and anxiety, which I take medicine for and while it does help, it isn't a miracle worker. I struggle with motivating myself to work and often find myself distracted by anything that will help me procrastinate. I am working on being more self disciplined with work by using schedules and reminders on my phone, and they work! Until my 8 year old brother enters the picture. He has gnarly ADHD. He is not a peach, or a pie, or the apple of my eye. We rarely get along. Yet, my parents think that leaving him at home with me while I should be working whenever he is 'sick' or slept in or has breaks (like spring or winter breaks). I was okay with it the first time, but it keeps happening. They just say to take care of him and dip out. Later I will get a text telling me to get him to do x y or z when I am trying to do my work after being distracted by my brother because he was hungry and he didnt like the food I made him, or he wants to play a game and can't get it to work or wants to rant about Pokemon to me. He  is directly impacting my work. I am getting less done and less right. My grades are dropping. My parents are in lala land. I have tried speaking to them about it but they just laugh it off?

157,"**tl;dr** I am dating my BFF's brother, her close knit family is vocal on their support but she won't talk to me. How long do I wait for forgiveness and should I offer to step down from being her bridesmaid in her wedding next fall to help her feel less awkward?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Three months ago I (27F) approached my very type-A best friend (26F) and told her that her older brother (28M) had expressed interest in me and that I had been silently interested in him for the past year since he returned from basic training. While I told her this out of courtesy and not to ask her permission she still took it as the latter and immediately said she did not approve and didn’t understand what I could possibly see in him. I explained to her that we had already discussed that if we were to date we would need to take it seriously from the beginning - we had already even discussed items such as religion, living expectations, children, and career aspirations to ensure that they aligned where important. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I gave her a few weeks of space and then wrote her a letter addressing what I thought might be bothering her most but she only continued to tell her brother untrue and negative things about me.  Since then, she has stopped talking to me except to text me that I am no longer welcome at her family’s events (including her brother’s own birthday dinner when he invited me.) I had previously been invited to them all over the last four years. Ultimately, her brother ended up cancelling the dinner because he didn’t want to reward her being a “brat.” Her aunts and her father have all reached out and told us that they’re sorry she’s been acting this way but she’ll come around and they’re so happy we finally decided to try this. About a month later moved 10 hours away for work so I can’t see her face to face easily any longer.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lastly, she and her fiancé (another great friend of mine) are getting married next fall and she has added me to the bridesmaid Facebook group (she had invited me before all this happened) but still has not say a word to me. Her maid of honor has told me that she’ll be hosting the engagement party now too instead of me even though I had already discussed it with my friend’s mother. It is important to mention her family dynamics too – her mother passed away from a long battle of cancer shortly before this happened and her family is very close knit. I knew her mother well and we got along great even to the point where she and the entire family had joked around multiple times that I should date the brother. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is no way for me to understand the emotional turmoil that occurs around losing a parent at a young age and I realize there are a lot of layers to this question – but now I come to you for help on how to proceed. To be clear, I am not sorry that we’re dating and it’s going very well. I am torn on if I can do anything to help my relationship with her.

* Do I continue to wait it out? Forever?
* Do I set a date where I should offer to step down as a bridesmaid so that she doesn’t feel that she has to have me stand up there out of obligation from our old friendship?
* What, if anything, should I try to do more?
* Should I automatically forgive her for the hurtful things she’s said about me and attribute it to her stressed mental state?
* Please feel free to tell me to stop being so selfish wishing for a quicker resolution if that is what it needed.

*Note* To help explain our friendship level – We have the same local group of friends, I am now friends with all of her high school and college friends, we’ve backpacked Europe together, I traveled to another state with her the first time she met her fiancé in person (they met online), she originally considered having me officiate their wedding, I regularly attended family gatherings and dinners with her extended family, I have hang out with her parents even when she's not in town.

158,All through out my middle school and high school experience I have been diagnosed anorexia and you know most people find it unattractive that you can see bones like that. There was this girl who was constantly paired with me to do projects. And so she was kinda forced to talk to me and such. I eventually developed a crush on her and long story short I asked her out and she rejected me and destroyed the last of my self esteem. And now a few years later were are both almost graduated from high school and I've made a lot of progress on my recovery and I look almost normal. And she likes me now. And she asked me out this morning but my question is even though I like her and she's likes me should I date her because she didn't like me when I had anorexia.

160,"Dear Reddit,

I am at a complete loss. I am a 21 y/o male who is currently studying Music at University level in England, and I am trapped; trapped between the party life and normal.

When I was in secondary school (between the ages of 11-16), I was a completely different person to who I am now. I was fairly introverted, only had 1-3 proper friends and enjoyed my time playing video games and staying at home along with my closest and current best friend, Tom. We had a lot of fun whilst at school, and then it all changed once we went to different colleges. I came out of my shell and started to become a party nut with a multitude of ""friends"". My friend stayed the same however, and we slowly drifted apart over the course 2 years as our interests started to differ. Nevertheless, he's always stuck by me despite the endless arguments that used to occur and I cannot thank him enough for that. We are still best friends to this day. 

We are now both at university, and I feel like I am stuck. Stuck between my party lifestyle and not. I feel like I am in too deep now and don't know how to get out. It's not to say that I want to completely abandon it, but I am struggling to find a healthy equilibrium. 

Any advice on how to slowly convert back to my old, simpler lifestyle? Anything would be greatly appreciated! :)

P.S. Since I have health anxiety, the drinking and drugs from the partying just add to the list of detriments of that lifestyle, with it sending my hypochondria through the roof. Also if you cannot already tell, I am extremely easily influenced and find it hard to say no.   ",24Oct2017,12

176,"A little about me first. I am 17 years old freshmen studying Computer Science in an average college. I know a few programming languages well enough (Python, Rust, JavaScript and some other small languages not mentioning here) to write code that helps solve real-world problems. I own a couple of repositories, few of which are a bit popular and have contributed to some major open-source projects on GitHub, something which I am quite satisfied about. In my free time, I involve in Q&amp;A sites like StackOverflow or help people solve technical issues in some or other form.

But here's the deal, since I started college, I don't think I've learn anything valuable in these 3 months. I get no time to maintain my own projects or learn other things I find interesting. Being a day scholar, I spend 9+ hours everyday from catching the bus till returning home. Not to mention the load of homework assignments, practical files and exams they put on us just about everyday (I am serious). I don't find anything that helps me look forward to attend college. At the moment, some of the things we are taught about are electrical motors, lasers, atoms. Most of which I don't think will ever help me. Stuff like this seriously makes me cram the day before exam and forget everything later on.

I've always wanted to learn more about machine learning and other phenomenal stuff in Computer Science. Even though I'll need maths as a per-requisite but I believe one can always learn anything when needed, instead of learning something and then looking for a way to put that knowledge to use.

In a nutshell, I don't find going college worth it. Should I stop going and put money to better use or is it that I am just being stupid? If leaving college might sound a better option, would my dev profile help grab interesting internships or a full-time job or should I just open-source more and gather knowledge by myself for the time being? Although, My parents won't easily agree for a drop but just in case life get unbearable.

185,"So I started working at this company a little over half a year ago. I got the interview by knowing the VP, but I wasn’t hired because I knew him. I did my training at $10/hour for two months and then they said I’d get $12. Fast forward two months, my “manager” only raises me to $11.50, saying the reason she’s not giving me the full $12 is because I didn’t come to work one day and she doesn’t want to give me preferential treatment. 

I went back to her office the next day and requested that I be raised to $12 as per our verbal agreement. She hesitated, and took three weeks before she raised me. 

That was the first sign that things were gonna get iffy. I put “manager” in quotes because she’s supposed to be HR, but gave herself the production manager title because of *her* relationship to the boss. 

Fast forward, they had me increase my production and made me do new units that I wasn’t used to or got trained on. As expected, I messed up quite a number of times for a couple of weeks, but managed to learn by asking questions and annoying my supervisor. Through this, people in another department developed a hatred for me and started to talk behind my back. That turned into them bullying me later on.

I go back to my “manager” to complain about the bullying, and she says she’ll talk to them. After she talked to them, things got worse and I’m now ostracized. 

Yesterday, there was an incident where someone was throwing away brand new parts to avoid repairing and my “manager” came to our department to yell at us. There are only four of us and I’m pretty sure I knew who did it, because when we were told, this one lady had the most exaggerated gasp and started kissing up. My “manager” was looking at me most of the time and she kept emphasizing that she’d “remove you from the department” if she catches them again. I know for a fact my coworkers are going to blame me because I’m the new guy and I was the one that was messing up the units. But it wasn’t me, and I don’t know how else I can prove it.

I’ve been dealing with this for a while and everyday I tell myself get myself through it and that these people don’t mean anything to me. I come to work and immediately get anxiety and I’ve been starting to get depressed. I feel like I’m at my wits end and I don’t know how else to approach this. 

I don’t know if I should quit because I don’t think I’ll find another full time job that’ll pay me like this and I don’t have time to job hunt as I’m going to school part time as well. Any advice would be appreciated.

So my girlfriend of 2 years (22 years old) broke up with me because she wanted to experience being 22 again. She had started conversations about us being soulmates and getting married when we were about a year in and I couldn't agree more. Here's the catch: she had a 2 year old son when we started dating with the father no where in the picture... she asked me 6 months before she broke up with me if I would adopt him if we got married. I told her absolutely because I love that kid (taught him to skate, swim etc). My entire family was also very cool with her and her son and everything was perfect. 

I'm not sure what happened honestly because this girl and this mentality is not the one I fell in love with. She was dealing with depression a lot of the summer and I was there for her and never for one second contemplated leaving her. I've been going to therapy (this happened a month ago) but I just don't know what the next move is honestly. My friends and therapist say ""she snapped because of life pressures and it got too real"" but it's so unfair I can't even comprehend it. Anyways, everyone has been telling me to wait until Nov. 19 to text her for her bday, but our anniversary is nov. 13th so what's the best move here? She hasn't texted me but when she broke up with me she said ""it'd be too hard to not see you and break up so I do wanna see you and I see it working out in the future"" but like I know she just said that or else she'd text me.

192,"Last wednesday, I hung out with some people from work. This extremely attractive guy I've worked with for two months began flirting with me, when he realized I didn't have a boyfriend like he'd thought I did all along. He seemed really interested and we had a bit in common. Eventually, after a few more beers he asks where I live and he follows me back to my house where he meets my mom and my grandmother. He's very drunk at this point, and I'm pretty naiive, but he starts kissing me and picks me up and stuff, then keeps trying to touch me and other things of that nature. I thought he genuinely liked me, but I would be like ""No, cut it out, I don't know you that well"" but he would be like, ""But I'm not!"" and yet continue to take my pants off and I'd have to pull them back up. Eventually he ended up fapping onto my stomach. I acted kind of awkward and disinterested while he was doing that, in retrospect, and refused to fuck him or put it in my mouth or even touch it. As he was leaving he got extremely weird. He kept telling me I was going to ""Be ok"" like I was upset or something (I wasn't), that I ""don't need a man"", and saying ""maybe I'll come back here someday"" then left for work, still decently hammered. The next day he consistently makes eye contact with me and smiles at me constantly, and keeps asking me what I'm doing later, but never asks to hang out. Two days after that, I get called in for dinner shift, and he ends up coming in as well. I'm leaving at that point, assuming he's gone home for the night as everyone else has, when I see him leaning against his car drinking a beer and having a cigarette. He immediately comes toward me and apologizes for the other night and gives me a hug and talks to me for a while. I muster the balls to ask if he wants to hang out again sometime, and he immediately says he's not looking for a girlfriend, but also immediately comes up with an idea of what we should do (He'd bring his dog over and we'd go for a run). Eventually he asks what im doing when I go home and I say probably going to sleep, and he says he has family visiting. We hug again then I drive away. 

A little backstory about me, I'm apparently a ""good looking girl with something wrong upstairs"" as a guy I met briefly described me to someone. I have an embarassing social skills issue and my behavior/mannerisms are very childlike/choppy/awkward. Ive been told by numerous people that no matter how attractive I supposedly am, my weird demeanor deters guys who would ordinarily be interested because im ""hot"" (I think that may be bullshit because I'm pretty sure hot girls don't get rejected like this)

Anyways, I'm so confused, and it's killing me:
1. Could it possibly be that I'm just not attractive enough?
2. Do you think he genuinely likes me or was just drunk?
3. Has there ever been a very good looking girl that you rejected/just weren't interested in for some reason?
4. General thoughts on the situation?

Prior to starting my undergraduate education, I wanted to go to a liberal arts institution but stopped myself because of the stereotypes against them. However, after extensive introspection and contemplation, I have decided that a liberal arts institution is what would make me happier.

However, as is true with most students pursuing a post-secondary education, financials are a very big obstacle. Currently, I am projected to pay around 20k for the year. If I were to transfer, this cost would increase to 30k-35K (this being a rough projection), meaning I would have to take loans out (though that is not the end of the world).

Basically, I was looking at a NSFW video on a work computer. I work in small insurance agency, only 10 or so staff. The computer is a desktop, facing out, not particularly private. A coworker, I'll call her Gina,  who is a middle aged woman, noticed what I was doing, and said my name quietly, and said very discretely, ""please, don't do that"".

I of course knew what she was talking about, and was beyond mortified. I immediately closed it, and without saying anything back to her, went back to work. Or tried to. I was distracted for the rest of the day by my overwhelming embarrassment, and felt physically ill. It was horrible, but I've been very friendly with Gina, and thought that she'd likely keep quiet about it as long as I didn't do it again or anything.

Well, she didn't. She told the agency owner, I'll call her Sally, who's an older woman in her late 60's/ early 70's. Now Sally runs the agency with the help of her son ""Jeremy"", who's in his early 40's. He's the one who hired me, and has been training me and working directly with me. So Sally approached me this morning, and she said, ""Gina told me what happened here yesterday. It is completely unacceptable, these are MY computers. How DARE you do that here at the office. I want you to know, I've texted Jeremy about this, and he's the only reason you're still here."" 

I was so in shock, I just nodded my head and said, ""Okay"". Sally walked away, and I went back to my work. Less than a minute later, Sally was talking to me about completely unrelated work topics. 

Jeremy is out of state for the week, so I doubt I'll hear anything before he gets back. 

I don't have a specific question, but I don't know what to do. What does reddit think the best thing for me to do would be? Do I apologize to Sally? To Gina?

207,"I don’t really know where I’m going with this, I just have to write it down before my mind is blown!
A few weeks ago applied for a job to become a Support Worker for adults. I didn’t think I’d get the job, but applied because I had nothing to lose. 
I must add that I already have two other jobs, that are part time working with children in a school and in a play scheme during half terms and the summer holiday.
I love these jobs, they both bring me excitement and satisfaction as I love helping people learn and develop. 
The support worker job I applied for was just on a part time basis, sixteen hours - evenings and weekend thing. 
I told them that I could start work for them in the evenings by four o’clock in the afternoon, as I leave my school job at three. 
Everything was great, I’m just waiting for a start date and my Criminal record check to come through.
So fast forward to today, and I come home to an E-mail inviting me for another interview at another school where the position is full time and permanent. 
I’ll probably be starting earlier and finishing later if I get this job, so I will only be later starting my other job in the evenings. 
I will more than likely hand in my notice for my present school job so I can start the new job.
The headteacher at my current school already thinks I do too much so I don’t know how she would take this if I said that I have an interview for another school. 
What would I say at the interview? Should I tell them about my job in the evenings? Would that benefit or hinder me getting the job that I actually want, which is the one I have an interview for soon? 
I genuinely don’t know what to do. 
I hope I’ve added everything. I just feel so flustered over it!
Thanks for the help!

209,"Hey, so I have this problem that started a couple days ago. A couple different things came to a head and I don't think I was quite as prepared for it as was needed. 

So 4 days ago I met up with this girl from tinder. We had sex, but it was purely physical. There wasn't any amount of connection. It felt pretty exhausting afterwards. On top of that fact, I couldn't help but think about this girl I have deep feelings for. Which is the basis of my anguish.

The problem is rooted in the fact that she has a boyfriend, and I tend to romanticize things. Which I really wish I didn't. I wasn't mindful of my train of thought, and be for I knew it, I was daydreaming about 2 years from now somehow how making things work with her. 

But at the end of the day, it's a bit selfish. 
She was talking about how her boyfriend has done mean things in the past, and about his controlling nature. Now for some reason, my mind has latched onto this as testament to the idea that their relationship has an expiry date. Which is untrue.

I care for her deeply, and the selfish man in me wants to confess my feelings for her. But I know that would cause her duress, and potentially destroy whatever delicate dynamic we've built. 
The man in me that I aspire to be says ""just be her friend, offer her advice that can help her be happy, but never tell her what you think she should do. It is her road to walk, you should just be the one that help sweep the street clean.""

And Yeah, it's a beautiful sentiment. 
The altruistically noble man giving thought only to the well being of her. Solely for the sake of her happiness. 
The reality Is, that I think I am more selfish than my idealistic side wants to believe. And I'm finding it hard not to want act upon these emotions I feel towards her and profess my love for her.

Yet, in only months, I move to Australia and she moves back home to Germany. 
Overall I don't think I will tell her how I feel. I don't want to mess anything up. Or cause her any amount of harm by doing so. 

Now that the groundwork of context has been carefully laid. I ask you this question: 

How does a man who loves a girl, be her friend, without feeling the urge to just tell her that he would wait years to be with her? Is it even possible to continue this interaction without feeling like some sort of tormented soul? And why in light of these realizations over the past couple days, has my self confidence, drive, and energy (the things she admires in me) virtually disappeared? It's freaking me out because I don't feel like the same person I was a couple days ago. 

Does anyone have any advice/insight into how to cope with these things? It's such a strange place to be in and I feel a bit lost at the moment. 

Thanks in advance for the advice, I love you all ",24Oct2017,1

Everyone’s time is valuable and I don’t want an artist to create a design for me without me getting it however depending on the design I may not want that one. How long after I get a design I like should the artist be expected to wait or would wait until I was ready to get the tattoo? For example if I email an artist today with my ideas and asking for a design how long does it usually take for someone to get back to you? How much should I pay for the design itself? Could I wait until December to actually have a tattoo done? Or should I wait until December to even ask an artist for their opinion?",24Oct2017,7

218,"I'm an Indian guy who grew up and currently live in the United States. One of my best friends is Muslim (his family is from Afghanistan but my friend was born and raised in the US) and my parents are forbidding me from hanging out with him precisely because he is Muslim.

Their main fears is that in the off-chance that he or any of his friends/family ends up being a terrorist (even if my friend himself is perfectly harmless), that it's going to pull my whole family into the FBI/CIA investigation since then we'll be associated with terrorists. If scenario does happen, it'll ruin not just my life but also my parent's lives especially since we are not white. They cited post-911 as evidence because the government at the time tortured and interrogated many innocent non-white people just because they were merely suspected of terrorism or suspected of being linked in some way to terrorists. They even claim they had Muslim neighbors at that time who randomly disappeared. **Yes, this is exactly what they said and yes, I do fully realize how insanely crazy and unrealistic/unlikely it sounds. I personally do NOT share these views** 

I tried convincing them otherwise by showing them statistics of how not every Muslim is a terrorist, how rare terrorism actually is if you take away media exaggeration, and how I'm astronomically more likely to die in a car crash then get pulled into some terrorist business, but they aren't having any of it. They don't want me to put my whole family at risk (no matter how small that risk actually is) because the consequences are massive in case it does happen since we are not white and because Trump is in office.

I think they have their minds set and are not going to be swayed by facts. I was planning to take a trip with my Muslim friend and now my parents aren't letting me go. What do I do?",24Oct2017,2
219,"Always feel weird around my friend.  So, I’ve known my friend for about a year.  I’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of mixed signals.  I do have a little crush on her, but I never have pushed anything for several reasons (its just occasionally is at the back of my mind).  For example, she’ll ask me to do stuff with her or spend time with her, but when I do the same thing she acts very weird.  The other day, after telling me she was just too exhausted to go out, she wasn’t lying.  But then continued talking with me ans asked me if we we’re going to spend the next day at the conference together.  During the middle of the conference she asked me to come back with her to her place, and kept offering me coffee.  Then she also asked me if it would be okay if she did some housework and I could just relax.  So, we went back to her place she made me some good coffee, I relaxed and she did house work.  She told me I should take a nap, and I did.  On the way, back she kept apologizing, saying it was weird to ask someone you like back to you place, and not do anything with them.

TL;DR: Things feel awkward between my friend and I.  We get along really well, enjoy spending time with each other.  Although not that much lately given our schedules.  It just feels weird because there’s always some sort of tension when were together, but conversely I’m incredibly calm and happy when I’m with her.

222,"So, I know this kind of post is probably popular on this sub, but I figured I would ask because it has been consuming my thoughts. I know all girls are not the same, but I want a general idea. I generally over think and analyze things until it hurts.

So about two weeks ago I met a girl at my friends birthday shindig. We are both 21, and go to different colleges in the same area. At the birthday party we talked a lot, just about random stuff so nothing out of the ordinary. As the night went on the party slowed down and eventually I left, but I was to big of a bitch to ask for her info. I didn't want to come off as weird and thirsty.

(Keep in mind, I was relatively good at talking to girls in high school. Ever since I have gotten to college I have been getting worse at socializing in general, it depends on how confident I am feeling that day. With girls I like, I almost always freeze up and end up never saying anything.)

So that Monday I go to my friends school at lunch break and just talk to him about it. Considering this girl is his girlfriend's friend, he said he can get her to come around more often. And on that Saturday I go over his house again, and without me knowing this girl came over with his girlfriend. So, I was pretty nervous about talking to her because others were around and she was glued to her phone, which is generally a sign they arent interested in what is around. We had a great time playing some fun games,  but after 10 rounds of dirty Scategories the event died down and the girls just left because they bored and tired( which I understand able because they came after their shift at work). But, I didnt really engage with her directly, so I was worried I messed up my chance to get to know her. 

I was just way to nervous and everytime I wanted to talk to her she was buried in her phone, and on top of that I was concerned that my friends girlfriend told her I was interested in her.

After a long week of loathing my lack of action and being kind of depressed about it. That Saturday I end up with my friend at his girlfriend's apartment so we could pre-game and chill before going out to a bar/club. Eventually his girlfriend begins to tease me saying "" Ohhhhhh, I think I should invite ________ over so we can all chill, right RoastBeefyWeefs?"" Of course I said hell yeah. Eventually she arrives and we head to the club. And holy shit did she get all decked out in an amazing outfit and makeup, she was stunning.


This club was packed with college kids, so our crew heads to a corner of the dance floor. We all begin to talk and dance, but it was extremely hot so I was afraid I would sweat to much. Not to mention I never really go to the club, I was kinda nervous in a new setting. So the whole time me and the love interest werent dancing to much and every once in awhile I would see her looking at me out of the corner of my eye. I would look at her and she would look away real quick and vice versa, but I couldn't muster up the courage to dance with her. At one point she moved closer to me but facing away and eventually the girls got too hot and want to leave, so again I fucked up, or so I thought. After five minutes, the girl I like came back with one of her friends and began chilling with my friends and I. I talked to her for a little bit, made some jokes and she laughed at all of them. We all agree to grab some pizza afterwards, and although she didn't want pizza her and her friend waited for us. I thought this was weird  considering they didnt really know me too well and I figured they would rather be with their girl friends. 

As we are walking back to the apartment it was 1:00 AM and everyone seemed pretty tired and cold. We were all talking and shit outside the apartment considering you needed a school ID to access the building. She eventually started talking and was laughing at all of my jokes and occasionally looking at me. They invited us to talk in the lobby and that lasted until 3:30 AM. They went up to their room, and considering other friend and I were sober, we just drove home.

I know this is a lot of back story for nothing, but I figured I would include this to be as detailed as possible. To some this is probably stupid, but I don't know how to act in these situations. I get really nervous and fear rejection so much. I would at least like to be her friend because she seems awesome.

I don't want to over think it, but some of this stuff leads me to believe I might actually have a chance. And I have only ever hung out with her 3 times, so maybe I am being dumb. At the same time, why would my friend and his GF go through all that trouble for me and her to hang out...

Over the past couple of weeks I’ve been thinking about women that’ve literally told or alluded that they want to have to go on a date or have sex with me. Every time I’ll either laugh them off or just not call or text them even though I promised to. 

I feel like a walking paradox. I have a strong desire to be in a physical and emotional relationship with a woman but at the same time thinking about being physically close to someone makes me feel uncomfortable at best and sometimes slightly ill. 

I have no clue why I don’t like being touched or touching people. Sometimes those feelings are stronger and other times they’re nonexistent. The only time that physical contact doesn’t bother me at all is when I’ve been drinking. Alcohol isn’t a long term solution for obvious reasons.

230,"I found out that an aunt of mine on my mother's side died yesterday. We were closer to her when I was younger, but she did some really fucked up shit to my family, my parents thought they were going to have to sue her, etc. Things got really nasty and she kind of just stopped talking to all of us.
The past few years I think amends started to be made, but I don't know. I don't really talk to my mom about it because I think it upsets her (it's her aunt - she has two that she was really close to growing up because they were pretty close in age to her so they're more like sisters. She's still very close with my surviving aunt.) I don't know if my two aunts ever made amends. I asked if I should call my aunt with my condolences and my mom said not to reach out to her right now, so I think the situation is complicated.
I guess what I'm getting at is that I feel really weird about it. I'm sad, but I don't know why I'm sad because I haven't really spoken to her in years except for some occasional happy birthday wishes. I'm sad for my mom and my aunt and my cousins, because I think my cousins were making amends and becoming closer to her again. And I guess part of me is sad because I always kind of assumed I would talk to her again, even if it was just briefly, to catch up.
It's hard to explain to people, I told my friends but the whole situation is complicated so when they told me they were sorry I kind of just brushed it off and said I wasn't that close with her. Which is true, but I'm still upset. And it was easier to say that than to get into the whole situation. I hung out with my boyfriend for a bit after I found out and he did a good job cheering me up but I don't think he really gets it, either. No one can really get it. And my family doesn't talk about emotional shit so we are never going to talk about it. Another part of me kind of feels distant from it. Like the grief I'm feeling is more grief for my other aunt and my cousins and my mom than for my dead aunt herself.
Has anyone gone through anything similar? Sorry for the novel, I just needed to get some thoughts out there.

 But in these months she has gotten a credit card. And she has been spending ridiculous amounts of money on new windows, new bathroom, new lights, holidays etc. Its very clear to me that this money is coming from no where and thats the reason of the credit card.. 

So now I presume she's probably in a lot of debt and whatnot but she has never said anything. Now in the past two weeks or so she has been telling me we are going to be visiting the doctor as she is entitled to this tax credit and needs a letter signed by a GP.. She has also been telling me I need to act extremely disabled and tell the doctor how awful my life is and how dyspraxia ruined my social life etc etc.



Well today was that day. We visited the doctor, she went in alone first so I dont know what she said.. then I was called, I stated truthfully how it impacts me etc, my mother would interrupt and basically answer for me, when the doctor stated she doesnt believe I am impaired enough for this benefit my mother got extremely aggressive and was raising her voice and nearly shouting at the doctor, obviously embarrassing me.

 We left and I got in the car, speechless. She was on the verge of tears and shaking with rage and complained the whole time how I should be entitled to this etc. Etc. (This grant is mainly given to people with disabilities like cerebral palsy etc) 

Is it wrong to feel like she tried to exploit my disability?

240,"Backstory: 20yr old male, currently in my first semester part-time at a CC and working 40+ hours a week full time.

Decided to sit out a year of college, after I first decided to go to university but backed out last second because of the debt I'd be in (good choice on my part). Moved in with a sibling and their partner so I could be closer to the city. Got a steady warehouse job, been there over a year, making $12/hr now and enrolled in CC (finaid paid for 100% tuition) part-time going towards an Assosciates degree in science to make University transfer easier.

I'm only half-way through my first semester, taking 2 courses for now with an A and B grade in those as of now. Balancing work and school life without becoming a hermit is somewhat challenging but I think next semester I could maybe add another course and not go insane (and be able to perform well).

But, I honestly have no idea what I want to do. My 3 things in life I'm passionate for are fishing/outdoors, music, and fitness. I don't see anything going my way in music (not music literate nor musician) and other than being a PE teacher, fitness related fields are pretty few and far in between to make a living on. I don't like the idea of teaching snotty kids in PE class that don't give a rats ass about what I'm saying, either. 

Working for my states Dept. of Fish &amp; Wildlife seemed like a great idea, but most of the career worthy jobs in that field require you to be an excellent swimmer. I can't swim, whatsoever, and have a fear of deep water so I feel like that went out the window for me.

Is it worth it to get a degree in something such as business, heightening my chances for a decent entry level job out of college, even though it's something I'm not very interested in? I know I could become a low-to-mid level manager at my current workplace with those credentials at least.

I could also get a job at a factory, and just live the boring 9-5 lifestyle but make a decent amount of money. $17/hr starting and $20/hr after a year. All of the people I know that have worked there a while make enough money to finance a near-new vehicle, live in a nice part of town, yada yada yada.

241,"How do you deal with arrogant fools who don't take you seriously (thinking you're not ""adult"" or, in other words, thinking you're naive, don't know what you're talking about, and what you say is less significant in addition to HEAVILY underestimating your potential, even when a large percentage of it's shown)?",24Oct2017,3
242,"Not to brag but I think it would be fairly accurate to state that I'm a person of quite above average intellect. I graduated school with a perfect grade score, I will attend med school next year and I'm planning on simultaneously pursuing a PhD in neuroscience while I'm in med school. I'm not exactly ugly and I like my personality for the most part. I'm pathologically overambitious and pretty much obsessed with achieving academic accolades. The problem is that I don't only expect this much from myself but also from the people around me which leads to me thinking of myself as someone better than all those who are not as accomplished as me. Everyday I look at people and think of how much smarter than all these people I am. I have developed an outright disdain for unintelligent people, idiocy aggravates me, so I spend so much time just being angry for this petty reason. These are such ugly traits and I usually don't say these things out loud because of it. How can I get rid of these thoughts and how can I stop being so damn arrogant?",24Oct2017,4
243,"I’m planning to move to Chicago in maybe a year or so. I graduated with a bachelors in psychology and honestly... I haven’t gotten much out of it, I was earning $10/hour and I don’t have enough money to go back to school for a masters.. basically in the psychology field you need a masters. 


I’ve just been stuck as a customer service representative earning $13.50/hr sometimes more, it’s not hard, it’s easy and the people aren’t so bad. I have extensive experience with customer service and I feel like that’s all I’ve known.. I found a job offering $15/hr and I plan to move with my boyfriend who earns $100k a year and we can split the costs and such.

I believe this is happening or happened because she has been acting a bit weird in the last weeks, more distant, and we actually did break up two weeks ago but she kept texting and calling me saying she couldn't imagine herself without me. Besides, we hadn't had any intimate action in 1 month... We are both students so ok we don't have like a place of ours that we can use whenever we want but still, we've had a few opportunities and nothing...

The guy she cheated with was a one time thing, but still, for a few weeks I couldn't even see her yet I came to forgive her because I loved her very much and she seemed very remorseful, although she didn't confessed it at the beginning, I did discover this inciddent she had... She cheated with a friend of hers, and she still hangs out with him, and this drives me completely crazy...

Besides she's an avid user of twitter and she tweets some things to which I can't relate at all, and are intimate things, it seems like she's refering to someone else...

Yet, I don't know if this is just me seeing things or if there really is something happening... and if there is I don't know what I can do, I mean, how can I be sure she's cheating? What do you suggest me to do?",24Oct2017,4

In addition to being a garden-variety, Trump voting moron, she's a big time racist (by way of example she once made a Facebook post comparing Michelle Obama to a monkey).

Basically, I refuse to have anything to do with her and I literally will not even speak to her.

She's well aware of how I feel about her.

This has really been a non-issue up until now, but her (adult) daughter just passed away.

253,"So far i've adopted 3 dogs and 3 cats and i'm open to more once I get these the treatments they need. All 3 dogs are heartworm positive and need to be spay/neutered.

We found one of the cats in a garbage bag on the side of the road, the fur on her tail was ripped off, she had cuts/bruises all over her, she was starving and wouldn't stop meowing for 2 days straight. I paid to take her to the vet and make sure she was ok, she's doing fine now but she needs to be spayed.   

The other two cats were dropped off at my place of employment, they stayed around for a couple of days and my work was going to call animal control to pick them up so I decided to take them home with me. One of them had a respiratory infection though. 

One of the dogs I have was also dropped off at my place of employment, she was pregnant and starving, she's also heart worm positive and needs to be spayed. I took her to the vet and took care of her and the puppies and gave the puppies away but I still have her. 

The other two dogs I found by accident. I was going to a new doctor and accidently took the wrong back road, I went to turn around in one of the side roads (where people drop off junk on the side of road) and there was two dogs there, in the cold, starving and whining. When I got them home I realized one was having severe symptoms, he was coughing a lot, he wouldn't eat, he wouldn't drink, he was breathing heavy, so I took him to the vet and he's heart worm positive and also had a parasite. I paid for the treatment it was around $300 and i've been paying for his preventive and doxycycline (which is $100 for a 30 day dose). He needs to be on that for a year, given every couple of months.

Basically all of the dogs are heartworm positive. So far i've paid for their vet visits, heartworm test and heartworm treatment for one. The kitten in the plastic bag needed fluids, one of the cat's from my work had a respiratory infection I paid for those vet visits as well. I also pay for all of the heartworm/flea/parasite prevention medication every month (it's $150 all together per month). I've spend thousands of dollars though so far and still need so much done for them.

I've been at the same job for around 8 years  but I don't have a lot of money, especially since I live in a part of Louisiana that got flooded last year, my mobile home and car got flooded, the mobile home needed new flooring and electrical and the appliances were also shorted out, so I had and still need to replace some of those things. I also lost my car and don't even have one at the moment. 

I love these pets and they will have a forever home with me, I would also be open to adopting more in the future but it's extremely expensive, especially in the situation i'm in now. 

I also raise my niece, she's 10 years old because her mom (my sister) is a drug addict. She lives with me and helps out with the pets, she loves them just as much as I do. 

So we were wondering could we do some fund raisers to help pay for their treatments? We've got some ideas but I wasn't sure how they work as far the law goes or when it comes to taxes at the end of the year?   

If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it, thank you.

259,"Here we go. So I've been a bit of a depressed mess lately, my depression usually just came in little jolts from time to time but I've been feeling it for a full week now. It's intense and I know why it's not going away.

There's this girl I'm friends with (I'm a guy). We go to college and hang out outside of college together and have pretty much became best friends at this point. You can already guess what the trouble is. I like her. A lot. And she recently broke up with her boyfriend. I was being a little stupid in being like this since half of this and last year (we've been friends for about a year now) we've repeatedly talked about not being into each other. But something as of the past few months have changed that for me.

Now here's the actual dilemma. She pretty much moved on straight away and found a new guy to fuck. This got me really jealous and only heightened the depression. As this has all built up I've been thinking really hard about telling her about all these feelings. 

I want to make it clear, I DONT want a relationship or sex with her. She's one of the only two friends I have in this world and I don't want to change that in the slightest. I want to get this out to her, let her know, so we can continue our friendship. But I don't know if this is a good idea. She has a kinda date with the guy this Friday and I really don't want to ruin that for her or anything. The only reason I'm contemplating this is because someone else was in almost this exact same situation with her before and she was willing to continue the friendship as normal after it, so maybe I should. 

So please, reddit. Tell me, should I tell her? It feels like all these emotions are gonna just be bottled up forever if I don't.

Edit: I know this post was long enough already but I'd like to add that this girl is very open about her sexuality and has sent me the nudes this guy has been sending her and telling me how into him she is and how she's gonna fuck him.

271,"This year I was really struggling finding work and my friend Dottie said she could help me out with a job at her place. She works at a catering company, so anyway, I start and everything’s fine. 

We had a really strange manager who was a bit older than us and would constantly make crude comments and advances towards us all but mostly Dottie. He would give us tips out of the days profits (which was forbidden) and slip Dottie even more. 

He would generally pick on and me treat me differently, letting my friends do ‘bad’ stuff and shouting at me for making small mistakes. 

I became really miserable working there and talked to Dottie who agreed that our manager was a bit much, she spoke to him and things calmed down. 

Anyway in the last few weeks Dottie was accused stealing money from the profits and had to be searched; the other managers wanted to call the police. After her cart partner burst into tears they decided to drop it, later on we discovered the money was counted wrong. 

In the next few days, Dottie leaves early because she had enough of being partnered with the immigrants who worked with company - storming out and leaving halfway through her shift. That day I stayed and worked.

The next week none of us get notification about any shifts, only for us to be told my Dottie that we have all been let go reasons being: I, Charlesrae, was low on money too many times and had reflected badly on my two peers. 

Now keep in mind, we all worked on individual carts and were purposely never paired together because we were friends, so how my performance effected all our jobs completely baffles me.  Also! Dottie had been working there for over a year and was regarded as one of their ‘top sellers’. 

There’s more small details, but am I crazy in thinking that I shouldn’t be taking the responsibility over two individuals adults losing their jobs?

My birthday was recently and Dottie was bothering me all day saying horrible things and refusing to hear me out and completely rejecting my apologies whilst Katherine who’s a lifelong friend quite literally went cold on me. Didn’t wish me a happy birthday or anything - saying she’s not pointing fingers but openly talking to Dottie about the situation, who is then verbally abusing me online (of which I have now blocked her off all social media’s).

272,"Hey there, looking for some life / career advice. This is going to be as detailed as possible as to give the proper context and try to be as honest as I can be about my situation. This is not meant to be a woe-is-me cry for help looking for sympathy, just looking for solid feedback - not overly reactive kneejerk reactions. Bad advice and stupid comments and messages will be downvoted and ignored. I’m not going to be editing the grammar or word choice too heavily, there will be a lot of stream of consciousness writing going on. Lots of boring personal details incoming…. 

I guess I’ll start out with a little about me: I’m a 28 year old dude who is still living with my parents. I graduated from college in 2012 with a 2-yr degree. I had part time job for 4 years that I quit at the end of 2013 due to lack of opportunity for advancement, the location (small town that I grew up in), and not fitting in culture wise, good people – but there were 2 people under the age of 30 around on a consistent basis and I was one of them. I wasn’t really able to relate, and got along as well as I could… But I needed something new.

So I may as well start there. I’ve been unemployed since. I comb over job sites every day at 4:00 pm to assure that most of the postings have come in for the day (indeed, craigslist, zip recruiter, monster, simplyhired; have tried many others as well) and have been for quite some time now. I went through a period where I got really down on myself and my own worth, and it comes back every once and awhile but I’ve really just learned to enjoy my free time over the last several years. I feel lucky to be able to even say that in the first place. Work out every day after I get up in the morning, write things down I want to do during the day, personal chores, etc. 

The thing is, I don’t want to live in this area anymore. It’s a great place to grow up, and get old, but for everyone else it’s a bit stale. The job market here is relatively crappy. Mostly part-time gigs, fast food places, and full-time manufacturing jobs - none of which interest me. I’d like to move to the city, but have no resources to do so. Doing research on being able to earn money online is something I do on and off, doing it again more recently now (online surveys do actually work these days, who knew?). Used to donate plasma at a nearby place but the cost of driving over there and risk of not being able to donate due to elevated heart rate became too much of a problem for it to be worth it anymore. I used to have a specific career path I wanted to go into, and I’d talk to my mom about it but she would never follow through on the support we had spoken about. That leads me into my relationship issues.

There’s a lot of talking between us, just not a whole lot of listening. They’ve both gotten a bit older (61, 65) and process things more slowly, and need to be spoken to even more loudly to now than they did a couple years ago (it also doesn’t help I’m not a super loud dude). It’s hit a tipping point with me recently. My dad is now giving me the silent treatment any time he doesn’t like what he hears from me. It’s starting to remind me of when I was a kid when he would pull this shit all the time. It isn’t because I’ve been some douche, or disrespectful. He just doesn’t know how to respond to what I say, so instead of trying he just doesn’t respond at all and shuts down. That way he gets to feel superior instead of being a socially-challenged old guy, but that’s what he actually is.

My mom will usually just go along with how-ever he acts because she’s grown so dependent on him over the years that she has made the decision it would be easier to do that and deal with his anger problems than to find some other solution. There was a time back in 2012 after she retired that I could see a clear shift towards this attitude. I’ve gotten the sense that she almost worships him in a way with how he acts and his “bad boy” bullshit attitude, like they’re still 20 or something (got married young). 

He has had a hard time with self-control since I was young (used to drink too much but has always been a hothead besides). My older brother was abused by him when I was little. I fairly clearly remember the scene of walking into his room seeing my dad holding my brother up by the neck being pressed into the closet door trying to talk or yell at him for something (my bro was a teenager at the time, me between 4-6). As I walk in, I hear from my mother “(my name), go to the other room” as she watches what they’re doing, until I stayed too long for her liking and she took me out. 

Now, my older brother has always had problems exaggerating things, but some of the things he’s told me even balanced out just don’t feel right. Apparently he used to get “the shit beat out of him” (as he put it) in front of our family “jokingly” by my dad quite a few times during parties or gatherings back in the day. I have pressed him for details before but that’s about all I’ve ever gotten. Doesn’t seem like much of a joke to me. He doesn’t really like to talk about it I’m sure, and we don’t have a great relationship ourselves (not great, but not bad – but I won’t go into that). He always used to say that one of our uncles would tell him that “I’m gonna come get you one of these days” All the while actually saying very little if anything to my father, and continuing to let things happen. Most of, if not all of the rest of my family did nothing. 

Fortunately I didn’t have to deal with the physical stuff like he did. My dad DID quit that, at least (and drinking too). Since about 16 he has tried to kick me out of the house several times (not legal until 18 here) and successfully did so when I was 25, though that was partly me leaving too just from being so beaten down mentally dealing with them. Years I held a lot resentment up until about 26 or so, just got tired of being angry all the time. Up until recently I hadn’t been reminded as much why I resented him in the first place. 

It’s just become clear things aren’t going to change for the 14th time. They’re comfortable being miserable and I’m going nowhere with them around. I still love them, but eventually something needs to happen. I don’t want to live here anymore…. Want to move to a bigger city, the capital city of my state, or the west coast (WA, or CA) preferably. I have very little money, an older car, and the friends I had when I was younger have moved on. 

This was hard to write…. A lot of it made me feel very tense and made it harder for me to breathe. Even though I know they weren’t watching here while I was writing, some paranoia too. As far as positives it was definitely cathartic to be able to it all down.

I’ve never told anyone this level of detail into everything.
So after some backstory, aside from the obvious get out of there, get a job, etc. what would you guys do? How do I go about making the decision? Anything insightful works.
That’s enough whining for about a year.

Next day at work they had me stand and walk around all day.  Just no ""twisting"" because no one understand what was going on.

Since then I've been mainly sitting, but the stool I sit in and task I am usually working on is causing severe back and neck pain so I stand at times to try and relieve that.  

I ""have"" to walk, bend, turn, twist, etc at times to move items (all light weight) throughout the warehouse even though I am on ""light duty"" and sitting because it's impossible not to.  

I've done 8-9 sessions of PT and some stuff at home, but nothing is really helping.  Sitting down right now and the medial side of my knee hurts all over.  It's been over 3 weeks and there is no improvement.

It's bad enough that I can't quit my job or even look for another one because standing all day anywhere is not currently an option and without my degree I am having minimal luck getting something where I wouldn't have to do that.

TLDR : I was injured at work when an improperly secured comfort pad slipped underneath me and now have what is most likely an MCL sprain that isn't healing because I am constantly tweaking the injury with minimal movement at work.  Or it could be something worse than an MCL sprain.  Company is of no help.

I'm asking for advice because I'm in a health professions doctorate program, and the people calling/ texting is incessant! I don't want to change my number just yet, because it's linked to so many school related things where I have to be accessible at a moments notice.

Here is what I've tried:
CONTACTING THE OWNERS: One of them responded, said he doesn't know but he'll see what he can do. That was 2 months ago and so far nothing.

TELLING THE SEARCH ENGINE THE NUMBER IS WRONG: The search engine accepted the change in #, then reverted back to my #.

LEAVING A REVIEW ON THEIR WEBSITE/SOCIAL MEDIA: Since some reviews are automatically sorted based off Positive/Negative or Recent/Old, I can't be sure that people are seeing my post about them being closed.

note: I found the owners contact info by searching the webmaster info where I found the registrant info, but I'm not a computer person and I'm not sure if I'm reading it correctly.

289,"I recently reconnected with an old crush of mine after not seeing each other for nearly 3 years and I asked if she would be up for going out to get dessert, which she agreed to. It wasn't a date per say, but I was testing the water. She showed all the signs of somebody who was interested in something more, even admitting to dressing up to see me that evening and complementing me on how I looked. After we had our desserts, which we had shared with one another, she brought me to a nearby swing set and told me that anytime she went on a date with a guy she'd ask if there was a swing set nearby because she loves them. We then went back to her place, which is where everything began to fall apart because she brought up how she was seeing this other guy and how it might get serious once he gets back, I was stumped to say the least. I went home that night and couldn't stop thinking about had happened. I decided I would talk to her about it and my feelings, but she played it off as if she was just excited to see me and said that had I asked her out sooner, then maybe we could of gone on a date, but that it was too late by the time we had seen each other. Fast forward a couple weeks, I contact her again tell her that I couldn't accept being just friends, that my feelings for her will get in the way and that I would regrettably have to distance myself, but that if ever wanted to give dating a chance, to let me know. That's when she told me that she definitely saw us as a couple, that it was unfortunate things didn't work out.

After about half a week, she informs me that things between her and this other guy didn't work out, but then seemingly began to ignore my messages. I waited a week before contacting her again and asked what was going through her mind, she told me she just wasn't sure what she wanted anymore and said that she thinks she wants commitment, which is when I responded saying I don't have any problems with commitment, but that I obviously can't commit to somebody who doesn't know what it is they want and that I'm not dating. I then followed it up with asking her on a date, which she saw and never responded. We spoke briefly yesterday, which was about 3 days after I asked her out, but she was still unsure of what she wants. I'm kind of at a loss, I like this girl, but my attraction is dwindling and the worst part is that we've been friends for 9 years, which is why I'm so restless about the situation. I obviously value our history and would rather not lose it.

I always kept changing the story and changing the details to the point where my friends got fed up with me always changing and restarting the story so they gave up on it. I had one friend who didn't give up on me, but I ended up letting him down too. But he still never gave up on me. 

I was always so indecisive and so wishy washy. One week I'd feel one way about something then the next, I would have a completely different opinion. It was always my friend who pointed it out to me. It was like everything I believed in could change in just a moment, I could just suddenly shift gears and start doing/believing something else. Years later it's still going on and It's even worse, because I always forget something I said previously and then say something and get called out on it.

292,"I'm in a bit of a difficult situation.

After 3 years at my current company I decided to look for a new job. And the reason is mostly about money. I would say I'm pretty underpaid for the amount of work I do.
I even asked my boss for a raise but he said the company can't afford it. After that meeting, he started sensing I wanted to leave my job, and a few weeks ago he asked me if I was in the job market, and if that was the case, he would introduce me to a few people that can help me in the job search.
I told him I'm open to new opportunities. I had an interview about 3 weeks ago, and I was honest to my boss about it. Unfortunately I didn't get that job.

2 weeks ago my boss met with me again but this time he said something like ""if you feel like you're not 100% on board, I can give you time off to look for a new job and in the meantime I can start looking for a replacement"". I obviously wouldn't want him to start looking for someone else until I find a new job, so I lied and told him I'm not actively looking anymore.

Last week I had a recruiter for a big firm call me and this seems like a great opportunity. They scheduled to fly me to their office (in a different city) for a day long interview this Friday.
I haven't told my boss about it. I was just planning on using a sick day.
However, today right before I was leaving the office, I made a comment on how there's gonna be some road work by our office on Friday. He responded ""Well I thought you weren't coming in this Friday"" and started laughing. I took it as a joke and kept walking out.

I have no idea how he would know about my interview. I only told a coworker of mine, but she's a good friend (even outside work) and we trust each other...so I know she didn't say anything.
I also doubt the recruiter had any contact with my current employer.

295,"Hello, Reddit.

I've been struggling with a family/career/anxiety issue that I hope to get an outside perspective on.

Nearly my entire life I've worked for a small consulting firm for my father.  The work was exciting at first (age 15) but has grown unbearable for me over past several years.  To give an idea of the place this is a small company with just my father and I, all the correspondence is through email, and the office never has visitors.  It's become a place of isolation and frustration for me as far back as I can remember and I feel stuck in it.  

I've worked at the company through college as well.  I would commute to school and drive straight to the office leaving little time for any meaningful social interaction.  This just became routine for me and I grew used to it.  

The crossroad that I'm facing now is that if I don't make a drastic change now then I fear that I never will and will be doomed to repeat the same cycles that leave me feeling alienated, helpless, and without purpose. 

I could really use any sort of advice that would help shake me out of this funk and get me started in the right direction.  There are plenty more details that factor in but I'm hoping to keep this as short as I can and hopefully reach someone that can help.

302,"I'm frustrated and typing on a phone, so sorry if this is nonsensical.

My whole life I've been expected by everyone to live upto certain expectations. Unfortunately I was raised in a echo chamber of a home, which led me to have social anxiety (never schooled etc..) I never open my mouth in social situations, because of the fear of saying something stupid (I tend to think about the smallest things I say for years) this leads me to have depression. Which basically leaves me with no drive to do anything. Everyone calls me useless as the result of this. This combined with my self image issues leaves me with severe self confidence problems. It doesn't help that I just went bald, have a stammer and am only 18.

I asked a girl out I had a crush on for years, 3 months ago. Everyone said ""go on ask her there's no way she'll say no she's dying to go out with you!"" She laughed it off... And made me feel 10.

I tried passing my driving test (very important to me and my family) but suck because of my nerve and self doubt problems. I had 70+ lessons and made little progress.

I tried a hospitality and bartending course. felt completely out of place the entire time. Got little benefit for completing it. Realised I hated the work.

303,"So, I work(ed) in the office of a small manufacturing company for about 1 and a half years. Without going into extreme detail, today one of the owners asked me to explain something regarding data entry to a girl that was recently hired a few months ago. I didn't really want to do this because every interaction I have with her makes me feel very uncomfortable. It's hard to explain but she just has a very rude personality, at least towards me. I ask her to open an application so I can show her what I'm supposed to show her and she just sorta stares at me like I'm the biggest asshole in the world. I just quickly explain what I was asked to and go work on something outside the office.

When I come back, the office manager calls everyone in the office over. She starts directly scolding me, telling me I was new here once and that I shouldn't attack new people for making mistakes since they're still learning the system. I didn't really know what to do besides grab my things and leave.

This might seem like an overreaction, but the office manager couldn't even show me the respect of talking to me 1 on 1 instead of involving the whole office in some sort of strange display of public shaming. Plus, the discussion wasn't even about putting in bad data, so the new girl went to the office manager and lied about the whole interaction while I was out of the office. Third, stuff like that makes me incredibly uncomfortable in the first place. I had to stop on the way home to throw up.

So, I was never truly happy with my job, but I still admit it was better than any job I've had before. There's a lot of incompetence, a lot of being blamed for other peoples' mistakes, a lot of high school-level drama, but sitting at a computer typing in data beats working retail any day.

I'm not really sure where to go from here. I can take some other job where I'll be even unhappier and pays even less (I was making about 12.30 an hour and there's practically no benefits), or I could do... something else. I'm not sure what that something else is so I guess that's why I'm here.

I'm almost 30 and I don't know how to get out of the loop of working crappy dead-end jobs. Unfortunately I squandered my younger years; I had poor guidance and a lack of ambition. I had no idea what I wanted to do as a career and honestly to this day I still don't.

Part of the problem is where I live, it's a real dead-end rural area with no good jobs. I'm absolutely willing to move anywhere in the country, but I don't know how to find a job outside of where I live. I have no degree, no great experience in anything, what incentive is there for someone out-of-state to hire me? Do I just take the plunge and move somewhere and gamble whether I ""make it"" or end up homeless?

I could try community college again. I tried this a few years ago, got all As my first semester, my second semester I had serious money issues, couldn't make enough money to swing rent and food and stuff, basically gave up eating and I got so sick I couldn't even attend class anymore. The school wasn't very helpful or accommodating; the professors I emailed about rescheduling tests just ignored me. So if I went this direction I have to figure out how to solve the money issue, and I'll also have to move somewhere else due to my bad experience with the local community college. I've always wanted a better education, I just don't see a feasible way to swing it.

Luckily I'm moderately frugal and was able to save a couple thousand dollars, so I'm not completely screwed, but I'm not exactly feeling great about things either.

307,"I am currently a male sophomore in high school. Last week, I realized that my chemistry grade was slouching (screw-up #1) primarily due to the fact that I was sitting next to my friends. So I went ahead and told them that it was nothing personal that I am moving seats to the back of the classroom where only 1 other friend of mine and a girl sit (screw-up #2). Now, this girl has a reputation for being a sort of ""snobby white girl"" or... (can't say it), but I decided to just chill and try to not talk to her.
So, class starts yesterday and I am bored because the teacher is talking about older stuff that we are not studying anymore so I tap my pencil on the table a few times. Since the girl is all ""smart"" and chooses to focus literally EVERYTHING on classwork, she calls me an annoying idiot. I am a sensitive person and most people in the grade know this. I also have ADHD so I might not seem like that smart of a person until you get to know me better.
The dialogue yesterday went something like this: *taps pencil* ""Wow, (to my friend to the right of her) he is an annoying idiot, I'm so glad I get to sit with you but not him""-no response from me, only a ""**** you"" in which she says back ""you wish""
So that happened yesterday. Today she comes into class and kind of jokingly expresses that she wants me to settle down a bit during class, like that flirty ""Shush"" with her fingers out and closed. So I don't really say anything until she somehow started to say to my friend at the previous table I was sitting at that he was a smart and capable person, unlike me. She explains even before class starts that I need to shut up because I am breaking her focus, in which I yell at her saying ""I WON'T TALK WHEN THE TEACHER HAS STARTED CLASS, DEAL!?"" Shortly after she explains to me after I had said something to my friend sitting at our table mid-class that I need to shut up and that she has an A in chemistry and I have a B-, which is kind of funny because the reason that I moved back there was to improve my grades. Now, I spend the entire class thinking of ways to get back at her, and holding back tears, as opposed to me focusing on the teacher's notes. So now it is even worse than before at the other table.

She smelled it and confirmed there was no alcohol. She also didn't smell any alcohol on us. 


When K comes back, he interrogates some of us. Clearly, he is on the drum majors side (that we were drinking at the competition). He's so biased and he's personally attacking the people he questions.

I’m away from the house for at least a couple hours and sometimes my phone starts to die, (which is how my mom checks on me to make sure I’m okay), I get thirsty, (there’s only one gas station in my town and I usually don’t have any money on me anyway), and sometimes it rains while I’m a couple miles away from my house. So I’ve thought about bringing a backpack with me to put a portable charger, water, and a jacket and umbrella. I always carry my phone and pocket knife with me. And my jacket if I think I’m not going to get too hot from walking because I don’t like holding it. 

If you’re going to be walking around your town without stopping in at your house for awhile, what would/do you bring with you? What are your necessities and recommendations? It’s kind of a silly question, but I’m just getting into this whole walking thing so I’d like to experiment and see what helps me out. :) ",24Oct2017,3
321,"Sorry for the awkward title, I'm not on here very much and couldn't really think of an eloquent way to phrase it.

Anyways, here's the background. I'm a guy in my mid-20's and have been in a long term relationship since high school. My girlfriend and I get along very well and our relationship is a good place. We have our ups and downs but we communicate pretty well. Our interests have diverged somewhat over the years but we still have plenty in common. We've had a lot of great times together and moved across the country together, and some of my best memories are with her.

Recently I've made a new friend, who also happens to be female. I'm usually pretty good about having platonic friends of the opposite gender without being weird about it, and I've been 100% faithful to my girlfriend in the almost decade we've been together.

This friend though, is a bit different. She's like a female version of me. Not in a creepy way though, I mean just in our interests. She's super into cars just like I am. And I don't just mean at a surface level, I mean she's comfortable with taking apart engines, fabricating parts, going to junkyards to find parts, etc. The other day we helped a mutual friend work on his car, and we had a blast. She offered to help me paint my sports car, since it has some panels that don't match very well— apparently she knows how to do automotive body work as well.

She's also really smart and is in school to become a surgeon, so we can talk about various bits of medical trivia as well (I've always had an interest in that stuff, but was never book smart enough to do med school). To top it off, she's also a really good photographer and knows how to wield a gun well (we live in the southwest). Her personality is so energetic and she's quite confident, along with being kinda gorgeous. I've never seen a girl look so good covered in motor oil and dirt. And she's single...

I'm fine with just being friends, but it's kinda eating away at me. I get excited to get texts from her and hanging out with her is amazing. Every time I see a post from her on social media I get excited. I keep thinking how convenient it would be if I had a girlfriend that I could do all my hobbies with, as opposed to leaving my current girlfriend on her own whenever I do my thing (my current girlfriend isn't really interested in cars).

Now I'm old enough to know what an infatuation is, and that those can be fleeting, but that doesn't stop me from feeling weird on the inside. I feel wrong for thinking about this, but I would never actually cross the line into doing anything out of bounds since I respect my girlfriend and our relationship. At the same time, my girlfriend hasn't exactly been 100% faithful in the past, but I know that two wrongs don't make a right. My girlfriend loves me wholeheartedly and unconditionally, and pretty much lives to be with me, so I couldn't bear to hurt her in any way.

So what do I do? I can't really avoid the female friend in question, as she's a mutual friend of some of my other guy friends so she's always around when we hang out. I usually don't care about other girls this much so this is really weird for me.",24Oct2017,0
322,"I'm currently a junior and started out college planning on going to medical school. After receiving a few C's in my bio classes and in organic chemistry I decided that medical school isn't for me. I am  starting to really hate college and I want it to be over as soon as possible. Since the realization that I can't get into medical school I have found it harder to stay motivated and have been skipping class and getting lower and lower grades. I fear I am not going to be able to graduate at this rate. So I guess I need on advice on how to stay motivated when you don't know what you're going to do with your degree after college or if I should even stay in college. Also a side note, I have a full scholarship as long as I work for the state for 5 years after college in a job using my biology major. ",24Oct2017,6
323,"I'm a college student and during a test today I was on my phone texting, it was stupid. Anyways my teacher caught me and pulled me out of class and I told her it was me texting and being stupid and that she should just give me a 0. She said she believed me after telling me to look her in the eyes but I feel petty. I got to turn in the test but now I feel like I'm gonna be looked at differently. 

It was embarrassing as I had to walk through the class outside with her. How should I go about next class, I feel it will be awkward seeing as she might hold it against me for possibly cheating. ",24Oct2017,2
324,"So basically I'm one of those people who sees a girl I'd like to know better, and A, keep walking, B, try to make eye contact (quite awkward), or, if we have a class, C, instantly panic in my head and lose all sense of social competency.

I was in one relationship before, but she kind of drove most of the hey-do-you-want-to-be-a-thing thing, I just asked her out (a result of being way too tired at the time for my senses to kick in and zero boundaries because of that).  Life was awesome.  But it ended over a year ago.  And since then, I've started to feel really quite lonely.

Part of me wanted to hold off on finding someone else right away because I was kind of mourning the last relationship, and also wanted to do some self-reflection and the whole ""who am I"" thing.  But now that I'm past that, I'm starting to feel kind of lonely, and feel like I'm starting to sink a bit into depression.

For data's sake, I will mention that people say I'm fairly attractive.  I get some looks from girls, and they tend to be pretty nice towards me (I've even been called cute once *gasp*).  But have absolutely no idea how to respond without panicking in my head.  I feel like I've missed a lot of opportunities because of this.  Like I just want to go straight from single and lonely to watching the Pride and Prejudice miniseries on a couch and cuddling (I know, I'm weird) without going through the whole ""do you like me"" thing.

I think a lot of it is that I'm really afraid of coming off as creepy or something.  Or, if it's a friend, I don't want to risk the friendship and all the awkwardness that comes with that.  I'm usually really quiet in person, especially if there's a girl around.  I've purposely veered a lot of potential relationships into friendships only (still, great friendships).  I'm getting kind of sick of it.  I need advice on how to get myself around this whole mental wall I've built for myself.

Any help would be appreciated.",24Oct2017,12
327,"Hello there,

I finally got a job and very happy. It is a programme assistant job. I will be starting my first day on Thursday, so excited.

What should I do on my first day? I do not want to be very pushy and I also would like to prepare myself. I will be dealing a lot with office assistance, such as phone calls, data entry, and so on. What I am trying to say is that I would like to engage myself from the first day and make a good impression in front of a manager and a supervisor and not to look like a person that does not care much about things and/or in other words be like a dumb @@@. Is there any advice and suggestions you could give me then that would be great! Thank you.",24Oct2017,1
328,"Hello, I have been having these chest pains for a month or two now, they are sharp stabbing pains located on the mid left hand side of my chest, sometimes the pains move closer to the centre and sometimes lower down near my lower left ribs.  They just happen randomly under any condition and any time of day, also I don't know if this is related but when I have a cold drink I can feel the liquid travel in the same areas I get the pain.  Any thoughts? Thank you in advance. ",24Oct2017,1
329,"Hi simple question, I tried searching it up but it's kind of hard to word. So what can I do to somehow anonymously have my mom see a website without her knowing I sent it or put it on her computer or anything that hints out that I was the one who caused her to see it. I want her to read something, but being the narcissistic parent they are, she will blow up on me if I showed it to her myself.

Thank you
