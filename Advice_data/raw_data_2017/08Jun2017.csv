2,So I was wondering what I should do concerning my friend of 10 years. Her and I are really close but I asked her once before and she said she didn't want to date me because it might end up badly and we wouldn't be friends anymore. Today I was hanging out with her and another friend and we always play flirt with each other. Well today I put my hand on her leg and she didn't pull away and then she draped her leg over me and came closer. After that we watched a movie and I laid my head on her lap with a pillow and she took the pillow and made me lay on her legs. She also laid her arm across me. I am very confused as to these mixed signals. I need help.       ,08Jun2017,3
3,"I'm a 24 year old  male - I'm single, but close with  a lot of friends and family in Boston. I was just offered a very generous job offer to head marketing for a business in rural PA. But they want me to work there 3 days out of the week, every week.. 

Should I accept the job? Is it practical?

I'm worried that I'll get burnt out real fast by commuting down to PA every week, and will feel disconnected from my family/friends up here in Boston. Even though I'll be here on weekends I'm worried my mind will be in PA and I'll feel like I'm living a double life.. ",08Jun2017,1
4,"I'm not seeking their forgiveness. I don't need them to like me anymore. I just want to do what's right. We did both consent to it and we took the risk together, but I suggested the risk and I don't want her parents to blame her for any of this.

I was thinking about doing it at the dinner table with her traditional father, mother, and brother. ",08Jun2017,1
5,"Hey guys! I'm seventeen and I have been living away from my parents for about half a year. In my teenage years, my parents almost never took me to the doctor because they were unemployed and disliked using government aid. In addition, my parents taught me very few social skills because they were introverts and homeschooled me. There are some things I would like to go to the doctor for, but I have no idea how to do it.

So here's my basic questions:

I live in the same town that my parents do. Should I go to the same doctor that they took me to?  
I'm currently part of my parent's Idaho Medicaid plan. How does that work exactly? Are there only specific doctors that will work with Medicaid?  
How do I set up an appointment with the doctor?  
How do I choose/find a good doctor?  
Once I get there, how should I act?  ",08Jun2017,4

7,"I just finished my 2nd year of community college and am going on to take a 3rd year there to finish my pre med and major prerequisites. This coming fall I am taking Ochem and Zoo and the following Spring I will be taking Ochem 2 and Physics 2 to finish my pre reqs (as well as other psych courses and gen ed stuff). I then looked at the classes I needed to take at UC Davis transferring as a ‘junior’ and found that the required classes to get the B.S. psych degree is only 12 classes or about 50 units, so it seems that transferring from a semester system to a quarter system with 3 academic quarters I can finish those 12 classes in 1 year at Davis, taking 4 classes a quarter, rather than 2 years, which I thought I was going to have to do. So I am thinking about taking the MCAT this summer right after I finish my 3rd year at the community college, after finishing physics 2 and ochem 2, and then applying to medical schools in December of that year. I also plan on volunteering at a hospice and putting a lot of hours into that, as well as start studying for the MCAT now so I can hopefully rock it next summer. I am mostly banking on getting a high MCAT score and gaining meaningful patient experience at the hospice to make up for me spending most of my academic years in a community college (NVC), does that even matter anymore since everyone is taking the same standardized MCAT exam, so if I get a high score on that and maintain a good GPA will I be a competitive candidate? Currently my GPA is 3.7 and I wasn’t as disciplined as I am now, so I plan on getting that up, and I also have been doing jiu jitsu for a while now as an extracurricular. I don’t mind going to a D.O. as well. Any helpful advice or insightful criticism (even other possible career paths) would be appreciated, all this uncertainty in life right now is stressful but very meaningful and exciting. Thank you!",08Jun2017,1
9,"My school is a public middle school in a ghetto of sorts. There's very little funding for it. 

The school is very, very hard to access if you're in a wheelchair, for one. The only good ramp is in the front of the main building. Unfortunately, the school is spread over two buildings, interconnected by a shoddy sideway, and there are no ramps beyond that one. Several doors open up to that sidewalk, but none of them have usable ramps. Some have ""ramps"" that are lumps of asphalt that have a huge lip between the pavement. This makes it hard for people to get their chair onto the ramps in the first place. The school also has ""classrooms"" in old trailers. These classrooms are the only place that certain classes can be held, such as the foreign language classes. The trailers have no ramps, either. Quite a few of them have rotten stairs, and I've seen the stairs break with someone using them before.

When I brought this up to a teacher who wanted to be an admin, she told me that the school doesn't have enough funding for ramps. I asked her why we don't have funding to fix the stairs and install ramps, but we have funds to buy flat-screen TVs, to which she told me that I needed to consider the greater good and that very, very few people were disabled anyways.

One day, I came into the school counselor's office. I was incredibly upset. I'd been bullied for a while and all of the frustration had finally come to a head. Once I finally calmed down through my sobbing and was finally able to tell her, I was told to ""just ignore them."" Even though people had threatened to beat me, called me racial slurs, and so on, and I told her this, I was the one that had to get over this.

What do you think I should do about this? ",08Jun2017,3
10,"I was on my lunch break and I pulled into the drive through at McDonald's and while I'm waiting in line a big silver SUV pulls up and the driver leans out and knocks on my window, shows me a badge that looks like a star with a ring around it, and asks me to pull out into the parking lot next door.
I pull into there expecting to be ticketed for some stupid shit and the guy comes to my window and asks me if I'm a manager or an assistant manager, and if I know this girl that works up front, he shows me a picture on his phone of a bathroom selfie of this girl that works up front.

He quickly puts in she's not in trouble but her boyfriend is wanted for murder and they want to talk to her.  So they want me to go in and see if she is at work and call them if she is.  The guy has me dial his number and call him so he has mine and I have his number.  

So I agree to all that, get my lunch and head inside the store to eat, I didn't see her and I text the guy saying as much.

Something about this is rubbing me the wrong way, why didn't they just go in and look?  Why have me do it? And why make a point of telling me to keep it on the down low? 

I work in a rough part of town and see lots of cops. And we have armed security at the door, so another guy with a gun on his hip wouldn't have freaked anyone out.

I'm not even 100 percent sure the guy was who he said he was I got flashed a badge for like 3 seconds. 

Am I paranoid or just naive about whatever is going on?",08Jun2017,1
11,"Long story short: almost 8 years dating, very much in love,yada yada yada, but really stressed about the financial part.
I am a 28[F] making about 11k a year (I'm not from the US, that salary puts me in low middle class, w/o kids). 
So the thing is this, bf is about to graduate as a civil engineer, he plans to do his masters, which stresses me because he hasn't done any engineering work and he's 28. So from my point of view studying a masters in that same field is pointless if you aren't going to work on that field. 
He started a school cafeteria business, which he owns 10%, so he should receive 10% of profits. At the beginning it went great, he made almost my monthly salary w/o having to be there 40 hours a week. They are going to start a new cafeteria in august, same deal 10%, we are getting married in october. 
But right now, the cafeteria isn't making money, it went from making about 800 monthly to about 200. It stresses me that this is going to be it for the next years. If the other cafeteria is the same it's only 400 monthly for both. 
This stresses me so much I've thought about cancelling the wedding, mostly because he won't even take a part time job and insists on this businesses, I want to trust him but every time it is the same: He tells me he's going to make X amount of money and it ends being Y amount of money way below the X amount. He told me I could count with 2700 for the wedding, turns out he's 'struggling' to get 1k (struggling with quotations because he keeps buying unnecessary things like cigarettes).
 I'm saving all the money I can right now by cutting all unnecessary expenses because it seems that if we get married nearly all financial responsibilities will fall on me and my savings, (he has no savings). 

I'm so scared of cancelling or postponing the wedding because all the money my parents already have paid. And personally I don't want to because I DO want to be married to him. He says I need to have more patience but the first cafe has been running for almost a year and it doesn't seem to make any progress. 

Right now I'm just counting every single penny but I can't even think about a honeymoon because all I can think of is that we may need that money after. Even sex freaks me out because the thought of having a kid in this situation scares me. Also I don't think we would be able to buy a home or something if this is how it is going to be.

What should I do? I've already talked to him about this and he insists I have to be more patient. I don't want to be so stressed about money all my life. I'm on a dead-end job and this is the highest salary I've been able to get.   

TL;DR:
Boyfriend seems to take things too slow with his businesses and I'm scared that it would be like that forever placing all financial responsibility on me, thus making it impossible to have a family, a home, in the future.

14,"I am 27 and my brother was 20 when he committed suicide. He was just minding his own business, when this girl came up and introduced him and asked him out to dinner, she was 16, so he said sure. They went to dinner, movies, ice skating, bowling, camping, ..etc and the entire time, complete strangers gave him dirty looks, people started harassing him, telling him to break up with her, and that he should be beaten up, and in prison, or murdered.

He ended up breaking up with her, to end the abuse, but it only got worse, people kept calling his house and texting him to kill himself and calling him a pedophile. a rapist, a baby rapist, a child molester.

As per usual, the ups guy dropped the package in front of my door, my brother took it in. Dad was curious on the content, so he asked my brother to open it.

I'm 18 years old(19 on july), i live in spain(in Huelva,Andalusia)
My family lives in a small town, my parents divorced in 2011, they both live in the town, but that's not important now.
I study an engineer degree for first year, i were the typical freak guy back in my town, and i had my group of friends, but now i'm living in a bigger city(out of my town), without my family,sharing my apartment with a boy from my degree,which is now very important in my life,as i share with him the whole day(same schedule at uni, same house,same friends...), but i'm not pretty happy on my degree, since i discovered in the city the real life,as i call it(i've started to have party,tried alcohol,have fun in the society,to sum up)
In my family,finances aren't as well as one would like, my uni+ house rent+money i need to survive is around 300-350 euros, in home my mother,grandfather and a sister survive with 1500€ in total, which every month are wasted on debts.
The point is, i'm really happy with my roomate,friends and all that stuff,like i've never been ever, but not on the degree,also i want to get a partial job so i can pay the uni, but i'm scared, because that would mean i'll be on morning at class,and evening working,leaving the hours of 22:00-1:00 to study
Nowadays i'm just throwing away hours on internet due to my lack of interest on my degree, and maybe the work and the schedule would fix that(and a change on the degree,aswell)
Would you guys try to put effort on the current situation?( study hard my current degree, denying the possible jobs) or would go with it?change my degree, get a job,etc, i suppose my family wouldn't like that, since they want to have me under their belt(talking about my mum) and would be a little ""earthquake"" on my family.
I feel now i'm throwing an oportunity away(exams are starting in 10 days) on my degree,but i can't find motivation to study, and that's why i want to change my degree,but i've been stupid,lying the whole year to my family about that,telling them i study a lot and i love my degree,so there's the problem i have to give the step.
Can i get some advice on my life,reddit?

36,"Some context: My friend and I have known each other for some 10+ years. We absolutely love each other and try to support one another through every difficult time, and in October we got an apartment together, a major step - he escaped from his horrible family, I escaped from a barely-standing house. It's mostly been a blessing, but since then I've been having trouble coming to terms with one thing in particular: his anger.

He's always been an angry sort but it never occurred to me how deep it went until I lived with him. My family doesn't really get angry, or when we do we cool off quickly, but he holds on to things for days and days. Everything I try to say or do falls flat, and all my coping mechanisms are either failing him or not being attempted.

I've come to terms with the fact that I can't help him, but just being in an apartment with that kind of energy makes me hate being home, and you don't need to tell me that's not healthy. He knows he has anger problems, he's gone to therapy. He stopped because he felt like he had enough coping mechanisms, but I feel like when you come home miserable six days out of the week you're not better. You're functional.

Now, I'll be the first to admit that I have my bad habits, and I've been putting off therapy for years (this time my excuse is a constantly changing paycheck that never stops being too small) but if I can't convince him to figure this out, I can't keep living like this.

Okay, so last year I started college and met some people who were nice and we hit off a decent friendship. Shared good interests and were generally open to each other. In the fall we signed a lease on an apartment for this year through August. (for context there are 4 of us, including me)     
   
I don't feel like going into the details of how or why they started acting kinda douchey, rather I'll just share some of the crap they do. E.g. I joined a group chat that had all of us in just for easier communication. A week later I learned they made a ""secret"" group chat with everyone in it but me. Whenever I am present they are always silent and stare at their phones or w/e they are doing, never engage in conversation more than replying to me saying ""Hello!"". It feels like the can only see negative aspects about my personality and think that defines me wholly. They also actively exclude me from activities and try to keep secrets. It doesn't help how bad these people are at keeping secrets.... At this point its best to move on with my life and meet a better and more supportive group of friends. Luckily the second one is fairly set in stone and with work over this summer I can hopefully establish stronger and more secure friendships. Problem being times kinda out for subleasing my room and theres no point of living somewhere else. Just need to get through summer until I move out to a better time.

I'm trying limiting myself and deleting all apps i spend too much time on (minus Snapchat). Anyway if I end up not being able to benefit from limiting myself I would like to get of my iPhone all together. If it comes to this, is there a more basic phone that has GPS and group text (with iPhone users) capabilities?

47,"Okay so for context I am quite a naturally skinny person, around 5'6 and 115 lbs. This is something people have always acknowledged in me and pointed out.
It isn't something I'm arrogant about - hell, there's a ton of things about my body I'm very insecure about, and I often really envy girls who have more shapely figures. 

Anyway; today in a discussion with a friend, the subject of size/weight came up. My friend started to get really defensive about me being skinny. She kept saying stuff like ""you're not even that skinny. my friend's skinnier than you. you're not that much skinnier than me"". For some more context, she's a larger girl. She wouldn't drop it, and kept insisting to me that I'm not skinny. When I told my other friends about it they thought it was really weird too. 

She's also done this before, but with me ""looking younger than my age"". I'm 21 but because I dress youthfully and don't wear make up, people tend to think I'm around 16/17. The same friend gets really defensive whenever this is mentioned, and starts saying stuff like ""you do look your age. people always think I'M younger than i am. you don't even look that young"". 

Why do you think she might do this? And what can I say to her when these conversations arise? I don't want to fall out with her over it. Up until now I have held my tongue every time she does it and shrugged it off, but honestly it's starting to get really annoying.

48,"A friend of mine has been dating this guy for six months. The first few months he was active and happy. Then all of a sudden he became withdrawn and secretive. He is no longer happy. He doesn't speak to anyone. All he does is sleep. Even when it's really hot he will wear long sleeve shirts. She has to do everything for him; it's like he has become a vegetable. He has become blue and bloated. He doesn't seem to do anything by himself except get to the bathroom. When he's in the bathroom he's in there for like 30 mins at a time. 

She found a cigarette lighter in the bathroom (neither one smokes and nobody else has been in their house). He also keeps scratching his face and arms. When he eats he is always dropping the food utensil because he shakes so bad. They haven't had sex in 4 months and he pretty much ignores her.

53,"  Hi guys, recently I've experienced something that might not be unique, but I'll get to the question at the end of my backstory.

  So in my freshman year of high school, I had this one girl I really liked (let's call her Girl for the sake of the story); she is a grade above me. I got to know her more by talking to her, and at one point we both noticed that we had feelings for each other, which got me really hyped. My freshman naivete led me to believe that we would become a great couple, mainly because I think long-term and am serious when it comes to things like this. I was wrong.
  For two months, it was a cycle of ups and downs. I would always show affection for her, but she kept on rejecting it, being cold often. I told her I couldn't do this anymore.
  I asked her why she was like this, and she said age. I was 15 at the time when she was 17 (reminder: she's still a sophomore at this point).
  I despised her for playing and toying me like this, but this all changed when I started to talk to her again this sophomore year.
  I was just going to resume as if we were just friends, but I guess there were some lingering feelings that came back to life. After a month of texting, talking to each other, Snapchatting, sharing some intimate moments, I began liking her again. I had a stretch of time where I wanted to reject these feelings, but I thought it would be better to accept than reject them for the sake of my mind.
  The only problem was that she had a sort of boyfriend, who we will call Lucky.
  Girl and Lucky knew each other since fourth grade, but only recently started to talk to each other again after years of not talking to each other when Lucky moved to a different town.
  A couple of days ago, I told her that I liked her, and in a serious way. Reading from what I said earlier, one would suspect that she liked me, and she did. However she couldn't like me back because of her relationship with Lucky.

*During this one month I learned from her that she never wanted to break my poor freshman heart. It was her status in school she wanted to keep up, not to be the target of bullying for liking a freshman. This was from the heart and I knew she wasn't lying.

  So, what do I do with these leftover feelings? I mean, I still really like her, but my feelings are just... uselessly existing at this point. We're still talking normally as friends, but I don't know what to do. This is my cry for help.",08Jun2017,1
54,"So I am a freshman in high school. About two weeks ago I met this cute new girl(Also a cheer leader lol) in a class next door to one of mine. She is not even in any of my classes, but we have been talking and walking together a lot. The other day I was walking and I did not even see her, but she saw me and called me over. She like introduced me to her friends but she made a comment that caught me off guard. She said ""This is my friend (Name). Yea he's sexy"". I like laughed it off and joked around. She also like always sees me before I see her, even if she is with a group of her friends. 

I also got her snap, and sent like a message asking if anyone wants to start a streak. She replied back and said yes with a snap. But after that one snap she sent me, she has not sent any more to keep the streak going. 

I'm very talkative and social, and know a lot of people. But surprisingly never had a girl friend, and only liked one other person a while back. 

Do you guys think she likes me or am I overthinking this? Do you guys think I'm overthinking this? Tomorrow is also the last day of school for summer break.       :( Should I try to keep in contact with her over summer, like keep sending snaps even though she does not reply back?

55,"Basically I've got the most manipulative dirty underhanded family around. Always spreading lies and being general dicks, taking religious high grounds or a you're too young to understand attitude. Always. 24/7. The love starting shit and bagging people out. 

Last month my mum said she wanted to give me 2.5k to fix my new house as we have nothing just the frame no paint garden driveway floors etc. 

I thought it was a gift. Turns out she wanted it to use as a bargaining chip for more abuse. I have my first kid on the way in two months and I work 60 hour weeks and my wife does 40. Mum worked 20 hours a week had kids at 25 never went back to work but tells her friends and family how lazy and useless I am. And I mean non stop. It's relentless. Sometimes I see her friends and they say 'do you have a job?' 'Why don't you work?' 'Are you ok do you need help?' 'you should visit your mum more...' I show them photos and say I do... I take her out every 2 weeks here's proof... I look after her house and take care of her costs... I tell them I've had the same job for almost a decade... I'm on 150k and the wife's on 100k... we're in federal committees for our professions and meet with heads of states etc. they always look flabbergasted and she's often losing friends after 2-3 years when they find out she's just a 100% douche bag.

It was a relief we might have a driveway and floors. I paid the deposit from our own funds. Let her know I need the money - time to deliver. Then she says 'nope - I'm not giving you anything...' I haven't talked to her since in 3 weeks.

My sisters the same always wanting to take take take. Religious high grounds if she's trapped and knows she's wrong. Never apologises. She said she would loan me the money but only after mum had told every one how I was begging for money from everyone and how I can't keep my family fed. then she also went on a you guys are poor you guys are lazy etc etc. I hate how bad my family is. It's shameful they have no filter for what they do or say.

What's probably worst is they post this stuff on Facebook and SMS it to everyone in their phone books etc just to get a reaction from people. I now have two Facebook accounts and even changed my last name two years ago and added everyone but them. I kept the account private and don't friend anyone who's friends with them just in case they see the tag. My old Facebook now has about 7 friends left as I removed them all and let them now circle jerk each other. 

I know you're thinking 'always two sides to a story' but I swear to god it's 100% a complete cluster f of a random emotional roller coaster mind game. 

I've often gone 3-6 months not talking to them but I just want to hear from people who have done the following. 


Cut them entirely and never talk to them again.

Keep in contact but only ever do 1-2 hour public lunch engagements once every 2-3 months. 

Keep in contact but full family contact. 

Was it worth it. How are you going 15-20-40 years down the track. Has it worked out well or do you wish you'd have done the opposite. 

Both my wife and myself are university educated. We hate the way they think. We're positive thinkers and never engage in negative thinking unless absolutely required. We hate people who treat others like garbage and believe in equality and fairness. 

We've come far but want to go a lot further and it's hard to see that happening with my family always, always doing these things and pulling this kind of crap.

56,"It's like nothing ever works. My internship is going to shit because I hate everyone there. They are all about mockery, and everyday they taunt me. I have Aspergers, and when I told people about my autism, everyone just started treating me as if I were retarded. They are always speaking ill of me. I just can't take it anymore, man...

Then I totally lost it in a reunion, and I practically told them to fuck the right off (though not exactly in those words). I said that all of that was analogous to pre-teen bullshit, that they were behaving like children, and that all of that was ridiculous.

Now nobody talks to me. Well, they already didn't... But it is so hard to go though it... It's like the atmosphere is horrible, and gloom and doom.

I work in a school, and everyone there are women. I just can't take it anymore... Women can be so evil!!

I study Education and Mathematics (two undergraduation courses). If I drop out and leave all this bullshit, I won't be able to study Education anymore... Though I'm not sure whether I should... I love children, but I hate all this women bullshit, and I don't like people...

But if I drop out from my internship, I won't have anything to do all day... and I won't earn money. Right now, I do earn some money, but I hate all the people, and it hurts me so much. I was told from friends to just go and do my work, but I don't know...

On the bright side, there's so much to learn. I could learn to be patient while involved in all this bullshit, and I could learn not to care so much about this kind of thing...

I could aswell just drop out from Education school and keep up with my internship (which is valid for both Education and Mathematics). Though I don't know... Maybe I'm just generalising? I don't know. Perhaps other schools aren't like that.

I'm just unhappy with all this.

67,"I'm gonna try to keep this short. There's a girl let's call her Jenna. Jenna and I have known each other probably ten years. Notice I didn't say we've been FRIENDS for ten years... So when she first moved here, my best friend was a girl we can call Dana. So me and Dana are bffs, always together pretty much inseparable. Jenna moves here from a slightly more upper class town. Jenna thinks she is better than everyone, especially me. So blah blah blah Jenna and Dana start hanging out and they start being really cruel to me. They would make plans with me intentionally just to ditch me. If they did end up going through with our plans they would do everything they could to make me feel left out and just generally less than them. Eventually we all worked it out and me and Dana were back to bffs (once she realized Jenna was in fact a very shitty person) and me and Jenna were civil.

Fast forward a few years. Me and Dana are still bffs and Jenna is now just part of the group ( there was 4 of us). Now me and Jenna never hung out just the two of us, she only ever came with Dana. That is until my brother passed away. Dana was in another state and couldn't possibly be there for me and my mother abandoned me. So Jenna became my new bff. In the following years despite not knowing my brother, she used his death for attention. She would post about it on Facebook and talk to people about him. I'm convinced she became my friend simply to use my tradgedy to her advantage. That was five years ago and I've just let it slide this whole time. 

Later this month Jenna will be getting married and I'm one of her bridesmaids. I have every intention of being in the wedding just because I wouldn't wanna be THAT GUY. However, I plan to bail on her bachelorette party for a few reasons. One, she was never really a good friend to me. Two, I don't like alcohol or clubs and I don't want to go period. Three, her marriage is a joke. They fight daily and she's been sneaking around with the same guy their whole relationship. And finally, a few months ago, on the anniversary of my brothers death, I went to her for help. I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts my whole life but rarely ever ask for help. I told her I wanted to die and that I just didn't see my life ever getting better. This girl, who calls herself my best friend, simply said ""Idk""........ No hug, no support not even an ounce of compassion. Following that day I stopped leaving my house. Having spent most of my days prior to this at Jennas house. She didnt even take the time to check if I was okay. She was not concerned with the fact that I told her I wanted to die and then isolated myself completely. So my question is, does it make me a bad person to bail on her bachelorette party? Am I sinking to her level or giving her what she deserves? I'm well aware that I dont need friends like that.... I have no intention of maintaining a relationship with her afterwards. But I did say I would go and I'm not that type of person. It just feels like I should bail, I know I won't have fun.

68,"Hello! This is kind of complicated

So for a solid three years (like, 2012-2015) I liked this guy. My social skills were underdeveloped to say the least, and I basically followed him around to try and talk to him. I was super embarrassed when someone pulled me aside and told me that it was creepy. I got it under control, but it definitely was a bad look.

Fast forward to know, and we've both been accepted to this program that involves helping out younger kids. It involves a lot of communication and planning, and it's a two-year minimum commitment. So I'm going to be around him a fair amount.

I'm super excited to be in the program (so I'd like to avoid just quitting to avoid him), but I realize that we're both pretty awkward around each other. I can't stand awkwardness most of the time, so I'm really considering shooting him a text to just clear the air. It'd probably go something like this:

""Hey! Before I forget, I just wanna say I'm really excited to be in [program] with you. Just to be blunt, I'm sorry for how I acted towards you a few years back. I was pretty obviously not a people-person, but I don't want that to interfere with what we're gonna be doing now. We've got a lot of meetings ahead of us, so I figure it'll be easier if I say this now instead of avoiding it""

71,"Hard to explain, but all my life, talking never felt smooth or comfortable. People think I'm quiet, but not really. I don't talk because I find it very difficult, especially when I have to project my throat. Usually when I speak my whole mouth feels tight, it feels like I'm forcing air out. My voice often sounds strained and my pitch is unreliable, going in some weird directions. Most people rarely understand what I'm saying first time. I've listened to recording of myself and it sounds like I'm barely saying saying my vowels or not articulating, but I'm not sure. It kinda makes me sound a bit Chinese, even though I'm not from there. The weird part is that I can do impersonations pretty well. In that, when I copy somebody else, I speak natural all of a sudden. The thing is, when I stop copying that person's speech, then I go back to the strained way of talking. I've tried applying what I do when I do impersonation to my natural speech, but no luck. I've noticed the difference is that, my throat feels more relaxed and there is no tension when I'm doing impersonations. Whereas when I fall out of it, or I mess up, I feel a sudden tightness in my throat, and talking becomes difficult again. Sometimes I can spend hours doing impressions, because its the only time talking feels comfortable. It's just weird. I've looked everywhere online and I can't find anything on this. I just know it can't be normal, talking shouldn't be hard work, right? The closest I can describe this is when really nervous people try to talk. Kinda like that, but it like that for me most of the time, even if I'm relaxed. Its made my social life very difficult as you can imagine. Does anyone know what this could be? Does anybody else suffer from the same thing? I'm my just going mad, lol. Thank you for reading.

I didn't really get along with them. I don't feel traditionally feminine. I don't ""get"" a lot of the things that come with being a woman. Long hair, makeup, fashion, etc. 

When I see a girl or woman in public, I feel small and intimidated. Like this overwhelming feeling of ""this is what you should look and act like"" even though I'm in my 20's.

found out he was still married but seperated in the middle of completing divorce. They are ""best friends"" with a 'platonic relationship' supposedly. he hid this marriage because he also hid the fact that he had 2 other children who were under 5. I also feel he hid this because he was ashamed, or wasnt planning on keeping me around too long. He hid her name as his assistants name on his cell phone. I hacked into his ipad and found out that way, they talk every day and tho conversations arent romantic they did tell each other they love each other. Im annoyed because he swears shes always been a ""friend"" and ""didnt love her"" but i argued with him how pathetic that sounds because not only did you marry her but stayed married and then had 2 kids at the very end of your marraige but still want to continue their same bs friendly relationship they have--i understand they have kids and do need to communicate HOWEVER thats no excuse to talk everyday. He has children with an ex ex wife that he doesnt have this everyday overly friendly relationship. He talks highly of her and says he loves her like a sister???(which is gross and still not ok) he says he doesnt want to be with her and that im making a big deal because i dont understand and that he wants to be there for his kids. Ive explained to him that he should be there for his kids but he doesnt need to be there for her. Ive read text messages between them where he stays at their home in Louisiana and they even smoke bud together--thats some shit i would never do or cross with an ex bf. I told him i cant continue dating him because i dont like his life lol and didnt want anything to do with it. If he found a life partner and if his relationship with his kids were that important he wouldnt divorce her? right? he told me it was something he had to think about and time to get his shit together (hahah obviously)  he said he couldnt just end a friend thats been there his whole life.......i told him i wont allow it or ever bless their friendship..its not fair that i have to live and pretend to be okay with that because it makes HIM happy. its even made me think that this wife bestie of his is a typical fillipino push over and is ok with letting him do what he wants and is ok to stick around? maybe she isnt worried and feels confident about her role in his life. ..idk he says thats not how she is but his judgment on people isnt always great. I found out that he is also planning on moving them in the same state so he can be closer to his young daughter with autism. BOTTOM LINE i dont  appreciate feeling like i have to share my role if he wants to be with me then he needs to transfer that friendship to our relationship and let her go. if he knows hes not romantically wanting to be with her then why continue? why? why have 2 kids? the youngst is 3 so you literally had a baby not long ago but yet theres no love or romnce? he said he couldnt physically cheat if he wanted because the bitch has a fungus on her asshole that fucks up how she uses her vagina or something like that. she knew he was with me but i had no idea about her or her kids lol as much nice things she says about her i feel like shes pretty aware of what shes doing especially if shes calling 8-10pm and knowing hes in a relationship. he says she calls for the kids but unless theyre dying she dont need to keep up. when she would call he would ignore it..i always thought it was a little weird how ""work"" would call late",08Jun2017,1

This new job is a substantial pay increase and a promotion in position, going from an assistant to a director (obviously something I've been working toward for a few years now).

If my back is still bad by Monday, I can bullshit and excuse and push back the physical a couple days at most, but my real concern is if this injury remains I obviously won't be hired by the new company and my current company is unlikely to want to support me through a workers comp or long term injury.

85,"She is 17 years-old. She even needs someone to take out her roller skating shoes for here, that's the level of dependency. There is even more.

1) She needs someone to put on rolling skating pads for her. Knee guard and everything. She can't do it by herself. She needs my help. Also even after i unbuckle everything on the roller-skating shoes for me, she screams for my help to help her take off the shoes when she can easily pull it off herself. It was the incident that broke me and I don't want to babysit this 3 year old in 17-years-old body.

2) One incident, we went to the museum as a school group. She clings and clings onto and fake knowledge about museums. I told her and all my friends I need some time alone so I view the exhibits in peace, but she kept on tugging begging for my attention. I ask her to give one example of a museum in our country. She doesn't know. 

3) When I tried to get some time alone at balcony with another of my friend, she follows me into the balcony and basically said to me, ""You can talk there, let me stay here."" When I asked for privacy, she said she will not listen, I had to move away to another place. 

4) I once tried telling her if she is open to idea of seeing a psychologist (her level of dependency and clingly is all time high) and she is like, ""Nah I don't have any problems.""

86,"I am currently living in a 2 bedroom apartment with my partner (H) and a male roommate (T). H and I live in bedroom 1 with our own bathroom. T lives in bedroom 2 with his own bathroom. We all decide to split the rent and bills equally. Rent is $925, so H and T pay $308 and I pay $309 (extra dollar that I didn't mind paying for). 

Recently T has had a friend (R) over a lot. The first week I didn't really notice him so I was whatever about it. Second week I see him all the time so on Sunday I approach R and say ""I know you're staying here and I think it's only fair that you pay for rent if you continue to live here."" R says ""Yea I'll be paying for half of T's rent."" I was taken aback because T never told me anything about this nor did he ever ask if I was cool with it. I told R that arrangement is not fair if we are equally splitting the rent. R said he'll talk to T. After, I text T and tell him that if his friend continues to stay here then he needs to pay rent. T never texts me back and I don't see him for the rest of the day.

Monday, H is up in the morning making some food. He is purposely waiting in the kitchen to stop and talk to T about this before he heads out for the day. I was not awake at this time but H informed me that he heard T and R in the room whispering if H was still in the kitchen. H said that T made R check on what H is doing so that T can leave quickly. H gets fed up and heads to T's room where he repeats what I had said to R the other day. R must pay rent if he continues to live here. He cannot pay half of T's rent if we agreed to split equally. T and R say okay and head out the door. H and I calculate how much R owes.

Tuesday, T sends a text in the morning saying his friend will be leaving early in the week but he's ""on board regardless."" I was confused by the message and texted him back what does he mean. Did not receive a text back nor did I see him the rest of the day. Only his friend was around. 

Wednesday, H and I wake up and do our usual thing, make food, and whatnot. We hang out in our room with our door open. H is asleep at around 1pm since he has trouble sleeping at night. I am watching Netflix in our room. T's door is near enough that we can see each other's door. R exits T's room and head to the bathroom. I was feeling annoyed just by seeing him because he should have been gone, according to T's text. T then comes home and I see him enter his room. T and R are doing whatever. I wasn't paying attention to them at this point. 30-40 minutes later, T and R leave the apartment. Maybe 40 minutes later I head to the kitchen to serve water. I keep plants on the windowsill near the kitchen. I walk in and find one plant on the floor with soil everywhere. I am absolutely furious. I don't know if this is on purpose or an accident but either way they could have picked it up, told me about it, said sorry or something. I know they must have done something because it could not have been the wind. The plant is too big to have fallen due to the wind. I have much smaller plants that should have fallen as well if the wind was a problem. 

So now I am just angry and I need advice on what to do. I plan to sit both of them down and talk through the whole situation. I just need advice if this is the best way to go about this. How can I continue to live with him? What should I  even say? Am I overreacting about this whole thing because none of it feels fair.
Please help!

106,"Back in November I referred my best friend, we'll call her Jane, of 8 years to my apartment complex. She's always been the type of person to sit at home and watch Netflix and go to bed super early so I had no doubts that she would be a bad tenant. 
 After she got the apartment she ended up going through a break up that put her into depression. She started drinking excessively and constantly has a new guy over every night. She will be loud past the quiet time and sometimes she'll drunkenly yell on the phone outside at midnight. I have asked her multiple times to keep quiet and she ends up just arguing with me. I think she's a full on alcoholic now.
 So a few days ago, another tenant ( we'll call her sarah) told me that the landlord asked if she has had any issues with Jane. Sarah told him that sometimes Jane can be pretty loud. The landlord mentioned that he has gotten multiple complaints about Jane from other tenants.
 Pretty much I feel awful for referring someone that ended up not being a good tenant. I really had no idea that this would happen because Jane has never acted like this before. My question is should I apologize to the landlord for referring her? If so, how should I go about it? Also, do you think the landlord will look down on me for referring a bad tenant?

I work in a brewpub in New Zealand where i have been shift managing for nearly three years. The Brewpub is owned by one of New Zealands biggest breweries and when i joined i was give an hourly rate which didnt reflect the wages of people managing regular bars across the city. 

After three years of the same shit for lack of a better phrase, i am becoming bored and frustrated at my coworkers and management and need to leave for the sake of my sanity. Similarly, im stagnating in my position and theres no real room for me to advance in roles so im out.

Ive had four job prospects in the past four months at other bars around town of a similar level of responsibility but as soon as i say what i earn and what i would want to earn, i dont get offered the job or i get offered something lower.

Im started at panic and stress that noone will pay me what i am on now and i would need take a pay cut if i am to leave - and while it is knly a dollar or 2 an hour, it is the principle.

Do i keep looking, sticking by my guns or should i accept my fate that a pay cut is my only way out?

114,"It goes like this. This guy pretty much has a huge sexual desire for my SO. Ever since 3rd year high school this guy keeps harassing her in a way that it doesn't really break the touch barrier but more on a way similar to a catcall. He keeps remarking about his obscene verbal lust (and sometimes bodily actions) in some times when she passes him by. This continued until Grade 10 and I reckon he will do it again in Grade 11. The thing is during Grade 10, the guy made sexual advances on her by touching her bottom. She cried, I felt weak since I couldn't do anything about it. The only thing I can do was be her crying shoulder up until she can build back the confidence again to walk into school. For me, I begged her many times that I should do action about it and she wouldn't let me. She said she was not prepared for the consequences of what might happen. She said she's not brave enough to face it head on. She said that she knows the guy will chance but that is not the case. I can't do anything about it, that guy is part of the ""cool kids"" who can twist the truth with his own version. It sucks that that is the reality and nature of the social circles within the campus. When Junior High ended for us, I was excited to study at this renowned University but something terrible happened. 

Recently, the guy chatted her on facebook asking for selfies. My girl refused over and over but the guy kept insisting. There was also a part of that conversation that goes something like this;
""I want to tell you something but I can't tell you in facebook""
""Let's meet up""
(By this point my girl is still refusing)

I am so frustrated. I had to give up my dream of studying on that University in favor of being there for my girlfriend. I need to be at her side now and more than ever now that that sort of thing just happened. I need to give her the confidence she needs to take her out of the comfort zone and make her brave enough to stand up against that guy.

120,"Alright, this might be a bit longer text, but please, do read it since I could really use some opinions and advice...

I'll start off by saying I'm supposed to move to a German speaking country from a Balkan country in 2 days. It all began after I finished high school, I wanted to move to attend university abroad. It felt like there were gonna be more options and opportunities than in my poor country.
I spent a year and a half after HS studying the foreign language, and have gotten decent enough to get accepted into a uni abroad. I'm 20 now and I'm supposed to start in October.

Thing is, I've had depression for a long time now (maybe 4 years or so) because I'm ugly. So my thought was, why don't I go abroad, enrol into uni and work a side job while studying, and work even more inbetween the semesters and save up some cash for surgery?

Back then this sounded like a logical idea, I'm not rich and my mom wouldn't be able to fork out a fortune for my ""unnecessary"" surgeries.
But I actually went to the country of interest and lived there for 2 months in a shared apartment, and got to experience the city. This is when my mind first changed.

I couldn't find a job in 2 months (went around and handed out CVs) and was also lonely during that time (not the most social person, my family keeps me content). And I will absolutely need a job once I move to finance my rent and food, since my mum wouldn't be able to afford supporting me abroad on her own.

A roommate put me into contact with one of his friends, and I'm supposed to move into his place once his friend has moved out.

I'm in a huge dilemma right now, and I need help on making the wisest decision:

* I really need to save up some money for surgeries, but I can't get a job in my own country (trust me not even fully functioning adults with a diploma can, a lack of workplaces), so I should move for the time being

* On the other hand, I don't think I'm capable of handling depression, working in a foreign language I'm not fluent in whilst having to study engineering, studying in uni in a language I'm not comfortable with yet, and being lonely, separated from my family. I think I'll go insane to be honest, and I fear the worst happening.

All in all, I really need the money, but I also need to keep my sanity, and in the end I don't actually want to move, I could go to university in a city that is a half an hour ride by train from my own, and stay with my family and in the comfort of my home, without having to work while studying (nor even being able to).

(also regarding the place where I'm supposed to move in, I haven't signed any contracts yet or anything, just arranged everything, already brought my clothes over, and the guy that used to live here already moved in with his gf, not sure what would happen if I said that I don't wanna move in anymore two days before signing a contract...)",08Jun2017,3
121,"My fiancée has been experiencing some symptoms associated with Chlamydia for about 5 months. We weren't sure what it was and stupidly never considered an STI. She finally had the test done and it has come back positive.

I have been faithful and I believe she has too. She is (understandably​) incredibly upset as I was pretty irresponsible with my sexual encounters before we got together and never got tested myself. 

Right now she is not talking to me and refuses to even touch me. She's worried she has PID and is now infertile as she's had Chlamydia for 2 years.

The person who I share a bathroom with is sheds a lot, and almost every day there is a huge mass of hair in the shower drain. I texted him about this (because we keep very different hours) and it stopped for a while.

141,"Back in the start of high school which is year 8. I picked Chinese as a language to learn. It was compulsory for every student to pick a language until the end of year 9 however if you wanted to continue learning that language until your senior years, you can but it will be hard. The way the system of our school works is that you have 3 languages to pick: Chinese, Japanese and French. But if you have a background in your family that has anything to do with those three languages, then they will still let you learn that language up to year 9. However, if you want to continue learning that language all the way to your seniors than the school will make it EXTRA hard. I have a Chinese background because I am from Singapore. My mum wanted me to pick Japanese in the first place because we don't have a Japanese background and I can do it all the way to my seniors easily. My mum strongly wants me to do languages because second language is SO important nowadays because it benefits people to get jobs and such. Learning languages in my seniors will also give me a bonus 10% in my final result in for my last year in high school which will help me with my university. But to get that bonus 10% you have to do well in languages in your seniors. But I still picked Chinese because of back than I wanted to be able to speak to my family members who don't know English. Next year, Halfway through the year, my mum forced me to transition to Japanese so I now have to catch up. I was doing pretty well and got a B in my grade but at the end of the year I’m struggling and got a C. Now I'm in my third year and I’m probably going to get a D in my Japanese since I failed the exam. I have been arguing with my mum to let me drop Japanese as I hate learning it and I hate anime and all that. My mum won't let me and yells at me. One of the reasons my mum won't let me quit is because she let me quit Music class that same year I started Japanese. She made me promise I will do well in my subjects if she lets me drop Music. I didn't do too well last year with my grades but this year I am doing well and haven't failed any tests except for my Japanese tests. My mum still won't let me quit and last week my class had a talk with the Language Head of Department where she encourages us to not do languages anymore if you don't enjoy it anymore. My mum STILL won't let me quit. And I find it dumb because HOW CAN YOU FORCE YOUR CHILD TO DO SOMETHING AND EXPECT THEM TO DO WELL AT IT!?! THAT’S AUTISM!!! If you don't like something, why force yourself to do it AND do well at it? It's INSANE!!! Every time I bring it up she will bring up about how she let me quit music and how I broke my promise on saying I will do well in my subjects. But back than I was desperate and would do anything to quick Music. But right now I’m doing well! Even my dad is happy enough. Generally my mum thinks that if she lets me drop Japanese I’m going to lie to her again and do badly at school. It's depressing when your parents force you to do something and they get angry when you don't do it well enough to their accordance. My mum calls me a QUITTER for dropping Music and a LIAR for promising I will do well in my subjects as long as she lets me drop Music last year.  Next year is my senior years and my mum wants me to find the passion to enjoy Japanese just like she wanted me to find the passion in music (which face it, I didn't). She also talks about how she regrets letting me quit Music and all that. Blah Blah Blah. I will admit that I'm at fault and I should have picked Japanese back in Year 8 but I KNOW myself. I wouldn't even really want to do learn Japanese as a second language.

So, any ideas on what to do now?

145,"So yeah, as above, one colleague in my office keeps making daft mistakes in her work and my boss will go to her desk and talk to her about it, as though she's a child. It's a quiet office so everyone can hear, and she says things like ""this can't keep happening"" and ""why have you done this?"" is a strict tone, which makes the atmosphere pretty awkward for everyone.

It's always the same employee (and to be fair, she does keep making errors), but I don't think this is the best way to deal with it. Earlier, because I'm tired of it, I asked my boss if there was anything I could do to help the person out e.g. maybe swap some work over, but all I got was ""I can't discuss another colleague with you"". But it's fine to make a scene about it in the office?

Sometimes she does take the colleague out of the room to reprimand her, but it's become increasingly frequent that she just has a go at her for every little thing as though it's the worst thing ever, right in front of everyone.

It's like one day he can be so warm and loving and then by the next time I see him he's quiet and maybe a little distant. Im not sure how to handle it. I asked him if everything was ok and he says he's fine. I told him I was feeling insecure and he said to be assured that we're fine. I don't want to be strung along. If things have changed let me know now not when I've packed up and planned to move. Advice? ",08Jun2017,1

163,"Hello! Like the title says, I'm having a weird sensation around my anus (feeling like it burns) but I can't figure out why. This started two days ago, it was a 'weird' gaming session because I was from 16:00 hrs to something like 03:00 hrs, but I stopped at about 17:30 to go the bathroom, did what I needed to do but felt like I haven't *left all* and felt like that for the next hours. Also, that's where the burn begun and I thought it would be wise to use a cushion so I grabbed one and sit anyways. I did not feel the burn or something unless I moved my butt a little so I tried not to move at all, then at 21:00 I stopped 20 minutes then came back.

I do not practice something like anal sex or introduction of *things* into my anus, it's just that most days I play while I sit and this has never occurred before so I am worried. I have a test today but I think it's wiser to go see a doctor. The problem with it is that I don't know if I should see a specialist directly or a general doctor that may or may not direct me to one.

170,"So, I have a friend we'll call ""Charlie"". He was in my Improv 101 class and he was super friendly, so I started hanging out with him. He was like an excitable puppy and super friendly, so it was usually fun! There were problems. He said some weird things to me like ""Look, she didn't shave her legs..."" or ""You would make a great weird face comedian.""

Last night, I met my friend Charlie at a social event. Only... he was being drunk and extremely abrasive: Interrupting folks' conversations to complement their attire, and then talking about nothing over everyone. Also, shouting passerby's names like their old friends (despite meeting them like once).

After he left, some of the people asked me if I was friends with him. I said ""I'm friends with everyone but I can understand why you're not friends with him."" Then they told me about a rude thing he did where he tipped a bartender a quarter by tossing it on the table.

The sad thing is, I know Charlie is just looking for a community. He wants the same thing as me: he wants to feel liked by everyone. He wants to know everyone. But, it's getting pretty difficult to defend the guy though, you know?

How should I approach this problem?

* Should I cut him out of my life?
* Should I try and be his friend since he has no-one else?
* Should I talk to him about his behavior?

173,"TL;DR:  My girlfriend and I are likely receiving spoofed calls from her ex-husband. How should we handle it? Should I be spoofing my number and calling him at random times?


I have a question, which I don't know where to direct it but, basically I just want an opinion. My girlfriend's ex-husband is fairly tech savvy,  he used to love using phone apps to make free calls, and it would have him show up on the phone as 0000000 or something unusual, never his actual phone number. Since he has stopped making harrassing phonecalls to his ex-wife(last call was 3 days after finalization) she and I both get LOTS of random calls with no voicemail left. I brushed it off as telemarketing scams, but instead of being calls from random locations across the country they are all local, and they all start with the same first three digits as our respective phone numbers.

I have done reverse lookup on each of them, they are all tied to people I have never met or heard of. It is every single ""odd"" call for 3-4 months.

Does it seem likely that I am paranoid and crazy or is it possible we are receiving spoofed phone calls?

This person meets virtually every criteria of narcissistic personality disorder, he has stalked and harrassed someone before(mutual friend) and has shown no sign of accepting or getting over his divorce. He sent daily text messages cycling through various methods of manipulation throughout the year and a half it took to divorce him ending finally in playing the victim and pretending he had been nice all along and wishing her well. Of course, that is whenwe started seeing the missed calls. Neither of us answers the phone when we do not recognize the number but, eventually a pattern emerged.

What should we do? I have had my phone number for 20 years and am not trying to change it. I've blocked roughly 30 phone numbers during this process and I still get several calls a week.",08Jun2017,1

180,"       First to begin I'll go ahead and apologize for the length of this post. I want everyone that reads this to get the full story so that no rash decision can be made on my part. Hopefully I'm not just being selfish and if I am please don't be afraid to call me out on my BS. I'm going to refer to my girlfriend as Tina and her Ex as Todd. 
       I met Tina last year (June 2016) at my workplace and we hit it off. We both work together at a hospital and our jobs are somewhat intertwined. Tina and I get along very well and she ended up asking me to drinks one night after work. Since then we have been inseparable. After multiple dates throughout the next couple of months I finally asked her to be my girlfriend. She ended up giving me a key to her house and we practically have been living together ever since. Everything was going fantastic, so something had to go wrong.
        Around November while I was working one of my coworkers pulled me off to the side. He asked me about my relationship with Tina and how we were getting along. I told him we were fantastic and no problems so far. So he introduced the problem, he showed me an article about a soldier that died at the beginning of 2016, he was deployed at the time and it was a chilling read. The best part of the article is the part where they say who the soldier is survived by. Under his parents and siblings was her name right there in the bold print. I honestly didn't know what to say. What do you do if you find out your girlfriends ex died overseas? I'm a soldier myself but I couldn't fathom what to expect if I asked her about it. 
      That night I went to Tina's to confront her about the article and ask what happened. She immediately began to cry as she told me the story. Apparently his name was Todd, she knew him since middle school. They were best friends throughout high school and ended up dating once she went to college. Tina and Todd ended up dating 7 years up until his death. The story she told me was that he joined the airforce and was constantly deployed around the world. A month after his death was going to be the first time Tina would have seen him in 9 months as she was planning to move to where he was stationed for the remainder of his contract. After his death she flew over to where he was stationed and found out he had another girlfriend that was staying with him. Throughout all this Tina still stayed and returned all of Todd's belongings to the states. Since they were unmarried she received nothing from his passing except a few token items she took from his apartment. 
      Once I heard the story I didn't know what to say. She told me that's what she expected and that there is nothing to say. Tina expressed the reason she had not told me yet was because she didn't know how to tell me without making it seem like our relationship means less to her than it really does. Tina told me that our relationship is much better than hers with Todd had ever been. Yet Todd was her best friend and she misses him. I told her how sorry I was for her and how unfortunate this situation is.
      Fast forward to now, it is now the anniversary of Todd's death. I am currently being deployed and on the other side of the country. Tina talks to me everyday, sometimes about work but mostly about Todd. I'm trying to stay strong but the constant barrage of grief for her ex-boyfriend is starting to tear away at me. She has expressed that there is no one else to talk to about her problems, including family and friends. Mainly for the simple fact that her story is too sad and most people don't want to sit to hear what's going on. So I've taken up the role of listening to her problems. Each day she seems to get better but I feel myself getting worse. I'm not quite sure what to feel in this situation as everyday she tells me she misses and loves another man. I understand that Todd has passed and will not be able to alter our relationship. Yet, each day it's getting a little harder to take. I'm not quite sure what to think at this point.  Seeing that she is in pain makes me want to help, but every time she talks about him I die a little inside. It makes me feel as though I could never compare to what he was to her. Many of my close friends have stated that I am just the rebound guy for her, but I truly do care for Tina. I want for us to work out but at this point I honestly don't think it's even worth it. It took a lot for me to write this post and I've been struggling with the courage to tell r/advice any of this. I honestly don't know who to talk to or what to do and Any incite would be extremely helpful.

182,"so I pay for a garage and sometimes a really nice car will park in front of it. Like I think its a seven series, kinda nice. I've asked this guy several times and building management is no help. Tow service takes too long. For instance, I arrived home last night at 11:30 and he was parked in front of my garage, so I call our private tow company and they need the building manager to call them first.

So I call the city tow but I live in a major city and that take 4 hours and by then he's had his jollies and left but I've had to stay up to nearly 4 trying to make sure I'm not blocking in someone else's garage or running the risk of tow myself.

185,"Hello. I was just in my first semi-major car accident and I am a bit jarred. I initially thought the truck driver whom I was involved in the accident with was at fault but when the police arrived they stated that I would be found at fault. I have OCD so I tend to doubt myself, as I am doing about my recollection of this event currently. I can tell you the facts as I remember them and perhaps you can shed some light or even your opinion.

The last thing I saw before the car crash was the front of the truck in my left rear mirror, meaning he was behind me and to my left. 

I was in the right lane continuing forward and attempting to make an eventual merge left.

The lane the truck split so that the left portion continued into a left turn and the right portion continued straight.

The truck driver was trying to make a right and stay straight-- I was in the right.

As soon as the truck hit me, he hit my rear left side, I spun into the left lane. After I had stopped spinning, I was ended up perpendicular to the truck.

Police and the driver say that I was merging too quickly but this is not what I recall happening. I had not even merged yet--I spun into the lane I wanted to be in after I had been hit. I saw the truck in my left rear view before collision. Further it doesn't make sense to me that I merged to my left yet spun into the left lane at the same time. 

One thing really making me doubt myself is that after the accident a passenger in the car behind the USPS truck (this is a big freighter truck, btw) handed the USPS guy his number and said to use him as a witness. I am really confused. ",08Jun2017,1

190,"Hello:

I am looking for some advice--I have reached a point in my career and company that I am thinking of changing careers.

For the last 10 years I have been in various retail banking jobs, the last 8 years as a Branch Manager for large banks and small community banks. I have a blend of experience and am good at the job. (Which makes it no longer a challenge).
My skills are not necessarily in finance, but:
*management of people
*management of sales
*operational and security soundness
*community involvement and interaction
*direct sales
*customer service 
*special projects

I am wondering what other industries could dove tail with my current skills. I know people are always looking for good managers, but I may not necessarily have the technical skill to back it up.

I am also considering going back to get my MBA, what fields will be growing over the next couple years I could jump into?

Currently in Chicago
Currently 90k/year and would like to keep it around that salary if not more (obviously)

198,"I am sorry if my typing is off at all, I don't post on Reddit very often but I would really like to know what others think about this situation and I would really like some advice on how to handle the situation. So here I go:

I (female) work as a shift leader at a rather large pizza restaurant chain and I have been up for a promotion (where there are many slots available) to a more senior management position for over 6 months. My boss as well as my boss' boss are all up for it, they want me to step up and help out my store more. Everything seemed to be going well, I was supposed to go into training for this position at the beginning of June. 

However, we also train our shift leaders at the same stores that we train all other management trainees. My store had recently hired a guy that was interested in management and they wanted to get him through training as fast as they could as many restaurants are struggling for help. I was fine with that as I understand the need for shift leaders so that the general managers can get a day off work. 

I then soon found out that they decided to put him through not only shift lead training but upper management training too. Quite honestly I am very angry and I am not sure what to do. 

These are the reasons why I feel like this is unfair treatment:
1. I've been waiting to go into training for my promotion since before the beginning of the year, I have had to do much extra work and pull extra hours to ensure that I was ""prepared enough"" before I was sent to training
2. The guy they put before me (who has no experience and quite honestly can barely make a pizza) has had to have 0 preparation before he was sent to training
3. I was actually told the reason they sent him into training was so they could send him to another store because he hit on my boss.
4. So this guy is getting paid more than me with bonus potential when he has no experience and I am one of the best shift leaders in my area.

Another part of this that is really upsetting is that I am very close with my boss, but i have about had it. 
What should I do? Should I just wait it out and get over it? Get another job? I know I should talk to my boss I'm just not really sure how.

208,"Probably a longer post. A little backstory, I used to be a really social kid, go out every day, do stuff with friends - I always had something to do when I was younger. When I was 14 I discovered the world of video games and got hooked. Up until now (I'm 18 now) I've pretty much declined every single invitation I had ever gotten from friends, I came home from school and played for 10 hours on weekdays and 13-15 on weekends. Now I reached the point where I wanna go out and stuff outside the only problem is I have no one to do stuff with. Recently it got a little better as I went out multiple weekends in a row but only cause people invited me to their birthdays or to a festival etc. But I don't want to be limited to only do stuff on weekends when people invite me over, I want to do stuff on weekdays aswell as on weekends but I've literally got no one to do stuff with. I consider the people that invited me to their birthdays etc. great friends but the thing is they have their own circle of friends which they've had for years now so it is only obvious that they hang out with them. I appriciate ever invite that I get but seeing peoples snap storys and stuff on like a tuesday night where they just chill and have fun meanwhile I sit at home doing nothing makes me feel very miserable. I have the next 2 months off and I'm already hating the thought of just sitting home for 2 months maybe going out once or twice if someone invites me to go out with them. Today I literally went to bed at 4pm cause I had nothing to do, I didn't wanna play video games they bore me and I didn't know what to do. So this is where I'm at right now. I'd like to go out and do stuff with people everyday but I have no one to do stuff with. The obvious answer would be to go out by myself I know but I think I don't have the confidence to do that as I don't really know how to meet new people. It's not that I have anxiety or anything I love talking to people even to strangers but just randomly going up to someone isn't me and I don't really wanna go somewhere and hope people are going to approach me.

209,"Hello, I am 21 years old. Please pardon me, my english it's not perfect.
I been throught really difficult stuff. (like everyone) about my relationship with myself, guys, love and sex. I'm closed to many things, I am afraid.  I have been repressed, prudish, and people have took advantage of that. I am in a lot of emotional and physical pain.
There are things that have happened to me without looking for them, and maybe other times, for being such a prudish person, not letting myself to enjoy, have fun, living my dessires. 

In my university, I met this guy, let's call him Luis. Last semester I was in a class with him, and only a few times, we talked. He was with two friends all the time, and rarely he looked at me. I thought he didnt like me, not even as a person. This semester, I had a class with him, and it was the same, no talking, I dont even remember looking at him. 

Few months ago, Luis added me on facebook, Accepted his friendship request. He talked to me. I thought he talked because he needed information about a school project. Not really, he was clear about his intentions. He would like to be with me (intercourse)  He's good looking, he's respectful, a nice guy. Its weird, cause he always ignored me, I dont have a bad reputation,   I am very shy and I don't stand out. 

I also want to be with him. I just want it. I wanna experience, I dont know, maybe this wont happen, maybe it will be once, twice, many times, but I am curious. 

I just wanna feel, enjoy, to live life, share. To be honest, I felt  so sad, and so alone. I was wishing for someone who I can have fun with.

I am not very beautiful, he has many pretty friends. I am kinda afraid he wont see my real person, and thats not a far possibilty.

My question it is Might this be a good Idea?

210,"I live in a pretty cool house, albeit a little dated and dirty. The rent is super cheap ($350/mo.), it's centrally located, and it has a shed where I can store my motorcycle. I'm going to be away learning Spanish at a program in Vermont over the summer, and I probably won't find someone to sublet. My lease is supposed to renew a week ago (June 1st), but we've had trouble getting another person into the remaining room, and fortunately our landlords are somewhat flexible and lenient.  I'm really just wondering: 

**1. If I should sign another lease and pay rent while I'm gone so I can keep my room,**

or

**2. If I should just leave and figure out a new living situation when I get back.**

Though I generally like my house, I'm having roommate problems. I live in a 3br/2ba house with a guy I found off of Craigslist, and we're currently looking for another roommate to help with the rent. My current roommate is 23, graduated from a selective college, and now works at the Department of Transportation in my state making enough money to insouciantly throw it away buying expensive stuff that he never eats at Whole Foods. For reference, I'm 28, in community college, and I'm waiting tables to pay the bills. 

**My problems with my current roommate are that:** 

* he doesn't respond to the landlords promptly
* he hasn't been as motivated in helping to fill the empty room in the house 
* he doesn't clean up as much and leaves pots and pans in the sink until he's ready to use them to cook again. 
* he constantly throws recyclables into the garbage can. I f!cking hate this. Should I really hate this? This is so f!cking easy not to do.

...Oh yeah: when he moved in, he also needed my help screwing the base into his big new flat screen TV and assembling his IKEA coffee table because he's ""never really done this sort of stuff before."" All I did was use a screwdriver.

I'm annoyed that I'm living with a person who seems like they've lived a privileged life and has gotten a lot more than I have without having to really work for it. Everything he does adds up, but I really don't know whether or not I should cut him slack because he's only 23. At the same time, I've talked to him several times about some of this stuff, and he just sort of sighs and says, ""Yeah, I need to do that. I'll start doing that."" 

**My other roommate problem is that I haven't been able to find a third roommate to help with the rent, and I don't want to live in a house that I can't pay for. Should I try to make it work, or find two random people off of Craigslist and bail?**

Edit: I've already moved once every 6 months for the past two years so I really don't want to move again *unless I really should.* This is probably an important point for me to make.",08Jun2017,1

Ever since I was a very small child change and transition has taken a lot of emotional energy for me. I used to cry for about an hour every day when I got home from kindergarten, just that change was too much for me. I've gotten better at tempering this; I give off a rather hardy outward appearance I've been told, and not many people have seen me me cry.  That's one reason I'm concerned; I do not want to alarm others if I do cry. I don't want them to worry. My other worry is that I'm a messy crier - I snot and hiccup and all of that nonsense. And frankly, it's embarrassing. I'm going to be around lots of people that I really admire and respect and I don't want that to be their image of me on my graduation. Can anyone give me some tips for how to get through the whole thing, dignity in tact? Thank you.",08Jun2017,2

222,"Back in December, three of us decided to start renting a house together. It's me, my best friend ""Chris"", and the cat-guy ""Frank"". The two of them took care of the lease and everything because I lived on the other side of the country. I asked about getting a pet, and they said we weren't allowed to have pets, and that ""Frank"" had to get rid of his cat in order to move in. Me and ""Chris"", took Frank at his word that he'd do it, because we've known him for ~12 years and he had never given us any reason to think otherwise.

So the two of them moved into the house towards the end of April, and Frank brought his cat with him, and said he's still in the process of re-homing it. Frank ran into a little financial trouble in January, so it wasn't a huge surprise, but he still didn't tell either of us it was happening. We told him it wasn't a big deal, but the cat really needs to be gone ASAP.

Then, the conversation about the cat just sort of stopped. I lived 3 time-zones away from Chris, and the jobs that both of us had made it difficult to talk to each other on a daily basis. We communicated more through text and e-mail, and the topic just wasn't brought up since we had so many other things to worry about.

Fast-forward to this past weekend, and I finally roll into town. I started moving my things into the house, and I opened up the garage, and *there's* the fucking cat. He had water, and dry food, but his litter box looked like it had been full for a while, and there was a pile of garbage building up around his ""area"". I cleaned up all of the garbage, emptied the litter box, and gave him fresh water, but it has become clear to me that the cat is being neglected. Not so much that I would think criminal charges are necessary, but I'm an animal-lover, and I can't stand seeing any animal being mistreated. So, I've been taking care of it for the last 3 days.

Frank claims that it's too expensive to give him up for adoption, and also that the shelters around here won't take the cat simply because having one in the house violates our lease-agreement. It's not a good enough reason, and I certainly agree.

But, we simply cannot keep it, and so I come to you for advice, Reddit.",08Jun2017,4

I took incredibly difficult classes and I was just enveloped by it all.  The semester before that was the worst one of my life because i was just genuinely depressed and didn't want to do anything with school.  My parents had just announced their divorce, which left my dad with nobody to talk to but me.  He relied on me for everything and it made the semester incredibly difficult for me to try in.  I submitted a suspension appeal to the registrars office in hopes that they would review it and hopefully bring me back in, but i just got an email back saying that it was denied. This year was the worst of my life.  Previously my GPA's have been 2.7 +'s, but they don't seem to care about that i guess.  

I don't know what to do anymore.  The past 4 interviews i've had for jobs have ended up with no calls back.  I also don't even know how I'd get to the jobs, as bumming off of friends can only go so far.

I was going to college out of state and was double majoring so you know taking mainly core classes with maybe 1 GE a semester. Entering into sophomore year I start my language class which my second major is based off of, and all is going well until at the last second my teacher asked for another copy of my final writing assignment, which I put in her assignment dropbox. Long story short it somehow goes missing the next day when I show up and my A goes to a D when combined with my not so hot final. Which meant that because I was on a 5 year program, that it would push me out to 6 to stay in it. I cannot afford to stay for that long so I decided to transfer back to a community college back home temporarily to get GE's out the way before transferring locally. My dilemma is that I am pretty certain that they have my freshman year official transcript, which is about a 3.0 GPA, but I have yet to give them my latest one because of that class and dealing with chronic migraines with no meds or insurance were a factor in my grades slipping. So considering that  most of the classes I do not believe will transfer because they are out of state engineering classes with 1 GE can I just not give them the current transcript with no repercussions?

My phone is the Google Pixel, and I've had it for six months with no problems, however suddenly my microphone and headphone jack stopped working simultaneously.

I got home last night around 7, ate a dinner, felt tired, and decided to take a small rest around 8-8:30pm. i was awake sometime around 10-11 pm but for the next 2 hours i just laid in bed and played on my phone. eventually i got up at 1-2 am and was on my computer. a few hours later i look at the time and it's 4:30 am. i had to be up at 6 am to get ready and be at the hospital by 8 am. decided to set my alarm to wake me in an hour and a half. turns out, the alarm never rang at all and i woke up at 11:15 am. sighhhh

i'm not sure how i can stop this from happening, oversleeping is such a pain and ruined my day. it turns out the alarm on my phone wasn't even on, i thought i set it before i slept at 4:30 but i didn't, which is why it never rang. i've always been using my phone alarm and about once every 3 months i oversleep for something important and end up getting pissed about it, it's annoying. how can i correct this problem? my initial plan is to buy an alarm clock today and run 3 separate alarms for the reminder of this internship. one alarm on my computer, my phone alarm, and an actual alarm. i'm not sure how practical it would be to run 3 alarms every day, makes me feel like an abnormal person that needs to go to this extent. however, during school i would always use 2 alarms before a big exam which helped me not oversleep. anyone have advice on this? thanks",08Jun2017,1

I'm in a much more corporate apartment meant for semi long-term visitors/relocated employees. While the other interns had to sign a lease and all, I had to fill our zero paperwork and am being giving the housing for free.

I am incredibly grateful for the housing but the internet is pretty terrible. It is incredibly inconsistent. At its peak, I get maybe 6Mb/s. However, that is incredibly rare. For most of the time I get &lt; .75Mb/s. As someone whose life is mainly internet based, I feel like I'm dying.

Part of me wants to go to HR since it is the company that pays for the service. I want to ask if they can contact the provider to see if there is an issue.

However, I feel it may just be best to pay for it myself the few months I'm here. My big question is, can I pay for internet while not being on the lease? My name may be on some documentation they have but I never had to sign anything.

278,"So I'm getting a new kitten, but my parents are divorced. The original plan is to have the cat at my dads house, because there's a room that's easy to kitten proof for the adjustment period and our cat at dads house could use a little company. I was going to get a kitten at dads house, and since I'm out of school I can be home all day to make sure he's adjusting and introduce him to my other cat slowly. When I'm at my moms house (because I switch houses) I would go over every day for a few hours while my dads at work and then my dad would get home and take it from there. The issue is that my mom wants the kitten to live at her house. I don't know if that's a good idea because there isn't a totally kitten proof room there.

279,"20 years ago while in college I saw a girl jump to her death.  The experience haunted me, matured me almost immediately, and definitely changed my life.

Yesterday my son was watching a movie where someone dies and he asked me if I had ever seen someone die.  Immediately all these memories flooded back to me.  I relived the whole experience, especially how I was affected by the suicide in college, and how two of my friends who knew the girl were very defensive of her memory.  My brain is reeling remembering this incident.  I should mention that while I met her, I was not friends with her.  

I googled the incident and learned her full name and her parents' names.  Her mother is still surviving and lives about 10 minutes from me.  The first three references when googling the father's name are his obituary an article about the suicide, and his address.  Nothing weird about finding this information.

I wrote out a letter to the mother last night recounting how I met her daughter at a dorm event, that I was deeply affected by her daughter and what happened, a story about my two friends defending her memory, and a paragraph how twenty years later I never forgot her daughter.  I don't reference her suicide directly and I try to keep everything very respectful and really just to let the mother know that I still think about her daughter.

I'm not sure what to do. My dad was always gone to work for 3-4 months growing up, when he was home he was an alcoholic.

I feel uncomfortable touching or hugging him and talking to him is a chore ... I feel like he is a hard to deal with stranger.

Is this normal? what does it feel like to have a normal dad? I feel like I should never talk to him again in my life and give up, will I regret it?",08Jun2017,7
