1,"I don't know what I'm trying to get at here exactly, but I feel like more now I'm concerned that my memory isn't quite up to par with everyone else my age. I'm 16 and have trouble remembering names and faces, sometimes there are people who come up to me - who clearly knows who I am, but I don't recall a single thing about them. Some more short time things would be like I place something down, and as soon as I turn away - even if it is do the smallest thing, I completely forget where I placed it down. This happened twice in a row (forget where something was, placed something down to find it, found it, forgot where I placed the other thing.) However it doesn't seem to affect my academia, I am able to remember school stuff easily, however it's difficult for me to take a large chunk of time devoted to doing this one specific thing. I'll also often forget who I'm having a conversation with, so I could have one conversation with one person, completely forget that I had it with them and bring it up later - to that same person thinking I never spoke to them about this thing.


Unless I make an active effort to remember something, they'll likely - very likely slip my mind. Another example is that today I was carrying a folder with me with fieldtrip forms down to a teacher to get something signed, as I was at their classroom I opened my folder, got it out for him to sign, went away to go to another room and I submitted my field trip forms. When I arrived at where I am right now, I searched for my folder - it wasn't there. The part about the folder is completely lost in my memory. I do not recall anything, it's like there's a chunk of my memory that refuses to come back to me, I do not recall anything I did with the folder other than the fact I took my field trip forms out of there.

I also often misplace things, and I mean OFTEN. I've consistently misplaced something in the same room at least like 5 times in the span of maybe 3 months or so?

** Edit: I also forget things I do myself, like I can do something for example type in something to Google, but 1 second later, not recall typing that in Google. 

This kind of stuff happens to me frequently, and I'm worried it happens more than it should. Could anyone tell me if they experience similar situations?

I don't have the money to get another degree, and I don't know what I would enjoy doing as a job anyway. All I like doing are leisure activities and things that can't be applied to a job. What should I do? Do I have any options besides suicide? ",30Mar2017,1

My dilemma is wether or not I should tell her. People say my brother (24) and I (21) look like twins, but I wouldn't want to go out with said girl because I'm a look-a-like. The thought of someone going out with me because I look like my brother bothers me a lot. I feel so conflicted.

4,"I've always had trouble with condoms in early (critical) stages of relationships. So when my girlfriend (we've been going out for 5 months) was clear about not being able to conceive it seemed like I didn't have to worry. She has polycystic ovaries and another condition and was categorical it wasn't possible, and joked about use one if you want, but there's zero point. She also said even if she could she wouldn't want one now especially considering her life and that we're in early stages of a relationship. 

Well I honestly believed her, and believe she believed it herself. She's had unprotected sex for many years and never had a problem.

Of course the moment she tested positive she not only wants to keep it, but stated it's not a choice because she couldn't live with herself if she terminated. But I already have a child who is my world and lives with me half the time. I do not know my GF anywhere near enough to consider moving in together, in fact I was at the stage of wondering if I was in love enough to be in a relationship with her.

So although it's been painful, I've felt it important to be clear about all this for both our sakes, but it hasn't swayed her. She's almost treating it like it's not even mine now, and has said I'm optional. She said I can 'terminate' by saying I don't want to be involved...but she doesn't seem to have the faintest idea what that would mean. Secrets and lies, or being judged as a POS.


I'm so pissed off and I'm doing my utmost to stay ok with her, but she's getting more demanding of my feelings, but I feel like I've been violated and my life's a mess. I don't know how I can explain to my daughter. 

I'm not sure anyone can help, but never ever everblet this happen no matter what she says or how safe it might seem.

I just don't know what the hell to do!! I do not in any way want to be a father again at the moment, I've had years of being a single parent..how can I live with any of this?

6,"Hello Reddit!

As you can read from the title I'm having problems with my teacher. 

I live in Germany so I'm not sure how it works in other countries but here you have to parts for a driving license: 
1.Theoretical 
2.Practical

I passed the theoretical part but I'm having difficulties with the practical part. I was always scared of driving but my teacher makes it 100 times worse. He yells at me for the slightest mistakes (ex.: I drove 45 km/h in a 50 km/h zone).

Maybe you will say that it is my fault and he's just correcting my mistakes but when I drove above the speed limit (57 km/h in the 50 km/h zone) he yelled at me and laughed when the girl after me did the same (she was even driving faster than me). He's always yelling at me so I always make more mistakes because I'm so scared of him. 

When he doesn't yell I always do better (ex.: He was telling me to drive faster even when I was driving close to the speed limit so I was so focused on speeding to the point where I almost ran a red light).

I think he doesn't like me. I have tried explaining myself several times to him but it's just not working. I don't know what to do anymore. I come home crying after every lesson and since I started my practical part of my license my depression has gotten worse. My therapist told me to stand up for myself but I'm just too scared of him and generally being in a car at this point. I dread every lesson and try to come up with reason to bail (very cowardly I know :-(   ). I have talked to my parents about this and first they blamed me but after seeing that I was always coming home crying or depressed they asked me if I wanted to change schools.

I'm worried that I will come off as a crybaby/weakling if I change schools and I'm just scared that I will disappoint my parents even more.

I'm very sorry if I come off as wimpy/dumb/lame but my depression makes everything so difficult for me. All my friends have their license and talk about how easy it was and as always I'm the only one that struggles.

Should I change schools and how should I go about it? 

Thank you for reading my post and thank you in advance!",30Mar2017,1

9,"All throughout my life I have been legitimately terrified of social situations. It's been getting better, but I'm still a little shy. I recently transferred to a new school, and I have class with this one guy that I see myself in way too much. He sits in the corner all class with his headphones on, and I never see him smile. He eats lunch in the hallway outside of the cafeteria and always by himself. I feel terrible for him, because I've been in the same situation myself for a majority of my life. I bought some chocolate chip cookies and tomorrow I'm going to try and sit with him and share them, (everyone likes cookies right?) but I'm scared this idea won't work and I'll make him feel like a charity case. All I want to do is make sure he has at least one friend. What do I do?

11,"Hey Reddit, there is something weighing heavily on my shoulders right now and I am looking for some unbiased opinions, I thank you if you take the time to read this. A little background, I went to academic magnet schools my entire life. I got good grades, played year round sports, and had no trouble at all with any aspect. Healthy family relationships, etc. I used to be afraid to miss anything; homework, class, ANYTHING. However, lately I’ve been in this weird slump of worry and sadness that has completely immobilized me. I mean I have been missing months of class, not turning things in, and generally screwing up my entire life. I don’t know why this happened or why I let so much time pass before I accepted that I need help. I just want to make things right but I feel as if it is too late. I have bailed on meetings with my advisor and other professors just because I have a panic attack right before I go to the meeting. Why is this happening? 

Right now, I am facing academic dismissal because we are 5 weeks from the end of the semester and I have hardly made any progress with classes or even attended them. There is no excuse for this type of behavior and that is why I can’t find peace or move on, I am greatly ashamed and just need some direction. Part of me is ready to get busy and do what it takes if I were to have a second chance, but the other part of me thinks there is a different meaning behind all of this.  This part of me believes that I never wanted to come to [my university] anyway. I still have a passion for what I chose to study here, but I don’t think I listened to my instincts when my first college plan didn’t work out. I may have just done what I had been doing well my whole life; listen and follow. I don’t think I’m wired for that, but don’t have the balls to stray from the people I’ve always been around. I stuck it out to my senior year and then shit goes down hill. (by the way, this isn’t just a feeling I started to have when I realized I was not doing well. Even with good grades and everything going right, I still had these thoughts/aspirations). I have no more direction at all. I have a small vision of what I want to do but I don’t have the slightest clue of how to get there. I don’t know who to go to for that kind of help, cause it seems like more of a personal thing.  Now on top of letting myself down and failing at what I’ve been doing my entire life pretty well, I’m afraid to hell of how to explain to my parents and friends and relatives that I wasted all this time and it makes me feel ashamed. 

I have complete confidence in myself that I have the ability to strive and adapt in my right setting, but again, I just cant figure out what to do to bust out of this slump. I always did great at everything in life when I had people telling me what to do and by when, etc. then I just kind of fell off when I started having to be the one telling myself what to do. However that’s not how I’ve always been, I used to be the one who would do what others said I COULDN’T. I don’t think this is going to make sense to anyone but god it feels good to write it down finally. So, friends, here I am finally letting this stuff out of my head. I could use a little advice.  

Thank you again if you took the time to read my post. I will answer any questions truthfully; as I understand that’s the only way I could receive effective advice.

She also says that before she meets him (I hope not... I'll feel so bad for Liam. He better run) she'll punch herself in the face so he can be concerned. Yikes? I mean, why can't she be happy for Liam? I need her to see that this is a crucial moment in his life. I thought she was a fan.

16,"Hey everyone!
So, I've been friends with my best friends for 3 years or so.  They've always kinda made fun of me more than anyone else but it's recently gotten worse.  I know friends pick on each other and stuff but I feel like they pick on me the most and the harshest.  So they always say I have ""autism"" and disabilities (which I find kinda offensive but that's another thing) and idk I'm just sick of it. They always make fun of me whenever I go along with the group. Today in class, I asked a question because we have a test and I guess the answer was kinda obvious. But I heard my friend (let's call her friend a) behind me imitating me, and I turned and half jokingly said ""stop making fun of me"" but I guess I was hurt and it showed because friend b who sits across from me saw I was hurt.  She told friend a to stop and I guess friend a felt bad because she apologized but it didn't feel very sincere.  Friend a made a new friend who's ""popular"" and her popular friend barely acknowledges me. It all makes me sad. I think I'm overreacting but this isn't the first time I've felt really hurt by the constant picking on.  It also makes me even more insecure.  If anyone has any advice on how to address the picking on thing with my friends without adding fuel to the fire that would be great. I'm sorry if I was rambling/ it didn't make sense but I'm just sad and can't think.

* The position I took was open for roughly 3 months when I came on because it's extremely difficult for them to find reliable people. We only have one flex officer who is trained to work at the site because of this. 
* Since I started working here I've had to hold over for people being late (and often 2+ hours late) several times
* My attendance has been basically perfect, I've probably been late twice 
* I've never been reprimanded for doing anything incorrectly and haven't had any issues with my coworkers when it comes to the job itself 
* I've heard rumors of people making upwards of 25% more than I make simply be leveraging and threatening to move on to a different company

Since graduating College, I landed a job as a Systems Analyst at large corporation. Plus side of this job is the 70k salary, which a large chunk of goes to student loans every 2 weeks. Downside is, I can't stand the job...Too much office politics, the work is really unsatisfying, and the 9-5 grind completely saps the energy out of me. 

Prior to this job I was a much more creative and content person. Played guitar almost everyday, read a lot, did really well in classes, and had a pretty decent social life. Now..not so much. I've dabbled in all these things, but I don't have the same time/energy I used to once 5 o clock hits. 

The obvious solution would be to quit this job. I've had trouble doing this because I'm worried another job in IT would be just as draining (especially a Systems Analyst role...) I've spent a little bit of my free time learning Web Development, but its hard to stay motivated after 8+ hours of screen time M-F. I feel like this job has removed any joy I once had for computers.

I've made a lot of healthy life changes over the past couple years by eating better and working out at least 3 days a week, which is probably how I've forced myself through these 2 years.Still, I feel like I don't know what my passion is in life because I simply don't have the energy to invest into anything.

I think the reason I cling to relationships so much is because my family life growing up wasn't healthy, so to be with someone is like a family to me. To have someone who is always there, until there not. I tend to put myself fully into someone and then as usual I end up getting hurt, because regardless of the comfort I gather from relationships my depression and anxiety destroy them. Not to mention when red flags come up in a relationship, I wave them away, for example one guy I was seeing told me how he does coke and I let it go without a second thought. 


Now after the third breakup with the same guy I've been seeing for almost a year, I realize that I let these people in, because I don't respect myself enough to know I'll be okay without them. I don't know how to even begin to fix myself and start to work on my self-esteem. I want to carry myself and be proud of who I am. I want to be confident enough to put my foot down and tell someone when something isn't okay in a relationship or call them on a deal breaker. I want to not fear doing something because of judgement or what someone will think of me. I just want to do it because it'll make me happy. I want to be strong, independent and happy on my own.

When I arrived at the hospital she looked so beat up.. bumps, bruises, blood everywhere. I made sure to be strong for my whole extended family was there, im talking aunts, uncles, cousins i haven't seen in three years... 

I calmed everyone down and I calmed my sister down which really helped her situation, I made her laugh and her whole mood changed when my brother and I got there... 

They took her to a CT scan and Xray and after hours of inspection and waiting, miraculously no broken bones, nor head trauma/bleeding/concussion. 

Only 1 tooth was half gone and others kind of chipped... 

After she was cleaned up and after a few stitches in her mouth she looked beat up.. but fine. 

She was hit by a Access-A-Ride truck who ate a red light and turned right (its illegal in NYC) and my sister was crossing the street from my aunts house to my moms house... My dad was a couple houses away and saw the whole thing... The doctors said she was extremely lucky she came out with superficial bruising... 

I stayed with her all night, today, and she looks SO much better, like her swelling has gone down tremendously and she can move around and talk a lot better, but of course she is all sore. 


now why I feel guilty ---- &gt; I feel so fucked up inside right now because she looked up to me , and still does so much.. 

I was less than a perfect example for her, I went through alcoholism, drug addiction... shes seen me come home fucked up a couple of years ago... and shes cried when I was kicked out of my house... I went through a really long time that I didn't speak to anyone in my family because I thought I had it all made up... I should have died so many times. Yet, I did manage to climb out of that hole and stop drinking alcohol, no drugs ( weed very rarely for my anxiety) and went vegan.. 

She told me that when she was rolling on the ground, the one thought that came through her head was one time when we were really young and she wanted ice cream but I didnt want to go and get some for her, so she went outside on her own and almost went into the street but I ran behind her and caught her.... 

that broke my heart.... literally in tears writing this.

how can I be such a shitty person to one of the only people in this world who looks up to me. Why couldn't I be there to catch her again... 

I was thinking of calling her and hanging out with her a couple days before it happened and when I saw the missed calls... the first call went to voicemail and my moms voicemail was baby lil sis like 8 years ago, and somehow I knew something happened to her..

She seems strong and fine, but Im so distraught... I couldn't be there to protect her, and I have been a less than perfect brother and role model.... 

We dont know where to start... I know fixing my sisters teeth is really the main priority... any lawyers/dentist out there that could give me any advice? 

Or advice on the whole situation.. anything helps..


tl;dr : Little sis got hit by a truck who ran a red light, she had a memory of me while getting hit, she looks up to me, but Ive been a really shitty human being and havent been there for her. i feel like shit....",30Mar2017,2

I'm working nights at UPS and they are paying 100% of my tuition, my book fees, and are giving me semester bonuses.

I have a fun time, but I mostly don't develop any attraction or feelings or want for a second date. As I said, im young and want to enjoy being single. 

Well tonight I went out with a girl and I actually really clicked with her. She was attractive, very intelligent, well traveled, ambitious, the whole nine. And we had a great time. Kissed at the end and said our goodbyes. Maybe 15-20 minutes later she texts me how good of a time she had, thank you for everything, I hope you're not too tired tomorrow (I wake up pretty early usually.)

So I think the answer to should I ask her out again is probably a yes. I think she would want to go out with me again. The main question is how? I'm great at talking to girls, but asking a girl out a second time is way different than the first. The second date becomes a more serious date. 

She mentioned she wanted to try a dark restaurant, so I'm thinking maybe there? If there even is one open in my city. Idk, any advice is appreciated.

Separately, I've come to the decision to switch from counseling to a more intense psychotherapy (or do both). I've been seeing the same counsellor for around 4 years, and I'm afraid finding a psychotherapist will be difficult since I won't feel as connected with them as I do with my counselor.

My psych teacher is actually a practicing psychotherapist, though, and after being in her class all semester, I feel like I could really open up to her.

I'm not a big birthday person. I love planning for other people's but I don't really enjoy too much focus on me.

They have been my entire life, and I've never been able to do anything about it. I want to move out and be independent. I'm tired of seeing them drunk and high out of their minds all the time. I'm tired of getting into incoherent arguments about it. I just want to move on with my life.

Anyways, about me, and to give you a good idea of me, I'll start from the beginning. 

I was born to a pig vet and a database management specialist. My parents were 36ish and 41, at the time of my birth. Nothing special about me, to be honest. Just another blonde, blue eyed american kid. Mom had come from the east coast. Her father made shitloads of money, but is a total asshole and she had, from what I can tell, a shitty childhood. She's smart, to be sure, and generally a nice person. She's talkative and outgoing, but a huge control freak. I'll get to that later. Dad is the opposite. Middle class parents, born in Cali to people from Oklahoma and New York. Lived in an average house in an average neighborhood. His mom was easygoing, his dad was like my mother. Crazy control freak, otherwise a-ok. He's like his mom, chill, more of a bend but don't break kinda guy. He gets mad, but it takes quite a bit to get there.  

Back to me. I was pretty average, I spoke early but not by much, I was kinda normal or slower physically. I've never been very big, I'm more of a mind kinda person. The only interesting thing about my childhood was that I told insightful things to my parents. I went to preschool, made a few friends, ehhh, nothing interesting. I then went to a public elementary bilingual school 15 minutes away from our house. I was a normal kid. Gifted and Talented, good with languages (spanish, in this case) but I hung out with the cool kids and became good friends with them. I was ok at sports, not great but not bad. I don't really remember much, as I only attended up to 3rd grade. 

During this period, however, my home life got really bad. See, my parents had a common law marriage, something that really confused my religious friends. They fought a lot, tbh, but I was pretty naive and didn't notice. We were normal. I visited my family on the east coast every summer for a few weeks. We weren't that close, but mom had me do it because my cousin Sally* and I were really tight. During one of these summers, when my mom would fly out a few days before I left for Colorado to pick me up, my dad left her. I can't really blame him, as he continued to support us and let us live in the house they co-owned and was pretty chill. We got back, I spent the weekends at his condo and the rest at her house. I loved them both, and they didn't really fight that much after he left, so it was easy to ignore but def. affected me. Dad moved back after a few months. We were 'normal' again. 

Two years later, my mother pushed us to move abroad. I love America, so it was tough, but I didn't have any say so it didn't matter. We moved to Oaxaca, Mexico. I could speak spanish almost fluently, and so we did it to perfect my spanish and move back, maybe learn a little bit about the world. We were gonna stay for 11 months, but we didn't leave for three years. We rented out our house for income, which paid our mortgage and a bit more, but we spent nearly 300k living for 3 years. Dad didn't work, mom was getting old (49) and obviously couldn't work remote.

At first I attended a public school, while also doing some US homeschool shit. I worked my ass off, but I didn't really have anything else to do. I was a nothing; no interests, no culture, nothing. After a year of that, I'd made 3 long term friends and we decided it wasn't for me. I had straight A's, that wasn't the problem. We then decided to do Mexican public school, but that was a fucking joke. That's where my life went downhill. The schoolwork was so boring and useless, I never did it. I shit you not, I never did a single thing for that place. I went, I checked all the boxes, and I got straight A's on tests. I hated it; the kids thought I was weird (snow white skinned blond blue eyes in mexico? Can't blame them) and bullied me. It sounds so dumb, but looking back it makes more sense. Whatever, I lived, but it fucked me up.

We then decided to go back to the US. Keep in mind I had no social skills with American kids and wasn't used to doing difficult stuff. I did COVA during the public school year, but it wasn't that challenging. I enrolled in a 12k a year language focused private school. My father got his job back, making a little less. It was tight, I think we lost money that year. The school sucked, it was teeny and very difficult. I had already been lying about the public school, and finally the stress and pressure got to me and I just stopped doing my english work 2 months before the class ended. 

That shit didn't work out. I learned a lot? maybe? I'm really not sure. We re-rented the house, my father quit his job and we moved back, doing homeschool. I'm not going to get into the specifics of that, the last two years have been a blur. Needless to say, I have very few friends. Will explain later.

This brings me to today. I'm smart, not brilliant but above your average 'stick my dick in something/beat the shit out of someone' high schooler. Sure, I have no idea if that is a true stereotype, but I haven't gone to an american school for 7 years. I have social skills, but I just don't understand people my age. 

The reason this is suddenly important is because I'm looking at my life and I really see very few options. I have no close friends, I don't really have a future in Mexico but don't have many options in the US either. I feel like I should return there but the logistics of that are just fucking impossible. 

Here's what you should know about me, and what I'd like to know from you:

I'm 14, male. I'd like to be involved in politics, likely as a staffer or analyst but I have no idea where life will lead me. I've had problems with lying, seriously bad problems. I'm working on becoming a better person. I like to express my emotions, frankly, bottling them up and being a passive aggressive little POS is just not my thing. I'd like to attend CU Boulder or Northwestern. (Political Sciences)

What are 'normal' teenagers like?
A friend of mine since we were 2 came and visited us, she seems interested in me, gave me her snap and insta. Is she just adding me cause she feels bad and wants a follower or...? what do y'all think

Should I move back to the US?
Should I continue homeschooling?
Public School or Homeschool?
What is it like being normal?

Thanks, 
Apologies for the rambling, if you can read through it all, thanks a ton!
Have a good one.

Doubting my long term relationship, crushing on a guy at work (that I hardly know) which is the only comfort I get at the moment.
a few other, lesser issues happening too
anyway...

Last week I was told I would not be kept on at work once my contract ends (business reasons). This has came as a massive, massive blow. It was the one consistent thing in my life. I could go into work and leave my problems at the door. I am trying to fight it, even if it requires going to another department but it's a struggle. The job is in the O&amp;G industry and I'm paid a pittance. I am trying to get a contract extension for just over the summer to save for my masters.

95,"Currently 18 years of age and packing lady bits.

Genuinely dislike new people touching me. Bad with both emotional and physical intimacy. Socially awkward. 

~~Clearly a keeper, am I right?~~

I've made a significant but rather tiny group of friends in college, and I find myself kind of iffy on where I stand and what to do right now with myself in order to avoid scaring them off or losing them because I'm being silly or dumb in certain instances.

** Instance One:** I was having a conversation with a friend, let's call her Betty, about just how much I dislike being touched or grabbed without permission and, well unthinkingly, she does just *that* while explaining how another friend in our group had been pulling her around while dancing at a tiny get-together back at her place earlier.

Her hand's on my wrist, she tugs me forward and I stumble a little, nothing big or really harmful, but for some reason I'm fucking **terrified**. I don't know where it came from. I don't even know why I cried, but for almost two minutes straight I was completely scared and didn't want her or anyone to touch me. The thought of anyone's hands on me just made me feel sick, but she kept trying to comfort me and made it worse. I don't know where the hell it came from. But it happened and although she doesn't treat me like glass, I'm pretty sure she still remembers.

** Instance Two:** Friend 2, Jill is a socialite. She's extraverted while I am introverted. I like my space. She likes to be in other people's space. She likes to cuddle with friends. I do not. Being so close and up and into another peron's personal bubble just makes me uncomfortable. I've just recently managed to convince myself to initiate hugs. I don't want to hurt her feelings because I know her intentions are innocent and she just likes the close-contact and is a very hands-on friend with pretty much everyone, but it's not something I'm comfortable with.

There was a small gathering at a friend's house. There's no room anywhere. A bunch of snoring college students sprawled in every surface. I sleep on the floor with a blanket I deem is okay to share with Jill as long as she keeps her space since she doesn't have one. Jill proclaims she wants to cuddle. Gets all up in my bubble. Doesn't touch me, so I'm a little ruffled but I'm a'ight. I'm a big girl. I can handle it. Reaches a hand over me to grab her phone off the charge, her arm brushes over my side and stays on longer than I expected; and I'm immediately all queasiness and casually asking her to move her hand away like she just squeezed a handful of coyotebaby ass rather than just grazed my skin.

** Instance Three:** Jill and Betty didn't know eachother until I introduced them. They're both social people. They both are very touchy-feely kinda people. They hit it off fast. The have no issues being in eachothers space. They touch and joke so casually in ways that I can't manage each time we're all together. I, admittedly, feel pretty shitty. Jill gives Betty her number. They text consistently and make plans and joke and the conversation still runs strong when I'm gone. I try and meet them on their wavelength, and it just isn't clicking. It doesn't feel right and I feel like a background character in the whirlwind bromance going on between them.

Not really a big deal, I'm used to running on the sidelines as it's something I've grown accustomed to. But, if I'm to be completely honest, it does sting, and I wonder if there's anything I can do to get better at socializing or at least to avoid a more permanent third-wheel status?",30Mar2017,5
96,"I'm a 22 year old female, and I will be 23 later this year. In the four years I have been out of high school, I have accomplished absolutely nothing, unless you consider accumulating about 18 credits through a community college as something to be proud of. I have no idea what to do with my life. I have depression, social anxiety, and physical health issues (ibs, ovarian cyst that refuse to go away). I also have perfectionist tendencies--for example, I have withdrawn from several college courses due to the fear of not getting a desired grade in them. Basically, I give up on things easily. I feel as though I am worthless, stupid, and untalented. I constantly compare myself to other people. I'm also painfully shy, aloof, withdrawn, and detatched. I honestly do not understand the thought processes of other people, and I find it hard to relate to most people. I also have a tendency to withdraw from people for long periods of time, and I hate being in loud, crowded, bright places. 












































I've never had a job, I've never been in a relationship, and I have no friends. I feel as though most people think I'm a weirdo and snob, due to the fact that I find it hard to open up to people.




The thing is, I do have an idea of the things I like. However, the things I enjoy are viewed as useless by a large swath of society. The only things I really like are art history and music history, but I feel as though I am too old to pursue a degree in one of these subjects. Another thing is that jobs in these fields usually require a Master's degree or PhD, and I don't know if I could tolerate being in school for over 5-6 years. Also, the job market for these jobs sucks, unless you have tons of connections. I'd also like to avoid ending up with massive student loan debt. 
































People have told me that I should become a paralegal or a graphic designer, but I'm not sure what level of education these jobs require. I have no interest in working in the medical field, unless it's something like a medical coder or secretary, and again, I don't know how to get into these fields. 





















I have taken almost every free career or personality test online, from mbti test to color career test (pathetic I know). Most of these test say that I should become a librarian or library technician, a translator, a technical writer, an artist, an HR employee, an archivist, an editor, an actuary, an accountant, or a paralegal. In terms of my personal interest, I like reading, researching and writing about subjects I enjoy, and I'll occasionally dable with painting, drawing, and playing music, but that's about it. 





















































I feel as though I am too idealistic and out of touch with reality. Ever since I was about 11, I've dreamed of being a housewife. It sounds incredibly stupid to aspire to be a housewife in this day and age, but at some point in my life I really do want to find the love of my life, get married, and have 1-3 children. While I have always loved learning about different subjects, I've never been interested having a ""career"", so to speak.

I just don't like the idea of someone going through my stuff whether it's my phone, computer, closet, etc. She has said before, ""You can look through my phone.""

98,"I [24/F] am very unhappy in my relationship with my boyfriend [26/M] of four years.

We have lived together for 2 of the 4 years that we have been dating and are currently in a sticky situation. Our landlord is evicting us and we must find a new apartment in the next month.

I love my boyfriend, really and truly I do, but the relationship has been draining me for a while now and I can't help but feel as though it is my fault the situation has reached critical mass so to speak. 

My boyfriend is an alcoholic. He is clearly depressed. He has dropped out of school multiple times, he has been working at a retail job that he doesn't hate for the past year for a bit above minimum wage (the longest he has retained employment in the time we have been dating), and in his free time all he wants to do is drink and play video games.

He does not pay rent. He does not clean or do laundry or help around the house (although he is an AMAZING cook when he works up the energy). When he is drunk, he is mean. In the past few months he has been a lot better about this and I have tried to forgive him for some of the things he has said and done to me in the past while drinking as he has been so good recently but it is hard. He is still drinking. I worry about his mental health. A normal person can work 30-odd hours a week and still have the energy to do thinks such as run errands and do the dishes, but he can't even be bothered to book us some dentists appointments. Meanwhile I work 40 hours a week and go to school, do all the housework, and more often than not.

This is relevant because he does not make too much money and has not saved any. He refuses to get a phone and has fallen out of touch with many of his friends. While his family relationship is good at the moment it has been strained due to his behavior in the past. If I broke up with him, where would he go? Can I turn someone that I love out on the streets just because I am tired and feel unappreciated? How can I do this without him spiraling into a pit of self-destruction? I've been trying to build him up and get him to a place where he could function on his own, but he fights me at every turn. Should I give him an ultimatum to shape up or ship out? I just feel so lost and unhappy. I care for him so much but I can't spend my life being both his mother and his lover. Everyone that loves me has told me to leave him but I just can't bring myself to put him into a situation where he could be a danger to himself or others.

101,"So i met this girl a few months ago and we really hit it off. It started out as a friendship but things changed lately. I really like the girl and honestly i can't imagine a day without talking to her. Skip ahead to earlier this week when she couldn't sleep and she was telling me about some stuff she was dealing with. 

We talked about it for about an hour or so and then i felt comfortable to share something with her. I told her about a really traumatic time in my life from my childhood when my parents fostered 2 girls who were sexually abused.

 The girls were really strange and they did some fucked up stuff that i will never be able to forget. For some stupid reason i felt it would make us closer if i told this girl about that. I described every detail and suddenly she told me to stop.

She said it was so awful she didn't want to hear anymore so i stopped. I immediately apologised and regretted it. I didn't know what i was thinking :( i just felt so much trust and i had never told anyone about it. I still can't believe i thought it was a good idea. 

No me and this girl we used to talk a lot.... Like i mean pretty much all the time we have a chat going on. But now that has stopped. She used to always send me a snap to say goodnight with a kiss and that has stopped. I have to start most conversations and she really doesn't treat me the same anymore.

She text me this morning saying that we will talk about it this evening and i am terrified she is going to tell me she is done with me. I can't sleep, i cant eat and i have the constant feeling of holding back tears... I don't want to have to live without her....",30Mar2017,1

I was wondering if it's still morally wrong to swear or curse if you're playing a role. Or is it simply you just respectively being that character? Obviously you shouldn't hurt anyone or have sex because your character does it, (that's why it's called acting) but you should try to keep their personality traits and talk like them right?

106,"I am 18 and got mediocre grades in my last year of Sixth Form which means I barely scraped my way into a medium-low rank university (Uni of Aberdeen in scotland). I took a year out to try and consider my options and figure out what to do but I'm running out of time to decide and still haven't figured out what I should do. All I've done this year is work for a couple months, register to retake some exams independently, and lose all my friends because they can't be arsed with a lazy failure with no hobbies.

Even if I get better grades this year I still can't really go to a better university, most good unis don't accept retakes over a 3 year period, they want you to do good in your 2 years that you normally get.

It's going to be expensive and completely different in Aberdeen and I will be there for 4 years as opposed to 3 years in english unis to get a bachelors degree.

It's really frustrating me because I didn't realise how many paths to success I closed off when I became a lazy fuck in high school. I am considering giving up on education and joining the military (RAF or Navy). Maybe i'll learn some discipline and figure out how to sort out my life. But then I don't want to spend my youth in misery missing out on all the normal experiences people have at uni - i've been pretty isolated from stuff like girlfriends and doing cool shit with friends during my life, so I really want to see what that's like too.

My parents didn't go to Uni and they don't know much about the whole education ranking system and how employers target certain schools so I didn't get much advice from them. They don't really have an opinion on it, which also frustrates me, because I can give them ONE reason as to why uni would be a bad choice and they'll say don't go, and then I can say ONE thing that would make it worthy, and they completely 180 on their opinion and tell me to go, and this constant flip flopping around advice just confuses me more. Careers counselors didn't give me much advice, the last one I talked to literally said to me 'well you CAN go to university so what's the problem?' not realising that just because I CAN go to a mediocre uni doesn't mean that I am willing to go into £50,000 debt for a degree that may not even pay for itself.

As far as I know (which may not be correct but this is my perspective from the research i've done) the way to get a good job that is actually relevant to your studies and pays decently is to go to a top university and get a 1st class honours, and that even if you go to a mediocre uni and get a 1st class you may still not get good jobs because there are just so many other grads from better unis competing with you.

So my question is, is it worth it to go to Aberdeen and pay over £50,000 for this degree, and also spend 4 years studying, or should I do something else? And what else could I do aside from the typical choices of Uni/Military/Apprenticeships/Min wage unskilled work.

Sorry for the length, I tried to summarise my problems as best I could, I could go on for hours though.

111,"TLDR; I made the decision of transferring to study online. Didn't get many as many credits toward my degree as I wanted. Feel depressed about my decision and career choice. I don't know what to do next.

I went to University straight out of high school. I didn't get very good marks, so I went for a no-brainer class hoping to transfer into what I ""wanted"" to do. It wasn't what I wanted to do - it was just what I felt like I should be doing, and one of the easiest university degrees. 

After my first year, I done that course for 2.5 years before deciding to move back home with my parents and study online. They thought it was because I didn't like travelling or the University life, but honestly it was because I have crippling society anxiety. I thought studying online would free up a lot of my time to eat right, exercise and work on self development. 

I was so happy I'd made that decision until the online University had promised me that I'd be able to ""take off from where I'd left the other University."" Turns out it wasn't that simple. Now I'm stuck with 2 year progress that I'd spend 3.5 years in the making. This doesn't bother me as much as the fact that everyone knows that I'm going to university to be a teacher, and I'm due to finish the the end of 2017. Without the exemptions, I'll finish at the end of 2018 if I'm lucky. 

I really want to just move onto the next part of my life: I want to get a job, a house and a newer car. All of my friends are starting to make roots in my hometown and I'm stuck miserable doing a degree I don't even love that been pushed back even further. 

My parents seem very disappointed in me and the situation I've gotten myself in. Sometimes I honestly feel like killing myself. I daydream about how I'd do it and it brings me so much more joy than anything else around me. I made one stupid decision and now I'm living with being a failure. Even if I were able to deal with the embarrassment of telling everyone I had ANOTHER year to complete, I don't even think I would love the job it leads to. I've been racking my brain for anything at all I'd love to do with the plan I could run away to the city and do my own thing there. Nothing seems great to me. I hate myself and my decisions and I don't know what to do. 

I've been in this depressing daze for almost a year now and I don't know what to do or where to go. I've never felt so helpless or embarrassed in my entire life. 

What should I do? Any advice? Has anyone been in a similar situation? ",30Mar2017,1

113,"Hi, so this is a throwaway account because of privacy reasons.

For the past 3 years, I don't think I've been happy. There were a chain of events which just changed my world completely. Firstly, an important family member, who I looked up to passing away, being kicked out of school, and who I considered to be my best friend abandoning me with no warning. The friendship was long distance because I was the outcast at my school, not really having anyone to talk or relate to.

Because of all that stress, I didn't want to talk to anyone, which was a big mistake. For some reason or another, the stress seemed to have manifested a medical condition which I have to deal with. I get serious pains in my abdomen, I can't eat, and I'm tired all the time. With the medication I take, I can't really leave my house because of a weakened immune system, thus making it somewhat hard to actually travel anywhere. 

The problem is that all of the friends that I do have live in different countries, and I really want to visit them and feel happy in their company, but my condition just makes it completely impossible. It's kind of weird having something that makes you sleep all the time, but that thought keep coming back to you in nightmares. I've tried constantly to get the ok to visit, but my health always just gets worse last minute, building up my hopes, just to have them smashed.

Sorry for the essay, but I'll try and get my point across. For the 3 years, I haven't really been the same, I can't talk to anyone locally, because I'm not really comfortable with appointments, or anything of the sort. I just want to feel somewhat happy again, but I have no idea where to begin.

I have always been decently smart, and have been told so by many teachers/relatives and I think this is where my problem stems from. I have never needed to study too much to get decent grades. If I am awake during class, and study before an exams, I get a decent grade (even in college). And because of this I just waste most of my free time doing things that are not important to me. I waste my time during the day, and I regret it when I go to sleep, but immediately the next day itself I do the same shit over and over.

Tuesday on my way home, I was stuck behind a red light I hear a familiar bang. I look up and I see a car on its side and another car next to it. I call 911 and turn on my hazards and run/jog (foot is still not completely healed) to the vehicles, at this point the car on its side is catching on fire. When I make it to the vehicles I talk to the driver of the car on its side, I asked for injuries and asked if anyone is still in the cars. Too both of these he said no (however his arm is clearly cut up). He was around my age 18 and was freaking out, almost in tears about the car. I guess it was his family's and was new for them. As another lady was already calming him down. I went to move my car to allow emergency vehicles through when they come.

I then waited as traffic was being directed and all the passenger and drivers were on the other side of the road being taken care of by other witness and emergency personal. I waited for the scene to get managed and I went to talk to an officer to give my name and # for a witness statement on the color of the light in my direction ( all I saw).

Anyways I know I acted appropriately and nothing I could do would make it better but for some reason I keep running the situation over and over again in my head. I also think about my crash as well.

One of those dogs, we got about 13 years ago, so she's pretty old and needs a lot of medicine and check ups.  For some reason, she thinks since that dog always slept in my room, it's 'my dog'.

Now that I'm moved out, I didn't take any animals with me.  Yet she expects me to pay for this one dogs expenses.  I've tried to fight with her before and she just threatens to put the dog down since 'she can't afford it', even though she's taking 2-3 trips down south every year...

Heard from a co-worker (he's the sweetest, chillest guy---has has no reason to fib) that the girl who does the same job as me (makes everything easier when there's two of us), was talking to another co-worker and basically said: she does not like me, she thinks she can do the job alone, and that I'm a nuisance. And for the record, the people who informed me are trusted friends inside and outside of work, as much as they hate drama, they have my back.



I always am pleasant with her, I mean hell it makes the day easier when we sit 15ft apart 5x a day, 8.5 hrs a day. I have given her rides home when her car wasn't in commission.

My best friend, who knew about my crush on this special girl, decided to plan something for all of us to do. So, at the end of that school week, we planned to head up to Raleigh, NC to eat at a small Irish restaurant and see a movie. 

That Friday, I picked up my best friend, my crush, and another friend of mine. *(We'll just call her ""my friend"", while calling my best friend ""my best friend"".)* Anyway, the 45-minute car ride was filled with my crush making a few witty comments that were aimed at ""picking"" on me. Once we got to the restaurant, she sat with my best friend on the opposite side of the booth. While we ate, when I went to talk, instead of being on her phone like my two friends were, she held my eyes while I spoke and had no trouble keeping the conversation going. After we ate, my best friend decided it'd be best if we stopped by the mall to buy a movie there to watch back at my house, so we did just that. Once we got to the mall, I pulled up to the front of the mall, allowing everyone to get out of the car; however, she refused to get out, saying she didn’t want me walking alone. As we entered the mall, she immediately pulled me off to go and try out this trampoline jump station. It’s worth mentioning this girl isn’t big on being all “touchy touchy”. As the trampoline was being prepared for her to jump on, she placed my hand over her heart, telling me to feel her heartbeat. She held it there for a couple of seconds before returning it to my side. After she got her turn on the ride, we met up with my two friends and went back to my house to watch a movie. While at my house, she cuddled up next to me during the movie, resting her head on my shoulder. She soon fell asleep within 15-minutes of starting the movie. When she woke up, she commented, ""We are way too close!"" However, she barely moved over any. After the movie ended, I took my friend home. Then, with my best friend and my crush in the car, I drove to take her home.
	
Over the next few weeks after this, we’ve talked more. We text, Facetime, and Snapchat! We’ve had serious conversations too! She actually opens up to me. Her best friend has even been talking to one of my friends! Her best friend has said things along the lines of…“Does he like her?”...“They’ve been getting along pretty well!” **Should I try and figure out from her best friend whether I have a shot or not?**

This is where things get complicated. My ex-girlfriend, who I dated for two and a half years, is also in color guard; therefore, they’ve been *casual* friends. My ex isn’t exactly over me at the moment, so she’s constantly trying to prevent me from spending time with my crush. For example, me and my crush were supposed to be watching a movie at my house a couple of weekends ago, but our plans were ruined when my ex-girlfriend sent a text message to my crush, stating she didn’t feel comfortable with just the two of us being alone together. In all, this frustrated me. Why should my ex-girlfriend have any right to intervene with who I want to spend my time with? Why should my ex-girlfirend have to ruin a potential relationship for me? My crush ended up canceling on me, apologizing and explaining we should have considered how my ex-girlfriend would feel. My crush hates confrontation. She can’t stand for anyone to be mad at her. She tries her best to please everyone, never putting herself first. This is one of the main reasons I feel as if I’ll never be able to date her. Eventually, my ex-girlfriend texted her, stating she no longer cared if me and my crush spent any time together. Still, my crush will never consider dating me until she knows it won’t hurt my ex-girlfriend.

Today, I’m happy as ever. She asked me to go get frozen yogurt with her after school, which I happily obliged to. We talked for an hour and a half, sitting close with our arms tangled together. We even planned to hang out Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday! Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday we have planned to attend our school’s play to support many of our friends that play a role in it! Friday, I convinced her to allow me to pick her up from her house, so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant (Her Favorite) and go back to my home for a scary movie! I’m glad I’m able to spend a lot of time with her this week, but I need advice on what I should be doing. **Should I embrace our flirtatious manner and push it a little farther than we’ve been? (Cuddling during the movie, hugging her before she leaves, etc.) If so, how do I go about doing those things?**

I know this is all a lot to take in. Most of it probably sounds stupid, but I’m tired of repeatedly asking my friends for advice. They’re just as confused as I am. I really want to make things work with this girl. I don’t have to be in a relationship with her by tomorrow, but I’d like closure knowing I won’t lose her to someone who’d be easier to date. I have to make things work. I want to take her time. I want to eventually call her mine. She’s been cheated on four times by a guy she really thought she loved. I want to be everything she needs and more. I could go on and on. Thank you all for listening. **Any comments or advice will be greatly appreciated!**

**TL;DR; : What should I do when me and my crush hang out more? Do I push our flirtatious manners a little more or try and just be friends? How do I lead this into a relationship? Does she even like me?**",30Mar2017,2
133,"I'm currently seeking a litigation for a personal injury. My lawyer has sent over our contingency agreement for how the case will proceed and how compensation will go. Everything seems fairly routine and normal within it. However there is one part that I am concerned about, and I just want to ensure I'm doing my homework. It is as followed;

""In the event that no monies are recovered, the lawyers shall not be entitled to any fees. But shall be paid and reimbursed for its costs, expenses, disbursements, and GST incurred.""

As someone who is fairly low income, I am concerned about that, in the event i lose my case, what do ""costs, expenses, disbursements"" mean, and how much could that cost me? This is in Canada to give context. Any advice and answers would be amazing!

134,"In the next year or so I will be faced with changing my life in a direction of my pleasing. Currently I am an art director for a small ad agency and have decided that I need to move on somewhere with my life, a new city, new job, etc. I have a degree and am progressing in my career but have found it frustrating getting to the level that I wish to be at these past few years. Basically I am deciding between applying to a graduate program that will grant me the opportunity to build my portfolio more easily in the next two years as well as getting recruited to work in a company pretty much of my pleasing - and moving to a new city getting a job and trying to work my way up through time uncertain of what sort of growth I can attain or what level of business I will be working with. 

Although I am aware one could say how can you be certain that I will be satisfied with my job prospects post-graduation, the level of program is the highest and I am confident in the returns. 

But I would be sacrificing two years and my life-savings to go to grad school, in one sense I could see myself being successful and happy not going to school. Also I could see myself really regretting not going to school and never reaching the level of success that I want. 

It reminds me of what parallel universe do I wish to live in, trust me I know that this is a great problem to have but I am still struggling with making a decision. It would be nice keeping the money I would be putting forward towards school and living a comfortable life, but for how long will I be comfortable?

Anyways, curious as to how people go about making huge decisions, with your gut or your head? Is it a sort of never look back mentality and just pick whichever feels right? ",30Mar2017,1

143,"I was raised into a decent family, i loved my mum and dad very much. My dad was diagnosed with huntingtons disease just after i was born. I found out at 16 that i have a 50% chance of inheriting it.

Sadly the disease ruined my dads mind. He used to be so loving, but it was taken away from him. He turned violent and abusive through no fault of his own. I was a spoilt bratt, I dropped out of school, went into care for like 6 months and talked back at him when he was being rude. 

It felt very strange growing up- all of my friends had normal families. My mum didnt tell me what was wrong with him, so i grew up resenting my dad not knowing why he was getting so angry. It made me the weird kid in primary school. I didnt wear proper clothes, my hair was matted and i got bullied a lot. My mother is so kind, however too kind. She was very timid and didnt know how to look after dad during his mood swings. I do not blame her - however, i do believe more could have been done to look after me and my younger sibling. I would never say that to her as i do not want to hurt her feelings.

He took a turn for the worse when i was around 14. He broke my nose, threw a keyboard on me, rowed with mum and beat my younger sibling. He apologised every time after it happened. Twice he cried, i felt terrible. The day i went into care was because he beat my brother so badly, and i decided it was too much to stay at home. 

I didnt last long in care. Being 16, i was allowed to leave. After a row with my foster mum over skipping school, i left and returned home. Things were okay with my dad but soon took a turn for the worst. He was ordering me about in the house, he got angry of i couldnt fix something, or if i couldnt get downstairs in time. One time, i heard him rowing with mum downstairs. I cant remember what about-  i walked downstairs scared for my mum and he punched me in the face, breaking my nose. He was taken away and arrested, however i didnt press charges. He was released and we were told to leave the house. We had to leave my dad which i feel horrible about. We stayed in another town about 30 miles away with my grandmother. School was a trek, my mum had to drive us for an hour each way. I got tired. Lost my friends in school as i became distant. Became a loner. The embarrassment of becoming a loner and the stress of everything got to me, and i started skipping school. I remember sitting in the town library, reading books untill the time came to meet my highschool boyfriend at his school. Id stay out late, smoke weed or whatever the plan was, and get the train home. I was always tired. I couldnt keep up. I didnt even arrive to my exams because i didnt want to see anyone from school. I because so anxious.

I managed to get into college around a year later. I was still living 30 miles away from my dad. He constantly called my mum begging him to come back. He made suicide threats. I was so concerned for his safety, that i took a few secret trips to his house. He never wanted me to leave him. My family would have been angry if they found out that i put myself at risk. 

One day, the police came round and told me that he had jumped off a car park close to my house. I was distraught. He broke both of his legs, fractured his spine and pelvis. I went to see him in the hospital, and he gave me a blank stare. It was so hard for all of us. I tried talking to him but i think where he was on medication he couldnt talk. I left the hospital and when i was about to get the train home, someone from the hospital had said that he was trying to call me. I felt SO guilty, i cant put in to words how horrible i felt. I blamed myself- the arguments, leaving him etc. I still do. 

My dads side of the family organised for him to go into a care home closer to where they lived. My dad used to complain about how they shut him out- once they never visited him in around 6 years. His sister visited at one point introducing herself to me and my sibling by her formal name. We knew who she was. It seemed rather rude leaving us to care for him when we was not capable. She knew that. 

Grandad seemed to blame us for the mistreatment of dad. My mum recieved a letter telling her how horrible she was, and that he doesnt want anything thing to do with her kids again (me and younger sibling). I felt so hurt and rejected. She was on the phone to dads sisters husband, who was being horrible to her. And i just lost it. I phoned him up giving abuse, so angry that he blamed my mum and i. I regret loosing my temper, it made me just as bad. But i was a mouthy bitch at that point and wouldnt take anything. 

We moved back to the house. My dad had killed the kitten that he bought to get us back i think (he knew me and younger sibling loved cats). My brother was first in, he looked in the bathtub and saw it. I heard a horrible scream. 

Flash foward to now (sorry im rambling theres a lot to go through), the memories are everywhere. The parking lot, punch holes in doors, the scratches in the bathtub. My dads old room, trashed from where he ruined it before he left. I left college, but now im stuck. I have a very supportive boyfriend who has helped me through a lot of my issues, but has his own life to deal with and its stresses. 

I have no motivation anymore. I dont know what to do with my life. I do not know how to move on. 

The questions that im asking are-

Is this my fault? Did i bring this on myself? With the talking back. 

How can i move on when theres memories everywhere? I have no money to move out. 

Should i get tested for huntingtons disease? If i know that ive got it, it could cause a lifetime of pain. But not knowing could be just as painful.

Should i apologise to my dads side of the family? Ive tried to explain to my dads sister, she partly understands. My grandad will not have any of it. I really feel rejected.

ANY advice would be appreciated. But please be nice as this whole situation hurts me so badly. Honest, but nice.  ",30Mar2017,1
145,"So last week we received a letter telling us we would have to pay $15 a month to park(will be deducted through our paychecks). And the letter needs to be signed and handed in to our managers by tomorrow Friday, 31 if we want to park. 
The place I work at rents out parking space at a different property which is about a 5 min walk away from where we work. The property where we rent parking has increased their rent price, so now we are being told by the place where I work at, have to pay in order to park on the rented space. 
All employees (Full-time and part-time) have to pay $15($0.75 a day) to help with the increased rent price. Which I think is kind of unfair because I am part-time and I obviously don't work everyday because I go to school. I know people who have worked here for over 15 years and now have to pay for parking.

There are a few plazas around the area not too far from work where maybe I can park(but scared of getting a ticket/towed)? maybe I can ask other properties if I can park on their space?  Point is we are being forced to pay because we really have no other place to park and I really don't want to pay $15 a month (more than my netflix subscription!) for parking when I only work 14 hours per week.

146,"So I'm a second year Aeronautical/mechanical double major. I'm doing fine in school, that's not what I need help on. I've always wanted to do a study abroad in Germany so I signed up to do one. But I'm finding out that if I go on the study abroad then I would set my graduation date back a full year, because my school only offers certain necessary courses in the spring/fall, and I'm doing a spring study abroad. I can't afford to do that. 
My options are: drop the Aero degree, take the fall off, take a coop(supposing someone will hire me for one, or to take classes over the summer. 
Problems: I will not drop the major I've worked too hard
There are few Aero classes offered online through any school over the summer
I would have to have someone hire me for a coop and so far no one has replied despite my number of attempts
And my advisor has been the opposite of helpful, often telling me that I should see someone else or that it's my issue

Does anyone in the nursing field(or medical field) have any idea how helpful it would be to know Spanish? Even just conversationally? 

My logical side is saying take 3 classes this coming fall( I only need two but 3 classes keeps me full time and lets my scholarships continue) get a decent job, work full time in the second semester and save money for nursing school and get an apartment (which I will need to do because the nursing school does not have on campus housing like the university I am currently attending does). On the other hand my emotional side is saying ""study abroad, f*ck money, life is about experiences"". 
I'm going to school to become a nurse practitioner. The program I'm in is a transfer program where I complete a prerequisite courses at a university and then transfer to the nursing school to finish the last 4 years of my schooling. Classes for the nursing school start in May. BUT I can't start this May because I have 2 more classes to finish before I transfer. This leaves me with a whole year where all I need to do is take 2 classes and apply to the nursing school.

151,"So some background I'm 22, over the winter semester I took a class where I (stupidly) refused to get the text book as the previous semester where I didn't use any of them my lowest grade was a B. I made a deal (albeit I was pressured into it) where if I got lower than a C, I wouldn't be able to play on my Xbox one where I mainly play World of Tanks. I tried using the browser editor to change the grade of a C- to a C+ but the next day my father drove down to the school (which is about 45min away) where they told him ""the only way that grade would've​ changed like that is if someone altered it"" he confronted me later that day where I told him the truth. As a result there's a nest cam watching my Xbox one. So I tried tampering with the cam early on but then decided after Dad being suspicious to not try that anymore. This semester I'm doing ok but I plan on doing better as I'd like to have a good GPA so I can do something meaningful with my life once I graduate. But a couple weeks ago I found a little loophole, my Xbox 360 which has been sitting on top of a box of wires we keep in the garage since I got my Xbox one also has World of Tanks where the progress transfers seemlessly between the 2. So for about 3 weeks now I've been getting up around 7:30 in the morning and playing knowing my parents wouldn't come home before I leave for classes around 10:45. The room I play in is right next to the garage and there is no camera present. But this morning I woke up to find my Xbox 360 as I put it back on top of the box of wires gone. I'm absolutely terrified of going​ home, and getting confronted about it but at the same time I'm sick of being treated like a child.

159,"I live in a normal household with average-ish parents who fight rarely because my mom is a keeper and would always find ways to fix the problem because my egoistic, narcissistic and asshole dad would never do that. But that's the average household nowadays, right?

Everything changed when he came home very drunk one night and was accusing my mom on cheating and he even hit her, which was very shocking to me and my little sister because it was our first time to witness such acts from our dad. I was so infuriated because my mom was not as strong as my dad, even in a drunken state. So I hit my dad with a pipe(no serious injuries tho) and we fled the house.

About two months later, after all the hiding and lawsuits(which my mom dropped because "" freakin love""), they kinda had an agreement to just forget it all and start anew. My mom forgiving my dad for all the trouble that he caused and my dad letting my mom go for the ""accused"" cheating which he never proved and which I would never believe because I've known my mom since like forever and this is not a biased statement. 

Here is the problem, though my mom let my dad slide for all the shitstorm that he has caused, I never respected him as a dad and as a person anymore. I still treat him the same, but the back of my head was filled with hate and disgust towards him(no murderous intentions tho). I was always like ""Why would you hit a woman?! A very sweet and kind one!"". Thoughts of **slapping** him so hard his head would go on a 360 would always cross my mind and the thing is that I always thought that the incident with him hitting my mom was kinda fishy so I thought to myself  that he maybe the one cheating but I never really thought much about that. One night he left his phone on the dining table and it rang at about midnight. There were no contact details and it only showed the number so I thought it was the mistress. **ALAS!** It was the most depressing successful prediction ever.

I don't wanna tell my mom yet because I would like the ""reveal"" to be well-prepared. I want to let it hit him so hard that he would want to disappear and never show himself to us again.

168,"My brother is obsessed with me, everything I do seems to piss him off, yet he can't leave me alone to save his life. I made a reddit just to rant about how bad he treats me and he tracks it down like a crazy person and posts all this crap just to make people hate me... Which means he probably goes through my things or looks at my phone or laptop when I go to the bathroom or leave for a minute which is again ""obsessed"". I haven't done anything to him 90% of the time...

He whines that I don't where panties and tells EVERYBODY we meet or I know, or he knows. Just out of no where just brings it up saying how I'm a slut and a hoe and try to make me look as bad as possible. All this and I could say nothing just be minding my own business... it's him that stares at my butt apparently. He's not my dad so he shouldn't worry about what I where and leave me the hell alone.

The next thing is he hates me so much, yet he can't leave me alone. He is always telling me what I should do, put on underwear, take a bath, stop sleeping around (and I'm a virgin, he's just starting stuff), he's just nitpicking me for no reason. Half the time I don't even look at him and he gets pissed off. Then when ai ignore him he gets more pissed off at me and starts getting physical.

And like I said, he's so obsessed with me that he will lie and lie on me until people hate me, my dad made me get a job and my brother hates me for it, but worse he tries to get everyone there to hate me. He tells everyone that I'm fucking all these other guys there, someone gives me a compliment and he will talk shit about me and try to make me look bad, even guys tell me that he calls me a dirty hoe that's easy that probably did 3 guys already that day... so much bullshit it's just impossible to live near him.

I'd quit but my dad won't let me. Instead I have to sit and be insulted by my brother so much it drives me nuts. The craziest part is this all started because he was upset I didn't wear panties and he's hated me since then. And I can't even talk to people without him making some comment to them later about me and trying to change their opinions of me.

One guy started a fight with him because he said my brother was literally talking so much shit and talking about my privacy and just being a complete asshole. And later at home when I was just walking past him he pushes me making me fall down and yells at me over it as if it was my fault.

He makes short comments to me as he walks by, like slut. When I say asshole, he goes on getting upset as if he didn't start this. It's so much that just pisses me off. Why is he so obseesed with me if he hates my guts. I wouldn't want to say a single wors to him, yet he goes out of his way to talk shit about me even when I'm not around... it's just so much thay I needed advice on the entire thing...

How do you deal with someone that hates you but is obsessed with you? You can't ignore them because it makes them more pissed and minding your own business seems to piss them off too. Even making no eye contact whatsoever makes them want to hir you. And anybody you talk too they will go out of thier way to try to make that person hates you. All this becuase you won't do what they want or act how they want you to act... it's so stupid that I can't go out without my brother commenting on it. Then when I do argue and complain with him he always takes it in a way such as I'm a bitch, yet he starts it, not me. I don't act hostile until he pushes me over the edge...

175,"Hi all. I'm more than happy to provide any details that may help with any advice directed my way.


So. My fiance has had an issue crop up in the last few weeks at his work in the maintenance side of a large service provider here in Canada. Last week he had a meeting where they were complaining about how well the boxes (battery boxes or something) were cleaned, cleaning which is an extra but not truly mandatory part of maintenance on these things. They accused him of not even doing his work or being at any of these sites; he pointed out that everything is GPS tracked so they could see he was at the location. He said he would return to the sites, take before pics with after pics of these boxes spotless. Bear in mind, these things are outside and apparently dirt is unlikely to have much of an effect on how well the battery works. Add to this that the original visits to these sites occured in the middle of a Canadian winter...You can see why they wouldn't be truly free of specks of dust etc!


Anyway he  returns to these sites over the week and takes pictures and shows them to me over the day. Today he had a follow up meeting which was organised during the previous meeting. This time they accused him of lying again because he didn't email the before and after pictures of his work throughout the week. He said that as he'd known they would have a meeting in person and it wasn't requested that these photos were emailed, that he assumed it would be suitable to have them discuss it all in person.


The tone of these meetings were incredibly bitter according to him, especially for a ""first transgression"". They've since sent him home for the day and are meeting with HR to discuss his role within the company.


Now, he's nervous. Understandably. And he's since told me something interesting. Although he's been commended recently for some extras he's done (productivity aids and email stuff) when a target is painted on your back, management in this particular area don't care. They belittle and demean their staff. I asked how targets occur and he claims that a lot of it has happened recently with management change; co-workers who've suggested alternative ways to approach work that would be more productive and cost effective, have been labelled as having a bad attitude for not accepting what they've been told. Those that have had grumbles about pay (other companies pay this position more and with additional benefits) have also had a target on their backs. The morale​ of the company is at an all time low. For him I think the target came about because he's been asking around and applying to other positions elsewhere in the company, simply because he doesn't get the fulfillment he once did. With our growing family he wanted something a little more fulfilling and paid a little better.


I don't think this constitutes as misconduct...if anything their treatment of their staff is appalling. Most first time transgressions are treated with a performance review period, and these musings from management sound like the review is going to be bypassed.


I know a lot will suggest contact HR, and we're trying to do that (several calls and voicemails later and were no closer to contact), but in the meantime is their anything that we can do? Anything at all? 


Bullying and belittling seems such a poor way to run a department. A department that so many are planning to leave with applications elsewhere too. But that's not my position, as much as I'd like to give them a wake-up call on how to manage people, I just want to help the almost-husband in the meantime.


I am biased, true, but I know he's been working so hard to stand out for his chances in other departments. I just want to be able to offer help in any way I can.

184,"Hey all,

So today I had some trouble at work, for the first time it really got me down. I've been working at this company for around 3 years in total, having started at an entry level position and moved up twice, done pretty well and always tried my best. I care deeply about my work and am somewhat of a perfectionist, I push for my own results and focus very well. I constantly try my best. But recently I've felt very underappreciated until I had an argument with my boss this morning. 

The company is not going well, people are leaving, no one is very happy, and in general not much exciting is happening. I went away for 6 weeks unpaid leave travelling, as it was the perfect time to, had to request time off and got it, then eventually came back to work this week (Monday) and found work exactly the same if not worse. People unhappy, bad atmosphere etc. After that long I expected change and felt very angry at it all, I have a colleague next to me that I talk to a lot. We start applying for jobs and all sorts togethor, helping each other to try and leave the place. This guy and my boss have not been getting on at all lately, something happened during the 6 weeks away that I don't know about. Anyway first few days back, and already my boss has barely spoken to me. Before I went away I felt isolated, a team of 3 of us and I've always been the one left out, despite always working with good clients and getting results, for some reason he has never taken to me.

Anyway back to today, he brings me into a meeting which I thought would have happened monday and just has a huge go at me. No one has ever spoken to me like that at work before, and he basically said I'd pissed him off after talking to the guy next to me and moaning and he knows i'm applying to other places. He says I can go if I want I don't have to be there, he threatens to give me formal warnings for misconduct and says the other guy is just influencing me. He really puts me down and makes me not want to work for him at all. Coming home I felt very sad, and I now feel confused and like quitting right away. I don't feel like I've done much wrong, and that he's taking his anger out on me. 
It seems another colleague (who runs to him about everything) told him I'm applying for jobs and feels uncomfortable with us when we complain about things, even after she agreed with us and sent me links to places - she went behind our backs to the boss. The company has always favored people that just say yes and carry on, whereas I like to question things and face the negative points - instead of just nodding. 

Right now I'm applying to other jobs and want to leave, I'm thinking about handing in my notice next week and using my notice period to find another job. but i'm worried, as this is my only work experience and I don't believe I've gained many skills at all, I'm someone that would aim for entry level roles pretty much, but no clue what career to face. I feel stuck, and borderline depressed at it all now.

Please advise guys - I've never felt this unhappy with work before, would it be a bad idea to just quit and get myself out?",30Mar2017,2

189,"Hi there,

I am a law student at Copenhagen University. In a few months I will have to choose whether to continue studying law, or go in another direction.
In Denmark it is possible to take a master in journalism after any bachelor if you can pass the initial tests. It is a way to produce more specialised journalists - in my case I would be specialised in law, I guess.

Now, the thing is - I am not sure I want to become a lawyer. But a master degree in law still opens a ton of other career opportunities. Also, I like law; mainly international law, human rights law, and the ""softer"" fields. I dont want to spend my career making contracts for rich people to get richer. 

On the other hand, I like writing and already have experience working with media, which I also like a lot. Having a university degree in both law and journalism might also open tons of opportunities...

Well... For me it is 50/50 at this point, so I figured I should ask you guys for advice. Maybe someone in the crowd has work experience from these fields they can share? What are the pro's and cons?

191,"hiya reddit, i'm a 20 year old college student studying premed biology and theatre (weird i know). i moved in with two other theatre majors this past august after fulfilling my required time in the dorms and thought it was going super well until realizing my roommates may actually be the worst. one of them didn't pay me for the utilities i cover (electric and gas) for the entirety of fall semester and both of them still owe me for these past two months. they both know i have a bit of sitting money because i get a lot of scholarships from my uni, but i don't work enough to offset my cost of living, so my money drains consistently throughout the year. they complained about me owning a mini fridge and how that would affect the electricity bill even though they haven't even paid me recently. they were both best friends before i agreed to live with them and now i am afraid to stand up for myself because they always team up. one time when i tried to tell them they didn't pay me for utilities they gaslit me and tried to convince me they did pay when i was SO SURE they didn't. they have both argued that i need to stop bringing up money so much because it makes them feel bad and they know how much they owe me. money gives me a lot of anxiety because i come from a lower middle class single parent family and i don't want to be taken advantage of. they have locked me out using the deadbolt without asking if i was going to be home and have referenced to me being the least busy person in the apartment when we have argued about keeping the apartment clean. i have already signed the lease for next year because you have to get those done early in college towns in order to avoid your realtor showing your apartment to prospective tenants. my parents and friends want me to leave asap but i feel like there is no way for me to escape my lease without completely muddying my relationship with my roommates. i don't want to garner animosity because they are very petty and show almost no mercy when it comes to people who aren't within their friend group. this is also my first time living alone and i'm unsure how to get out of leases and how to find somewhere else to live, or if it's even worth it. does anyone have advice when it comes to god awful roommates?? i would like to think i'm an okay roommate. i keep to myself and am out of the apartment most hours of the day and i am pretty meticulously clean with all my belongings but it would be ignorant to think i am completely innocent in roommate drama.

Currently I'm living in a house with 6 roommates. I'm a little bit the ''house-mom''. That means I'm poking everybody to do their choires. That works so and then. But the dishes is a big problem in our house. And it drives me nuts. 

This is the situation: 

* We are 6 roommates who own our own plates, pans and cups, but we own some beer glasses who are used my everybody. The cutlery is a combination of own and shared. 

* We have one kitchen, one sink and two cooking pits. 

* We have one dinner table and I think two a three meters of kitchen counter.

The dishes are everywhere... nobody ever does their dishes, everybody keeps complaining. The kitchen counter can't be used, because of dishes. One cooking pit is always full with dirty pans. 

We once had the system where you can throw your dirty dishes in a basin with your name on it. So it's not on the counter all the time. But it doesn't work. Now my roommates throw their clean dishes in the basin.

197,"I'm a quiet person. My hobbies are reading, video games and writing. When I exercise I go on solo runs and I usually eat well. Lately
i have been eating like crap though. Not overweight or anything. I'm a freshman in college.



Lately though I just do nothing. I only have 12 hours of classes this semester, and the thing is that I have so little work. But it's almost like my laziness adjusts to how much work I have, so that i am perpetually lazy anyway and end up turning in assignments late. I am practiced in doing the bare minimum to keep what I consider acceptable grades. Which is somewhere between 3.0 and 4.0, but I know I could do so much better. I'm not asking to be a social butterfly or anything, I just want to stop laying in bed all day and not wanting to do anything. I do not think i'm depressed, just very very lazy for some reason.





Lately I have been on my phone a lot just lying in bed a lot. Looking at reddit, and yes, jerking off, which I don't think helps with my energy. When I do get energy I usually just game a lot or something. Sometimes I read. 




And another thing, this ""energy"" seems more like a construct than anything else. Like, I think it's bullshit. It's more accurate to say that I just really hate doing things that require effort. Not saying that energy doesn't exist, but a lot of it is mental anyway.


Something I can say that saps this ""energy"" is anxiety. When i have to talk to people I just get really anxious. It's not that I'm bad at it I don't think. It just doesn't seem worth it and when I have to it feels like it takes a lot out of me. This could be bullshit, but it *seems* to me that it makes me fatigued. 


Like for example, my roommate likes to just go around the hallway and say hi to everyone and mess around. This is so crazy to me, because for me I would probably rather give you $10 than do that just because the social interaction is so anxiety producing. I have asked my roommate and he says he has no anxiety. Exchanging pleasantries feels like a chore to some extent because of the anxiety. The door being open or unlocked makes me anxious slightly as well.


I just wonder how much of this is purely mental. Like, why can't I just not be anxious? I know it's not that simple. ",30Mar2017,3

202,"So like the title says, my landlord isn't giving us notice to enter the property. However, I'm sure as to whether or not he has to. The exact situation is that I live on the second floor of a house with a roommate, with a separate entrance to our unit; and the landlord lives underneath of us with basically a separate entire house (approximately 7 rooms, kitchen, living room, garage, etc.) This is where it gets complicated and why I'm unsure; my roommate and I are on separate leases each with a single room, and a shared common area between us, and the landlord enters the common area all the time, for example, he came in and took my crockpot from the common area (WITH FOOD IN IT!) this morning because he thought it was his (to clarify, he went out of his house, went around to our entrance, unlocked our door, climbed the stairs to our floor, and took the crockpot full of food back down to his floor.) He doesn't enter our specific rooms, just the shared common area. Both my roommate and I have our respective rooms and the common area on our respective leases, and the lease states he must give us two days notice before he can enter the property. My question is, since we rent individual rooms, is he allowed to enter my roommate and I's shared common area without notice because he owns the building? (would it be considered an extension of his house?) Or is he violating the rental agreement? Bonus question, if he is, how do I bring it up with him without being rude?

Here comes the hard part. We have been together working on a project that was hosted on his personal dedicated server (he put it in a datacenter), so we both had access to it (and no one else). Private keys for his bitcoin wallet are also stored on that server. Tomorrow the gateway through which I can access the server will be turned off. 

So basically if I do nothing with these bitcoins, they will just disappear and can never be obtained by anybody. I avoided the issue before, but maybe I am supposed to do anything now?

He never said he wants to give them to me, so they are definitely not mine. 

Another option is informing his parents and helping them get the money. The issue here is that he hated his parents, and I really think they are one of the reasons he has passed away. They also tried to hid it was a suicide and told everyone that he died due to heart attack.

Another option is transfering money to some charity, but for some reason I always felt like most of these organizations are a massive fraud and money-laundering. And it also involves me taking the money I'm not supposed to touch.

206,"I'm a 21 year old female and I've been in a long distance relationship for almost a year and a half. I have never cheated on my boyfriend Dillon and have been extremely loyal to him to the point of deleting all males off of my Snapchat - even my brother. I offered to have a threesome with him one time, but he sent nudes to the 3rd girl behind my back (I feel like it's cheating but I've been told that I'm over reacting.) So summed up, he's done virtual cheating, and I've been loyal. I've worked it out with him and realized that he thought it was okay since the girl was going to have a threesome with us and he's done whatever he can to build my trust back and let me know that I'm all his. 

So Dillon goes to a college town about 3 hours from his house every weekend to party with his friends that go there. Since the whole sexting/nudes thing, I've asked him to tell me about his interactions with women and to not talk to woman in a flirty way, but I have never told him he's not allowed to go out and think it's good for him to be out with his friends. In my past, whenever I've gone out wether it be to the grocery store or a bar, I've had guys catcall me or high key flirt with me and it's made Dillon extremely upset. This weekend, he's going to the college town to party it up. I had a friend invite me to go to the lake on Sunday, so I asked Dillon for his permission to go. He got extremely defensive, and asked if any guys would be there. I told him no and that it was a girls night out kind of thing. He said that if he finds out that I was lying and a guy was there, that he would ""punish"" me and not talk to me for a whole week. I asked him what would happen if a guy showed up that was a boyfriend of one of my friends. He said that he would make the punishment less, but still be very angry. I told him that I thought he was being manipulative by having a quote on quote ""punishment,"" for me, but he responded with sending me the google definition of manipulative and said he's not. So basically, we just fought for the next 30 minutes about how he's hurt that I won't listen to him, how he won't talk to me for a  week if I go out, etc. So I decided to do the same thing he did so he could see how immature it is, and I told him that if he gives eye contact or says a word to any woman this weekend that I won't have sex with him for 3 months. I wouldn't actually do that, but I did it to see what his reaction would be. He said, ""I can't do that that's completely unrealistic."" So it's completely unrealistic for him to talk to other woman this weekend, but if I do as much as be in a room with a guy this weekend than he won't talk to me for a week. I'm only allowed to be with other guys when he's around. 

I apologized for saying I wanted to go to the lake and that I won't go, and he said that he doesn't forgive me right now but he's working on it.

I don't want to give out the wrong impression of him because he has a reason to be worried with all the attempted sexual assaults that have happened to me and all the flirting, but I'm majorly upset about the whole situation.

209,"I was raised into a decent family, i loved my mum and dad very much. My dad was diagnosed with huntingtons disease just after i was born. I found out at 16 that i have a 50% chance of inheriting it.

Sadly the disease ruined my dads mind. He used to be so loving, but it was taken away from him. He turned violent and abusive through no fault of his own. I was a spoilt bratt, I dropped out of school, went into care for like 6 months and talked back at him when he was being rude. 

It felt very strange growing up- all of my friends had normal families. My mum didnt tell me what was wrong with him, so i grew up resenting my dad not knowing why he was getting so angry. It made me the weird kid in primary school. I didnt wear proper clothes, my hair was matted and i got bullied a lot. My mother is so kind, however too kind. She was very timid and didnt know how to look after dad during his mood swings. I do not blame her - however, i do believe more could have been done to look after me and my younger sibling. I would never say that to her as i do not want to hurt her feelings.

He took a turn for the worse when i was around 14. He broke my nose, threw a keyboard on me, rowed with mum and beat my younger sibling. He apologised every time after it happened. Twice he cried, i felt terrible. The day i went into care was because he beat my brother so badly, and i decided it was too much to stay at home. 

I didnt last long in care. Being 16, i was allowed to leave. After a row with my foster mum over skipping school, i left and returned home. Things were okay with my dad but soon took a turn for the worst. He was ordering me about in the house, he got angry of i couldnt fix something, or if i couldnt get downstairs in time. One time, i heard him rowing with mum downstairs. I cant remember what about-  i walked downstairs scared for my mum and he punched me in the face, breaking my nose. He was taken away and arrested, however i didnt press charges. He was released and we were told to leave the house. We had to leave my dad which i feel horrible about. We stayed in another town about 30 miles away with my grandmother. School was a trek, my mum had to drive us for an hour each way. I got tired. Lost my friends in school as i became distant. Became a loner. The embarrassment of becoming a loner and the stress of everything got to me, and i started skipping school. I remember sitting in the town library, reading books untill the time came to meet my highschool boyfriend at his school. Id stay out late, smoke weed or whatever the plan was, and get the train home. I was always tired. I couldnt keep up. I didnt even arrive to my exams because i didnt want to see anyone from school. I because so anxious.

I managed to get into college around a year later. I was still living 30 miles away from my dad. He constantly called my mum begging him to come back. He made suicide threats. I was so concerned for his safety, that i took a few secret trips to his house. He never wanted me to leave him. My family would have been angry if they found out that i put myself at risk. 

One day, the police came round and told me that he had jumped off a car park close to my house. I was distraught. He broke both of his legs, fractured his spine and pelvis. I went to see him in the hospital, and he gave me a blank stare. It was so hard for all of us. I tried talking to him but i think where he was on medication he couldnt talk. I left the hospital and when i was about to get the train home, someone from the hospital had said that he was trying to call me. I felt SO guilty, i cant put in to words how horrible i felt. I blamed myself- the arguments, leaving him etc. I still do. 

My dads side of the family organised for him to go into a care home closer to where they lived. My dad used to complain about how they shut him out- once they never visited him in around 6 years. His sister visited at one point introducing herself to me and my sibling by her formal name. We knew who she was. It seemed rather rude leaving us to care for him when we was not capable. She knew that. 

Grandad seemed to blame us for the mistreatment of dad. My mum recieved a letter telling her how horrible she was, and that he doesnt want anything thing to do with her kids again (me and younger sibling). I felt so hurt and rejected. She was on the phone to dads sisters husband, who was being horrible to her. And i just lost it. I phoned him up giving abuse, so angry that he blamed my mum and i. I regret loosing my temper, it made me just as bad. But i was a mouthy bitch at that point and wouldnt take anything. 

We moved back to the house. My dad had killed the kitten that he bought to get us back i think (he knew me and younger sibling loved cats). My brother was first in, he looked in the bathtub and saw it. I heard a horrible scream. 

Flash foward to now (sorry im rambling theres a lot to go through), the memories are everywhere. The parking lot, punch holes in doors, the scratches in the bathtub. My dads old room, trashed from where he ruined it before he left. I left college, but now im stuck. I have a very supportive boyfriend who has helped me through a lot of my issues, but has his own life to deal with and its stresses. 

I have no motivation anymore. I dont know what to do with my life. I do not know how to move on. 

The questions that im asking are-

Is this my fault? Did i bring this on myself? With the talking back. 

How can i move on when theres memories everywhere? I have no money to move out. 

Should i get tested for huntingtons disease? If i know that ive got it, it could cause a lifetime of pain. But not knowing could be just as painful.

Should i apologise to my dads side of the family? Ive tried to explain to my dads sister, she partly understands. My grandad will not have any of it. I really feel rejected.

ANY advice would be appreciated. But please be nice as this whole situation hurts me so badly. Honest, but nice.  ",30Mar2017,1

213,"Hi reddit! I need your advice.
Around months ago I have started to attend dance classes in local ballroom dance school. It is dance course for beginners: cha-cha, discofox, waltz etc. The problem is that I am dancing really badly. Like the worst learner in the group. And I feel quite depressed about it. Every dance lesson is torment. I am loosing rhythm, my movements are award and clumsy, I do not remember sequences and dance moves. Every lesson is like a first one. After each lesson I am feeling undermined and defeated. Furthermore, currently I am dancing without a partner (like four last lessons) and looks like there will not be any in the future. 
But it is OK as there always one or more mens in the dance floor who dance alone during the lesson. Unfortunately, dancing with a partner is much more enjoyable experience. 

So, reddit users, I would appreciate if you could give me some advice about this situation. Should I continue to attend dance lessons? Of course, my experience is unpleasant but in the same I want to learn to dance. It is already started and it is stupid to leave something without any valuable result. Especially after so much time have been invested (even without any notable progress).

I know, it is stupid and whiny, sorry. But I can not decide, those lessons make me feel bad.
Thanks.",30Mar2017,1
214,"I am in the last year of secondary school, f 18 . So at the moment, everything is about grades, projects, exams, performance etc. I'm an exceptionally competitive person, which means I am nearly always comparing myself to other and how they are doing. I study hard and get reasonably good grades, but never it seems, anything higher. Over the past couple of weeks, with exams looming it seems everyone, left right and center is excelling.

I came out of a recent exam having thought I did absolutely terrible while everyone else seems to be comfortable, even happy with how they did. It doesn't help that my friends seem to be brain boxes, usually achieving high grades. I need high grades to get into the college of my choice. I'm exhausted with over-thinking, over-working and over doing it. How do you know when enough is enough? How do you stop comparing yourself to others and just be comfortable with your own skill-set?

So since I was a baby my family has been broke because my mom became I'll and couldn't work so my father had to take care of her.

My parents have never been that great, very selfish people sometimes, I can be more forgiving with mom because of her issues but still I can't stand my family at times and its hard not to be resentful.

230,"Hi! I currently attend a local community college and I'm debating between two universities I'm interested in transferring to. There's one local school I'm interested in for its programs and education quality, Seattle University, and another school with seemingly poor to mediocre education quality strictly because of its location, the University of Hawaii (Manoa). In Seattle, I would double major in Christian theology and public policy, at Hawaii I'd probably just major in public policy. 

I've lived near Seattle my entire life. I love where I'm from, but I'm happiest in the sunshine and we don't have much sun for ~9 months out of the year. Living in Hawaii during the school year and coming home in the summer would be my ideal situation, as I'd always have warm, sunny weather in a beautiful location. Hawaii would also be much cheaper (Seattle U is a private school, and Hawaii offers reasonable tuition to residents of western states). I'm also big into outdoorsy stuff (biking, hiking, trail running) and Hawaii is a great place for that, especially since I'm very interested in learning to surf. I also wouldn't mind living in a different location for once, especially a laid-back place like Oahu that suits my personality. Hawaii would also be a great creative space for me, I work better in that aspect in a sunny environment. But I'm also not really in college for the post-graduation job prospects, I'm going to pursue music no matter what I do. I'm just trying to learn something I care about and get a quality education. So I'm torn.

232,"It's a long story but I will try to give the shortest version I can. I've dealt with anxiety for as long as I can remember. It started to heavily affect me in high school but I managed to graduate. Immediately, I started at a technical college in a program that I enjoyed at the time, but slowly lost interest in. After three semesters of that I decided to try a different program but didn't even finish the semester. It was about this time last year that I quit going. Last summer I had the opportunity to move to a different state and live with my brother and his wife. This was my first time ever moving away from home and I was very excited about it. I'm from a very small town and I have never liked it here. 

Anyway, my time living away was great. I was able to get my first job, and I met someone while working there. We started dating and he became my first real boyfriend. He was quite a bit older than me and my family didn't like that too much. But I had fun with him and really enjoyed having him around. Things were great until the beginning of this year. He pretty much disappeared with no explanation. It was really hard for me to handle. It made my job that I already didn't like even worse. I had also just quit taking antidepressants cold turkey in November (which I know is not the right way to come off of them). So I think that made everything harder too. Things kept happening and I started to consider going back home to my parents. Living with them, I wouldn't have to work. But I'm not lazy. I DO want to work, I was just having a very hard time doing my job with everything that was going on. I didn't want to go back home. I loved the place I was in. But I thought going home might be better on me mentally and emotionally. One weekend, I had an accident. That put me in a position where I didn't have a choice. Now that I didn't have a car, I had to go home. So now I'm back in my parents house and still very miserable. Last week, I finally heard from the guy who disappeared on me. He gave me the explanation that I needed and he apologized for everything. He is in a better place now, both mentally and financially. He's doing good. He's offered, if I'm interested, for us to try things again. But I would have to move back there and live with him. He is eight hours away from me now. I know that its probably a really crazy idea, but I feel like I would be happier there with him. My parents would be disappointed, and that matters to me deeply. I want to make my parents proud. But I feel like they have such high expectations of me. I feel like I'll never be able to make them truly proud. Or I could, but then I wouldn't be happy with the life I was living. I'm 20 and have no clue what I want to do with my life. It's so overwhelming. Basically I just want to hear from some people, maybe who have been in similar situations.

I'm just totally depressed right now, and mostly am depressed. I am dissatisfied with the way I look, because: I am small, skinny, and I just look like a 'nerd', and I feel because of that I get no respect in life.

I study in Sudan, and I am not sure what the problem is exactly, perhaps it's the culture shock, the society, boredom, and standard of living (I'm American), but this place is not working out well with me.

I don't like the way I am living here nor do I like my life here. I am under the impression that because of the way I look, I get no respect here from guys and girls. Like, I look abnormal and they don't take me seriously. I also feel I have this problem with my cousin who I am living with who is more on the 'macho' side. Its driving me insane.

I also go to a top-end college here for wealthy people, and I find that I don't fit in because these people look better than me there. I am basically a loser here. Look like one, feel like one, and basically made fun of since they call me 'crazy' sometimes and I don't know what to do.

Anyway, I recently left a job I was at for 10 years for a newer better paying job doing sys admin work (but still well-below market rates, but that's for another day). My first day was this past Monday and after all of the orientation work goes on, I'm passed off to my work group and given not much to do but read some manuals.

One of the main reasons I left my other job was simply boredom and lack of novelty. So I've spent most of this past week just doing menial tasks with a couple applications and otherwise listening to podcasts while reading manuals.
The other thing that has me worried is the workplace culture. This is an IT department of around 200 people that seems to lack any aspirations at all. The technology is old and the developers are a mix between those close to retirement age, guys fresh out of college or H1/B folks. None of these groups seems happy to be there and would quit if they weren't paid so well.

237,"So, I started college this year and I met a guy who seemed pretty cool, but throughout the year has proven himself to be a straight up dick. Now, I've know some people who are assholes in my time, but this guy takes the cake by far. 

Now, I know the easiest thing to do is just drop him and let him suffer on his own (something that he very quickly is doing), but not only is it too close to the end of the year for me to really care about doing it, I also just don't want to straight up say ""fuck off, you're an asshole,""

What has he done to lead me to this conclusion, you may ask (and it's a good question). To avoid going too deep into things, he talks trash about every single person that we both know behind their backs, and rarely will actually do so to their face. Sterotypical two-faced behavior, more or less. I'm almost certain that he does the same to me but I couldn't care less. I would *love* to tell the people that he insults and belittles them when they're not around but on one hand I really don't want to do that just because it'd do nothing but cause drama, and more than likely they know the same thing I do.

Not only does he talk trash about people, but he is constantly being ""wronged"" by people we know. He will constantly talk about how someone else is a dick, or is an ass because of something they did to him (or he thinks they did to him). I constantly am reminded of the ""if you meet an asshole in the morning, they were an asshole, but if you meet assholes your entire day, you're the asshole"" saying when he starts going on.

I've tried to talk to him about this, and tell him why it's wrong, but he frankly doesn't care. I'm kinda just at a loss here. While he obviously sees me as a friend, and he's honestly not a bad guy when he's not making fun of people (yes, I understand how that sounds), hanging around someone who constantly is talking down about other people just makes me feel annoyed and by this point I'm literally looking for anything to do and try to get through to this guy that what he's doing isn't okay, especially going into adulthood.

2. What would increase the current or voltage? Strength of the magnet? Length of the magnet? How fast it spins? Number of wire coils?

There are guys who seem to only degrade/objectify me and only see me as a walking pair of tits, who have at the same time indirectly rejected me for whatever reason, and I am still attracted to them. The attraction seems to be more physical/sexual but I still hate it so much, because even though I want to dislike them and to only want to be with guys who respect me, I am just so physically/sexually attracted to them that it skews my judgment and I still want them to want me.

I don't ever want to have sex with a guy who doesn't respect me, but the way I seem to be attracted to douchebags makes me worry that that might happen one day. And, it's funny because once upon a time I thought I was asexual, but now I know for sure that I'm not. But, I guess now my problem is separating my attraction to certain guys from emotional feelings and maintaining my dignity if I'm ever tempted.
