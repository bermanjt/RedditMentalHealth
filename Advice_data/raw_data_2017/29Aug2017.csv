0,"Hello! so right now I am working 2 part time jobs and a full time Student. So job A I have been working in for a year, it's a sales job and I don't feel I am very good at it, it pays base + commission.  Job B i have been with for 7 months, and pays hourly but more than minimum wage. The job dilemma is that I want to quit job A  but I told my boss from Job A I would stick to it for another year. I want to quit because I want to focus more on school. I want to keep them both but at the same time I am afraid that I would lose them both if I don't commit to one.",29Aug2017,1
1,I'm a senior that plays football at my highschool and I'm conflicted on if I should quit playing football or not. I've been playing all my life but have struggled to find a starting position on the team all throughout highschool up intill this year where I found a spot at TE. That was intill I suffered a concussion a few weeks ago. I'm back now but the coach has me on the practice squad and hasn't given me an indication on if  I will be coming back or not. So I feel like I should just stop playing and focus more on studying and working instead of wasting time out there. What are yalls thoughts.

5,"I recently got hired as an Apple tech even though I don't own any apple product. Also I've been having issues with the charging port being fucky on my current phone, an LG G4.

7,"Recently, I've been thinking about relationships and how often numerous arguments can arise from dating someone who has a differing worldview. While I do understand that everyone will have differing beliefs to an extent, when you are attracted to someone, their beliefs shouldn't matter and that one should pursue that relationship.

However, I feel that many people who I have encountered in the past might strongly disagree with me. They argue that I shouldn't be ""unequally yoked"" and that with divorce rates so high, it would be dangerous to marry someone who has differing views from oneself.

That said, I do not want to limit myself and I would like to know it is possible to live a happy married life with someone who has a different religion, or political views, or philosophy. I would like it if someone can answer my question *""Can you have a successful intimate relationship with someone of a different religion or political views?""*

8,"We were at a party the other day and there was a girl there that needed a ride home. We gave her a ride there and went up to her apartment to use her restroom. The next day I had to work, and he had the day off. I got home to find him sleeping and I asked what he did that day. He told me he slept all morning and then he went to lunch with the girl. 

I am fine with my boyfriend having friends that are girls, but this seemed extremely odd to me. I felt uncomfortable that they went for lunch without me because they hardly know each other. He said she asked him to breakfast but he didn't wake up in time so instead they went to lunch.

I didn't share my thoughts on the matter because I didn't want to start a fight as we were headed to a restaurant to celebrate my grandma's birthday. Now I'm not sure what to do or say. I feel uncomfortable about the whole situation. She made the effort to ask him to eat with her the next day and now they are Facebook friends, but she didn't request me on Facebook.

9,"Hi this is my first post on here so hopefully I'm doing it right. I would like advice on calming myself down about a person that I like. I developed an interest in them but I think I'm too clingy and that I think about them a bit more than is healthy. I don't want to become a creep that obsessively stalks them so I feel I should nip this in the bud early. I would like advice on finding an outlet that helps me focus on other things as my current hobbies don't seem to work too well or advice on how to proceed onward.

To offer some context on the relationship, I've been talking to this person since around June. They're very nice and I personally do not know whether or not they are interested in me and I do not want to bother them if they are only being courteous.

11,"I relapsed last night. After almost six months clean. I can barely describe the shame and guilt I've been feeling since. 

The first time around I didn't tell anyone but my scars were discovered when I was almost completely unable to function (like not eating, being unable to sleep, hearing voices, being unable to talk for long periods of time, scary shit like that; I don't actually remember much of what happened outside of my head, but I scared the hell out of my roommate). I was sent to a mental hospital barely aware of who and where I was, and it was one of the darkest moments and scariest experiences of my life. Being surrounded by a bunch of strangers and trapped in a room with no windows was not what I needed at the time. When I finally got back to my boarding school, I confided in my best friend/roommate and a teacher I was very close to. I attended therapy briefly, but I was scared of the therapist and never learned how to trust her. The time spent driving 2 hours each way to therapy also cut into my school work, and I kept up better once I quit. The school also requires me to see the counselor regularly (who is a licensed therapist but rather homophobic and makes me uncomfortable/afraid/ashamed).

Someone at the school got suspicious of my relationship with the teacher at the end of last year, and he told me about it. I've been trying to keep my distance since then, but he advises the club I'm president of, so we still see each other/talk. He said it was still okay if I called him if I was in a crisis, and last night before I cut I dialed his number. But I was so scared of getting him in trouble that I couldn't hit the call button. I wish I had. 

If I confide in him, will he have to report it? Will he have to take me to the counselor? Will I get taken out of school again? Will I have to go back to the hospital? I want/need someone to talk to, but I'm so goddamn scared of everything.

I don't deserve help and don't want to scare/burden him or put his career at risk, but I want to stop. And I think it'll be easier if someone I can depend on knows about it. 

TL;DR: I had a self-harm relapse and need someone to talk to, but I'm scared of the consequences of talking to the only adult that I trust about it. How well-founded are my fears? What should I do (other than trying to stop cutting myself, I know that part)?",29Aug2017,8
12,"Hi everyone,

I am in a somewhat tough situation. I have a job interview, tomorrow, over Skype, which I think will result in an offer. Great company. Somewhat well-known. This is based on multiple factors that have led to this point. However, that is not the issue at hand. The real issue at hand is as follows:

In July, I had a recruiter from a PR firm contact me. From the beginning, this firm seemed so shady. I ignored the message. Didn't reply to the guy. Come a couple weeks ago, I am getting phone call after phone call and e-mail after e-mail from companies wanting to interview me. I begin scheduling the interviews, accordingly. I then messaged the recruiter from the shady PR firm and told him that I was not interested. He said he would like to set up an interview. It was at this point that I researched his company. It is a PR firm in Chicago with INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE reviews, both from clients and employees, as well as people who received phone calls from these con artists. At this point, I knew I would not be working for said company.

The recruiter says he will be calling me Wednesday, after I told him not to do so. How should I go about telling this guy to leave me alone, for the fifth time (there were other times to the situation, just a little irrelevant.)?
Have any of you called out a recruiter for trying to promote a scam? If so, what did you say? This guy has annoyed me severely and I just want to rip one to him and call him out on the scheme for which he is promoting. I only ask because he has contacted me non-stop, even when I have asked him to stop. Every recruiter to whom I have spoken has been respectful with my decision to consider other opportunities with other companies. Some even ask how I am doing and what my job entails.

Any advice and/or even testimonials on similar experiences would be much appreciated!",29Aug2017,1

24,"I first met this guy in the third grade. We'll refer to him as ""Jack"". The two of us, both seven years old, quickly became good friends and maintained that friendship with few downfalls for the past 13 years.

A few months ago, Jack and I were walking down the riverside park with another buddy of his. Things were alright until we came across a group of mutual friends and he insisted on chatting with them. We were already running late and I had to be home in time for my curfew. I urged him to quit the talking so we could get in my car and drop off him and his buddy at their houses before I could finally get to mine.

Although my request was reasonable, Jack began throwing a hissy fit on the way back to my car. He insulted me and berated me simply for having the desire to leave. It got to the point where I cussed him out and ordered him and his friend to walk home while I made my way back to my car alone. As I was walking away from the two of them, I could hear some muffled screams from Jack in the distance.

Shortly after this unfortunate event, I texted an apology to Jack hoping for him to accept my offer to talk it out. To my dismay, he ignored me. After a few more attempts to get a hold of Jack, I contacted one of our mutual friends to find out what exactly was going on here or if he had heard anything. He informed me that Jack did not want to see me anymore. At this moment, I was so enraged that I can still clearly remember the feeling today. I could not accept someone being close friends with me for 13 years and suddenly leaving as if it was all for nothing.

At this point, I found that the only solution for closure in our friendship would be for us to meet up one-on-one for a fight. I was willing to accept any outcome of this fight as sufficient closure to our long friendship. Once Jack accepted, he insisted on meeting at his friend's house downtown (a house which I had never been to). After speaking to some of my friends about this opportunity, it quickly came to my realization that his friends waiting with him at this house could likely be armed with weapons to intervene in the fight and attack me. Not only that, but I don't even have a squad of my own that is willing to come with me to this fight and back me up in case something happens.

Jack refuses to see me alone one-on-one because he believes that I will come with a weapon to use during the fight. I tried unsuccessfully to convince him that I would not do such a thing. As strong as my desire is to fight Jack, I don't think I can risk potentially getting shot, stabbed, or beaten to death by his crew. In a last resort effort, I walked into his place of work yesterday, not to fight, but to negotiate. As expected he cowered away back to his work station. Further hostility occurred through our texts, which had been active since the beginning of our quarrel. I will be putting screenshots of the texts between Jack and I in the link below so you all may get a better understanding (fair warning: It's vulgar):

25,"Hey everyone, 

I will try my best to give a short summary of how I know this person, the evidence I saw from the abused, and what happened when I confronted them - and now a year after I last talked to this person and why they are back in my life (sorta).

- I had a partner, but she moved onto my best friend, Shrimp. It was very difficult but I stopped talking to my ex and Shrimp. About two years goes by, I joined my friend Charlie's band, which Shrimp was also a part of - however I just joined to help out Charlie, I didn't talk to Shrimp at all (this was my first time seeing him since my breakup). We ended up getting a chance to record in NYC, us three boys were planning - but my X decides to join. The night before we leave, X messages us saying ""I can't come anymore due to reasons"" I called my X, as it was very annoying as I paid for their round trip expecting to get paid back. I could tell in her voice something was wrong, and low and behold she told me Shrimp had been very angry and she is in too much pain/scared to come up. I talked with her through the night and met up with her the next morning. I saw heavy bruises and scratches under her turtleneck. Very heartbreaking and enraging. Yikes - ok, moving on. I saw a lot of photos and threatening messages from Shrimp in the form of screenshots. We decided, X told myself and Charlie, that the best way to confront him is to continue the week recording and act like we don't know anything, and bring it up on the bus ride back home. Worst part is the fucker Shrimp admitted to everything, but showed no remorse. It was probably the scariest thing I have ever witnessed, completely admitting but you couldn't see any light in his eyes.

**Damn, sorry this is taking so long, just context is important - I think**

- So we end up all ex-communicating Shrimp, and now all the threats and blackmail have been neutralized. Charlie and I did our best to tell local friends in the music scene to avoid Shrimp for the terrible monster he is. We see and hear him mentioned sometimes, but throughout the year, eventually nothing.

Now, here is my issue. I have a friend that seems like they are dealing/dating with Shrimp. Not a close friend, but a friend that I see every couple of months at shows/through friends. I don't know how to bring it up to her. Goodness, I can just go on about how fucking scary this situation is.

I don't want to enrage this fucking monster Shrimp by messaging this friend of mine, as I don't know what would happen. I have heard that he said, ""If I ever see CouldveBin I will fucking kill him"" (which I know is just tough guy talk for I'll beat the shit out of him"".

I want my friends, every man woman and other, EVERYONE, to be safe in their relationships and friendships. I just feel terrible not saying anything, but I know I have too. Please, anyone that has experience in confronting monstrous sexual abusers, please give me some guidance. 

I have no one to talk to on this situation. My best friend, Charlie, can't talk about Shrimp because that was his old best friend before all of this happened, and he is still torn about the previous year. 

I have tried my best to be as descriptive as possible and as much backstory that is relevant to the case.

To be clear, **I have no sympathy for this piece of shit Shrimp. Although I believe everyone deserves a second chance and all that good stuff - but this situation is very scary for me, and although it isn't my problem anymore... I can't live with myself knowing someone else gets hurt by me being complacent.** Fuck I really don't know, please help.

Love and thanks in advance.

We have to pass his home coming to our property and noticed an influx of family/friends over and knew something was up a couple weeks back, well... my mom found out today through her nurse that his wife had passed on the 17th. Today when driving by my parents noticed he was just sitting in his wifes car. 

We had a loss just recently from cancer and my mother has beat cancer once already. So this hits more than close to home.

38,"I'm currently in the corporate sales world doing a 9 to 5 job almost 5 to 6 days a week, with weekends in the middle of the week. The job requires me to be on call even at home. I don't mind the workload but it gets quite repetitive and boring. I've made sales already, but the workload does not have any substance at all. From handling documents and constantly talking to clients, there's just no thrill to it anymore. However, the good thing about this current job of mine is that it has a slow but steady pace in building a career path. 

The problem with it is its repetition of work, my team's settlement for mediocrity, and my incompatibility to jive with them. On the other hand, I have a friend whom I met in the same corporate field who invited me to work with him at a start up, along with an acquaintance that he met through me. Both of them will be partners, and I will basically be the third guy doing the overall operations assisted with their guidance and training. 

Both of them are very competent in their separate fields: one has 8 years in experience in sales; the other a Harvard graduate in the field of e-commerce and financial modeling. The problem with this is that I have not been invited as a partner, understandable due to my lack of expertise. It would seem as I would be working for my friend, which somewhat bothers me a bit. But on the brighter note, I find this a good experience to learn all the operations of handling a business, just not as a shareholder (yet, hopefully). 

I'm bothered by this transition, and I don't know what I will get myself into if I ever decide to take the leap. I know the risks of start ups: lesser salary than expected, more workload, risk in time, risk in effort, risk in general. Overall, the business idea they proposed is something I feel as though it has potential that it would work out fine, and this is me judging their expertise on the field; considering the guy is a graduate from Harvard and has a lot of experience in the business side of things. 

Would it be worth the leap? I really want to picture myself out as a partner/equity holder, but they said that it isn't really the priority to think about now. It's only been around 3 months since working in my current company. I can see that climbing the corporate ladder will take years to accomplish, and I don't think I would enjoy the climb.

It's more than I don't know how to dance but I actually get anxiety from the idea of dancing. At receptions I always sit to the side for hours and just watch people dance. I get sick to my stomach when my friends grab me to the dance floor or get pissed at me for sitting to the side. If they drag me on the dance floor I just stand there very awkwardly and I freeze. I can't even attempt to move my body, so I don't and just go back to sitting down. 

I'm a very social, I have a lot of friends, and usually don't mind getting made fun of, but for some reason I can't bring myself to dance. I know dancing is a social thing but it is probably the social thing I am the most scared of

I have a wedding coming up in a couple weeks and I can't even get excited for them or for the trip to the wedding because of this fear. This is the 4th wedding of our friend group in the last 2 years and I know my unwillingness to dance is becoming very known. 

Any advice?",29Aug2017,1
46,"I haven't cut for a long time, I think it's been at least months. But today's been shit. I found out my crush of over a year is dating someone, who they've never told me about. I proceeded to fail my drivers test, and so my dad probably hates me. I'm such a fucking failure, so easily replaced. All that can go through my mind is ""I want you to hurt"", I just hate myself so much. My right leg is full of (minor but plentiful) cuts now, but I still don't feel enough. I'm fucking garbage. I have a disgusting body, fat and feminine and short, I want to fucking die. I already think of killing myself daily, though I'm too much of a pussy to ever do it. I wish I could get help, but I've learned the hard way that admitting any depressed or suicidal thoughts will just get you thrown into a mental hospital where everyone watches you, they drug you, and no one really cares. I don't have any family or friends close enough to me to tell, and again I even if I did I'd just get locked up. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up.

I've been way more in tune to it lately but it seems like I'll be telling my friends about my day, for example, and they'll switch the conversation to something about them.

49,"Ok so here's the thing reddit.

Before I start, I just want to let you guys know this is just high school drama stuff. I am not in college, I am currently a senior in high school.

I've known this girl since sophomore year, and we first met during P.E class. Now during my sophomore year, I only had 1 class together with her. I don't know her, and I never had any opportunities to talk to her because of my lack of confidence.

So why or how did I notice her? For the sake of just being able to understand what I'm saying more clearly, let's just call her Whiney. 

Initially, I noticed her because she is the type of girl that is introverted and doesn't seem to get along with other people. I wanted to talk to her just because she looked like a fun person, but I never had a chance to do so.

Flash forward to a few days later, we saw each other in the hallway. I thought it would be funny to just stare at her as we walk across the hallway, as she was just staring back too. We were just staring at each other for a good 3 seconds until we walked past each other. We don't know each other or have ever talked before together in our entire life, so I thought it was an interesting interaction. Because I was a socially awkward person back when I was in 10th grade, I didn't know what to do, so I just let it be.

Then it started to become contagious. Almost every single day we see each other in the hallway and we just stare at each other -- but we don't talk to each other. It had gotten to the point where we just stop looking at each other, because we both don't want that to happen anymore.

During winter break, I sent her a facebook friend request because I couldn't bring myself to actually talk to her in person about the whole eye contact interaction thing. She did not accept my friend request until the beginning of summer, which by that time I had thought it was too late to even bother anymore.

During junior year, we did not have classes together, So we did not see each other as often. I tried my best to avoid her.

Now that I am in senior year, I have 2 classes with her this year. In my first class, we just had boring history lecture. We usually can't socialize because the teacher talks like 95% of the time, so basically another iteration of the P.E class again.

Today, in my second class AP statistics, we switched seats. That's normal right? But here's the catch... I SIT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. 

Now, what is she to me? I think she is a really good looking person, and I love her smile. It might be a bit late to mention this, but I've had a crush on her ever since we just mindlessly stare at each other for entirely no reason. What a dumb reason to fall for someone right? Yeah. I agree too.

So here we are sitting in class, right across from each other. I just can't look her in the eyes. I can't do it, because neither can she. We finished class today, and we head our own ways.

4:30 PM PST this afternoon, I sent her a message. I wrote that I know this might be a bit uncomfortable for both of us, but we can try to get to know each other so that we won't have to deal with that anymore.

Great idea right? At least initially I thought so. So I sent this message, and apparently she read it around 6 PM. SHE DID NOT REPLY BACK.

In theory, I thought it was a picture perfect plan. She opens up to me, and we start having a blast together. Nope. She did not reply back. Right now it's 8 PM PST, and I'm FREAKING out about tomorrow.

So, why is this such a big deal to me? Because I don't know if she shares the same kind of feelings. I can sometimes tell she is looking at me with the corner of my eyes, and I can just feel it.

So right now, I'm in a pinch right now. She's not replying back, and I have no clue what to do tomorrow. 

Please, anyone, give me some good social advice. I'm not sure what to do, and I'm almost 100% certain she won't reply later.


Before I end, I want to say thank you for reading the wall of text. This is more of an offmychest, but at the same time I'm also looking for advice.

EDIT: I just realized I did not use her name at all. Whatever lol",29Aug2017,3
52," I've been talking to a celebrity for 2 months now. He's been trying to control my life. It's a weird situation. He says he loves me but hasn't met me. We were supposed to meet last week but I didn't go cuz he was playing too many games. Now he recently invited me to go on tour with them out of country. It seemed shady to me like why me. Why treat me this way. Yes I'm a hot girl and maybe they want me to be a groupie but it's suspect. This is a game too. He keeps saying he can pick me up but only if I consent. I'm like consent to what. I get a bad vibe abt it- going to a foreign country with them?? does anyone know why the word consent is being used and know what this means. Also they seem to be desperate to take me there I don't know why. Also he seems really set and nervous on me going and they've spent all this time trying to er me there. This isn't a catfish. I've talked to him on his phone number. a lot has happened actually I have his credit card numbers he gave me once which I used to buy something small online bc he wanted me to. Actually I have like six valid credit card numbers of his- which I would never use of course just did once. This is a super famous musician. When I tell people they don't believe me. He acts like he's in love with me but I don't buy it. He's done weird stuff like say things in interviews we've talked about. I guess the thing is- why does this person really want me going there- to be with him maybe- he's married so it makes sense- or to be with me in some way.

Apparently- he was just playing games, but really wants me to go to europe with them or meet them there. Does this sound like a safe situation to go hang out with a famous band in a foreign country? It seems shady- but then again maybe it's not. It's not a catfish- i talk to him on the phone, online etc...i have his credit card numbers sheesh. ",29Aug2017,1
53,"Any advice would be appreciated :)

A few months ago, I lied to my best friend and had a pretty big fight with her. We have since completely made up and she has fully forgiven me, but every time I hang out with her (which is quite often), I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt. I know that this would be a sensitive topic to discuss with her, which is why I have held out from doing so. I am not trying to be selfish in this situation and bring up a painful topic to her, but I truly still feel very bad about the situation and think about it more even though more time continues to pass from when it happened (this winter). I feel as if I would be prolonging the situation and am making a mountain out of a situation which has become a molehill, but I cannot stop thinking about it. Thank you ",29Aug2017,1

1. I bragged about almost kissing her to a friend which she saw but i didnt know she was watching (she hates it when guys brag because her old crush did that)
2. i got high in school and put my hand on her back in front of her friend after she saw me bragging 
3. theres this rumor that i didnt believe about her having sex with  
her best friends boyfriend i told the guy who said that to me to stfu its not true i dont think she would do that but i told the boyfriend who told the best friend who told her but she doesnt know that i really dont believe it
4. i was very hysterical and a bit manipulative but im done with that now
Theres this other guy though who is a complete asshole and takes pictures of upskirts of girls and flirts with other girls and it would be hard for me to see her go for him since the guy is a huge cunt. I feel like the best thing to do is to apologize for being a hysterical asshole and also say i didnt believe those rumors just wanted more advice :-)",29Aug2017,1
58,"I've never been good at motivation but it seems lately now that I'm finally an adult and will soon have my own bills to pay if I make it in to college(unlikely btw) that i've just stopped caring.

65,"Hello. This is a throwaway account.

I have an issue I'm ashamed to even speak about. But who knows if anyone out there can help. Only one way to find out.

I'm a guy, 19yo, living in Ontario, Canada. I have a girlfriend from Jamaica and we both got accepted to study at this college that I won't name for privacy reasons. Anyways, I've paid my tuition. It's pretty hard to find $8,000 CAD for a single semester. 

My girlfriend and I are madly in love. I've never felt this way about another human being in my whole entire life. She s literally the sole source of happiness in my life right now. I left Jamaica to come to Canada on Friday and the pain of being torn away from my girlfriend was literally like none I've ever felt before in my whole life. I can't seem to get myself out of this feeling. I can't eat and I haven't slept since Friday sleep. I can't concentrate on anything without this entire situation coming back into my head. 

Anyways, here's the rest of the story. (I'm crying as I type this). So, my girlfriend's sponsor (her mother's close friend) has been assuring her that he would pay part of the tuition fees along with her mother. It's very hard for them, especially since the deadline is this WEDNESDAY. He even submitted proof of funds to the IRCC when we were applying for her study VISA.

Now, my girlfriend has had trust issues with people promising her things all of her life. Her father isn't even in the picture in the slightest and her mother is a single parent teacher. Now, it seems as if her mother can only afford $3,000 out of the $8,000 school fee for this semester. The other guy who was supposed to pay the rest is jumping out of the boat at the last minute. This is driving me (and everyone else) completely insane. 

I can't imagine being away from this girl at all. I literally have a written plan on how I'm going to painlessly commit suicide should any of this fall through. I can't see myself going through this feeling every day for the foreseeable future and I know there is absolutely no escape. I've been through periods of family member's death and my own deep depression that has lasted 4-5 months. Nothing compares to this for some reason and I couldn't tell you why for the life of me.

 I won't be going back to Jamaica and if this doesn't work out, she won't be coming to Canada. I love this girl. I want to propose to her and marry her. I want to care for her for the rest of my life. And I'm being torn apart at the seams by everything that is happening right now. 

Anyways, this is not about me. 

I've told her mother that I want to help any way that I can. I've tried asking my parents if there's anything that we can do. They've said that it's already hard enough for my family already sending me to school. I don't want to burden them anymore than I have to. I'm not selfish like that. I'm already extremely grateful that I have this opportunity myself but at the same time, I don't see the point in living without this girl. We've been together a long time and when I left the other day, I cried in front of everyone around me without any care about what they might be thinking (I don't cry, I'm not even an emotional person, that's why I'm having such a hard time dealing with this, because I've never ever felt anything even remotely close to this in the slightest). 

I'm making this about me again. Anyways, so the deadline for the tuition payment is this week Wednesday (Today is Tuesday). 

So far I've put my computer up for sale (about $800CAD) and I'm prepared to give my entire savings account (about $400CAD) to her family to help pay the costs. Even then it wouldn't be enough and I'm stressed the fuck out. 

I'm also looking for a part time job. However, there is NO WAY IN HEAVEN OR HELL THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. 

After Wednesday at 11:59 PM, she will be removed from the program and all of this will be for nothing. We have waited for months. Applied for student VISA, looked for scholarships, prayed to God, everything! 

I have no idea where to turn. I have no idea who to call. No idea what to do. I just know for certain that I don't want to be alive without her. And I've never meant something so adamantly in my life. God knows why I'm even making this post. I don't know what I'm hoping for. A miracle? Yeah. That'd be nice. 

**This is all because of a broken promise**. One fucking promise has all but fucked up my entire life. One girl has made me want to kill myself. What is life, man?!?!? What is life? 

 I don't see the point in being alive right now. I'm talking to *her* right now and she's telling me how she doesn't support the suicide idea at all. 

We planned our life out together... We were supposed to fuck up this school thing together and work to pay back anyone who contributed. I had a great feeling up until the other day when that other guy jumped ship. I've never felt so broken hearted and **I hope nobody has to ever go through this kind of unrelenting pain**. I wouldn't even wish this upon my worst enemy. I cried to my bank teller today... I mean, who does that???

I'm going to continue to make calls and send emails and hope that someone can help, if even for a semester. Otherwise, I see no other way out than to kill myself. Yes, I know it's stupid, but if I won't see her again for the foreseeable future, what's the point in living? I've been trying to take my mind off of this. I'm the most positive person I know ever! But really, what's the point? I don't see any. This pain is something I'll trade for death at any time. I've never said that. But I've also never meant something more than right now.

Once again, I don't know why I made this post. I'm hoping for a miracle, I guess. I'm hoping God answers my prayers some way some how. I'm hoping the guy gets back on the boat. Or I'm hoping that her father picks up the slack. I'm hoping someone in my family can loan her mother another 5 grand. I'm hoping my laptop sells within the next couple hours. 


Hopefully, I don't end attempting suicide but, at the same time (as many can probably understand) I hope it would work out in a swift and painless manner. No, I don't want references to r/suicidewatch watch because that's not going to take away this pain. 

I'm also going to make a post to r/lawofattraction to see if they can help me focus my energy more positively. Yes, it's going to be a straight copy and paste. 

I'm sorry if I've made anyone sad but I needed to speak about this. Nobody in my family can help or listen to how I feel because they don't really support my love.

UPDATE: As I'm editing the grammar of this, my girl is giving me some really uplifting words. I don't feel like killing myself again but that doesn't mean this will last forever. I can hardly go about my daily life without stressing over this. As I said, I cried to my bank teller and told him my story. 

Anyways, please try to keep any responses a bit more positively minded. I know there are some people that will call me an idiot. Yes , I may very well be an idiot but that doesn't make any of this any less real.

Goodnight to all you lovely people. &lt;3",29Aug2017,1

76,"Hi, a little background- I am 23 F and just moved to a new town for one year perusing an internship/self employment opportunities as an artist. Warning- this got a little long! Sorry.



I moved here to this town with my boyfriend, he is attending the university and I decided to take welding classes and get as close to a certification as I can within the next year. We both want to leave this state (USA) as soon as possible but not before getting on our feet a little. 



I have an Art degree and previous studio internships. I was at several points a restaurant manager or a supervisor. I get offered promotions quickly when I enter a new job or I get added responsibility because I am one who can handle it. That being said I've never had a specialized job, it has all been retail and food service.



2 years ago I became an exotic dancer. I love pole dance and found out I could make more money doing that than I could working 50 plus hours running a restaurant while still finishing my degree. I've danced for nearly two years off and on, holding down part time jobs for the resume and one full time job as well so I would not have 'be a stripper' for my work history when I reentered the workforce. 



My brain got tired of the interactions- I don't like bars and the men are getting really aggressive and it is hard to compete with the girls prostituting themselves out. I make half as much as I did two years ago, but still more than I could possibly do with my skill set and age, and probably more than most people my age in this state. 



I intended to quit dancing when I moved to this town recently. I acquired new certifications to prepare my better for jobs that aren't 8 dollars an hour. But for weeks I've been looking and there is nothing here- the average restaurant manager salary is only 12.50 an hour and this entire section of the state only brings home an average of 10 dollars an hour. That includes the salary of the hundreds of well paid researchers and professors in the university here. What I am seeing realistically is that I will take a shitty service job for under 9 an hour and have a hard time getting my bills paid.



Now I travel back and forth from my home town to use a little studio type deal that I cannot bring with me in order to make my sculptures to sell. And I have class. So I do not want to be working overtime(which always happens when I take any food service job). I took a job as a dancer at the local strip club. The schedule is so forgiving. But I do not want to dance anymore. 



I got an interview with the police department here. A job I am under qualified for but would be paid training and it would look incredible on my resume. My mom would be so proud. A very respectable job. It would pay 13.50 an hour. Pretty good, I am very stoked about it. The interview went exceptionally well aside from one thing- the hours are going to be incredibly demanding and I will be required to work 11pm to 7am. They said I need to constantly be on call and I should not be upset when I have to work my days off with night before notice even when my time off was vacation/planned in advance. They want me, on days that I have class, come in before the class, leave for the class, then come back and work until about 4am. The original job posting did not mention they were looking for someone overnight, and there is no compensation for working the 3rd shift. 



This is the best job I would have ever had, has health and dental, 401(k), and other benefits (I've never had any of those from any job since I was 16) best paying (aside from dancing) and it would look very good on my resume. 



But if I take it, I am going to be worked to death with no time for me to build my own business selling my hand made items (yeah I know it sounds cheesy but I have worked very hard to make this a reality and it is my dream job, and I do make a little money from it- I am confident one day I will be successful! )



At this strip club I just got hired at, they cater to the college football home games days, and apparently the money is incredible. And I only need to be there about 30 hours a week, and can come in to pick up any shift I want if I need extra cash. 
I would have the time to work on my own business and take all the welding classes and possibly be certified by the end of my lease next year- or be very close to it. 



TL:DR- Should I keep being a stripper (which is only half soul sucking because I love pole dance) and use my free time/money to chase my dreams and education, or take this job with grueling hours which would be entirely soul sucking but pays alright and would look incredible on a resume?

Thank you so much for reading this. I am sorry it got so long winded!",29Aug2017,13
77,"I have a question on how to I should properly quit my job.

I have been at this company for the past 10 months. The industry is pretty niche, so the community is pretty close-knit.

On the side, I've been working on my own company, which I began  working on much prior to accepting this position, however it is in the same niche industry.

I need to quit, but don't want burn bridges or reveal my side gig, (my own company).

What is important is that I can have a clean, respectful exit and be able to pursue my company in the same niche industry as them.

How is the best way to do this?

81,"Hello,
For the majority of my life I've been brought up very sheltered by over protective parents who taught me and my siblings shame and corporal punishment was used often. I remember being 16 and not being able to hang out with friends at the movies, much less have a gf. And the thing is, it wasn't even ""you can't have a gf"" it was you can't go out and any talk of girls, sex, etc was simply not talked about. We were made to feel weird for being normal fucking human beings. (I have a lot of pent up anger for my parents even though I love them, but that's a different story.)

Fast forward to now, I'm in my mid 20s and I feel like since I missed out on so much that a normal person goes through growing up that my social skills are not up to par with most people's and a lot of social cues I just don't understand. I'm not autistic, I'm sure of that, but I still don't know the unspoken rules of say; relationships. 
I didn't even have sex until I was 20 years old and that was by luck. I have had sex with a few women after that but I still feel this empty feeling inside of me every time I try to get close to a woman. Like there's a disconnect between me and her and I can't express myself properly or ""do the right thing"". And maybe I could get away with that if I was younger but I'm older now and most women expect men to know these things by now. I also want to have a meaningful relationship with a girl, it's something I've never experienced.

I've been talking to a girl recently, she's 19 so she's pretty young. And I like her but it's weird; sometimes I see it going somewhere and other times I could care less. I also notice that when we talk on the phone there's a lot of pauses and I can't think of anything to say. I get nervous pretty easily but I try not to show it, but I'm stressed a lot of times trying to think of the right thing to say or follow proper etiquette or all this bullshit that everyone keeps telling me I should be doing like ""don't call her bro, wait a couple days"" or ""wait for her to text u bro don't be desperate"" or ""nah bro don't say that, that's not something u say til u get more comfortable with her"" etc. 

I have never had a girlfriend in my life, I've never had my heart broken that bad (nothing compared to really liking someone and going out and then breaking up), there's so much that I've missed out on and I feel emotionally stunted and not equipped to deal with the things that come with being in a relationship.
Is what I have going with this girl doomed to fail? I'm so confused about everything and I don't even know what to do.

Tl;dr 
Grew up sheltered and as a consequence my social skills especially in the relationship department are lacking and I don't know what to do in certain situations where I SHOULD know what to do. I'm tired of feeling this empty feeling inside of me and I don't want my future relationships to fail because I don't know any better.",29Aug2017,1
82,"Mac and I have been friends for years. We were romantically inclined at one point but then decided to not pursue it. Eventually we ended up in different relationships, but I found myself single and he ended up in a long term relationship with Lena. They have had countless issues and it's well known that she's cheating on him and sexting other guys. He is okay with it because she ""needs the attention"". The issue is, we have been sexting and occasionally meeting up to make out (but I always stop us from having sex). I told him we need to stop and eventually he agreed, but I still think he needs to tell Lena about what happened. I recently had a medical diagnosis that is forcing me to make amends and come to terms with the things I've done in my life. I didn't feel guilty until after this diagnosis and a lot of thought. He is refusing to tell Lena about any of it. Should I tell her and lose him as a friend, or do I just accept the guilt and keep quiet?",29Aug2017,1
83,"With a big music festival coming up in my country, and me seeing so many excited social media updates from people going to it, I can't help but feel once again terrible about how I live my life and how pathetic my social life is. 

I just feel like life has slipped away from me over the ages of 20-25. Instead of things improving for me, I'm missing out on more events each year due to my lack of friends.

I have only been to one proper music festival in my life, which was in 2010. It rained a lot and our tent was terrible, so it wasn't the most enjoyable experience sleeping there, but the fun and music were enjoyable. That was with my ex-girlfriend and her friends, though. I'm sure most people have been to multiple ones because they had the option, they have the social life.

Since then, I can count the music events I've gone to on one hand:

One during 2012, with one of my only friends. 
Two in 2013, the first with my best friend and the second with my two other friends.

Everyone else has big groups of friends they can go to festivals or concerts with and I just feel horrible without having the basic same level of fun in my life as everyone else. I'd wager most people who like music, which is nearly everyone, have gone to numerous music festivals and lots of concerts with all their many friends.

My current friends have drifted to being acquaintances really because they have girlfriends and they rarely do anything that doesn't involve their partners besides come out for drinks once every few months. 

I just feel isolated and kind of terrible that I've let my life become so lonely. I've always been the quiet introvert type. But it's utterly pathetic to not have 4 or 5 people in my phone I can call and say ""hey, do you want to go to this festival?"" like everyone else does. I don't even know enough people to play my favorite sport football with, so I don't play it. 

Large swathes of my life have been spent unable to do fun things or have fun because my social circle is so small. 

I guess I'm just looking for input on my problems and any advice at all would be nice. Seems like friendship groups that do these things together need to be built over years in school, college, work. Time has already ran out for me in that case.

94,"I am a small-time bad person who tried to cheat the system repeatedly - and was For a time rewarded with small successes - and it has now caught up to me. I am in a jam because I repeated the same bullshit habits for most of my adult life.

I flunked out of uni just a year shy because of sheer procrastination. I don't feel I can reapply because there is an academic discipline on my file (was dealing with depression and did something stupid to hide/escape my problems). I would have to start over by getting good grades at community college and then be readmitted to a university (my alma mater is now much more competitive than when I went). A few years ago I pulled another dishonest act and got myself into a grad program that I shouldn't have been if they knew I did not finish my first degree. Thanks to procrastination again, I flunked out of grad school. When I do put in the effort, I get A's, but I am very undisciplined about getting work done on time. I am a terrible procrastinator and feel horrible about it. I really want to get back into grad school and finish at least one degree (a practical one anyway. My undergrad is not in a very useful field to my profession now) to prove that I am not a lazy loser.

Thanks to luck and being reasonably competent, I have a good job that I enjoy, but everyday I live in fear that they will find out about my real accreditation, or lack thereof, and fire me. Nobody in my life knows about my incomplete education or the dishonesty. There is no reason for them to think I flunked out of uni and they think I paused grad school because a career opportunity came along.

My husband has a job in a different country. He wants me to move there, but doesn't know that I never completed my education as claimed. Financially and intellectually, I cannot just live in his country without a job. Getting a job there is difficult but possible, and my peers with the type of degrees I claim to have have done it, but I no longer want to lie about my education nor do I think I can get away with doing it again. To start from scratch will take easily 5 years of schooling and I don't have the money, time, or energy for that if I also need to work a FT job to pay bills.

98,"Hey r/Advice, 

I've been perusing this subreddit for quite a while, and I've got to say I never thought I'd be asking for advice. I've been thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend for a few months now, but I just can't seem to do it. 

Here's the details in dot points:

* We started dating when we were 17

* We are currently 21 

* He wasn't diagnosed with depression until last year, but he had always been a little down on himself 

* He finally saw a psychiatrist last year after I pestered him for basically our entire relationship 

Basically, after he was diagnosed with depression he stopped doing everything. He didn't go on walks with me anymore, he didn't play with his dog (I ended up taking him in January, he's only 2 and is quite energetic). Now, it's really starting to bother me. I thought I could handle it when he first told me, and I tried my hardest but I feel like he isn't trying to do anything and is kind of just using it as a crutch. Clearly he is depressed, but he won't even *try* medication and he's definitely gotten worse since diagnosis. 

I can't handle it anymore, and I think it's starting to take a toll on me mentally. How do I end it? I've asked my closest friend and she told me to 'be a bitch' because 'men just want to blame it on something other than themselves' but that doesn't seem right to me.

103,"Hello Everyone.

I really don't know how to start off or how should I say this but I feel so much pain as of this moment.

Just to give you a background of myself, I am a 30-year-old heterosexual male and have been fighting off this feeling of loneliness for months. I am the only son in our family of 7. I never had any trouble socializing with females since I grew up being surrounded by women. I am not really that close to my father though I do respect him as the head of the family and still love him as such. The biggest issue I had growing up as a teenager was that I lack interaction with fellow males. As much as I would like to, it's either I am being left out by them, being seen as only a math tutor or I am basically bullied by other males for being overweight. So I really had no choice but to socialize with females and gay men as they were the only ones who were kind enough to talk to me. It may be because of this reason that no other male would like to associate with me thinking I was not straight. I tried the very best I could to be part of them: I joined our school basketball team even though basketball really wasn't my thing, I joined our school army training classes, heck I even invited them over to our house to play video games. My cousins were also not an option because they were treating me the same. I even had to endure once where I got to a fist fight with a cousin's friend and all he did was to laugh at me and chose his friend's side. College was not mean to me as I met the very first group of male friends I had. We were 4 in the group. They were kind, intelligent people and I really liked hanging out with. One of them, I happened to be closest with as we both liked video games. The other one was very good at playing the drums and the last one was simply intelligent. For the entirety of my college years, I was always seen with them and up to this point, we still talk but being the adults that we are today, we very rarely get to see each other though we still have social media to catch up.

Last year, I met 2 people(a man and a woman) from my previous work which I grew really fond off. With the girl, I immediately got close to her because she was fun to be with and quite the introvert that resonated with how I grew up to be. And obviously, growing up with a family having majority of them women, that connection was not that hard to establish. Being this brother figure with her was a no-brainer and I told her so to clear out any suspicion that I am trying to hit on her.

The man, also an introvert, I didn't really get to like this fella until we get to talk for quite a bit. As time went by, it made me realize that this was the kind of little brother I wished to have. The feelings I have with my other siblings, I also share with this person. My instinct as a brother shows up whenever I am with this person. I never had a brother in my life. All my attempts in the past were all in vain, and I really don't want to remember them. All that matters to me is this. So I did what I do as a brother to this person. Since I lack the knowledge, let alone, the experience of having a brother, we did get to have fights but we did get to fix it, immediately. He told me that I was a bit clingy at times. I appreciated that and worked on to changing it. I was only trying to be there... I mean, I do it to my other friends, not just him. A few more fights later, I started to observe that he was becoming distant. If I approach him and ask that if there's something wrong, he says that there's nothing. This went on  until I resigned from my previous work.

I always try to reach out via social media, ever since, and my messages were not even seen. I always tell this to my other friend to that point that I am starting to avoid her also since whenever we talk, it's always this. Though, the 3 of us got to see each other again a few months back and I felt a bit relieved to see them. But as of this moment, he's not even trying to check on me when my other friend and other people I least expect are contacting me. Still, my messages were not seen. Communication, for me, is a big thing. Is it wrong to believe that when a friend cares for you, they will take their time off their busy schedules to check on you?I feel that all of my efforts were wasted. I don't want to give up because for me, giving up without doing everything I can is cowardice... seeking for the easy way out. For the record, all my past relationships with women, I did this so I have no regrets. I do want to talk to him about this but I hold myself back as we seldom talk to each other and I will open it on a negative mood?

I love these people as if they were my younger siblings but all I am doing is pushing them away. I feel so much pain that I can't do anything about it. I force myself to smile just so my family won't notice and to not worry. I don't want my other friend to feel that I am using her as someone to throw all my frustrations and such but since she's the only person I can talk to and she's within arm's reach from him. I have no choice but to talk to her about it. It really starts to take a toll on me. I don't want to go back to being this lonely person I used to.

I really don't know what to do as my mind's currently full of shit. I want to get piss drunk and do reckless things but it would only make things worse as more people will get involved.

105,"Hey folks.. I work for a pretty big trucking company which trains people new to the business. They have a school where you can get your CDL and as long as you pass, you're guaranteed a job. I went for the second time, as I've worked for the company for about four years overall, but between the first year and now, I was in the office, and had to get my license back because I let it lapse. So when I got hired back on, I did my phase 1, which is pretty much throwing you out with a trainer for 100 or so hours, where you learn to drive in traffic, deal with the qualcomm (communication pc and electronic logbook), backing, dealing with customers, etc. After phase 1, you transition to a phase 2 second seat.. Pretty much proving what you've learned to a driver with a bit more experience than you. I skipped being a 2nd seat and got promoted straight to 1st seat, essentially mentoring and verifying my 2nd seat has been trained correctly.. Here's where this gets interesting. I picked up a new 2nd seat a few weeks ago.. Seemingly good attitude. She has no clue how to back. Sends her inspection forms at the beginning of her shift instead of the end, which is how my ship is run. Constantly has me coming up when we get to a shipper because she has no clue what to do, no clue how to navigate a parking lot, talk to a shipper, set gps, nothing. I've tried to convince her to practice backing when we've had a chance. She gets set up and then complains about how uncomfortable she is and how she has a headache and can't do it.. Even admitting to me that if she was a solo driver how she would never make it.. Always an excuse. Pretty much, I was okay with this for the first week, ya know, people get nervous when they get thrown out there on their own, but it's going on week three and I'm at a loss. I feel she needs to go back into phase 1 and get trained more, but I have no clue how to bring it up. If I tell her that to her face, I'm a monster. Should I just message my manager?

I have not been applying for jobs since receiving the offer for my current role, and I applied for the &gt;future employer&lt; position early in 2017.

One of the strongest factors that motivates my decision is exploration potential, to be able to try different things in my role to see where I fit in best, and job security. Can I adapt my role for the first, and what can I expect in terms of job security.

Namely, any anticipated redundancies in coming years that could affect me, whether you consider me either inefficient or incompetent in the discharge of my duties, or you anticipate any transfer of duties I may not find agreeable, which are the lawful terms for termination for &gt;current employer&lt; employees.

I would also like to request flexible working hours. I will work the number of hours expected of me, but arrival at work, and hours worked late to my discretion appreciated.

I would also like to provide my notice at this stage, if I am not being considered for any alterations in my arrangements. 

May I also request a letter of recommendation I could give to future employers to testify to my ability? May I list you as a referee who will speak honestly about me? I know I can because you're great integrity anyway :) Was good working with you? Nothing personal just got to focus on my career advancement early on.

Got any suggestions to improve it?",29Aug2017,8
107,"Ok, this is kinda long but i'm looking for some advice of what to do i guess. 
So my mum had my brother, who is 5 years older than me (I'm 24, he's 29) from a marriage before she met my dad, then they had me. 
From the beginning me and my brother have always been treated VERY differently. He has always been allowed to get away with whatever he wants. My mum never disciplines him and almost seems afraid of him. She has never allowed my dad to fully discipline him either, so he's basically always had free reign to do whatever he likes. He uses my parents to whatever advantages he can and speaks to them in the most horrendous way. He's forever criticising them, 'borrowing' money that he never repays, telling them how they should do up their house and spend their money etc. He does have a job as a plumber and to be fair, he does work hard. 
I work hard too (2 jobs, 6 days a week) and never ask my parents for money, if i say anything out of place to my parents, i'm an awful, awful person and am made to feel so bad. 


Over the years my brother has turned alot more manipulative and will lie to get what he wants. My mum never stands up to him or stands up for me against him so he walks all over her. My dad isn't happy about this but is powerless to do anything as my mum won't allow him. This has caused so so many arguments in our family, to the point where my parents have almost split up numerous times. Away from my brother, they have a very happy and healthy marriage. My brother is the black cloud. 


When i was a teenager, he full on strangled me because my music was 'too loud'. I was crying and had red marks around my neck, after begging him to stop. I went to my mum, crying with red marks around my neck and she did nothing. Literally nothing. She spoke to him after and her words were 'He said he didn't do it so he didn't do it' - making me out to be the liar. This is not the kind of thing i would lie about. At all. 


We had a brief period in our lives where we got on ok, though i was always wary of him snapping about something. 
He's had numerous relationships. The one girlfriend he had was very arrogant and he allowed her to talk shit about my family, never once defending them. To the point where he let her scream at my nan, unprovoked, about something menial. The girlfriend he had after this had a young son who, when they were together, he had an old ipad which he gave to the little boy to play games on as he didn't want it anymore. This little boy was around 3 and through the amount of time he spent with my brother, started to look at him as a father figure. When the relationship broke down after around 18 months, he started to demand the ipad he gave to the little boy back. Holding all the photographs he had taken of this little boy (Holidays &amp; day trips etc) hostage until he had the ipad back. His mother was obviously very upset as these photographs were memories of her child at a certain age that she would never have back. She phoned us numerous times crying and begging us to get the photos for her. She also asked that when they broke up, he stayed for another week or so for the little boy. As in, see him less and less over this time so that he would understand he was leaving. Not for her, but for her little boy. He refused and just left this little boy, after getting so close with him. 


His latest relationship since then has broken down due to his girlfriends mental health issues that he 'can't cope with' and they were 'dragging him down' while going on about how much he loves her?! 
Me and my brother have had nothing to do with each other over the last 3 years due to his behaviour on a family holiday to Iceland. We went for my birthday, it was myself, my parents and my brother. It was initially going to be just me and my parents as, away from my brother we generally have a good relationship. I invited my brother along as i figured he would enjoy it too. As we were away on my birthday we went out for dinner in the evening. I found a nice Icelandic fish and chip restaurant which i thought would be great to try - we all like fish and chips and it seemed like a great place. All of a sudden my brother decides he doesn't like fish and chips, despite eating them regularly at home. He starts showing off about how he doesn't want to go but we can?! My mum gets upset and says that we should go somewhere as a family and not split up and where would he like to go? This is on MY birthday! The one day a year you get to choose where to go and everyone goes with it. All of a sudden, walking down the street, he's in my face pointing and screaming about what a nasty, selfish person i am and why can i not be considerate of what HE wants for a change - what?! My mum stands by and lets him do this then lets him storm off, leaving me there. I figure this is breaking point and decide to have nothing to do with him from this point on. 
This event caused a huge amount of friction between my parents and created an even bigger void over how differently we have both been treated over the years. This was made worse by my mum leaving our home and going to live with my brother for a few days?! (My brother moved out years ago, helped dramatically by my parents 'lending' him close to £25,000 - very little of which he has paid back)
This was literally all caused because he didn't get his own way. 


He has a vile attitude towards money. If ever i was worried about money, he would always say, don't worry about it, just ask mum and dad, they'll give it to you. When i was thinking of going to university but worried about the fees, he told me not to worry as 'when nan, gramp, our auntie and uncle pass away, we'll get everything and you won't have to worry about anything' (My aunt, uncle and grandparents are pretty well off and from my dads side of the family so are not blood related to him) This absolutely disgusted me. He only sees people for the amount they will leave him when they pass away. 
An example of this is shown by how much he will go out of his way to see my grandparents and my aunt and uncle when something happens yet will ignore them any other time. He always miraculously pops round to see them near Christmas or his birthday - or when he wants something. To put this in perspective, he never bothers with my other set of grandparents (Also my dads side of the family) who have very little money in comparison as 'they never bother with him' when they always make the effort. 


Yesterday it all came to another head at a family BBQ. My uncle has recently been very ill and it was the first time he'd properly been out and about since getting out of hospital. The BBQ was arranged to take place at our house and as yesterday was a bank holiday, i had a rare day off and helped to prepare all the food - even making homemade burgers. I was really excited to spend the afternoon with my family. My mum had mentioned to me before the BBQ that my brother would be popping by for a drink and to briefly see my uncle - i said this wasn't a problem, just him popping by for a drink. He then arrives just as we're starting to cook the food, bringing with him his dog who always tries to go for my cat. I've asked both him and my mum not to bring the dog around as it upsets my cat and it's not fair on her being afraid in her own home. When his dog has visited and upset her before, she has been known to not come home for a couple of days. 
My mum then invites him to stay for food. He's recently split up with his most recent girlfriend and has very few friends - this was the only reason he came around. He would never make the effort otherwise. He then proceeds to completely take over the whole BBQ. Saying how shit everything was and criticising my dad for the way the BBQ was lit, belittling my mum, smirking at me whenever he thought no one was looking etc. Considering i barely have any time off due to work and had spent most of my day preparing food etc for everyone, this got to me way more than i should have. I tried to sit outside with the rest of my family while he was doing this but struggled to keep my cool so went inside before i said anything. My mum then came in to talk to me and told me to keep it together for my uncle, I said if he makes any more comments i'm not going to be able to hold myself together so i'll leave. He then proceeded to make even more nasty comments and take over everything more so i left, knowing that if i stayed i would say something that would cause an argument which i didnt want happening on front of the rest of the family outside. I then had both my parents shouting at me over what a nasty, horrible, selfish person i am and how i've ruined everything. 


I'm now feeling really down and not entirely sure what to do, especially considering i didn't do anything wrong on this occasion. Any help or advice would be really appreciated as i'm sure others have been through the same. Thank you x

119,"Hello everyone,  
I would like to ask for an advice. Well I wouldn't be here if I didn't need any.   
Straight to my question before giving why I think pros and cons of each other.  
I would love to move to another country for living rest of my life. I can't decide between Japan or Russia(Far East, probably Vladivostok). Which one should I choose?  
I am going for college now and I'll be there for 5 years to get master degree from mechanical engineering(robotics) if everything goes well. Hell, I am prepared to all-nighters with studying, because I simply want to move out of here and I think with master degree it would be easier. So There are pros and cons I think I should consider. I would like your opinion on both of those countries and why I should choose this one. A year ago I wanted to move to GB but when I see what's happening there last years, I change my mind. The more I'll be from Europe then better.
Japan:  
+Culture  
+One of the best economics in the world   
+I heard there is really nice healt care aswell    
+top-class technology to work with   
+security(I don't count NK)  
-Language  
-Job?  
-Friends?  
-Would I fit in? It's Asian country  
Russia:   
+Language  
+I would probably fit in  
+It wouldn't be problem to find a job  
-Economy is in ruins(but they have a lot of mineral resources)  
-I heard if you don't pay a lot then healt care isn't on good level.  
I live in Czech Republic and there is no future. Czech Republic is slavic country and learning Russian wouldn't be such problem. If I choose Japan then would I be able to learn Japanese on level that I can actually go there by myself and find a job in my field? I am also scared of not fitting into social life. Well, They are asians and I am white. They have different social values. Would I be able to make any friends? I am not scared of work. I have part-time jobs on summer holiday breaks. I am planning to go to Japan next year for about a month or honth and half next summer holiday break to see if it's really for me and year after that to Vladivostok. What would you recommend to me? Where would you go to live if you was me? If there is a possibility to serve in an army for a period of time to get nationality/citizenship then I am not scared to go this way aswell.  
I am sorry for my awful English.

121,"A little background; I've been at this job for 6 months. Haven't had any significant problems, my managers are okay at telling me things they would like done differently but are fairly vague about it and it's more a ""just don't do that"" for things they believe are ""not my job"" or ""you should be doing this"" for several, quite large, ongoing tasks that were left undone or never started by my predecessor.

My role is fairly new, it's a growing business and the department I work in created a new role (mine) that also absorbed the duties of the Personal Assistant to the head of department. This is all fine and I knew this going in.

My issue is that I am the middle man between everything; I represent HR and Payroll in my department (100 staff), I represent the head of department in my work area (all messages/issues come through me). I am an administrator for a department of trade skilled staff that require a lot of admin support. I have people from all areas nearly constantly coming to me with minor to moderate issues, who all believe their issues are the most urgent. The longer I work there (and the more capable I show myself to be) the more tasks get diverted to me. I'm not exaggerating when I say between 9:30 and 10am I had 9 people come to me in person to ask questions or give me things to do.

I'm overwhelmed a lot of the time, and I feel extremely unproductive on days where everyone seems to want things done, because I can't focus or organise myself.

Can anyone give me advice on how to broach this issue with my managers at my review? Or how I can help myself solve it?

126,"So, for context:

I'm at a shitty 3rd shift job making $12.72/hr and I work from 10pm-7am roughly 4-5 days a week. This isn't really working out for me. I'm hoping the move out of my parent's house and live with my fiancee at some point (and obviously get married, which we can't afford to do right now. At least we're both ok with the long engagement!), and that amount isn't gonna cut it, what with the amount of bills I have to pay and how much each costs. On top of that; I can't stand the job anymore, and it's destroying my personal and social lives, due the hours. I don't even have motivation to get anything done after work when I get home because I'm so tired/exhausted that I don't feel like moving a muscle. I'm trying to look for a new job, but I'm not getting anywhere for multiple reasons. For one thing, I get calls for phone-interviews during the day, while I'm sleeping, so they catch me off guard, and I usually end up not getting the job (that, and I also kinda suck at interviews). For this reason alone, I'm debating on whether or not I should quit this job just to even *look* for a new one! Also, a good majority of the jobs that most job-search sites list have instances where:

*I'm not qualified or under-qualified for the job.

*The job is virtually the same as the one i have now/a lesser job.

I just want a full-time job, with benefits, that pays good, which is *incredibly* difficult to find in Massachusetts these days! To make matters worse, we just lost 3 people, and now that it's getting into the holiday season, the workload has increased, which sucks! The pressure and stress from all of this is driving me insane, so my question is:

129,"So let me set the background really quick. My mother in law has survived stage 4 cancer and a tumor in her head. She had part of her brain removed and part of her lungs and vocal cords removed to offset the cancer. The doctors also said that if the cancer came back that there was really nothing they could do. 

Now here's the issue that my wife and I are running into. My mother in law is under this assumption that wine helps diminish cancerous cells in the body and that it acts as a healing agent. Now she drinks so much wine that it completely changes her into a different person all together. (Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde)

My mother in law typically when she is drinking starts numerous fights with my father in law over things that don't really exists. She berates and belittles anyone she come into contact with; basically she tries to emotionally destroy them. She never apologizes for what she does or says because she can't remember what she did typically because she blacks out throughout the night or if she does remember which is fairly often she then refuses to apologize. She claims to have survivors guilt because her parents both died from cancer. She refuses to go see a counselor for these issues. She's driving us all away with her hateful words and controlling nature to where she tries to punish people that oppose her. She's very controlling and manipulative. 

Now the issue that I'm dealing with is that my wife has over the years of dealing with this traumatic event and the events after she has developed crippling anxiety to where most tasks that she could do are extremely hard for her to do. (Examples: job interviews, Work, babysitting, hanging out with friends, meeting new people, taking classes, and others) I have also noticed that with my mother in laws constant berating and verbal beatdown of my wife that with limiting her contact with her mom these feeling of anxiety kinda work themselves out and disappear all together. So after noticing this and with my mother in laws drinking getting so bad to where she is rarely sober but also that she is now putting minors in danger (she went to a family theme park and snuck in bottles [7 in total] full of vodka inside a minors backpack and then proceeded to drink all of them and when the police were called cause she thought she was going to drive them home; the police said that she was highly intoxicated and could have well blown 3 the legal limit); I decided that it was best to cut my mother in law off from seeing us for literally everything until she goes to counseling and some form of rehab whether that be family in home based or with an institution that her insurance will pay for. 

Am I doing the right thing here??? Am I not going far enough?? How do I help my wife when my mother in law tries to manipulate other people to get my wife to talk to her after we changed her phone number?

Ps. My mother in law is supposed to go into the hospital for cancerous scans every year on e a year to see if the cancer has come back and she's not been in four years and could have cancer again. ",29Aug2017,1

134,"Hello! So I'll try to make this brief but there are kind of a lot of issues going on.

Basically two years ago I helped my girlfriend leave an extremely abusive household. Her parents knew she was planning to leave so they emptied out her bank account.

She was still in school for a while but her ""friends"" from university were ditching her a ton. The reason was that she was bumming them out with her family issues and she had been spending too much time with me. This made her hate school so she ended up quitting. (We didn't really have the money to continue sending her anyways.) She was fired from a job (we worked at the same place but I didn't really have a say) and became quite depressed. 

She decided to go to makeup school instead (only a couple months) and really enjoyed it. She got a job with a big makeup brand and things seemed to be looking up! But then someone at work reported her for being ""inappropriate"". She was taken off shifts and told she would have to wait a few months for the complaint to be looked into. There have been no updates since then. We don't even know what the complaint was! The only thing she can think of is she mentioned doing makeup on a porn set in the past. (Of course now she thinks she's an idiot for bringing that up!) She's considered a private contractor so we don't even think there's any legal steps we can take here.

We're running out of money. We are looking into cheaper apartments to move into but she also wants to find a place that feels like home because it makes her feel safer. (I asked her if she would be ok living in a shitty apartment for a little while and she said she would rather die.) She's not looking for the penthouse suite but at least somewhere where the carpet isn't coming up and the paint isn't peeling back, you know?

She's applying for all kinds of jobs even things not in her field but she's not getting any call backs. We're living off of my paycheck. I get paid every other week and one paycheck a month goes to rent. We try to penny pinch where ever we can but we have her loan to pay back plus we've maxed out both our credit cards. 

PLUS she has a really bad case of endometriosis but we haven't been able to find her a family doctor. We finally got the hospital to take her seriously and got her in for an ultrasound (that's how we know she has endometriosis) but they never gave her a referral to the women's clinic? (We don't know why!)  She's been seeing a psychiatrist but they keep asking for a referral and then never call when they get the referral from a walk in clinic. So we're basically hopping her up on over the counter pain killers once a month so she's semi-functional and continually going back and forth between the hospital and the walk in clinic. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I have my own issues with depression and narcolepsy so I don't feel like I have the energy to take over job searching or resume writing for her. Nor do I think I could handle a second job. (Although honestly I might try.) Right now I'm just trying to keep her a little less depressed and anxious about everything.

142,"Now, I have never been close to my mom. Her talking behind my back is nothing new. In fact she talks bad about most the family and non-members of the family like friends or significant others (boyfriend's and girlfriends). Most the family is used to it and know not to really take what she says to heart. But there have been times she has pushed it and upset people. When she drinks it's pretty much a guarantee she will say something stupid.

It has come down to where I feel alienated from my father and her side of the family. If I talk to my father, she gives him a hard time because I am talking to him and not her. I do try to talk to her but she never seems to care or I am afraid she could potentially twist and use what I tell her against me later when talking behind my back. She complains I don't come to family gatherings or call. She never calls me and I have to reach out to her. When I do it's usually a 1-3 hour phone call of her talking and often repeating herself. And driving three hours there and back make it hard to visit especially since I have dogs. 

She has health problems that have led her to being unable to work and she rarely leaves the house. She spends her time with the dog and doesn't really talk to anyone or have friends. The fact her children have left the nest combined with medical issues and having almost no real human contact while my father is at work I think has effected her behavior. Last time I saw her she said she was going to stop talking about people behind their backs, then proceeded to do so about my Aunt. It's to the point me and my sister are like double agents, reporting to the other when she says something negative about the other. 

I don't know what to do. As I see it I have two choices. 

1) Do nothing. Let her continue, trying not to take it to heart. Maybe call more and do what I can to spend time with family. (Even if it's a three hour drive there and back)

2) Confront her. Either in person or over the phone. Tell her how I feel and stand up to her. Downside being making interactions with family harder and/or no guarantee she would really stop.

   I learned my contract is different from what we had been paying previously. Due to my own negligence I never really go over the CC bills throughly. We have an automatic payment and it's usually about the same each month. It's a CC we hardly use. This part really sucks is that it's been this way since the middle of last year. I've been charged about 1/3 more then what I thought it to be for almost 16 months(totally my fault for checking the bills). I never would have signed a contract for that amount for their services. 
  We've been emailing back and forth and I asked to have a confirmation of a contract or at least a recording of me accepting the new contract. So do I have a leg to stand on here?

I've cancelled my services. I'm interested in the possibility of being refunded the amount I didn't not agree upon.",29Aug2017,1
145,"So I have a friend on steam. I was fine with him before because we talked once a blue moon or so but now for some reason he's become so clingy. I'm always logged into steam so whenever I'm just relaxing doing my own thing or playing a game in origin, he'll message me and all my attention will be at him for a while until I ""Disconnect"" or have to go somewhere. It's gotten to the point where I just don't even want to get I my computer anymore. 

So, how can I stop him from messaging me and being so damn clingy? 

Side note, I would logout of my steam and just stay like that but I like to play games offline sometimes when I'm somewhere with no internet so I leave it logged in for that reason, but if it comes to it I might just have to stay logged out all the time ",29Aug2017,2
147,"I am not sure if this is the best subreddit to ask for this type of advice, but here we go.

I have a roommate, and she in the last few years has become one of my best friends. Last year, I went through a really bad divorce and after she moved away asked me to move with her. I took her up on it and moved to a different state. 

For the most part everything is chill, partly because I'm a super laid back person. She's got some issues with anxiety and ADHD which is probably why she can get crazy. 

Here are some examples:
I have become really good friends with a coach from the gym and he has introduced me to his group of friends. When we hang out we go back to his apartment and drink and I've had to stay a few nights because I didn't want to drive home, and she gets mad at me saying that she worries about me and that this group of friends are changing me and having me ""do bad things,"" mind you I am a 27 years old, and I am old enough to make my own decisions.

We have dogs, I have one dog in comparison to her 3 dogs. She recently got a puppy. I work a 9-5 and go straight to the gym. I am usually home around 7pm, sometimes I stay and hang out with my buddy but that is not a usual thing because he is the head coach there. She works 3pm-1am. Which means she is usually home all day with the dogs, but I feel like she leaves me the responsibilities of her dogs. For example, I have to hurry home to let the puppy out (mind you this is the 2nd puppy she's had since I moved in with her in January,) I have to walk her oldest dog because he refuses to poop in our yard. I feel like I can't go out on the weekends if I want to because she's at work, and she picks up a lot of extra hours and on calls on the weekend because she expects me to be home. She gets mad if I don't come home right away to let her dogs out, so sometimes I tell her I am home even thought I haven't made it yet. I guess yesterday she found out by checking out ADT. Mind you I was maybe running 45 mins behind. She had also left out back door open so the dogs can go in and out as they please. Now she is posting shit like ""I guess you cant trust anyone."" I didn't sell trade secrets I just didn't come home right away. In comparison I have one dog. Her downside is that she likes to whine to go in and out to the back yard and likes to bark, but other than that, she doesn't bug much. I don't expect her to walk her or anything like that. 

I give into mostly everything she wants because its just easier to do. She wanted the bigger room in the house we just moved in, I let her. She wanted a 3rd dog, I said sure, it is not my money. She tells me that her dads dogs are coming to stay with us for a week, I say cool. 

Am I being crazy? I love her but we pay the same bills. She did say that she can get crazy so she is self aware but I just feel like as far as the dogs, if I tell her I wont be home until late she'll get mad, so what is the point. ",29Aug2017,1
149,"I'm 21 and I'm trying to move out of my parents' house. I'm finishing up my senior year in college, and they've made it clear they won't help me. I've come to terms with that and became serious about making it happen for myself. However, in the past 3 days, I've spent a lot of time with my boyfriend, who has been helping me deal with the abusive way my mother talks to me and treats me. My mother has recently hit me and my parents used to be physical in order to ""punish me"". I'm now trying to talk to her and she's saying I'm a disrespectful and disgusting person, and that she doesn't know who I am. All I'm trying to do is make my own way in the world and do what I want. I've suffered deeply with depression and anxiety as a result of not only an abusive romantic relationship, but also as a result of the way my mom has made me feel less than worth of her love and her affection. As a young adult I want my parents to support what I do, who I hang out with, and who I am dating, but they refuse to do so. 
Is this a normal situation? Has anyone else had experience with this and how did they handle it? I know if I lessen my relationship with my parents, I'll lose all of a relationship with them, and I'll probably never get to talk to any of my family again. ",29Aug2017,7

152,"The management company that owns my apartment building has been doing work on the apartment above mine.  I recently got a bookshelf that needs a new coat of paint.  I had some free time today, so I decided to paint it on my balcony.  I got the bookshelf lightly sanded and got about a third of the way through painting it and then wood dust started raining down on me (blown out by a fan in the window of the apartment above mine).  I got the wet paint covered as best I could (not really covered at all since I just put newspaper on the top of the bookshelf).  Now there is wood dust (ranging from teeny little chips to fine dust) stuck in my paint.  I'm very pissed right now.  I've never painted furniture before, but from what I've heard, I'm going to need to buy several types of course grit sandpaper to take off the paint from today (with the wood dust stuck in it) to get the bookshelf ready to be painted again, and this is going to take me several hours.

154,"My BF and I have been together for two months. I met him at my student association trough a mutual friend who brought him in for the first time. My BF wasn't a member at the time - one of reasons I started dating him. Relationships within the association go two ways: well or DRAMA. Clean break-up aren't possible it seems and I have experiences with exes who I have to see every single week because they are a member. My social life is basically trough the association so that is basically the only reason why I still go. 

Anyway; my BF wants to join. I support that a 100% in the sense that it is good for his social capabilities. I want him to go out and get friends that aren't online. But it makes me hella nervous for a couple of reasons.
1) He is attractive but doesn't realise it. Irrational fear of me is that when that realisation kicks in due to a lot of female attention, he will leave me. I repeat *irrational*, I know that doesn't make sense so it's not the most important reason. I have relationship-anxiety might I add.
2) I like to keep my romantic live en my live around my friends separate in the sense that I want to introduce him myself when I feel like it's the right time. Besides those people I have only four friends who don't know anyone else. I like to have a place where I can be without my boyfriend; where people know me without my boyfriend attached and were I can talk about issues I have in my relationship without those people knowing my boyfriend. I am not different around him and other people, I am not trying to hide part of myself, but I like having a group of friends to myself so to speak. Not saying that he will have the same friends within the association as I do but still... the association isn't that big. 
3) I want to have a safe space for when things aren't going well. And the same regarding my ex: the student association still reminds me of him. 

I know that communication is key in this situation but I don't want to tell him ALL the reasons why I am not comfortable with the development. It's not the and of the world and I think it could actually be fun to have him join the group but it still makes me nervous. How should I do this??????? ",29Aug2017,1
155,"I'm a 23 year old guy. 5'8 and weigh 190. I know I am very overweight, started exercising.

I've had this issue all my life, just realized how big of an issue it is.

I live on campus so I do a lot of walking. Today it was raining a tiny bit. But I walked to class.

When I got there I was completely soaked in sweat. My back was drenched. My hair was dripping. It was a combination of rain and sweat. My feet ACHED. I got new shoes so maybe that is why. Doc Martins are very uncomfortable. I also think my shoes might be a bit too big. Better than being tight though, right? I think I just need to lace them up right.

Took a while to dry.

I HAVE to wear black. If I wear a simple grey tshirt, my back will be very damp. It is extremely embarrassing.

Here is the weird part. I felt like a freak. Yet there were these morbidly obese girls sitting in front of me, and they looked just fine. They weren't wet with sweat. They were wearing peach colored t-shirts and no sweat at all. Maybe they didn't walk far, I don't know. But everybody looked fine. Maybe I had to walk too far.

Even when I was skinnier at the weight of 170, I was still sweating like crazy. I would walk around the city in a grey tshirt, and my back and hair would become very damp.

When I sit down, I always leave butt sweat stains. No matter what. It's humiliating.

I guess my question is. Do some people just sweat much more than others?

I know weight is an issue. But I can't be sweating like this fucking bad so much because I'm a little chubby. Even when I was skinny I would sweat like crazy.

I sweat so much I can lay down on the ground and do sweat angels. I used to play basketball and I would lay on the ground and do a sweat angels to make my friends laugh. They always would be shocked at how much I sweat. They thought I got caught in the rain, that's how it looks like.

When I go running, completely soaked in sweat. My dad once asked if it was raining.

Just walking around campus I sweat so bad. I feel like just wearing hoodies from now on or something. ",29Aug2017,0

Now about 3 weeks ago we got into an argument which there has been off and on the last few yrs on various things. Sometimes my fault,sometimes hers... anyway she said we are done and asked me to leave so i did. Now we have a house in both our names and we are working on it but I am not back in the house. She said she wants to take it slow and date etc but we are pretty much doing a lot of things together except living together. She keeps telling me we need to appreciate each other instead of taking each other for granted. She has 5 kids that i have raised since they were 3. Always made sure they had what they needed.

161,"When I was in 3rd or 4th grade, my friend brought a science book home and showed me a page with a blown up image of a dust mite. That was the day I learned that a) dust mites exist, and are exceedingly ugly b) there are dust mites roaming all over my body. I was terrified. 

That night was one of the worst of my life. I couldn't sleep. I know it's impossible, but I could actually feel tiny bugs moving all over my body (the dust mites). The roaming was particularly intense in my neck area. I had to physically place my hands on my neck in a sort of chokehold to stifle it. 

After that night, the roaming feeling faded everywhere except for my neck area, where it's persisted all this time. If I stay still for too long without placing my hands in the chokehold position I sleep in (or a looser variant I position myself in in public), or if anything other than my hands comes into prolonged contact with my neck, or if I don't bow my head and tuck my chin into my chest, I get a very uncomfortable tickling/prickling sensation in my neck that sometimes spreads to my back and shoulders. 

Because of this, posing for photos or wearing turtlenecks or high-collared clothing is very, very uncomfortable for me. I wouldn't be able to stand the feeling of a choker for more than an instant. I've tried ""pushing"" myself and staying still, but the longer I stay still the more intense the feeling becomes, and I can never stand it for more than a few seconds. 

I'm 18 now, so it's been years that I've dealt with this feeling. I don't know how to make it go away. Is there a name for my condition? Some kind of treatment I can seek?

TLDR: I know it's in my head, but if I stay still for too long, I can feel the dust mites moving on my neck. I have to place my neck in a chokehold to get peace. ",29Aug2017,2
162,"I'd love to hear your advice/opinions.  My husband is a diesel mechanic and makes good money.  I do the farming, take care of the house, etc.,  The farming is done on my parents land just a few miles away.  We have poultry, dairy goats, and raise a batch of pastured pork each year.  There are 80 acres available, but most of the land has been rented by a neighbor for his cattle.  My husband recently got a new job with a bit of a pay decrease (most likely temporary), and I have felt quite discouraged with how the profit from farming has been.  I am not expecting to get rich, but it has been a lot tougher than I expected.  At the first of the year I was so hopeful to make some progress.  Anyway, I applied for a part time job.  It's a split shift, and somehow I thought it would work along with morning and evening chores.  I can make it work, but it may be difficult. It may also result in my parents having to put up the chickens.

It'd be nice to have some extra spending money, I'd love to decorate the house and be able to afford most of the animal feed. The only reason I would take this job would be for the money.

Only now (2 years later) did i start to worry of stds such as hiv or syphillis ( I dont know if the maid had any stds or not, don't have any contact with her anymore), I couldn't get tested  because i still live with my mother and i am ashamed to tell her and scared of how badly she will see me.

Overall, I do not have a bad relationship with my parents - but I find myself to be very mean to my mother from time-to-time. Here are some things that I fight with her about :

1. My mother is an extremely emotional person. Her response to every thing is very emotional - and she expresses it very overtly. However often times this results in her getting her hurt. I feel like I got the same genes from her and have suffered consequences in my early adulthood because of being over-emotional. I tend to get annoyed when I see this behavior and try to question her - often rudely. I also feel like if I did question her softly she won't take me seriously.

2. My mother is not a perfectionist - she tends to do things faster but usually with low quality. Again I fee like I inherited that quality from her and have suffered consequences. Over the years I have changed my attitude and focused on doing things with better quality - e.g. my work, school, house work. However, I don't see her making a change - she continues to do everything half-baked and low quality. This makes me annoyed and I pick fights with her.

I don't expect to get advice on how to ""fix"" her. She is older and I have no intentions of actually changing her. I just want to stop getting annoyed at her and picking fights with her. I want to get to a place where I am able to accept her flaws and not subconsciously hold her responsible for passing them on to me. I love her and want to be cordial to her - which I am able to do most of the times - but the fights/arguments are not pretty and I feel like I end up hurting her and making her feel like crap.

189,"Hey y'all

I'm posting because I'm a recent college graduate who graduated with a Bachelors of Arts in Political Science and I now have joined the work search like many others. I've been doing some sales positions and have recently looked into life insurance sales but due to reputation and misleading recruiting tactics I have decided to bag that idea. I'm posting because I want to hear from other people who are or were in a similar position as me and want to know where they found work after school? What were some things that helped?

192,"Hey all, using a throwaway because my actual account can be linked to me too easily. My boyfriend and I have been dating around 6 months, He is a great guy and I really enjoy his company. However, his wife (soon to be ex) is another story (to me).

He cancels plans with me last minute to accommodate her. If she calls him upset, he's there. Not that I think it's a bad thing, I appreciate his caring nature. But she is to freaking toxic and mean to him it kills me to see him continuously put himself in a position like that. She essentially stole his phone a couple days ago saying she was going to ""ruin his life"". She is just..manipulative as all hell. 

So I guess my question is, how have you been able to handle being with someone who's separated from their ex but who is still part of their daily life?

I totally understand their need to communicate (about financials and whatnot) and I fully support him in his decisions. How do I become a better part of this puzzle?

Tldr; Boyfriend is seperated from his (soon to be ex) wife, how do I support him to the best of my ability?",29Aug2017,3
194,"Hello, I'm new to reddit, so i just hope I don't break any rules here.

It started when i was in 11th grade. I was bullied, everyday, every single day for 2 years. That's when i also got rejected by someone i loved. It was horrible. Killed me from the inside. 

I got into college, i moved on from that girl, the bullies weren't here anymore. Things got better, but it's like life hates me. 2 years into college, and the bullying started again(I'm just so un-intimidating and weak, it tends to happen to me a lot)...and i lost my father last year. There's a lot of leftover guilt from that. I can't stress enough how much i loved him and miss him...

And recently again, kind of started liking a girl, and she got a boyfriend, and she has no idea I love her. She's an online friend, which is why i hadn't said anything, but when she got a boyfriend, I actually realised how much i like her.

It's like life hates me, whenever everything starts to get better, it just comes around and fucks me up just enough to give me a miserable life. I can't concentrate on *anything*. Because of this, i spend most of my time playing or sleeping, I've lost the will to be productive. I don't understand how to proceed in life without motivation! I don't know how to start... I don't know what to do...all i can think about is how I'm gonna have to go back to college to those terrible people, how I'll come back home and not see my dad anymore, how I'll text her and she'll keep telling me stories about her boyfriend. It's hard to be productive with *so much* of shit going on in life...

198,"So some background...I'm 34. I was adopted by my dad after he married my mom. My biological father ran out on my mom and I before I was born, she had me, married my dad when I was 3, and he adopted me at 5. I have one half brother, 4 years younger than I am. He and my mother divorced almost 15 years ago and 5 years ago he remarried a really nice lady whom I really like. 

Examples he may not particularly care:

When he was getting married, I returned to the Midwest (I've been living on the east coast since 2004 for work) to meet her extended family. When I met everyone he introduced me as his step son. I didn't say anything in the moment but when we were alone later I asked my brother and his wife if I had been demoted. They eventually confronted him about it and the next morning he called me and sounded rightfully ashamed and apologized profusely.

He has never, in 12 years of me living out here come out to visit. I go back between 2 and 5 times a year to see everyone, and every time he tells me how he wants to come and see me. Since I've been out here I've become the first person in our family to graduate from college &amp; get an advanced degree. I put myself through both without asking for any money from my family, then got a good job on Wall Street and have since bought a home, have a nice car, and all the bells and whistles that come with the work I've put in. he's never shown an interest in coming out to see any of it. Wasn't interested in traveling to see either of the graduations, and when technology advance to the level where I could facetime him and show him what my place looks like out here he wasn't interested. The first time he saw it was a Christmas when my little brother skyped me with my dad at the house.

Every year I give him a call on father's day and his birthday. 3 years ago I drove the 1200 miles back to the midwest to surprise him. For the last two years, this has been the extent of his contact with me on my birthday. ""Happy birthday"" sent over text.

He doesn't have a will. He's getting older and remarried several years ago. He still owns the house I grew up in but rather than leaving that to my little brother and I, he's just going to...well I don't know. He doesn't have a will so I guess it'll be up to our stepmom to determine if we are entitled to anything once he's gone. This wouldn't bother me because me and my little brother are in the same boat here, but last year I went out drinking with my little brother and he drunkenly let slip that my dad has told him he keep a metal box with several thousand dollars hidden in  a place in the house that his wife doesn't know about this. So I wonder now if after he passes I'm gonna be the odd man out on everything.

I found out last week that my biological father died. He had reestablished contact with me once I turned 18 and I had gotten to know him a bit over the course of a few years, but he wasn't a great dude (stole some money from me and other stuff) and I cut contact in 2006. I usually give my dad a call every weekend and this time he never picked up. Didn't respond to texts, nothing. He was never a fan of me talking to my biological dad and doesn't like uncomfortable conversation, so I'm worried he's ducking me because he doesn't want to ask if I'm doing ok. (I'm fine, BTW.)

So what do you think, Reddit? Does my dad not care about me? What should I do in this situation with a man who hates having uncomfortable conversations? Force one, or just accept it?

201,"This is mostly a venting post, and a throwaway for reasons but I need to decide if tohere's a way to get help for this and if it's even abuse or anything close? (Like I seriously dont even know) Thanks to anyone who takes the time to even read this.


Ok so I'm 19, and I absolutely do not trust my parents (mom and her fiance) to not go through my shit. I don't have a door in my room and they'll go through and ""search"" my room when i'm not home whenever they feel like it. They would make fun of me whenever they found shit like my vibrator or lingere. I remember wanting to keep a journal as a healthy way to deal with my feelings, but no matter where I seemed to hide it, they always found it, and I would get embarrassed and yelled at when it was found and entirely read through. (several times btw. I've had a few journals over the course of a few years/months, then decided to just not keep them anymore.)


ALL my devices have passwords. My laptop, phone, etc. Because I honestly CANNOT trust my parents to not go through my shit if I leave anything unprotected. Well last night, I went to bed pretty late and left my laptop on in my room, when I woke up I took a shower and when I came back to my room, my mom's fiance was IN my room, quickly getting off my computer, I asked him what he was doing and he got defensive as shit and kept saying ""my house I pay the bills if you want your own room by all means move out"" (which is pretty much impossible because i'm 19, in college, and only work part time)


So I brushed it off and walked to work. On the way my mom texts me and asks if I was going to work and I said ""yeah why""and she said ""I'm going to come by later and see if you're really there, i'm gonna lose my mind if you aren't."" And I was like ""um? What did i do?"" (I'm a pretty well behaved child honestly, never done drugs or got into trouble growing up). She says ""because you sneak out and fuck gross guys!"" referring to a romantic interest I was seeing at the time.


I went on my facebook to immediately change my password but got confused when it read ""wrong password"" whenever I tried to change it? And figured something was wrong with the app, and went on safari on my phone to login, nope my moms fiance fucking changed my password from my laptop. Thank GOD I was still logged in on my phone and was able to change it from there.
So all of this boils down to, does this sound like abuse?? Or am I overreacting and need to talk it out with them, or are other parents like this?? Like i'm so frustrated and I don't even know what to do, I feel like there's a fucking wall and I can't talk to my mom about anything and part of it is because of this? Idk, someone please help me with what the next step should be.

She still goes there to babysit which baffles me because that was the biggest factor of why she wanted to leave. It dawned on me she probably just wanted to escape her mothers rules. linda recently started hanging out with a guy she works with ""dylan"".

223,"TL;DR version : Crappy controlling Mom, no college alone time and went straight to marriage, gave wife power, miserable, need to understand what self power and willpower is. And, go.

**************************

I grew up in a working class family in a poor neighborhood (we didn't have a lot of money but we had more than our neighbors). My Dad worked and my Mom managed the home. My Mom was a dictator most of my life and basically lined up our schedule for us, our milestones for us, and our beliefs for us. I didn't have many friends growing up, so I didn't know my mom was domineering and making me powerless without her. I couldn't cook, I couldn't clean, I couldn't shop, I couldn't go out in public, I had no clue what was going on politically, I never had sexual education, I never learned self defense, I was naive and very innocent. I was sheltered and I couldn't cope. I found out how powerless she made me when I was put in a situation where I had to live in my car. I couldn't survive without help. Luckily the girl I was dating at the time (only 2 months fresh) was willing to get an apartment with me so I never had to come back home. But now I was her problem...

My Mom approved of my (now wife) girlfriend and explained to her how helpless and powerless I was but she agreed to stay. I was 19, she was 20, we really shouldn't have been on our own yet. We had lots of sex living together like most couples in the same living space do, but I eventually found out the hard way she wasnt on birth control (relationship was 4 months fresh). So the deal with her was sealed, and my lack of social and personal skills was put on hold for my son's survival...

Life was hard as an incapable son with a son. We ate a lot of fast food and we had a few really unsanitary situations. We made a lot of mistakes. I continue to make dumb mistakes today that I should have known better, like not teaching my son the proper way to open a metal can and him cutting his finger and needing stitches and now he has a deformed finger... I am just unfit for survival without my wife...

Today I am 35 and in many ways I am still powerless. But this isn't because of some oppressing authority like my mother, it's because I never learned how to be powerful. I have no clue what I am capable of, and finding out just seems like a huge waste of time since someone else is just going to insist on doing it for me. But I do see the consequences of this. By being dependent like this I am forced to ""owe"" my wife with no reciprocation since I already got a free meal or forgiveness for not being a top level executive. Basically, my Mom made me a beta male and I don't know if this is my nature or my nurture. I definitely feel like I should be doing more, but I am just not able. I want to become able, but I don't know how self power works. I was taught to be this way, I would need education before I could change...

So what is self power? How does one gain it? How does one use this power? And how does this power help me become a better person if my wife loves being in charge like my mother was?",29Aug2017,1

Mondays and Wednesdays, I have class starting at 8, basic conducting, followed by breakfast, then Theory from 10-11:15, on Wednesdays, I have a second violin studio class from 12-1, then I have my lesson at 1, then both Mondays and Wednesdays I have Orchestra from 3:15-5:15.

I practice deliberately, at a variety of tempi, in rhythms, practicing specific string changes and shifts, but I still feel like my time is wasted. I'm probably over practicing, but if I try to skip it, I feel anxious and restless until I go do it. 

I feel like I have no way of relaxing and recuperating. I don't really do anything other than school, practice, and hang out with friends sometimes. If I don't practice I feel antsy. I don't really have any hobbies, I have a gaming PC but I never feel like playing on it. I haven't touched it in weeks.

I have healthy coping mechanisms, I write in my journal and run 5ks fairly often. But I feel like I don't have a method of regaining energy. I'd give anything to take power naps whenever I have downtime, but I lost the ability to sleep unassisted a year and a half ago. I'm trying to learn how to take naps again, but I've only managed it once or twice. When I wake up I do not sleep again until I take my medication. If I run out I don't sleep until I get medication again, I was up for 4 days once because I didn't have a refill.

Something has to change. There has to be a way to cope with this schedule. Anyone have any wisdom for me?

227,"Hello Redditors of Reddit, thanks for taking the time to read this and help. 

I go to a public school in England called Bradfield College and I have finished my GCSEs,  applied and been accepted into a school North of London called Woodhouse College. 

The thing is, there are many dilemmas in my way. First of all, I have paid the term fee (£11, 500) and I have the choice waste the money and go over to Woodhouse College. The school fee at Woodhouse is free of charge and this can help my fathers   financial state, which to be honest, only stops me getting luxury items and less talks from my dad.

Secondly, another dilemma is that I really dislike my boarding house, like it's terrible, I miss lunch, dinner and breakfast - as there's no one in my house to go with (for those unfamiliar, you to literally everything with your housemates, whether if it's going to meals, sports or co curricular, stupid I know, but that's public school life. However, apart from the house aspect of it, I love my current school, the friends, food and much more. So going to Woodhouse would mean that I don't get to live in such a bad house with bad people but then I may not be settled in and regret going to the new school. 

Finally, the benefits of a public school life is huge (for me), so much more sports, more freedom, more co curricular, which I don't think can happen if I go to Woodhouse, just work. Also I get help along the way. Whereas Woodhouse , it's you and only yourself, which may be easy for some of you but I find it hard to choose right between football/ps4 and work. 

Sorry if I come across as high maintenance, I'm just so worried on making the right choice.

(I do International Baccalaureate, my grades are alright and I can definitely improve them through working hard) and 2) I feel like I wouldn't be good enough to do it if I do get accepted. But I suppose that's the point of going to Uni, to learn how to do it...

I've done a considerable amount of various tests and other programs that are supposed to help with choosing but, yeah, nah.

I'm not expecting anyone to find a uni for me or anything like that obviously, but, any advice?",29Aug2017,1

232,"So me and this guy work at a local retailer, where we stock shelves and help customers. We do loadouts and other stuff, basically anything customer service. It doesn't get too stressful usually. But our assistant manager (whom everyone likes) transferred to a different store. Our employee budget is over the top, so they cut all our hours and fired nearly half the employees. This makes it to where we are constantly busy and now we're getting backed up on freight. The goal is to get all the pallets of merchandise done before the next truck on monday (abot 25 pallets). Right now we have about 65 pallets in the back and we're supposed to rush to get it done and help customers, plus many other things. The store manager (jackass and no-one likes him) hurt his back so now we have no manager except a keyholder who thinks he's god's greatest gift.


That's just the small stuff. My co-worker (like everyone) got his hours cut, but he is falling behind on his bills. He nearly starves himself at work, has a small lunch and doesn't eat much at his house. He's a big, buff guy but he just doesn't have the money to buy food. His wife works for the school district and her job is falling apart. They have 3 kids who live with them. One likes to ditch school all the time and one has epilepsy which worries his wife all the time. From what I've heard (I don't go over to his house or hang out with him personally, but we are partners at work and I'm 17, he's 46) they fight quite a bit about stupid things. This past month he's been cleaning the house (like excessively scrubbing floors almost) because his mother in law was coming to town.


Then the most concerning part, is that he has troubles swallowing food and stuff, just in general. He said he was going to the doctor and apparently he has a bump in his throat (basically a tumor). He looked it up himself and he says his x-ray and the picture on the internet were almost identical and it was throat cancer. He's gone to the doctor quite a few times this past week for that, but they keep drawing blood and are sending it off for testing. He says the doctors keep arguing and ""don't know what it is yet"". He says it feels like they're saying ""he's screwed"", but won't tell him what it is. This morning, he showed up to work 4 hours early and just sat in the breakroom listening to music. They called him earlier and he told me that he just said nevermind and is cancelling all the appointments. He doesn't care anymore. He told me not to tell anyone, and I haven't except for posting this, but I'm really worried about him. I don't think he's depressed or anything, like he's said that he doesn't think suicide is the way to go before. He's very religious, but I just think he's giving up and I think he's making a mistake. What should I do? I've been trying to talk him out of it. On top of the fact that he cancelled the appointments and surgery (he said he'd need surgery no matter what before) his wife doesn't know yet. So he's gonna be more stressed and I don't know what to do. ",29Aug2017,1

I'm just going through the motions, not really totally upset because she is my best friend, but that's all I really see her as.

And not to sound like a douche, but there are also so many girls who I just wish I could get to know.   It's not that I'm really all that bad looking.  I feel like I'm slightly above average.  But I have no confidence.  I sit at the end of every row in class, not talking to anyone, not knowing anyone, and I'm just sad.

247,"I've been going through a rough patch in my life lately, and have been feeling kind of stuck. Unsure about what I want to be doing with my future, stuff like that.

Also recently, I lost a somewhat distant relative, and I was shocked by how hard the grief hit me. I had only seen him a few times throughout my life because he lived far away, but the impact he had on my life was still pretty big. Every conversation we had felt important to me, and I learned a lot of lessons from him, just by him telling me stories about his past and such. He was one of those people that had a profound impact on nearly everyone who met him, and his death was very unexpected so it really shook me up.

It's only been a couple of weeks but I'm finding myself crying all the time, I'm having trouble sleeping, forcing myself just to eat, shower and get through the day. The days seem to drag on, and I'm just watching the clock for time to pass so I can just go to bed and hope that tomorrow will be slightly less painful and miserable. I've also developed insomnia, and am having issues sleeping. I'm in full blown grief, and it took me by surprise because I've never grieved for anyone, and I feel like I shouldn't be hit this hard because he wasn't really somebody I *knew* that well.
I had to take some time off of work, and now that I'm back at work I'm really struggling to keep up my performance and not break down in tears every few hours.

So I recently discussed going to therapy to my parents, and they kindly offered to help me pay for it. They don't have a whole lot of money so it'd be spreading things thin for them, and that's making me feel kind of guilty because I can't exactly pay for it all on my own. None of us has insurance either, so that's not an option.

I've been wrestling back and forth between going to therapy or not, because I'm embarrassed and scared to go as I've never been before, but I don't know how to deal with this on my own. But at the same time my problems seem too small to need therapy over. I don't want to waste my parent's money, or my own, but I worry that if I don't get some help to unstick me and help me deal with my grief I might sink into a deep depression. I'm also worried that if I do go to therapy, I might get judged for feeling such intense grief over somebody so distant to me, and they might think I'm totally unbalanced for reacting the way I have been. 
Sorry for the wall of text.


TL;DR) Do people ever see therapists for smaller problems in their lives? Will a therapist judge me for seeking help if my problems aren't that bad or if I'm reacting very poorly to normally small issues?",29Aug2017,7
248,"So I tried to do  retail as a job, and all my mangers have said your too quiet and your just in general are too slow at doing things including finding items for people, (since I typically never know where an item is or take too long to get it) 

People I work with like me though in fact on of my mangers said I was one the nicest people that she's ever met and she's thinks i'm really humble, which is great considering she has worked in retail for 8 years in a variety of different stores.

The problem is she did admit that retail properly isn't the best for me, because not only the lack of speed and quietness, i'm apparently not showing enough enthusiasm for the job, which meant  I had to explain I struggle to  fake it, although I enjoy the job. On top of this she calmly mentioned my lack of confidence and how although i'm a great person retail companies won't be interested in me as they want confident employees, and that she will be forced to get rid of me in 3 months time assuming I don't improve, because if she doesn't me and a mystery shopper type person could fire us both.   

Which creates a problem what does somebody with little to no experience do when the world revolves around customers and finding things for people?

I'm slowly falling further behind. I've got $1,840 on me. I'm past due on my rent from this month. they were asking $2,200 by 3pm today.(latefees) If i couldn't pay it, i'd have the eviction process go through and i'd be facing up to $700 in fees(supposedly).

my next months rent is $1,618 due on the 5th.

I've got $1,000 coming in around the 2nd. I'm still short on bills.


I've got 4 kids and keeping them is my #1 goal. I don't care if we don't have a place to live, I just wouldn't want to risk protective services taking them.


Right now my plan is to:


#1 Sell everything we have. Don't pay any bills. I can't afford the money to stop the eviction process. So i see no sense in paying next months rent if I'm still being evicted for last months. I'd rather keep the cash to go towards a place to live in the future.

my goal is to have as much money saved up as possible by that time. after the legal stuff begins, I'll see my options. Hopefully i can pay off my debt, or have enough money to move somewhere else.


My concern is... If i'm evicted.. how will I find a place to live? will my kids be at risk? I can't find anything affordable from a private owner that would accomodate 6 people.(my wife and 4 kids). i'm thinking of lieing on a rental application before this eviction goes through, and rent out a studio or 1 bedroom. that way if I do risk possibly losing my children, i could say we do have a place to live.

Now she is homeless, caught up with a scumbag ""husband"" who abuses her, and has been forced into prostitution to fund her/their habit.

I know she started taking painkillers for a legitimate reason. She was initially diagnosed with a disease, and ended up electing to have a hysterectomy in her early twenties.

My question is what makes your favorite rappers stand out and what makes rappers you don't like suck? There are millions of rappers and most of them are average but what makes them average? 

Tell me what you hate about the average rap songs being released these days, because none of my songs were rated better than 6.7 and I need them at a 10.

282,"Lately my depression and anxiety has been taking over who I am as a person. It heavily effects my drive to get motivated. I'm twenty-five years old and still haven't found a purpose in life or something meaningful to pursue. It feels like my depression is weighing so heavily on me that it won't allow me to be free. I'm a slave to my own thoughts.

It is so hard for me to muster up some motivation and keep going with it. I've never felt more hopeless and lost in life. All I wish for is to have that fire that naturally burns for some people. What are some ways you guys stay motivated even with depression?",29Aug2017,1

287,"Okaaayy so this post is going to be a bit choppy, I haven't really done a lengthy post on here before AND I'm on mobile so I'm terribly sorry if this looks a bit choppy.


I'm an 18 year old gay male, living with his parents, just graduated high school and a freshman in college at the moment. I was on Grindr one night talking to this really nice guy and I decided I wanted to fool around with him. The same night, my parents announced that they're going on a flight somewhere to go to an appointment and I'll have the house to myself for the rest of the night and next day's evening. I took this as a great opportunity to have sex with the guy that I was talking to because the first thing that he noted was that we couldn't meet at his place, so I took it upon myself to host us instead.

My parents were giving their final goodbyes and told me where the pre-made food was incase I got hungry. Later that night, he came to my house and we both talked for a bit, got comfortable, then actually got to doing it. Everything was peachy and amazing and fun and we finish and just hang around a bit naked, condom visible on bed, and some condom wrappers sprawled out across my bed.

To my horror, my mom walks in and gasps loudly, THEIR FLIGHT WAS CANCELLED. She then goes into a yelling fit of rage hitting the guy and chasing him out, and my dad follows and chases him out of the house NAKED. (I think he got his shoes though, I hope.) Anyways, they then come for me and then kick me, hit me, slap me around and throw objects at me while I'm on the floor in a ball, traumatized. I seriously thought my life was over at that point, like, I wanted to just kill myself right there. My entire life felt like it ended. They kept going on and on about how I betrayed them and how I'm a disgusting, dirty liar and my dad yelled that he wasn't going to be ""tolerating any faggot shit in their home.""

They both exit the room and go downstairs, I think my dad chased the guy I was with to his car. Then they yell for me to get downstairs and I get sat in a chair in the middle of the living room, interrogation style. They were asking what the guy's name was, telling me how much danger I put our house in by letting a stranger in (I fully understand where they're coming from when saying this because I fear he'll come back and get revenge on my family for getting chased outside naked.) Then...the moment my mom asked how I met him, I told her ""an app"" and she FLIPPED and literally pushed me and the chair to the ground and she started kicking me again and hitting on me. Whilst this was going on dad was trying to stop her from hitting me so much.

Eventually, we all go silent. Sometimes, my mom screams out different insults like ""you fucker!"" and ""you idiot!"", and my favorite one of all, ""you LIAR!"". They keep telling me about how dangerous it was to let this guy in the house (and I also forgot the mention that our house is pretty big and costly) and that was making me cry the most because I do realize how much danger they may be in because of how much they scared the guy on his way out. 

This is the part that just broke me...they then start talking about kicking me out and getting me an apartment in the ghetto area of where I live. They say they're going to search for cheap apartments tomorrow..and honestly I'm completely fine with it. She even offered to pay my first month's rent (I really appreciate her, I'm very taken care of) and I start to cry viciously because I've never seen them actually want to get rid of me before. I'm an only child too, so it comes as a huge shock.

A day after the worst experience of my life, today, I see her on my way out to go to my class. She snips at me, says as little as possible, doesn't even turn to look at me, and just completely shuts me out. I have my second day of college and I almost got into a car accident because of how suffocated I am because of this entire situation. I was seriously considering killing myself because of how Ill never have the same life again after this, but I think of how foolish I'd be to end it all over something like this. 

I'm in class, I see the guy deleted and blocked me off of Snapchat and I feel so bad about the entire situation. I wanted to apologize to him because I put him in a really bad position but I don't know if I should reach out or not. he was a really nice, articulate guy and he made me feel very beautiful inside and out (no pun intended..lol?) We both talked about our futures, ambitions, likes and dislikes and we clicked really well. I also think he was hinting at a relationship because after that night he wanted to make me promise I wouldn't ever have sex with anybody but him.  I then start thinking that might make him more angry, and he'll actually come for my family and try to kill them. (That's what they're most worried about I guess)

I have his Facebook as well so I'm tempted to message him and apologize, but I also am hesitant.

I need some serious advice..I'm a mess. I might even be moving out to an apartment tomorrow. I don't know, but I'm just mortified.",29Aug2017,4
288,"So I have just adopted a puppy from a European charity called REAN. They rescued my Gracie from Romania and we got her on July 7th 2017. She came to me in disgusting condition even though this charity was meant to have her in their care since around February and she was only a days old when they found her. 
Now, the group have a private page on Facebook for those adopting to keep in touch and one of the main admins isn’t very nice. She is also a main worker for the charity. To put it short we had a disagreement and now she’s threatening me to take away the dog, just because we disagree about her attitude. I have full screen shots of conversations where she is rude, swearing and sends threats. 
Main issue: she claims she can remove the dog from my care whenever she likes. Now, I paid for Gracie a fee of £250 plus another about £300 in vet bills, medication etc because she had infections and skin conditions from the poor treatment the charity gave her. 
Can she remove the dog from my care even though I now own the dog and haven’t abused or harmed her in anyway? Please help, I don’t want to lose my puppy!

289,"**Please bear with me my brain and my english don't work very well after being used at work:**

So I recently graduated from grad school, and started my second job in engineering. I have grown very dissatisfied with my situation from my job to my new place (had to move because landlord sold) and perhaps I might be dissatisfied with the city.

I have found myself complaining a lot about everything but mostly my job to my friends, which I think is an indication that I should leave. However, I sometimes question myself simply because I have only been on the job for 5 months. Sometimes I think it will get better once I get a better grasp of my role, but sometimes I also think it's just going to remain shitty because 1) my boss is always condescending 24/7 to everyone 2) my coworkers seem a bit cult-ish (and shame other people into working more). 

When I am done with work (usually stay longer despite needing work-life balance and not getting paid overtime), I come home and I cook/catch up/try to research potential options. I get frustrated at all the issues this house has (it's an old house) because in my mind, I don't want to deal with any more issues when I am back from work. In the end, I do not really feel my home is my home but rather a place where I prepare for work. 

Lately, I've been considering moving west. I've been hearing about life-work balance being more common in the west for engineering (construction) companies. And while some people tell me it's more expensive and gloomy, I think moving to a place with more similar values would be much more beneficial to me and I am willing to pay a bit more for it.

Right now, I am stuck because I don't want to leave my job too early (+ other factors) and I think I will end up moving early next year. However, being unsatisfied for the following months sounds soul-crushing to me. I have been at my job 5 months and I feel like its been years of being exploited and I wonder how other people do it. I wonder how they wake up, get exploited for so many hours, and still give an appearance of happiness at work. While I liked what I studied, I generally get bored from working 8 hours on the same area of knowledge everyday despite the fact that I am always overwhelmed (I also dread from being overwhelmed) at my current job. 

I guess my question is: has anyone dealt with a situation like this? has anyone had a cult-ish workplace? am I spoiled for having my mind made up regarding my work place dissatisfaction? how can people survive in a place where their values are antagonistic to live-to-work values?

P.S. When I started my job, a few days in, I thought to myself I would be there for a year and bounce. However, lately I've been thinking I won't be able to make it to a full year.",29Aug2017,1
290,"After being unemployed for almost an entire year I found a job in a great company doing something I actually like and my coworkers are lovely, everything should be great right?
Except it's not. I fell into a horrible depression while I was unemployed and now I'm putting an enormous amount of pressure on myself to be the best at this new job, so much so that I'm having nightmares about my bosses being angry at me and every time they call me to tell me something I'm subconsciously expecting them to fire me.
To make things worse I was hired to cover for my boss while she goes on maternity leave because I have a master's degree. But now they told me I won't be doing that anymore, but I'm still being paid more than my co-workers because I was supposed to have more responsibilities in the future. So now I'm shitting myself thinking that they may not need me anymore and they could be paying less to someone with half my experience to do the exact same job I'm doing now. 
My bosses told me they're really happy with me and even noticed how stressed I am and told me not to be so hard on myself, but I can't help it. I don't know if I sound crazy, and I realize how lucky I am to have found a good job and I really just want to relax and enjoy it, but I'm stopping myself from being happy.

293,"TLDR - Co-worker is basically bullying me.  Management wants me to file a harassment complaint with HR.  if I do, he will likely end up being fired.  I feel awful that this might happen to him even though he's not really a good person.  Not sure what to do.

Long story short, there's a co-worker at work who has been harassing me, undermining me and basically bullying me for several months.  I talked to my managers about it.  There are several of them who are now aware of the situation.  They have taken the guy aside and talked to him.  He insists he's doing nothing wrong.  They've documented everything.  They can clearly see it and it's got so bad that other employees have gone to them and pointed out that they need to stop this guy from harassing me the way he is.  

Last week we had a meeting with HR.  Again, he insisted that he was doing nothing wrong and that all the fault is mine.  The gaslighting he did was pretty hardcore.  I left feeling like this was all in my head and I was crazy.  My management documented everything and was extremely pissed at him.  They are having ongoing talks with HR about the situation and have encouraged me to file a report with HR on my own about the harassment.

My company is a Fortune 500 company that has a pretty clear anti-bullying policy.  If I file this report they will immediately start getting their lawyers involved and figure out what they need to do to keep this guy or me from possibly suing them.  This guy's situation at work is tenuous as it is but the second I take this step it becomes even worse and the end result will probably be that he will eventually be fired.  This likely won't happen for several months and things will be very uncomfortable for him and probably me as well until then.

I am torn because I don't want to see this guy get fired.  We have very good jobs that pay extremely well for the area we're in.  He's got 7 kids at home and his wife doesn't work.  I've worked with him at this job and a previous place for nearly 10 years combined.  I don't want to see him get fired and feel the need to defend him for some reason which makes me feel even worse because he tosses me under the bus every single freaking chance he gets.  Reality is if I don't file this complaint, he probably gets fired anyway, management is that incredibly pissed at him.  If I do file the complaint, he gets fired faster.  I don't really want to be responsible for him being unemployed so I don't know what to do. ",29Aug2017,1

295,"I just graduated with a dual bachelors in psychology and education from a pretty prestigious university. I also have 5 years of paid experience in the mental health care field and 7 more years of volunteer experience for a total of 12 years of relevant experience (3 in a supervisory role). I took three years off between high school and college so I'm not the average 21 year old college grad.  

I'm currently looking for full time work and I know that BAs in the mental health care field don't get paid that well but my current part time job pays just as much/year as many of the full time job offers I'm getting. I can't justify leaving my current job to work double the hours for the exact same pay.

While I will continue to get raises, there is no opportunity for advancement in my current position. 

Accepting one of these low paying jobs isn't all that terrible. There would be opportunities for advancement, it would be better for my career than staying where I am, and when I pursue my Master in Social Work I may be able to finagle using my job as my field work (which is often an unpaid internship). 

On the downside, it's not a good financial decision considering that I live in Boston and am not being offered living wage. I want to work full time for career advancement but I was also expecting to make more money. I wasn't expecting my salary to double, I recognize that I'm incredibly fortunate with my part time job, but I was at least expecting a quarter more per year. 

I'm safe at my current job and can stay there for however long I want while I look for full time work, but I don't want to end up spending 6 months to a year or more trying to find a job that pays what I want because that will essentially delay my career.

I just don't know. The only thing stopping me from taking every single one of my job offers is the pay. Even if salaries are negotiable, there is no way they will pay my minimum desired salary as that would be 10,000/year more than they are trying to pay me. 

Should I accept one of these offers (good for career but double the hours/less vacation for same exact yearly pay) or keep searching until someone offers me higher pay (living wage for Boston + makes sense considering my decade+ of experience)? 

Am I deluding myself into thinking someone will offer me 45,000-55,000/year to work in a mental health care field with a BA?",29Aug2017,0
296,"As it always is in school, you'll have people you don't get along with. You have enemies; people who hate you and will hate on you even if you've never done anything to them. In my case, my enemies don't really pose a huge problem to me. There's no physical violence involved, and they avoid talking to me for the most part. 

The problem is, I HATE confrontation. I'm a Highly Sensitive Person, so I just can not deal with any sort of negativity. As soon as one of them enters a room, ""threat"" alarms go off in my head and I can't face them or make eye contact. I KNOW they're not going to harm me (they just verbally treat me like crap if they do talk to me), and yet I still freak out. I want to be able to look them in the face and be calm and collected, not panicking and avoiding eye contact just because they're sitting a few centimetres away from me. 

The only time I've felt proud of myself regarding this case was when one of them decided to ask me if I passed in this class we were both taking. This guy had earlier in the year verbally harassed for speaking out my opinion. When he asked me if I passed or not, I turned to face him, gave him the dirtiest look that I could, replied, and walked away. I felt great.

my youngest brother can be sassy and a bit bratty but he's a very sweet kid. he annoyed my dad the other day during church so as soon as we got in the car my dad threatened to kill him (in the church carpark, irony i know). he told my brother ""next time you ignore me i'll smack you so hard outside that people call the police and put me in jail and take you to foster care, and then i'll strangle you. my family members have died before so i'll get over it, you're an insignificant speck in my life"".

obviously absolutely shitty stuff.

he's done this before- i remember last year for some reason he told my brother to hang himself and you can tell in his tone that he is serious and not playing. a couple times my little brother has come home from school in tears when our dad picks him up, but he doesn't tell me what my dad said to him to make him cry when i try ask. 

so obviously i feel awful for my brother, no kid should have to hear that sort of abuse, its awful, especially at his age where he's not well liked in school and teased a lot as well from what i've heard, to just hear constant negativity is awful.

i'm not sure what i can do though. i'm a bit ashamed to say but my dad intimidates me as well, and i'm scared to stand up to him because i do take his threats of violence quite seriously.

he cheated on my mum last year which hugely scarred their relationship and my mum is still unsure if he's faithful to her - she's said before that she wants to leave but she doesn't have the money to do so and is worried about how she'll be seen - since most people we know in our city are my dads family and friends (my mum emigrated here from overseas).

i'm in my last semester of uni, i wanted to take a break afterwards and do some travelling, but in the car i thought that instead what i should do is get a full time job and earn some money so my mum can separate with my dad and i can get my brother out of this environment.

can you think of any other things i can do, or what i should do in this situation? i don't want to be useless in this situation.
