3,"Last year in September I signed a lease to move in with my sister her boyfriend and her boyfriends friend. The year went great no issues everyone had a great time. In June of this year we signed a promise not to resign our lease in September. Mid September my sister and her boyfriend break up prompting her to move out and me as well, back to my parents house. Not too big of a deal my parents were great about it. I paid my full rent for September before the break up, and then I was asked if I could pay for October while they tried to find another roommate, I did without fuss. Now I am being asked to pay for November because they still haven't found anyone. I don't feel like this burden should be my responsibility anymore, it really wasn't my choice to move out of the apartment I feel like it was a decision made for me. how should I handle the conversation with my sister and her ex?",28Oct2017,1
4,"So basically I’m planning a concert as a community project. I’m required to do some community project as a requirement of my Living Learning Center. The concert is required to be free but I’m selling art at the concert to raise money for the Trevor Project. (They do suicide prevention and advocacy stuff for LGBT youth) I requested permission to rent the court yard from my Living Learning Center and they approved my request without many questions. I did state in my request it was going to be five hip hop artists. The only thing is I’m concerned the lyrical content might be considered too profane and that I’m going to offend people. They didn’t ask about it, but I’m worried nonetheless. I’m on a college campus but promoted the event to the public. I feel like there’s no going back as the concert is tomorrow. I’m so nervous my heart is literally aching. I didn’t pick the artists -the studio my bf works at did. I never felt like I had much of a say in who to book.

6,"So I was gone 4 days during school do to influenza, therefore I had some work to makeup, I called my friend to get my work for me so I can work on it at home. I get done with everything. I had some math work I was doing at home, I'm generally a very smart person for my age when it comes to math, reason be is because I do constant game development therefore dealing with math all the time. Well on my math work it showed no where on any of the papers to ""Show your work!"" So as me being really good at math I can do it all mentally. When I get back to school, I hand the papers, cool. The next day my math teacher says that there was no way I could do it all mentally (WTF?). So me being dumb said I left the equations sheet at home. So today(Friday), the math teacher asked if I had the equations sheet, I said ""Ohh, sorry, I'll bring it Monday."" What do I do about this? I did the worksheet mentally and had no need to write out the equations to solve. 

TL;DR: Did homework mentally, teacher claims I couldn't, dumbly claimed I left the equations sheet at home. But as I said, I did it all mentally, my math teacher expects it Monday!",28Oct2017,1
7,"A few hours ago I was hanging out with all my friends at the public skatepark when one of the “rough” kids, with friends who all act like they’re in a gang and would throw bricks through people’s windows after something happened to one of them, came up to my friend who was nearly out cold drunk and started hitting him after pushing him into a bush. I walked up and pulled the guy off my friend and tried to calm him down to which he responded “my nan is in hospital” prior to hitting me around the head a couple times. I wasn’t bothered by it until I walked up to my friends and in anger I said something like “I shoulda knocked him out cold there and then” which wouldn’t necessarily be a difficult thing because I am an ex boxer with a hell of a punch. Anyway someone said something to the kid I think because he started coming up to me and telling me he wanted a fight to which I said “I don’t want a fight” and he kept hitting me and hitting me until one of his friends came up to him and pulled him away and made sure he wouldn’t do anything else, after this I felt a huge bout of anger and had to restrained by my friends as I was screaming stuff like “I’m gonna fuckin kill him” and the kid who had hit me broke free from his friends and came up to me but I were still 50/50 I should kill this fucker and I don’t wanna fight. So he starts hitting me again and again and I finally hit back with a right hook and busted his lip and split my knuckle. After this there was an uproar and I was bombarded by a torrent of hate with people saying “why’d you bust his lip” and two of his friends came up to me, threatening me and saying if I do anything else I’ll get beaten, not to mention while I was getting angry prior to this one of my so called “mates” pushed me and said “go home you prick” and I’m not sure what to say about that but afterwards all my friends told me to go home and one of them escorted me there. But now I’m in the wrong in my peers perspective and I don’t want people to think I’m any less of a good fighter because I didn’t fight back as I didn’t want to get my windows smashed and now I’m under great regret and I’m wondering how to get over this problem, not to mention afterwards the guy came to my house and apologised to my parents for what he did and shook my mum and dad’s hand which props to him for that but I spoke to him, and we’re on good terms now I guess but he is bragging about how he beat me pretty bad when I only retaliated once but I am thinking of ways to get over this as it is becoming a problem to me and I feel like I don’t have any reputation any more not to mention how my dad thinks I’m in the wrong because I punched him.",28Oct2017,3

Right now, I can honestly say that I can't attract someone who looks this pretty because I'm not handsome nor established.

The bright side is I'm a work in progress:

&gt;I'm still taking driving lessons and don't have my own car yet.

Would it be smart to start going to the gym again and gradually become physically fit, just to improve my chances of attracting someone this pretty ?

Will doing my best to become independant and possibly established actually make someone like this want to be with me ?

11,So I recently graduated college in May and unfortunately I had a job at the University I went to and it ended because it was student contract. I was recommended for graduate school NEXT fall and I really loved the job and want to work in higher education (a college or university position would be great). Well my over controlling father forced me to move back home; i.e. I'm broke and have no choice in the matter. My dad doesn't understand that we live literally middle of nowhere and there are no jobs for me here so I'm applying to everything possible. I've had 6 or 7 interviews for positions I want but my dad yells at me because they don't respond to me next day and that's the world he used to live in. He is pushing me to get a job at a local manufacutring job and got mad when I told him it would put me back into a depression. He only cares if I'm making money. I want to find the job I want and enjoy in a field I feel useful in and accomplished. I have no car of my own and all my stuff is back home here and I'm broke but my parents help me if I do what THEY want me to. My parents aren't happy together and my dad lives in our basement and always has an angry face and I absolutely hate it here but I need them to help me if I do find something.

It’s like I’m suffocating in my surroundings and I need some change. It’s making me feel sick to the point I’m randomly tearing up when I think about how trapped and isolated I feel where I live and what I’m doing.

15,"I have had Chronic Fatigue and Chronic pain for roughly 10 years now, since I was 15. My symptoms weren't disabling to begin with however it got bad when I was 18~ and forced to drop out of education. I'm now 25 and the last few years my health has not changed much except when it gets very bad and I am mostly stuck to bed rest. I am unable to work, I tried to volunteer this year and I loved it however was forced to drop it pretty quickly as it caused a bad flare up and months later I still don't feel back to the energy levels I had just before I began.

Recently I went to a convention (RTX London). It was my first ever convention and I travelled from NW England to get there. I knew it would cause me a bad flare up but *after* I got back home and could crash at home for long as I needed. However I underestimated how taxing it was on my body and in the morning on the first day I felt ill and didn't go in for a few hours. My ex-boyfriend who mostly paid for this trip went without me so I could sleep a bit more. The hotel was 0.5 miles (about a 15 minute walk away) and when I finally did go in, I had just missed him going into a panel and I was on my own for a while. I got anxious as there was so many people around me (I suffer with anxiety and don't like big crowds), I was too hot, couldn't breathe properly and in a lot of pain, especially in my legs. My ex messaged me saying to find a helper so I did and they directed me to First Aid where I then got advice and directed to an information desk, where I battled myself mentally and hired a manual wheelchair. Technically my condition is classed as a disability and it has been on my mind for about a year now whether to use one to help me but I also admit I have been in denial (and told I am) about how bad my condition is (like trying to do things I shouldn't be). I managed to push myself a bit and then waited for my ex, he for the rest of the 2 day event pushed me around the event and after initially feeling huge regret for coming because I realised I was seriously not physically capable of the walking and standing for queuing, I started to enjoy myself immensely. I still feel guilty though for my ex having to push me and I feel indebted to him (though he says it's nothing) because without that chair or him I would have had to crash at the hotel till I could go home on the Monday.

I feel after the event my eyes have been opened as to how I could be living. I met some of my heroes and met a lot of awesome fans/people, it was the first time I enjoyed myself without severe knockback of pain and fatigue I normally would get in years. I did still suffer when I got home but only for a few days instead of the weeks I predicted I would be ill.
I know though even if magically a powered chair appeared in front of me I couldn't use it everyday but I'm at the point where I rarely leave the house as I can't be out more than 30 minutes-1hour without then having to come back home. It's honestly left me suicidal at times as I get little help medically and I also battle once/twice a year to receive financial assistance (currently I recieve £73 a week). 

These chairs are very expensive and I despise asking people for help however as stated above, I feel basically in a bit of a desperate situation and was wondering if people think it's okay to use a crowd funding site to raise the funds? I have no way myself of doing so and my family is in no position to help either. It would cost about £1,000 for what I'd need. I just want to experience life as I feel I'm missing out on so much, my life mostly is being in a house each day with little to do. If I can get out even a few extra days a month with this help, it would mean the world to me. Currently I am mostly dependent on my parents to help me, and they themselves have their own health problems and my Dad is retiring in a few years, it would be nice not to be such a burden on them either.

Apologies if this post was quite long but I wanted to explain best my background and current situation.

22,"This has been a really weird year.

For the first half of the year, I moved halfway across the world with the girl I love.  It was amazing, but difficult, and once we returned home we ended our 6 year relationship, citing how things just haven't been working.  And while I'm glad I left and followed her and came back I can't help but think I was a bit dumb by doing so, thinking it could make things better or work between us.  And what's weirder is how little I feel now that she's gone.  I don't feel all ""woe is me"" now that she's gone but she's left a void in me that makes me wonder when I'll honestly be comfortable being intimate with someone, if ever again.

Moving home and coming back to a job that pays decent is a bit of a relief in comparison to the gruelling sketchy work you pick up while travelling, no matter how soul-sucking your home-job is.  However I don't know how long I can keep working at my current job without whatever's left of my spirit and soul being destroyed.

Coworkers and I have nothing in common, there's such an age gap that most are unrelatable or just straight up unfriendly and mean.  Coming home from work and partaking in creative hobbies is no longer fun for me, it just seems like a waste of effort.  Friends are those I see few and far between and reminiscing about old times gets old itself.  They're fun to hang out with but when you develop feelings for one of their significant others, just because she's being really nice to you, perhaps out of pity of this fucked up year you've had, you get confused and hate yourself just a little bit more.

I just want everything to end.  Nothing is enjoyable.  Everything is frustrating, confusing, exhausting.  I don't want to die because I think there's some semblance of hope in me still, but if I could just sleep for an incredibly long time, that wouldn't be so bad, right?",28Oct2017,1
24,"preemptive TL;DR title says it all. this was a few months ago. both sober. clear ""no"" and ""stop"". I'm not sure how to proceed, or whether the relationship can be saved. 

when we first got together we were 16/17 and since then have had bad consent practices. from the first time we had sex he went farther than I explicitly asked him to and he ignored my requests to stop. but I liked him, was lonely, and didn't know better so we kept daring. being only 17, he was terrible at sex. I was also on an antidepressant that made it impossible to orgasm, and so I basically got used to the idea that sex was bad and just something I had to put up with to be close to someone I liked. 

it took a long learning curve of finally getting off medication, learning about my own sexuality, etc to finally be able to orgasm again and enjoy sex with him. he's very patient attentive and now sex is wonderful. and outside of the sexual part of our relationship he's my best friend and we get along great. BUT the problem is he went too far again recently, after (so I thought) learning better, and I'm so hurt, bitter sad, and furious. 

what happened:
I always hated anal sex but one day offered to give it one last try. my boyfriend was ecstatic to try it but as usual, it hurt a lot (and yes, there was lube and deep breathing exercises involved). so I told him to stop. usually what happens when I tell him to stop is he reassures me I'll get used to the feeling and he continues. this time it hurt badly, I told him clearly and loudly ""no"" and to ""stop"" and he continued. it hurt so much and I don't know why I guess I just froze up. I couldn't move or say anything and then he asked me what happened and if I was alright. but I felt paralyzed so I didn't move or respond and he decided to keep going until he finished. when he did I felt disgusted and ran to the bathroom to throw up. he was extremely apologetic and has been ever since. he cries, he says he's ashamed and guilty and it's the worst mistake he's ever made. I love him very much so I forgive him and try to work through my feelings but I don't know if I should even bother. I don't know if I should just leave him and never talk to him again. I feel so sad numb and broken down I don't think I even know what I want anymore or what would make me happy. 

sometimes I have good days, sometimes I have bleh days where I'll sleep with my old teddy bear, sometimes I have days where I don't eat anything at all and scroll on my phone all day and cry all night. my boyfriend and I talk about this a lot I just want to know if anyone has been through something similar and I want to feel less alone. I made a therapy appointment at a rape crisis center but never went, I don't want to keep feeling like this so I'll get back to them finally.

Recently, I went on my dads Amazon order history (do not know why, was just curious) and saw purchases of lingerie, leggings, and panties. They were all through my dads credit card and shipped to our home. From time to time, he tells us that he needs to buy packages for his coworker due to the fact that his packages keep getting stolen, so we should not open the packages. But seeing the order history got me suspicious.  
I would also like to point out that I see porn in his internet history. I am really scared- is my dad cheating on my mom or maybe he just gets off to women's clothings or actually buying for his coworker? By the way, I never see the box packages within a day of the package arrival, and we usually leave boxes in a recycle bin. ",28Oct2017,1
30,"15 m in a car crash of an emotional state and nut really sure who to ask, so here I am.

I had an abusive father growing up from a baby to childhood. He made me aquaphobic due to throwing me in a pool; He gave me eating issues as if I refused to eat anything as babies do, he would force feed me and he would beat me for crying. He was also a prick to my mum but I'm not entirely sure what he did to me or mum

Luckily Mum got us out of there when I was 4 but she had no where proper to go to as she had fallen out with her parents and brother about marrying my father. We had to move into a domestic refuge where others in similar circumstances went to. I had gotten into a phase where I would only eat McDonald's Fries and there fish fingers as they where my toddler equivalent to comfort foods as only Mum ever took me to macs. The diatition she consulted said to let me eat whatever I wanted and that I would try new foods when I felt like it (this leeds to me being over weight) She goes to court and fights her ass off until I'm 7 to make sure I'm only under her custody and won but it cost a lot and the damage was done. He hasn't attempted to make contact since

I was a little shit to everyone after we left my father swore slot punched everyone who I even slightly disliked

Mum took me to a child physiatrist that helps me be less dickish tells her and I that the chances of me remembering what my father did is low but I would likely remember his I felt.

Lacking a fatherly figure I latch on to my Mum's Dad. He was really cool, kind and fun to be around and I always enjoyed his company. When I was 7 or 8 however, he passed away to what I would later find out to be hereditary heart disease that may have been passed down to me but not yet been tested.

The next male roll moddle I found was my 14 year old cousin who I liked for many of the same reasons. We also shared hobbies and humour which was great and I saw him every other week but as he grew he had less and less time to spare to visit me as his dad (Mum's bro)  put pressure on him due school. 

At this point I was starting to get over weight for eating nothing but crap and comfort food with little to no exercise and began having body issues as a result. 

Fairly cushy life from then on until 2016. Learn that Mum has a list of things that my father was charged for but she doesn't want me to see as ""the past is in the past"", find out that Mum didn't have the best life before me and that she passed on a lot just so I could have and do what I want and feel really guilty about it. Began to get the idea that I may be a result of *a one sided want for a child* and still can't shake it. Friends started to fuck with me unintentionally or not and don't really have any other mates like them. Year 10 hits me like a tone of bricks due to work stress. I start having bimonthly breakdowns from all this adding up

Get into 2017: I feel even worse about myself being the shortest and one of the fatest people in my year, had 2 crushes on closer friends and rejected twice ruaning friendship with one and making things awkward with the other, crush on a third but dening it, exam pressures put on like a bitch, start moving my breakdowns to night look like a little pussy and to not stress people out, hormones amplifying emotional instability don't really have any close guys I can talk to about guy stuff and have started regularly falling out with mum about seemingly trivial things and don't even have motivation to do my hobbies.

I really don't know what to do at this point, any sort of advice would be much appreciated 

TL;DR: Father abused, body issues, lack of roll moddle, feel guilty for mum, 2016 is shit, depression, romantic joke, possibly the result of assault, school is shit too, don't feel masculine, hormones, arguing with mum about stupid things

as the title suggests my mom passed away a few weeks ago. It was sudden and very very unexpected. I'm 18 years old and currently living away from home doing a discipleship program in a city 6 hours away from my home town. I don't have my high school diploma but am working on getting my GED, I also have little to no ID. 
My plan had my mom not passed away would have been to finish the discipleship program and then decide what to do for schooling/career when I got home. But I don't have home anymore. All of my stuff has been moved into storage and I no longer have a living space in my hometown. 
I'm debating leaving the discipleship program and getting a small apartment and job in my hometown, to be closer to my community and church family. 
I can also afford to stay in the discipleship program for the remainder of their course, but it would be very hard on me to be away for long periods of time. 

I just need some advice or insight on all of this. Is there anything that I can do to help my situation, what things should I look into doing?

39,"[UPDATE:] Tentatively we've decided to Fly there first so we can have more days at Universal, and then rent a car and drive back!

Hi all, this holiday season, my bf [23M] and I [23 F] booked a cruise sailing from Miami for 4 days. Because of med school / work we can only travel Dec 30-Jan 7th inclusively. The cruise we booked is Jan 2nd to 6th (the only one that fit in our schedule). We want to go to Universal Studios too (1, or preferably 2 days)... We're aware that we're booking late but we only received our holiday schedules just now.

Initially we wanted to book flights initially but we found out quickly that holiday season weekend flights aren't necessarily the most affordable. It would be to fly Home &gt; Orlando, then bus to Miami, cruise, then fly Miami &gt; Montreal. We COULD drive but we're about 24 hours north of Miami. That would make driving back super tight and crazy but it would cost us only gas money (~200$) compared to (2000$+) in flights.

Flights is another can of worms, do we go for the cheaper/crappier flights? There are flight options that save us 200$ each if we chose to fly Miami &gt; Newark + 6 hours transfer to change airport + New York &gt; Home, is that a terrible thing to do?

What would you do if you were us? Backup plan is that we do have generous parents and we know they would chip in as holiday/birthday presents, but I'd like to hear you guys' opinions first.

Thanks in advance! Any other alternative options and ideas are welcome.

Edit: Additional information that may or may not be relevant is that we don't think driving would be that bad if we take turns and there’s always audiobooks, music and stops along the way to keep us entertained, and we’ve taken several 13-hour road trips before (except this is twice as long!).",28Oct2017,1

My problem is that im realizing it might be slightly offensive, especially at my liberal university, so I need a different name for it other than ‘pimp’.

46,"Last August, I rolled my ankle while going down the stairs. It wasn't so bad and I didn't push my college clinic hard enough so they didn't give me crutches or a brace. 

I kept walking on it by going to class, and my ankle got a lot worse. My heel started hurting a ton, so I've been on crutches for nearly 14 months. 

I've gone to more doctors than I can count, had 4 MRIs, and was told that I don't have permanent damage in my foot so there's no need for surgery. According to the ortho surgeon,  I just have swelling in my heel and my ligaments are better. 

Even so, I have pain even when I'm not walking. My quality of life is terrible and I don't know if I should say that I'm disabled on job applications. Everyday I mourn my life before I got injured because my entire world has collapsed. 

How do I cope with this tragedy? I started going to PT last month, which has helped. Even so, I feel really depressed about my situation because my life is never going to be the same again.

***also I used to be extremely active and loved going on long runs and bike rides. I've gained 15lbs and have 5% the energy I used to have, so it's bad :(

I can't wrap my head around most concepts, I really struggle to understand concepts that are even remotely complex, I spent like 30 minutes yesterday trying to understand what a pyramid scheme was and I still don't get it, just stuff like that.

I picked up an instrument over a year ago and I still sound awful, I don't mean I don't sound like a pro I mean I sound really bad. I can't play the most basic of stuff and I find it really hard to read music, despite the fact that I practice every day and have been since I got this instrument.

I am so incompetent at work, I get like 4 hours a week at KFC despite having worked there for 3 years because I'm more of a liability than anything. I misunderstand instructions, don't hear people, drop things, don't do tasks properly and just generally mess things up.

When people are teaching me something on a one on one basis and they finish and I still don't get it it's the worst feeling, they just sigh and explain it again and I still don't get it.

My mother had me when she was 16, and I was basically pawned off to family members, kept completely secluded from any social events with friends, molested, and for years lived in complete filth. I don’t exactly know how much of this my family knows, but I remember as a child trying to tell them, and nobody would listen. I slashed my arms up in 8th grade and my mother didn’t enroll me in any sort of counseling at all. 

As soon as I turned 18 I moved out on my own, and I’m doing well from a financial stand point, but I still struggle with mental issues such as anxiety, depression, etc. My mother always brags about how great of a mother she was, and how we never “struggled” or “lived in filth” and how she kept a clean house, when I specifically remember the opposite. Im starting to think she has become so completely diluted that she *believes* this fantasy word she created really existed. 

She (or anyone else in my family) hasn’t ever apologized for how I was brought up. As a child I feel as if a lot of this shit was out of my control, and it’s caused a lot of psychological damage. She’s constantly saying “I love you.” What can I say/do when she reacts when I don’t say it back? If I try to confront her about my childhood she will have a meltdown and we won’t talk for months, and she will convince the family to exile me. ",28Oct2017,1

63,"Firstly, this is NOT a relationship advice post! I do not have any worries about my relationship's strength and definitely do not want to leave my girlfriend! 

I have been with my wonderful partner for a year and a half. She was a vegetarian for about a year before I met her, and for the past few months she has been following a vegan diet. She stopped consuming meat, and since animal products, for ethical reasons.

In the past couple of weeks my girlfriend has been constantly sending me links to videos and articles about animal suffering and slaughter, with a pressuring attitude, seemingly to 'force' me into a compassionate decision to stop eating meat or all animal products in general. She also tries to start ethical debates about what I eat, and then gets angry and upset when I 'don't see how my diet is wrong'. 

I am not a heartless person, and fully understand and respect her ethical decision to become a vegan. I know and have seen that most animals go through a lot of suffering before they are consumed. I personally could not carry out the 'killing blow' so to speak, apart from in a survival situation. I however like eating meats and fish, and most other animal products like dairy, so cannot see myself being able to cut them out of my diet. On a side note, I often prepare and eat vegan meals with my girlfriend, and enjoy them immensely!

Does this make me a bad, hypocritical person for continuing to eat meat? How can I ask my girlfriend to stop pressuring me? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? 

I'd love any suggestions, opinions, stories, facts etc, from both sides of the story if possible! I'm not sad or angry, I'd just like some good old r/advice!!!

Thanks very much!!! :)

The mom's standard is always has to be at least a bit more than the silver standard (90). 

She's already resorted to cheating more than once just to keep her grades up and avoid getting beaten once again. The mother is very stubborn, a part of it is probably due to her having breast cancer, but that isn't an excuse to drag your daughter across the floor and down the stairs. The dad on the other hand tends to be in the neutral but whenever mom and daughter fights, he usually blames it on the daughter even with explanation.

I personally never liked parents who have strict standards. Abusing your child because they aren't meeting the standards you set is harsh. We too have our limits.

I got top marks in university though, and I feel personally satisfied in my work life.

But finding a relationship is hard. I have always wanted a family to raise in a much better life than I did, and to instill values that make better people.

Most dating apps don't really have girls I'm interested in (they're either drug addicts, or single moms from failed relationships), (or I just get rejected a lot on them I guess) the rare dates that work, I'm never sure I really want to go through with it, or they reject me.

In the beginning few weeks, I described what I wanted and filled out questionnaires to help them understand the final product I was envisioning. They completely understood what I wanted and agreed that the project was attainable. They gave me a quote which was reasonable and wanted to split the payments into three; first payment up front, second payment during the halfway mark, and the last payment before actually handing the website over to me. I wasn't sure if that's how website development companies charged people but after contacting a few others (before choosing to go with this company) I found out that this payment charging method was used by most. So I made the first payment and they said that they were going to start with the design phase. After a couple days they asked my partner and I to come on skype to talk to them about how they're going to make the website and gave us examples of how the functionalities would work. So right of the bat my fears of this being an illegitimate company was gone because they seemed like they were actually trying to complete this project. However, some of the biggest functionalities that I wanted and asked for was not even mentioned and when we brought it up they said they couldn't do it. After our Skype conversation, my partner and I sat down and decided not to continue on this project with this company. So I sent the company an email stating that we won't be continuing with the project and would like a refund on the first payment made because they haven't started on the creation of the project plus they couldn't even create the original project that we agreed to in the beginning. However, they insisted that we come up with new requirements for the website, but we didn't want to change up our expectations plus we were very turned off after our Skype conversation and wanted out. Now they won't respond to my emails and I don't know what to do to get our money back. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated and sorry for the long post.

83,"Here we go first time posting on reddit by the way!

Me and my ex broke up back in September 2017. It has been a roller coaster ever since. We had a 5 year relationship and now have an infant son.

Our relationship was rocky! She came into the relationship with trust issues and I had a lot of female friends. I gave up the friends and we where great for the first year. Then the problems started my work at the time had me work 18hr shifts 5 days a week and half days on saturdays. During this time I denied her sex. She then denied me attention though living together for six months. I looked for attention from others not for sex just replacing what I was not getting. She caught me we argued I stop she shows me attention for a month and this patterned continued. I took the constant insulting demeaning attitude physical assaults both when she caught me and when she neglected me. We had a major break threw when she admitted she had depression and had it several years prior to our relationship. She went to a doctor and received help through medication and the two months she took it things were great! She stopped taking it and refused to return to the doctor stating she was fine. After a couple of month I talked her back into taking the meds while she was on them the last time our child was conceived. After which she refused to tell her pregnancy dr she had depression. I tried for over a year to get her to talk about the relationship she would say there's nothing wrong and refuse to talk. I acted out one last time though this time I just downloaded apps in my phone and left it with her for a couple weeks till she found it. This got her to talk but I think it did more damage than good. A month later we had a trip planned that became canceled due to an emergancy (a trip I was to purpose on) the week of our planned trip she cheated on me. I caught her. I did not blow up on her. We broke up and she left for a month to live seeing our son once or twice a week. Now she is trying to mandate the days I have after moving in with her parents. She been throwing mixed singnals since she left as well. She still slips calling me babe. Almost saying I love multiple times.she showed up to my dr apt but not the baby's. She will be sweet and flirty as well.but if she talks to this guy or her cousin she becomes highly aggressive towards me and only me. I have tried to be nothing but nice I want to be friends at least though in would take her back with councling on both sides. This happened the other day for example I asked her to video chat me and our baby so I could see him and she did but then she put the cam on her and started talking to me and brought up the fact that I was wearing a jacket. Later the same day I went to pick up our son she invited me into her room where he was asleep stranding close to me. She asked to hang out a bit while he slept but I needed to go she wakes me to my vehicle said good by to our son talked a bit to me and when I said good bye I had to say it four times before she would respond with a very low bye. Another key note is her memory that is normally really great is very shotty now.

I don't understand this she is a Taurus. I am a Scorpio ( yea and not being vengeful is weird as I don't feel it towards her). I'm looking for advise on how to handle the situation... if and how I should Persue her. Why she is acting this way. What should I do?

85,"Not really advice but I’ve been ignored plenty of times by friends and family over texts on messenger. It would be either questions or just a simple “hello” or “hey, how are you” they read it and never respond then a few minutes later I see them posting something on facebook.... are people really that inconvenient now ? Cause I would never ignore someone’s text unless what they send me is really bothersome, rude, or annoying. If I’m annoying my friends just for texting them then ..wow..... I just texted an old friend of mine last week that’s in the navy and I decided to text him on snapchat just to check up on him, yep he ignores me without a really good reason. I texted a girl I like last week as well, and low and behold she ignores me.... I didn’t say anything weird or creepy or anything. She posted a snap of some tea she got that improves your health so I sent her a message asking her where she got it, since she said that she’s there when i need her, well she just ignored my text... Am I doing anything wrong ? If so please tell me because this is ridiculous if you guys ignore people’s texts on purpose why do you do it even though the person that sent it to you didn’t say anything wrong at all ?

87,"Do I stand up for myself or do I just leave?

More context—I'm in a small, alternative school setting. Things were fantastic when I first started and I really felt like this was the workplace I wanted to invest the next five to ten years in. However, the longer I worked here, the more I realized certain points:

I was a first-year, first-time teacher and they assembled my classes with largely the students that I heard other teachers saying they requested not to have (due to difficulty, behavioral issues, etc.) This didn't bother me much, I was open to the challenge. The first few weeks were rough, but I built enough rapport with the students to get them to do their work without it being like pulling teeth. However, there was still resistance (we're talking about some kids with obsessive defiant disorder, mind you.) I had an impromptu observation on one student's bad day and a parent observation scheduled for another period/class that has a student that is prone to emotional breakdowns when he's frustrated (and go figure, the new body in the room triggered the poor kid into a small breakdown, probably scaring said parent out of enrolling their child.)

Another note that bothers me is that I was promised about three to six months of training when I was interviewed. I got about three days where I shadowed another teacher before she said I was good to go and I was left alone. Mildly annoying, but I worked with that, students are progressing well enough despite this. What really drove me nuts, though, was they hired two more new teachers after me and had them both shadow *me* for two or three weeks. For the life of me, I can't figure out the sense in this decision—they knew I was a first-time teacher with very little experience working with this age group, why would they set up their new employees to observe the newbie with three days of training?

Months later, both newbies quit. One was fired after bringing ""issues"" up to our boss, criticizing how things were going (I get mixed stories—some people say he was a jerk about this critique, others say he had some points about the qualifications involved in the people he watched. Knowing my qualifications are still so green, I'm sure I may have had my name dropped.) Either way, both left and I was back to being the newbie.

Other things that struck me as odd was how I was given highly distractable, defiant kids and never really given a real classroom. Our building is small, so I didn't complain... but I thought it was odd that my classroom was one that the rest of our school would have to walk through between periods to get things like backpacks, drinks, etc. I didn't have storage space like all of the other teachers—and it wasn't until another teacher who subbed for me brought it up that I actually thought to say something. I was fine keeping everything in a binder, but the other teacher told me I needed to ask for a real cubby area to keep teacher's documents and supplies and that the school told us they'd provide this.

So I did. And a few days later, I was removed from the classroom and set up to ""get the training we should have given you"" by shadowing a mentor teacher. I was thrilled with this, because I assume this is how it happens in the public school system (this is a private, mind you.) I had been under the impression that all teachers start their ""Year Zero"" as aides, assistants, or by having a mentor to shadow them throughout their first semester, at least.

The shadowing/tutoring went fantastic for about two weeks. I learned a lot and my rapport with the mentor teacher was great. We moved my classes from the ""locker room"" to her classroom—a real classroom with desks and visual aides for the students on the walls—and the students thrived. 

Not long after, had my position downgraded entirely to after school tutoring. In this ""interview"" they told me that it had nothing to do with my performance, but that they were hiring a specialist for students with extreme special needs. To afford said specialist, they had to cut hours from another employee. They told me that I was the newest hire and that I had the choice to take the cut hours or to quit, but hoped I'd still be on board. I said I'd still be on board because I do enjoy the job a great deal and want to be a candidate if the chance to get daytime hours back returns, but now I'm delegated to being just a part of their after school tutoring team and no longer a day school teacher.

But here's the plot twist—two days later, another teacher who had an evaluation that didn't go over well either quit or was fired. I don't know the details, nor do I feel that's any of my business. But she told me a few things that made me increasingly wary of this place: that she's seen them set people up for failure before. A day after this, I received an email specifically to me saying that despite recently letting go of another employee, I was still not needed on days, but will still be expected for afternoons. (Why would they even send me this letter if I hadn't asked them if the other teacher quitting made any difference, which I didn't ask? They're essentially down two teachers, but up only one, when they'd expected to only be down one teacher, but hiring the specialist in my stead? Which I understood and was alright with, because I care more about the students getting specialized help.)

Another teacher warned against making any ""complaints"" about students or accommodations because it would ""put me under the microscope"" and that he'd noticed that the management around here tends to see complaints as, ""if you are asking for help, you probably can't do the job.""

Administration here told me that they wanted me to come to *them* with questions, rather than ask other teachers first. Except now, it's only cemented in my mind that if I bring my questions to their attention, they will assume I can't do the job and just work to remove me ""fairly"" than actually help me. So I'm past the point of asking for help anymore. But this is an incredibly toxic way to bring up a first-year teacher, I feel? This can't possibly be the norm?

Another thing that bothers me is that they criticized the progress/speed at which my students were progressing—when just weeks earlier, I had asked them about how fast they wanted these students to progress (in tutoring) and they encouraged me to move ""at the student's pace."" They said in this meeting that they try for one lesson a week minimum, but multiple times, assured me that if some students are slower, that it's alright. All of my students except for two progress at about this speed, and the two who don't are confirmed for obsessive defiant disorder or extreme-end ADD and learning delays. But when they told me they felt my students weren't progressing fast enough, I can only imagine (upon researching said student progress in all my student charts for the last week,) that they looked at the two worst and assumed everyone was moving at this pace.

I'm just at a loss. They speak to my face very welcoming and with warm hearts and tones, but it's started to feel more and more like passive-aggression and a farce. I've had my tutoring classroom moved to the conference room outside the office of our administrator in an effort to fit everyone in tutoring on one floor—however, I can't help but get the vibe that it's to observe and nitpick my teaching. Because it's been this way for weeks now, I'm no longer very anxious about having ""stage fright"" when teaching/tutoring in this room. However, I feel like this was done with an unspoken intent.

I feel like a lot of things are being done at this workplace with unspoken intent.

My misgivings about this place are growing daily and I feel almost... workplace-bullied, or urged to quit without being told to just quit. The tidbits of information coworkers gave me just further give me the impression that I'm not the first person to receive such clumsy and unprofessional treatment and lack of training. A lot of where I am now (outside the admin's office, monitored all the time, hours halved) feels like the result of retaliation for having questions and asking about that training I was told I would get (and never got until about the time I was essentially demoted.)

Is this legal? Should I glassdoor this? Is this normal for teachers at private schools or even public schools? None of this sounds professional at all, but I'm too new to the system to know if this is just part of the package. 

I'm currently looking for another job, but it may take time to find something that matches the current pay rate. So I might have to grin and bear it a little longer—at least, until they finally find a reason to can me.

88,"The reason I ask is that right now, I'm at pretty fair middle-management job. It pays well, benefits are good, etc. But I've hated my life since I started this job. First it was the time commitment, going from 40-hour consistent schedules with the same days off each week, etc. to 50+ hours. Then it was the stress, with upper management adding on more and more responsibilities when we're barely getting done what we need to in the first place. The final factor is the fact that I moved away in order to be closer to family and friends, resulting in an extra 3 hours per day of driving, essentially leading to 60+ hour weeks. Now to some, I realize this is nothing, and that I sound a bit lazy, but I've dealt with depression for years, and this job makes me want to kill myself even more.

So, with all that said, would it be unwise to either find a new job or to step down to an hourly position at a closer location? I'd be losing a significant amount of money, but I just want to be content in life and feel this is a necessary step. Then I'd also have more time per day and could potentially finish out my college degree.

Why don't I just suck it up and do it? Because I'm afraid that I'll be stuck doing the same grunt-labor for the rest of my life if I step down. Sure I'd have a lot more time to do the things that I want to do, but would I be happy? I just don't know.

I know none of you can give me a definite answer, but perhaps you could share similar experiences and decisions that you've made?

92,"I was the guy who had it all growing up - 16-17 years old, the centre of all my friends, best girlfriend in town etc etc. 
This all changed when I was 19 and she left me. 
I realised I was to blame for because of my huge pride and ego etc, but it was like I didn't know how to be anything else but me. 
The year after my dad had a really bad health scare, and a few months after that so did my mum.
Suddenly I start becomming dissilusioned with everything. It felt like my life was falling apart around me. My mates were all moving on to bigger and better things. My older brothers all having kids and getting married, my parents could die at any time. I went from feeling like centre of the world to becomming an outsider. 
My friends were all growing as people and I was kind of stuck with the me that wasnt really working anymore. 
Not wanting to go out in my small town because my ex had basically taken my friend group. Feeling like half the man I would of been had I not gone out with her in the first place. 
I used to be into graphic design and illustration, but with so much stress and inner conflicts, my studies were beggining to go down the drain and I was burnt out. 
Also realising if I want to make in life, I have to get away from my Mum and Dad, - who are now old as fuck, and put myself first in life, was tearing me apart. The 2 people I can count on and not wanting to leave them behind because if 1 dies the other will be on their own. 
Applied for 300 jobs and got some temporary work pushing a button on a machine or hammering something for 8 hours a day, - my soul already felt dead inside. I was the guy who was so passionate, so creative and inspired, like a beam of light all my life, and now Im jaded with humanity, jaded with myself and hate the way its all going, my once unstoppable confidence now gone and feel like a shell of myself. At first I thought I was having a bad year, then I realise no, this is real life, and having a lot going for me when I was young has set me up for a downfall with the rest of my life. 
Im used to having a lot of influence all my first 20 years - even at college the teachers all respected the shit out of me. 
Now I can barely get out of bed. 
I felt like I was so close to making it in life, and maybe one day I will, but the amount I have lost myself is breaking my heart. 
I wish I got a simple job in town, moved out young and just enjoyed my life. But I have crashed and burned hart, I dont fit in with my old mates, havent made new ones, havent had sex in forever, and pretty much become the oppositte of everything about myself. 
If only I knew how much I had going for myself when I was younger I would of made something of it then, not waited for the future, not put trust in college or jobs. I would of started up my own comany doing something then. I had so much influence as a teen, I could of done anything, but its all died out and im a broken man already.

93,"I have a friend who is the opposite sex and we're both heterosexual, which makes our friendship vaguely uncomfortable in addition to the fact that we only became friends because we initially started by dating. She was very into me, but eventually our relationship turned into a friendship, mainly because she didn't like my lack of social skills and often inappropriate sense of humor. We've been friends for over a year and have even dated other people while still being friends. However, lately I feel as if she's been acting differently with me. She's more comfortable talking about the brief period when we dated, she's talked about if we were hypothetically married (as part of a joke), she suggested her and I go to a Halloween party as the joker and Harley Quinn, and finally, yesterday happened. Yesterday I wanted to hang out and she suggested we go to see a movie, so we went to see Happy Death Day (which we both thought was shit), and she somehow lost her car keys so I ended up waiting with her for a locksmith. What was supposed to be an after school hangout became an entire day spent together. During the time we were more intimate than friends traditionally are. During the movie she rested her head on my shoulder and she continually leaned on me and hugged me a few times throughout the day and even jokingly sat on my lap at one point. I only find this peculiar because she's the least physically engaging person I know, meaning I would not describe her as a hugger. 

I primarily feel like I'm overthinking this and she probably was in a touchy mood. But I also slightly feel like she might secretly have some sort of feelings for me. She always brings me lunch (which I only think she does because she knows how poor my family is), she talks to me fairly consistently, and she's usually in a good mood when she's with me.

Am I crazy for thinking this? Is she possibly growing fonder of me in a more romantic sense? Or is she just beginning to love me like a dog? I don't mind the current state her and I are in, but I do admit if she got involved with a guy, id probably be a bit jealous, so I kind of don't know how to feel.

97,"Hey everyone, sorry that this got kind of long. I'm also off and on with reddit so if this is the wrong section, sorry about that as well. I'm wondering if I should seek some counseling to help me move forward with my life.

Background: I'm a 29 year old male. My father died when I was 8, I was raised by my mother who, while an extremely nice person, isn't a totally capable adult. She grew up in a large poor family so was given no personal parenting, never had any schooling, and hasn't held a consistent job in 20 years. I had no male (or any) role model and was never taught any self discipline growing up, which I feel greatly effects me today. 

Fast forward: I graduated high school with decent grades despite not trying very hard, got into a good college, and majored in criminal justice because I had no idea what I wanted to study and randomly found it interesting. I had mediocre results in college as I wasn't dedicated. Fast forward to age 21, I decide I need to make a change because I'm not really interested in CJ and I want a major that will make me money. I decide to switch to engineering. 

I struggled at first with engineering but I end up getting a 6-month internship that paid well. I complete the internship and they offer me a full time job at the end. I decide to take the full time job ""temporarily"", to help pay for future schooling. I planned to drop out of school to work for a year to build up cash, then go back to class. This was over five years ago. I am still at this job today. 

I have gotten quite a few raises since I started and I can spin the job as good experience in my field. I make decent money. I work full time but started taking night classes part time to complete my engineering degree, but I am moving so slowly that I am still stuck in my sophomore year. Did I mention I am almost 30 years old. 

I find I'm having a hard time working full time at a fairly high stress job and taking demanding engineering courses at the same time. I would really like to drop back at my job and pick up more course hours but money, time, and commitment are all issues that make it very difficult for me. Most recently I was enrolled in a difficult math course that I felt I was going to fail so I had to withdraw from, which was a big setback because I feel like I'm losing time and can't afford to waste anymore. 

I feel I could have put more effort into this class. I feel I could put more effort into my daily life. But for whatever reason, I have a very difficult time motivating myself to make any real changes. 

I am dating casually but do not feel ready to commit to someone until I figure my own life out. As I'm still 2+ years from graduating, I don't see that happening any time soon. 2+ years is also a generous number, as that is if I were to go to school full time which I am currently not doing. I would like to do that but I am not sure if I can afford to.  

I feel I am wasting my time and my life taking part time classes at such a slow pace and at this job that I really am not challenged by or happy with anymore. I feel like life is passing me by while my friends are all getting married, buying houses, moving to new cities. But making extreme changes is very difficult for me. I am curious if counseling might help me become more accountable, more dedicated, and more motivated to move on with my life and become successful. I don't yet feel like my life is totally over. I think I am still redeemable, but feel I need some help. Would counseling help me? I haven't had any experience with counseling in my life. 

Anyway I'm curious if anyone has any advice for me. I am thinking of finding a counselor in the vain of a ""life coach"" as I think someone to hold me accountable for my actions would go a long way to helping me make long term changes.

Walking home everyday alone. My dads a bit of a psycho. If things don't go his way in the slightest he he will berate everything you are and will attack every emotional weak point he can.

They all go to different schools and seem to have made other close friends, but for me, I don't really have any good friends outside of these guys. I have lot's of other friends don't get me wrong, but none that I would consider ""close"". I wouldn't go out of my way to chill with any of them outside of school. We just talk before/after class, eat lunch, study together, stuff like that. 

It was just so much easier to make good friends in high school. You see them everyday, have the same breaks, go home at the same time, live in the same area, etc. It's the complete opposite with college. The friends I make are never as good as the ones in my current group, and I don't see us ever developing our friendship to that point. I'm kinda just waiting for the ""perfect friend"" to just pop up randomly and we just instantly click and I can add him to my best friends list, but i doubt that will ever happen.

I explain to them but they just gave a straight no without any reasonable explanation.

117,"So I met this girl on tinder about 2 months ago, we went on 5 dates and we were great, I really liked her, she really liked me and things were good. I unfortunately fell in love with her when she decided to end things because of the logistics of the whole thing (distance and future plans). After many arguments and what not I finally understood that we were only going to be friends. Yet I told myself that I’m going to kiss her regardless next time we meet because I still think I have a chance and I didn’t want to regret doing that. So last night she texts me asking if i wants to see a movie with her, I said yes and we did, and then went out to eat, we were having a good time like when we used to date. At the end of the night, I told her to get out of the car real quick (so I could stand and face her) she agreed and I went in to kiss her, she then turned her cheek to me, got back in the car and drove off without much of a goodbye or anything. I felt devastated. I had to text her because I felt sorry, she said “ok” after I said sorry and “prob” after I asked if things will be awkward now. What the fuck do I do? I feel awful because I think I upset her. ",28Oct2017,1
118,So I've been a part of a role-playing community on and off for years and I recently came back to it again after a while away. It feels like it's changed so much and there are few people there that I could still consider friends. All the threads there are in the hundreds of posts so it would feel wrong to just jump in with some random character. I figured I'd make my own but decided to get people's opinions first. I didn't get many replies but the few I did get seemed somewhat hostile. I used to enjoy that community so much and now I feel unwelcome. I want to feel the same enjoyment I used to feel RPing there.

121,"This is kind of long, but I'm confused and I feel like I might be a dipshit, so bear with me, por favor.

So 2 months ago, my neighbor introduced me to her boss. She and I hit it off like nothing I've ever known. We literally have everything in common. We say things at the same time, make the same obscure references, and we like all the same things. And it isn't like, ""Yeah, I like that, too,"" yes-man shit. It's like she'll explain why she likes something and that's EXACTLY how I feel about it and vice versa. We've been talking non-stop from the time we wake up to the time we go to bed every single day since the day we met. Two months straight. 

Our home situations are pretty similar as well. I live with my son and his mother, but we've lived in separate rooms for over 3 years out of 7 and haven't had sex in longer than that. She lives with her current husband and her own children from a previous marriage. They haven't slept in the same room for a long time either. She was just starting a divorce with him right before we met. It's underway.

Anyway, we have tight schedules and can't see each other very often, but we occasionally meet up for sex and have even gone out in public a few times on dates. My son's mother (I'll call her SM) knows about her (I'll call her GF) and we agreed that SM and I would do a co-parenting roommate type deal as long as my kid doesn't meet GF for a long time. Her husband (I'll call him HUB) knows about me and he's struggling with it hard and he now blames me for the divorce even though it was going on before we even met. 

One night after one of our dates, we went to her business that she owns and while we were making out, we caught him standing outside the window, in the rain, crying and staring at us. It was heartbreaking and pretty creepy. We invited him in and I basically sat there and listened to them talk about what was going on and how they both felt about the situation, so I know she's mostly been up front about everything since I've heard it from him now, too. He even asked her if she was in love with me and she said yes, to him, right in front of me. We continued to do our thing after that. That was maybe three weeks ago.

Her family doesn't know that she's going through a divorce yet because it's her second one, they're super-conservative and took the last one really hard (practically disowning her, from what she says), and she wants to keep up appearances for them until it's over to avoid their reaction. So, HUB and GF's wedding anniversary was last week and a few days before it, he wrote some really awkwardly dorky and forced lovey-dovey stuff on her Facebook. I told her it kind of bothered me and made me feel weird and after some convincing, she took it down. Bitch-move on my part, maybe in hindsight, but yeah, it made me feel like a side-piece. On the eve of the anniversary, GF and I went out to lunch and talked about it. I was confused and felt off about our whole situation, but after some convincing from her, I started feeling better about it. We were in that restaurant for about three hours, just talking and making it better, but when we exited, HUB was driving by, probably circling the block since her car was nearby, and he stopped traffic to get her attention. As soon as she saw him, she ran to him. Didn't even say anything to me. Just poof. Gone. So I got pissed and left. Maybe I should've gone over there, maybe not. I don't know. She says they were fighting over money since they're in the process of separating their funds and bills and whatnot. 

They also went to a counselor to mediate this thing and, from what she tells me, the counselor suggested that HUB and I are not to interact with one another and he needs to quit stalking us. HUB has also tried reaching out to me on every social media platform imaginable before that session, but she asked me to ignore him, so I have. He hasn't tried reaching out to me since the session. 

I also know that they use WhatsApp as their main means of communicating with each other and since he requested me on there, I can see whenever he's online. It makes me feel like a creepy fuck for looking, but it's there, you know? Sometimes a guy gets curious. From what I can tell, they are both on there about as often as GF and I are on another texting platform that we use. When he's online, she is as well. Every time. Pretty much all day. She claims that he's mostly nagging her about financial issues, but all day, everyday? It seems unlikely to me. 

Most of my interactions with this woman are through texts throughout the week and everything I know about what's currently going on, I know from what she texts me. 

From what I gather, their arrangement is to split the bills for now, him taking the most of it since he apparently makes far more money, until she can afford to move her kids and herself into their own place. The goal is the beginning of the year. Until then, I'm supposed to be the secret coleslaw that nobody's supposed to really know about, which I can understand to an extent, for the sake of keeping up appearances. 

Tonight I noticed that she just removed me from her Facebook and despite the fact that we've been talking all day, it isn't something that she even brought up to me, so I imagine HUB did something weird that she didn't want me to feel weird about again, but I don't know. She's sleeping, and it's only Facebook. I'm in my thirties and it feels stupid even bringing that up.

She constantly tells me she loves me, she's in love with me. We have plans to make it happen, make us happen, once she gets out of this place. We talk about our future a lot. Two months feels like a blink, but at the rate we've been talking every single hour of every day, I feel like we've squeezed a lot in there. I've been with a lot of women in my past, and at risk of sounding cliché, I've honestly never felt this way about anyone in my entire life. She excites me like I've never known.

Another issue is that I've basically been jerking off for three years with nothing else and just learned that such a habit can really fuck your dick up. She's the first woman I've been with since SM and I split within the house and my guy is having issues getting out of the old death grip syndrome. I'm working on that. I've abstained from myself and started taking herbal supplements that seem to be getting me back up to mast. I'm only bringing it up because my libido was jacked at first and I know my feelings for her aren't just my dick talking since he just wanted to fuck my hand when I met her. I have been successful in the sex part recently, but it just didn't work the first few times and the fact that she stuck by me and supported me despite that makes me feel like that must mean something, yeah? She is astoundingly hot, so it's not like she'd have trouble if she was just on the hunt for a quick lay. I really do love this woman and I do believe that she loves me, too. I am also very aware that it sounds premature. I'm not rushing on moving in or marriage or anything like that, but I do want to be with her.

I also have trust issues from my past that aren't really worth getting into, but I have a long line of people from my childhood on that have done really shitty things to me and I have issues opening up and trusting folks, so part of me thinks it might be my issues standing in the way. The other part of me thinks I need to keep my fucking head on straight and pay attention to these details. 

Am I fucking idiot, or am I just bugging out? Should I believe her and keep doing this side-dish monkey dance, or just back up and wait until the whole thing blows over? Maybe just be buddies and quit tripping. I don't know. I don't want to feel like a quick vacation from her shitty home life, but some details tell me I might be. I'm used to bottling my negative emotions and feeling bulletproof, but this whole thing is new to me and it's really fucking with my head, kind of turning me into somebody I'd probably call a ""bitch"" from a third party perspective. I'm addicted to her. The thought of cutting it off seems awful to me, but I know it'll hurt a whole lot worse if I drag it out longer and discover later on that I fucked up by investing myself so heavily into this. Or should I just trust her and find out? *GAAAH!* I don't know.




***TL;DR:*** *I'm an asshole in love with a married-but-almost-divorced woman whose husband is aware of me and I don't know if I'm a stupid douche or not.*

122,"So a friend of mine (let’s call him Rob) told me that his friend (Isaac) tried to cheat with his gf (Rob’s gf named Jackie). Jackie denied to cheat on Rob, and both Rob and Jackie were mad and shocked at Isaac’s request.

They did not hang out alone, but with a group of friends they’ve both known for a long time. Isaac has not apologized or tried to get on good terms with Rob. 
Question #1: Is Jackie wrong for hanging out and talking to Isaac after what he tried to do, and for not trying to get back on good terms with Rob? 

Furthermore, the group of friends claim to be a “family”. Rob is not really considered close to that group of friends since they’re more of Jackie’s friends. However, the friends within that family are somewhat friendly with Rob. Those friends also knew about Isaac’s attempt, and they also talk and hangout with him like nothing ever happened.

Last night she asked ""what are we?"" because apparently people keep asking her about her love life and she doesn't know how to answer the question. I kinda avoided the question a bit and she got really annoyed.

128,"Hi, this is my first post. 
Let me explain my situation. I’m a 19 year old first year applied physics student at the university of twente in Enschede, the Netherlands. Last year I started physics at a different university but after a few weeks/months I couldn’t do the work anymore due to chronic sinusitis and also a cardiac arrhythmia (at that point in time I didn’t know I had the heart condition). Especially the headaches from the sinusitis interfered with studying. I had to get surgery to get rid of the sinusitis, which took a while because I tried medication and all that stuff first. 

There was a small chance I would get enough ECTS (study points) to pass the first year. That would mean I couldn’t continue and I couldn’t start over in Groningen (a rule they have in the Netherlands) the next year either.

On top of that I didn’t really like the way applied physics was taught in Groningen.
So I decided to quit. I tried finding an easy job to pass the time, something I could do with headaches, feeling tired and having a lack of concentration. I didn’t succeed.

In March I had surgery for the sinusitis and during that surgery the doctor saw something odd on the heart monitor and they advised me to let that get checked out. So again, a lot of doctor appointments at the hospital and it turned out I have a cardiac arrhythmia (my GP always thought I was hyperventilating at the times my heart rate went up to about 175 bpm so I thought I was fine). I got surgery for that to last August, which didn’t solve the problem unfortunately.

I still wanted to do physics so I started this year at the University of Twente. But I got off to a bad start. A lot of trouble with my heart, still feeling tired, about 5 other smaller health issues which aren’t life threatening but still very very annoying, feeling quite depressed and useless because of failing last year, lack of concentration and after 3/4 weeks, terrible headaches, ruined the first few months for me. 
I am getting better though. I am on waiting list for an psychologists, I’m getting rid of the small issues and I’m getting an other heart surgery in January. I’m also working on my new terrible headaches with a physiotherapist. 

But here comes my problem, the one I’d like some advice on. I can’t do the math that’s required for doing physics anymore. I’m not great at math, but I manage to do it okay if I put the work in. But all my highschool math knowledge isn’t ready to use anymore, I really have to dig deep to remember how certain things work. This makes doing the calculus for physics very difficult. I‘ve also fallen behind quite a bit with my physics program and the calculus that comes with it. Since I’m not going to be healthy enough for at least a few months I think to catch up or work at the expected rate, all I can do is making sure the rate at which I’m falling behind is lower. 

I have a few options here:
1. I can give up on the university program and spend all the time I’m well enough to study on repeating the highschool math and then going on to the calculus/the math I need for physics. So that I can join the college program for physics in Enschede in February (there is a specified date for switching your program if you want to do that).
2. I can spend the time that I’m well enough to work on calculus and maybe some on the the physics subjects in my program and hoping that I do good enough on those two for the study advisor to decide to let me stay even though I won’t have enough ECTS. Which is something study advisors can do if you’ve had personal problems during your study. This means that if I don’t do good enough I still have to go to college in February, but without having spend time on really getting my shit together when it comes to math. Or even worse, quitting (again :’(  ) and doing something else, something really easy, next year or switching to an easy program in February. 

I really like applied physics. An alternative would be electrical engineering, but the math for it is just as difficult. 
I’m also afraid that if I were to opt for switching to something else, something easier, that I’d feel even more depressed. Because I just don’t see myself doing anything else. I like physics so much and I would be very disappointed if I ended up doing something else after putting this much time, trouble and worrying in it. 

I hope someone can help me out a bit, maybe say something to calm my nerves.

129,"Hi,

I'm 17 years old and I have problems regarding friends and a girl. This is going to be long, I hope you guys can take your time and read this, it's quite important to me.

**Girl issue:**

Well, basically, I've known a girl for about 3 months, and she really liked me - I think. We also had sex, but there was a problem. I didn't want a relationship and she said that she didn't want it either, however, she told me that she met her ex once while I was in school. I didn't really care, but that made me suspicious because she told me other things, she always told me that I'd be the only guy she's in touch with, but I'd sometimes notice that she wouldn't reply to me on social media, however would be online on other apps. I also noticed that she blocked me on a different platform. She wouldn't reply for hours, and when she finally did she kind of indicated that she was busy. I didn't care if she was seeing other guys or not, however I didn't know why she just wouldn't tell me. I also told her that I don't care but I just wanted her to be honest. We kept staying in touch for a while till some day I messaged her and wanted to know the actual truth and why she'd lie all the time. She denied lying and I told her that I didn't really want to see her anymore, she removed me. Now I'm not too sure what to do, I'm not sure if I was wrong the whole time or not.

I've done a similar thing (Different girl, same story - without the weird blocking/ignoring stuff). That one time it was deserved and I'm glad I don't have anything to do with her anymore. This time I'm not sure if I did the right thing or not.

**Friends issue:**

I've had many friends, lost a few and stopped being in touch with them. Lately I've been trying to make some new friends, however it's really hard. Like, whenever I don't ask them to do something, they don't either. It just seems like they're not down to do anything themselves, it was just me all the time. Sometimes I got replies like ""Not today bro, going to the bday party of a friend"", or just no reply at all. Another guy, he was a really good friend of mine, used to chill at his place quite often, however I stopped messaging him because he didn't really treat me well. I'm 2 years younger and he felt like he was the boss and could command me. 2 days ago I messaged him again because I was basically lost, I wanted to go outside but nobody was down to do anything with me. We had quite a lot of fun with some other people, (his friends) but I've always felt like he doesn't really see me as a part of his group of friends. We've always been seperated, I barely know them. Yesterday I asked him if he wants to do anything on Halloween, he just said that he probably isn't going to do anything. I'm pretty sure he will, but he doesn't want me to join.


I really need some help on finding decent friends (My main issue, the girl isn't that relevant). I've also tried people in school but I've had the same issue with them (As stated above)

I dropped out of college a few years back, within the past 2 weeks I've lost both my nannying job and office job. My relationship is serious(ly) unstable as my bf is an alcoholic.

139,"Ill make this as short as I can. As the title says Ive been talking to a girl for over a year online where she makes up these crazy ass stories about her bf.

 That alone has led me to believe that he doesnt exist but ive been wrong about things with her in the past where she proved me wrong so I dont want to blatantly tell her after this whole time that ""I think you are crazy and dont have a boyfriend""

and if im wrong then I look like the crazy one where she probably hates me after that.

Ive never seen a picture of him either because she ""doesnt like taking pictures with him"" 

Around this time last year she told me that his birthday was around this time and she has kept up with that ""story"" this year too. This is the only thing that might make me believe hes real.

But other than that every story about him seems too farfetched.

So is there any way I can try to find out? This girl is a mystery in herself and this is just one of the many things i'd really like to know. If you need more information just ask me, I suck at posting these and being thorough.

140,"So today I was talking with the head of my course, looking for ways to improve my performance on my one practical exam.  He lets me know that I was the second best for my practical, which I was happy with but just wanted to do better. He then let's me know that if I really want to I'd be able to transfer to dentistry if I really wanted to cause my GPA of 7 is really good, but he thinks I should stay in my current course as he says I have the potential to be really successful in my current degree.  I dunno if I would be happy transfering but I also have a feeling that if I don't change Ill never be successful.  

I'm really proud of how well I've done but this is my 3rd year of University, which I have only completed my second year in my current degree.  If I were to transfer I'd be starting from scratch again and would have another five years to go. 

I went through a break up on my birthday, 8 days ago and have been trying to meet people.  But I always get turned down by anyone cause they think I'm 12. 

Like today I went shopping and the store clerks don't even take me seriously, it's even gotten to the point where I was making a purchase in a high-end department store, I had security called on me cause "" they had reason to believe I had a fraudulent credit card"".

145,"I know this sound stupid as fuck and the answer should be “NO” for 95% of time but please hear me out. 

I am at around 20s years old. I have my own business which is kinda-successful. 

My girlfriend suffered from depression before she met me. She have met the doctor and said that her symptoms is better than it was but it is still pretty far away from normal.

She believed that her mom is the cause of her problem. Her mom was teenage mother. She had my GF when she was 18 years old. She once did drug and stuff. She lost temper easily. She is unemployed. I never met her myself but from my GF point of view she is a very toxic person. I believed that she is pretty toxic because all of my GF’s friends and cousins agree with her. 

Problem is my GF also has a grandmother which also need a closed care. She has Alzheimer’s and is paralyzed. While her cousin and her father want to take care of my GF themselves they feel uncomfortable to let her leave her grandmother because without her no one with take care of grandmother since her mother cannot do it even it is more like that she does not want to do it herself.(to be clearer, my GF’s mother is the only daughter of my GF’s grandmother.). 

I have almost no problem to take care of her. It will cost me around 5-10% of my current income which I will have to work 1-2 more days(about 10-20 hr.)for that much money. 

I really want her to get better from her depression. Depression is suck. I studied in college about it. I had a little of it. My brother currently is suffering from it as well. It prevents them from making a progress in their life. It is really a pain to me. I don’t think she can get any better in her house. So should I lend her a hand?",28Oct2017,43
146,"This truly feel like a hex, as I can truly understand this. (Throwaway as well for the hell of it).

Every day I experience an extreme phenomenon of rejection. Just most critical shit that can only be the result of something like witchcraft... let me explain. When I actually did 10 years of counseling and reading self help books to fix myself with good hygiene and appearance , it seemed as if the people have adjusted to become more hateful where it is the only feedback that's driving me nuts. I finally quit therapy all together, but still take my meds. The only progress that I see so far is that people actually notice me more than just a shadow in the room. I lost weight and dropped blood pressure as well and my physician was very excited about it, but I wasn't even phased. 

I have no one to rely on for support. Family members actually actively participated in harassment years ago that led to online and job mobbing. It's hard to talk about issues like mental heal online because places like this site is notorious for witch hunts, anything that is not ""normal worldly problems."" There is no one I can say genuine love me or supportive. Seeing how family was easily triggered to hate, it really fucked up my sight for seeing value in a person. All people look like demons that are eager to attack at my presence.

 Now my personality. I try to be humble at most, but of course this can be perceived as many things like desperate. I keep enthusiasm and joy in the way I talk, yet others look at me like a fool. Being my ""best self"" must be some spectacle that attracts harassment. The worst things I ever did compared what others actually done is like comparing stealing chips to murder, and they try to market me like the worst piece of shit in society while everyone masks their wrongs like acceptable norms. This ideology fucks my train of thought up since I took notice of it.

I tried going out and pretending that if I don’t wear my feelings on my sleeves... and even after going out in all directions with this mentality, people still think harassment is the only way I will learn. My interviews have been more fucked up. Last interview I forced myself to be a talkative social butterfly for a floor sales position in an electronics store and one of the interviewer's comments was along the lines of, ""Yeah, I see you like to connect with the customers and that mumbo jumbo..."" That still stuck to my head knowing a week later didn't get the job. 

 Co-workers are irritated by my presence even though there is no communication between us and we have completely different jobs. Then we have guys that come and help out that alway one-up over my work effort. I'm such an incompetent POS, my mind is the only place where I feel awesome. Co-workers and managers feel petty for me and tell me good job in pure sympathy.

I used to be really social online and a happy person, but regressed severely. Now extremely paranoid what I share now(not that I actually over shared about myself in the first place). I used to be comfortable about playing online games talking to others to showing my pc setup, but haven't played a game in five years. Some accounts were ghosted and all. It's hard to get out again with socializing online because of obvious present issues. Especially how someone just posted about being harassed on Discord.

Finally I put too much power in relying on validation from the same people that rather piss on my grave after stalking harassment. I'm lost. I would correct what's wrong with me, but others won't tell me(and it's not their job) and I'm blind to my issues. Therapy was a joke. The people I had sessions with seen me as an outlier and made each session a filibuster where they actually talk of themselves more. This is a scary point where people only know me long enough to hate and despise. Not saying people are suppose to like me, but it shouldn't go directly to hate either. I don't know. 

If there is something to look up for my situation, I'm open. I read that one blog on Cracked a bunch of times. I don't know street knowledge or worldly ""common sense"". Can't relate to the average joe and it is beating me down mentally. I have hobbies, but fear that this whole shit will carry on through each encounter with people. There is no emotion to run to get a comfortable self pity party or run to understand through any kind of worrying. I just feel a numbing pain and pressure in my head from keep trying to make sense of it all, but It's all pointless. There is nothing to learn from this. Don't know what dark path this is taking me through, truly the work of a hex... fuck. 

I'm really worried. Thoughts?",28Oct2017,1

148,"My dad and I (17) live with my brother (25) and quite frankly he's a disgusting slob. I won't get into to much detail as I can go on and on, but here's a small list of shit he'll do:

His room is filled with garbage, dirty clothes, and just random junk of his strewn everywhere. He will leave lights on all night, will not flush the toilet occasionally, he'll hardly ever pick up after himself, and he blatantly disrespects our rules we've set for him to follow. After his son spilled milk on out rug (he claimed he was watching him but was half asleep) he wasn't allowed to eat in the living room / on our furniture anymore, but he's been caught doing so plenty of times. We both spent a whole week cleaning his room to get it spotless, only for him to mess it up again the next week. Never even said thank you for that either. 

Nothing has worked to get him to change. Asking nicely, begging and pleading, being a dick right back to him; he's never changed. My dad's said that on days I'm not there, he'll use my desk for his own personal area for the week and leave garbage and his crap all over. When my dad asked him to clean it, he was met with an eye roll and ignored. 

We're both sick of him. We both deep down have an ounce of love for him still, but it's buried under a mountain of anger and hatred for him. Living with him is putting both of us on the edge.

Is it fair to kick him out? It was his place first but we moved in to help out with rent after his friend had to leave. Neither of us want to move but can't stand living with him. He shows no appreciation or regard for us and he shows zero signs of changing. We're both sick of yelling at him to change and we want him out. Is it fair in the situation to kick him out?",28Oct2017,1
149,"**TL; DR: I'm burned out after working/studying A LOT during +10 months. I've taken some measures to regain a good productive mood, but would like to hear other suggestions.** 

**----- Background story -----**

I've been working since December 2016 on acquiring the skills I need to get a job that allows me to be financially independent, flee my country (the fucked up socialist Venezuela), and help my family.

I focused so much on working towards my goal that I isolated myself from the world during 10 months without even realizing it. 

All this situation took its toll. A couple of weeks ago I had an existential crisis that prompted me to work on regaining a balanced life.

**----- The struggle -----**

Regaining a balanced life has been tricky. I'm broke, most of my friends already fled or are planning to flee, going for a walk means stumbling upon sad situations (people starving, homeless kids, etc.), my city is dangerous ([most violent](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-violent-cities-in-the-world-2017-4/#1-caracas-venezuela-had-13035-homicides-per-100000-residents-50) city that isn't an active combat zone), etc. I get a feeling of being a stranger in the very place I was born and raised.

On top of that, I still feel the urge to work on what's left of my training process, and I haven't been able to progress that much lately because I chose to create a complex app to show some of my skills, which makes its code and architecture trickier to handle, and leaves me with frustration because I'm not able to progress as fast as I thought I would. 

Failing at progressing as I expected feels like being told that I'm about to reach the end of the marathon only to realize a little later that I still have a few miles to run. 

Being unable to live as I used to, missing so many people, and having the certainty that the environment is getting worse by the day, feels like knowing that the remaining trail is on a slope full of pointy pebbles and I'm running without shoes.

**----- Some proactive actions I've taken so far -----**

* Re-defined the expected development time and deleted secondary features
* Started working out every other day
* Starting talking with my parents and other family members
* Wrote positive phrases on small cards, and check them often

**----- Suggestions? Advice? -----**

Thanks for reading this far, any ideas on daily rituals, things to avoid, things to do, or any thoughts that you think might help will be greatly appreciated.",28Oct2017,8
151,"So I know this girl from school and I am really attracted to her. We have never really spoken all that much but we have made out on multiple occasions when out at parties/clubs, often thanks to the help of a mutual friend. 

The other night, we made out at a club on two seperate occasions. One lasting for so long I ran out of breath haha. Anyway, I then bought her a drink and we spent some time together. After a while I saw her off talking to another guy and this was when I realised that I wanted her to be mine. I got so jealous and wanted to take her back but I kept my cool. I assume they made out as well. 

After doing some research, I have discovered that she has been talking to this other guy, but, only on a friend basis. From what I gather, she likes him, but, he doesn't see them together. 

Here is the predicament. I really want to tell her I see us together, but, now that I know about this other guy and because we haven't really spoken too much I don't know what I should do.

152,"I have a friend whom I have known for about three months.  She is in general very considerate and kind.  However, she has a (in my opinion) terrible habit of answering her phone and talking for extended periods of time when we are hanging out one-on-one.  She will do it in the park, in a restaurant, etc.  I never know the people she is talking to and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do when she does this!!!!  I sit there, praying she will hang up soon and we can resume hanging out as before.  But I usually end up sitting there for several minutes, listening to her talk about things I don't know about to a person I don't know.

One time, she ended up skyping with a friend while I was sitting across the table at a restaurant with her.  I felt so awkward so I just told her I was leaving, paid for my food, and went home.  She later texted me asking why I left.  I told her that I don't know what she expects me to do when she is skyping with a person I don't know, and that I thought our hangout was over.  She told me that wasn't her intention at all.  People of Reddit Advice, can you help me understand this?  Is this a normal thing?  We are both from the U.S., although we grew up across the country from each other, so I am fairly sure it's not a cultural difference.  Also, she is unfortunately not the first friend I have experienced this with :/

153,"i'm not a happy person. i try to keep a sarcastic sense of humor, I try to remember life is a gift, that i'm blessed to be alive, to have 2 legs, to be an American citizen, to be in NYC ""pursuing my dreams"".

I dont really enjoy spending time with other people, and I wish I did. I've been trying to pursue acting for many years of my life, and I've made some progress, theatrical agent &amp; manager in NYC, getting a call back for an audition on Netflix, getting into SAG, all things that yes are big deals, but I've also made less than $1000 on acting in my entire life. i keep thinking somethings gonna change and it doesnt, and I know with what I've achieved it COULD happen by the time i've 40 or 50, but jesus fucking christ i hate how I've spend my life thus far! the vast majority of my time I've shlepped waiting tables / bartending / moving from LA to NYC to LA to NYC to philly for 1/2 a graduate program to NYC searching for the right way to do this. spending nights lone literally to save a few bucks simply because I can't afford to go out and keep up in any way with my ""friends"" who are somehow able to live in thie world and function normally. this is not a humble brag.

I'm a creative, resourceful, scrappy motherfucker with a BA in journalism from Rutgers and I can sell ice to an eskimo, but this seems like not proper functioning to me. any normal person would not have made 1/5 of the life decisions I would have made, but people pursuing art are usually not normal, and like I've said I've seen some tangible results to make somebody keep going, but I dont think I can.

158,"So I’ve been unemployed for almost 4 months (previous job kinda screwed me over and fired me after 3 months) and this week I have some really important interviews that I am pretty nervous about.

I am unsure whether or not to disclose the information of my previous employer to these interviewers. Some people have said to just be honest, others have said to omit the previous job off my resume (only the experience from that job pertains to what I’m still going for), and others have said to include the job, but say I left to care for a sick loved one.

My question to reddit is what would be the best option of the three? My main concern is that if I choose to omit the previous employer from my resume/background check (if I get hired), it will still come out if they decide to pull my tax records. And if I lie and use the sick loved one story, they could potentially find me out from my previous employer. At this point, I am truly desperate for a job so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

163,"I went to my sisters house last weekend. I arrived around 3pm for a party where alcohol was being served. I stayed inside to watch my niece (22 mo) and nephew (3 yo autistic nonverbal) Around 4pm my niece started crying on the baby monitor so my sister asked if I’d go get her. My sister said she hadn’t gone into her room at all that day because she was playing quietly by herself. When my mom and I entered my niece’s room she was soaked in pee from the waste down with her diaper hanging off trapped inside her pee soaked pajamas. She hadn’t eaten anything that day. 
My mom and I were changing her diaper but there were no clean clothes. All the dresser drawers were empty. My mom told me not to tell anyone about this. I brought her downstairs and put her in her high chair and my sister fed her a doughnut because that’s what was being served at the party outside. 
Later that evening, a party guest came inside to use the bathroom which is in my nephews bedroom. They left a mason jar full of hot spiked whiskey cider in my nephews room. I was watching cartoons with the kids and didn’t notice my niece go into my nephews room but it shouldn’t have been a problem either way. She comes running out with the hot spiked cider and spills it all over herself. 
My niece will be 2 in January and can only say “no” and “side” which means outside. I know that having an autistic older sibling it’s normal for younger siblings to be nonverbal for longer than non autistic households. I’m worried that there is some neglect happening and I don’t know what to do. If this happens when people are around what is happening when they’re alone. My sister spends most evenings in bars because she is a musician. I know she has a Xanax problem and her doctor prescribes her anything she wants because she’s a stressed out stay at home mom. The last party my sister had her husband told me to go intervene because my sister was so wasted and wouldn’t listen to him. I physically tried to remove her cup from her hand but she wouldn’t let me. She kept telling everyone how much she loves Xanax and how her doctor gives her anything she wants. I recorded her on my phone to show her later. 
I also suspect she is having an affair with her band mate. There’s pics on fb of them holding hands. She asked her husband for a divorce but they realized it wouldn’t work financially to separate. Husband still loves her. 
I don’t want to judge too hard because I’m not a mother, but I’m worried about the kids. My father mentioned to me he’s worried about the baby because they do not get socialized or leave the house. Any advice?

164,"I’ve always found myself coming up with stories but I couldn’t think of how to tell them. A few years ago, I found film. It was perfect. Drawn to the endless possibilities, I was amazed that a single art form could include so many others. Music, writing and theatre can all be found in film. My goal is to become a writer-director. I’ve started small, making my own short films. With more recognition, I’ll progress onto more ambitious films, developing my own original style. This course will give me a vital head start. I’m confident in my knowledge of film theory, but I must learn more. I already have experience, but my skills must improve. I already know other talented filmmakers, but university provides me with a unique networking opportunity. That is why I’ve chosen this course.
My subjects have helped greatly. English, History and RMPS have developed my evaluative and analytical skills, which I’ve used to critique my own work in the classroom and in filmmaking. GC contains elements of Art and Media so it has helped me to develop my cinematography; creatively and technically. My attainment in Music is proof of my creativity and is linked to the praise I received for my short films’ soundtracks. Maths and Physics may seem irrelevant but both are challenging subjects and my success in both shows that I’m no stranger to hard work or independent learning. For my Higher Maths prelim, I achieved the second highest mark in my class.

165,"Im a 22 year old guy that apparently suffers from anxiety, stress from all parts of my life, low self esteem, overthink my every move, wanting and feeling desperate for a relationship, among other things. I have been going to counseling and my counselor said that I should consider anti-anxiety medication to help. Im really considering it since it seems like it can help but Im not sure how long the process will take to get it if I can get it. 

For now my counselor, and friends, say that I am too critical of myself because I blame my failed relationships on myself. I have pretty much gotten lead on by most of the girls I have dated and the only explanation I can get is that they werent meant to be, Im too accomodating, desperate and they can see it, I care too much, overthink everything, I want a relationship more than them, things along those lines. I believe I am not man enough so I was not good enough for them or for anyone else. Yet most of these issues are in my mind since I am not explicitly telling these girls I need a relationship, unless they bring up the question of what I want. Others may be seen by them as in Im too invested I guess by making plans to accomodate their time. 

I also am stuck seeing a girl I dated for a month last year, majority of the week on campus. She manipulated me, was jealous of any girl I spoke to, lead me on, kept ending things over texts and coming back to me without any explanation every time, and would always say it was her fault when she ended thing but then blamed it all on me when I walked away from her bs. I would try talking to her to understand her and prevent this kind of stuff but she would never want to talk to me about it. Her friends, who are my ex friends, made me feel like I was crazy for questioning her actions and she still seems to hold a grudge on me. She is also now dating a guy in that group of friends that she told me to not worry about and he said the same about her. I confided in him as well about her a lot and I feel very stupid that I trusted these people and now they are together.

I have tried dating since her and I have only faced rejection. At this point I dont know what to think about myself or where to start. I dont like myself at all, I would never want anyone to be in my shoes, I feel miserable about my life. I have gone back and forth about this but I honestly dont think I am ""fit"" to be with anyone, as in I am not good enough/man enough. I cant really explain what I mean by that but thats the closest explanation I can get to. I am just not someone would ever want to be with, I am just the guy you use for attention, a pick me up, until that right guy shows up. Thats all I have ever been and I dont see why it would change.

I am working out 3 times a week, busy with school and classes since Im finishing up my undergrad, have friends but Im introverted so parties and bars arent my thing, dont really drink, and I have a job lined up for when I graduate. My counselor and friends say Im some great guy, people say Im attractive, funny, nice, caring, Ill be a great dad some day, etc. That the right girl will show up, that she will be perfect in every way, she will be just as crazy about me as I am with other girls, etc. But in the end I cant really believe this anymore, I feel even worse hearing these things, especially with all my failed ""relationships"" of one or two dates and being a virgin.

I dont think things will improve, and I dont want to wait 20 years for me to get a woman desperate enough for me like I have been told. On top of that I have been told Im not the kind of guy a girl wants right now at least, and I can see that so I think dating and relationships are pointless for me because its all just a cycle. Theres no special girl, the girls in my past arent crazy or mean, its all just me fucking it up every time. I just want to stop being so anxious, and have better confidence in my choices and thoughts so I can at least do well in my job. Thats the only thing I have going in my life and it will get me closer to being able to live alone away from most of my stress. 

How do I work on becoming better that way? I mentioned the dating parts because they relate to my issues of self esteem. I can put on a face for a job or anything related to it so I can at least manage that part of appearing confident. I just need to get better at being social, confident in my work and decision making but Im not sure how to start.

174,"This will be our second year together, and they like me a lot.  Every holiday/special occasion I've spent with them, I have brought something.  I recently got a job at a pretty well-renowned restaurant and now I'm getting anxious.  I'm more than capable of cooking, but nothing I can come up with sounds good enough to me, or it sounds pretentious.  I don't want to upstage them by bringing something really fancy or bring something too simple and have them think I put very little effort into it.

I've narrowed it down to profiteroles (pastry cream and berry compote) , an orange ganache tart, or a creme brulee if I want to do dessert.  Profiteroles are still an option for an appetizer with meat and/or cheese, or a mushroom paté or a beet tartare.  Do any of these sound too pretentious or too low-effort?",28Oct2017,1
175,"I go through depression in cycles. Some stretches of time I'm on top of the world, other times I'm so low I'm a risk to my own life. I feel this way because for one reason or another I really have a strong desire for a female, I can't get one so sometimes I feel really lonely. I'm aware that I gotta love myself before I love anyone else, and I think I'm there for the most part. Despite having a desire, I haven't asked a girl on a date since high school. Partly because I was too nervous that a couple girls I really liked were going to be like the other girls I asked before and reject me harshly. I don't feel I'm capable of getting a girl and even if I was, I'm probably not ready for one despite how good I think I am. Anyways though, so I've been feeling down the last couple of days again over this, which isn't abnormal for me. Normally these thoughts with women will enter and stay for 3 days to two weeks. A female friend noticed I haven't been feeling really happy lately and pried out the reason from me. She told me that it's awful to feel I can't be with anyone, and that I was sweet enough to be with someone. She talked to me more about it and at the end of our conversation she said she would like to help me find someone. She's convinced with a little help from her I could get someone. I told her it sounds really nice but I would need to think about it. It honestly sounds like a really good prospect to me at least on the surface to give it a try, but at the same time I know I can't make any girl happy if I'm struggling with depression. Should I give her a chance to help me? Or do I say no thanks and keep working on myself?",28Oct2017,3

177,"I lived nearly all my life in Spain, I decided at 15yo to move to England with my mum (both agreed to this) so I could get my graphic design career started.

Im 18yo, last year of my graphic design course and for some odd reason recently Ive been really wanting to have someone to hang out with.

And by the looks, here on England they like to get drunk to have ‘fun’ which I think is utterly ridiculous.

Comparing the friendships Ive had on Spain, England people (from where I live) don’t even get 1/10, they’re careless, awkward, unsociable and backstabbing.

I try my best to maintain a friendship but its impossible.

I kind of regret moving to this country, the only good thing is that there are jobs everywhere and great opportunity for a career unlike Spain.

178,"I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place with a relationship and a friendship. There's this girl who goes to my school that (as far as I can tell) has feelings for me, but I'm pretty conflicted about her. We don't see each other much at school, but we text quite a bit. What I mean by I'm conflicted about her is that I alternate between liking her as a love interest and liking her as a friend. When my brain wanders, though, it always ends up thinking about her. I also am not sure if I'm able to even date her officially because of her parents and my responsibilities (work and school).

The other side to this conundrum is the fact that one of my best friends (who went to the same school as us but transferred to another nearby high school) has revealed to me that he has had a crush on her for a while now (much longer than the girl and I have had feelings for each other). When he asked me about my feelings, I told him I'm not pursuing any relationships, when in reality I'm trying to determine my own feelings to the same girl he's decided he wants to pursue. I've never given him any reason to doubt me in the past, and he really thinks that's true. Although I know for a fact he doesn't talk as much with her, and that she likes me more than she likes him. He really hasn't pursued her to any significant extent, either. From what I gather, it's kind of a crush that he's also a little indecisive about. I'm still a little salty about it though. 

I'm new to relationships (even though I've nearly graduated high school) and don't want to damage my friendship.

* I. How do I figure out my feelings (fast because this is stressing me out!)? I've talked with someone else and they told me to just ""figure out your feelings first"" but never told me how.

* II. How do I handle my friendship with the guy? Should I tell him what I think about the girl?

181,"Be me; 14. This story starts on the 25th day of August, 2016. It’s band camp, and my first year of it. I’m hanging out with my good friends John and Logan. Of course, knowing John, he makes a comment about a girls ass; “Hey Damien, I like how the freshman here is the only one with a nice ass.” Hard to think that quote started it all. Well, after he says that, Logan makes a statement of how that is Justin’s sister. The honest reason I found this funny is because of how Justin is an Eagle scout in our troop, and how he works in the karate place I used to go to. So, of course, this is a great joke that we all made. We’d go up to John and say “Hey John, you get that ass yet?” We’d do this for months. I told almost everybody about the joke. Then the school year started two weeks later; and guess who is in my class? Of fucking course it’s Jen, Justin’s sister. So essentially at that point I’m like “Well theres two possibilities, either she knows about the joke, or she dosen’t.” At this point it’s October, and I have a quote list of all the bad funny things my friends said. A lot of them being what John said about Jen. At this time, my friend Jake was getting really popular, and me, being a beta, was not well liked. My friend knew the best way to mess with me was to make fun of me in front of the class using lies. My other friend, Dean, was just like Jake . One day, I decided to tell them the joke, and the quote list. They said their gonna tell her what John said. Lets have a little flashback. Back in September, before a marching band competition, I was talking to Jen, and my friend Noah came over and told her what John said, but not mentioning her. She said and I quote “If he said that about me I’d bash his head in with a bat”. So back to present day. I’m becoming friends with Jen, genuinely nice person. And the day is November 17th 2016. I remember this day like yesterday. The day before we got our lab groups. My science teacher, who will be brought up later, paired Jake with Dean and Jen and another girl. At that point, I realized I was fucked. So back to the 17th; I get my friend Damien to try and convince Dean and Jake not to do it. They disagree. I attempt to stop them, they disagree. Then, as I walk over, I hear Dean say “Hey, did you hear what Mike said about you”. And he does infact tell her what he said. And she responded with, and I quote “A lot of people like my ass”. True quote. Well. I get home and I call Dean and I’m like “Hey how did she react”, he responded “She was okay with John but not with you.” How could I be involved. John said it. Jake. Thats how. He said I have a group chat about her ass to her; with John in it. He didn’t expext her to believe the joke. I found it funny at first. Until it became a big rumor acroos the freshman and a joke between my group of friends. After a while we have a theatre feild trip. Me and Jen are out of the school. So we get back last period, when Dean comes up to me and says one word; “Bitch”. He got called down to the Dean’s about having a “group chat”. Apparentally he told them the full story so I never got called down. But at the same time he never told me he told the full story. The next two weeks of my life were lived in fear. Basically, at this point in the year, I’m suffering from depression and my grades dropped, and my family had no idea what was going on. You really don’t know what it’s like to break until you do. I spent the rest of the year wanting to apologize to Jen but I never did. On the last day, we had a science research symposiun and I had to sit next to her. She wanted a copy of the finals scedule, and offered to put her number into my phone so I can text her it. I said no and sent it to my other friend to send to her. Later that summer I had to go to CIT at camp Yawgoog with my friends. The Brooke jokes reignited there and I really felt I need to apologize again, and I didn’t have her phone number to do so. I added her instagram, and she followed me back. Honestly, I didn’t have the balls to apologize then, so I didn’t. But if I took up her offer to have her number I probably would have.  So fast foward to 10th grade. Nobody remembers group chat thing and it’s time to start fresh. It was a good year so far, but shes in my classes again, and I still feel guily for the whole story. That’s why I am typing this, I wanted to have some advice as to wheather I should apologize or not. This whole story is just about a joke taken too far. What should I do?

184,"This is going to be a really long story. I have been a part of a group of friends (which I will be referring to as Team A) that ran long since Middle School. There has been a girl in our group (I refer to her as Sally) who was there since the beginning, but once high school began, she grew distant and even stopped coming to see us.  

Let me explain what kind of person she is. Sally is an extrovert, so she had many friends aside from Team A. She is charismatic and many people seem to like her. She sees (or used to) me as a very close friend, but the thing is, my friendship with her was toxic. Over the years with her, I had come to notice that she likes attention. She’s always up in the spotlight, works hard to get people’s eyes on her and she was just really popular. I didn’t mind it, but she has too many friends other than me. Personally, I always got hurt because of how often she forgets me to hang out with them and how she neglects me for others. I watched our friendship get worse when she hid things from me and often stole away my own friends. At some point, I saw more bad than good in our friendship. Perhaps you see me as a sensitive person, but this whole situation runs deeper than this.

Some info about Team A; it’s divided between girls (Team B ) and boys (Team C). Team A has always been close knitted, at least we all see each other twice a week but Sally hasn't come by in months. We tried not to bother with it, what she was doing wasn't hurting anyone significantly but that all changed just recently. A friend in Team A discovered that Sally has been talking crap about a close friend of mine from another friend of Sally’s (I will refer to Sally’s friend as Reena). I can’t remember exactly, but the idea was that our friend was supposedly whoring around with all the guys in Team A (which was rather ironic since Sally has practically liked and tried to date half of them).  Our friend was really hurt, and that was what began this whole problem. We also found out that she planned to hold a birthday party excluding us because all we do at her house was make a mess and cause drama. 

I wasn’t there when it occurred, but I came back to find out that Team B accidentally removed her from all the group chats affiliated with Team A. They were having a meeting about what we were going to do with her, and then she was removed in the heat of the moment. Sally was always “busy” and she never found out she was removed until two days late when a boy from Team B (referred to as Lance) broke it to her. I would admit that it was wrong for us to remove her without settling things out, but at the same time, we were just sick of her inactivity and doubted she would find out. The fact she never checks our chats even makes her look more neglectful of us.

Team B decided to talk about it with Sally. We tried to clear up what had happened about the rumors that were spread and how inactive she was (She claimed she was busy, had more friends to be responsible for and that she never said any rumors), but long story short, we decided to give Sally a second chance, mainly because of me. Out of all the people in Team B, I was the only one who wanted to believe in her because I was so attached to her, and I eventually got the others to take my side. We decided to cut off for the rest of the day and think more about this situation. It was about a few hours later when Reena claimed that Sally was still lying. Reena told us that Sally vented out to her how Lance was frustrated, and how we were so stupid for kicking her. Obviously, that made us even angrier in the process.

The next day, Reena just kept spilling more tea about Sally. Eventually, we found out she has been talking crap about almost everyone in Team A, people she hardly knew about. I wasn’t surprised to find crap written about me (her “best friend”) either. 

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. “What if it’s all lies made by Reena?” I considered that possibility too, but looking at all the information Reena got, there were somethings she said that she couldn’t have known about. There was no way Reena would’ve known about our middle school secrets and lives because she didn’t attend our old schools. They were too specific, I found it hard to believe they were all made up. None of us had never spoken about our pasts to anyone, but I can only suspect one person, Sally. 

We decided to call another meeting to address these. Like the previous night, Sally kept denying everything, claiming that she has never said these things but by that point, she had blown her second chance. We lost all of our trust in her. In the midst of our meeting, she kept on trying to turn the argument on us by saying that if we were her true friends, we would’ve believed her. Suddenly, she claims that Reena was a liar, a snake and that just put us in confusion. The meeting was put on hold, and I decided to research about Reena.

Next day, I spoke to Lance. He was on Sally’s side, to my frustration but we tried to reason with each other. He doesn’t trust Reena’s information because he has been personally hurt by her in the same way. I asked a few others too, and I came to that conclusion that maybe, Sally wasn’t lying after all but she hasn’t been honest either. I realized something then; rumors are true stories twisted into something ugly. For Reena to be able to know all these things, it didn’t matter whether Sally said bad things or not. **It was the fact she openly said things about her personal pasts to people we don’t really know. By then, I lost all my trust in her.** 
As a group, Team B decided that we won’t bring her back anymore.

Our most recent confrontation, last night, I brought this up and throughout the whole farce, Sally was not listening and kept insisting that she ‘thought it was okay to say those things’ or it was because she was ‘sad’, and other excuses. I wasn’t going to buy them anymore, so I completely shut her down and broke the truth. On another note, she kept trying to guilt trip us but I was just so hurt to the point I stopped caring about her and thought about my own feelings. 

I thought about how destructive our friendship us, how much stress she brings me, how many times she has lied to me or all those broken promises, I had to break myself out of that friendship so I ended it. We finished our fight, and she messaged me about how I broke her trust by not taking her side before cutting out our conversations. Team B though it was over, I thought all this drama could stop but suddenly, Lance left Team A.

This morning, I wake up to a mess. While I was asleep, apparently, half of Team C and Team B were in a group call with Sally, and she was crying. I don’t know all the details, but if Sally is gone for good, Lance would leave Team A. At this point, we didn’t intend for Lance to leave as well, and Team C is practically trying to make us bring Sally back to keep Lance. 

I’m just so frustrated. Personally, I don’t want to bring Sally back but Lance is a close friend who got caught up in the middle of everything. I’d say yes to bring him back, but I won’t be able to handle bringing back someone that I hate. I don’t know what to do anymore. I thought I would be free from that toxic friendship, and I really don’t want to deal with it again but I don’t want to lose Lance. Please at least give me some input, I’m just so lost.

190,"So, there is this guy in my Philosophy class in college who started talking to me - he initiated conversation since we were in the same group, but it was obvious he was flirting. He got my number, we texted and he arranged a day we can hang out outside of class to ""study""..even though we both knew we wouldn't study. So we got together that one day and ended up hanging out for 7 hours, getting to know one another, and we made out. He seemed like a cool, chill, funny guy but while we were talking, long story short he made it very clear to me that he was not looking for anything serious. He told me on the phone again the next day, that he is not looking to be tied down, and we agreed to just be fuck buddies. I didn't mind. I'm a virgin, but my sex drive is high and honestly I don't want to be one and since I found him attractive I thought to myself why not. Note: He knew I was a virgin, but didn't mind either. I assured him I was not the clingy type, and understood that he didn't want a relationship. The reason behind my virginity is not religion or personal issues, simply the fact that the opportunity of having sex with someone I found attractive has not occurred yet, which he was aware of.

I was on my period the next week so we just had oral sex. The week after we planned to have sex his dick wouldn't fit...we tried different positions and it still wouldn't go in. He remarked I was way too tight and needed to loosen it up more before it can go in, he tried putting his fingers in but it hurt like crazy, so again we ended up doing oral. He said it was fine and we would try again on Wednesday after class, since we always meet up after class to do the same thing at his house but he told me to try to loosen it up before then or he would bring some lube, I was like ok.

Next day in class, this guy completely ignores me. He usually says hi to me first, I noticed he was acting completely different and I was weirded out by it, I didn't confront him about it but while me and my friend were walking he walked past us and I asked him if we were still going to hang out that day (because we already arranged for that 2 days prior), he took out his earphones, responded very harshly ""I can't, I've got too much to do"" and kept walking.

My friend noticed he replied like an asshole and was like woah, whats up with him. I said idk. Next day in class, he sits in the back. All semester he sat next to me, but he avoids me this time.

I'm honestly not that bothered by it, I am just confused. Even though I wanted to lose my virginity I'm relieved I didn't lose it to him because he ended up showing his true colors (I want to lose it but I don't wanna lose it to an ass). Is it my blowjobs that sucked? My personality? The fact that I'm a virgin that turned him off? My friend told me it might be the latter, he was too impatient to wait and probably found another girl to get him off. I also find it weird how he just wasn't straight up. He could've said he didn't want to mess around anymore, but still remained friends with me. Because how he moved his seat, he is making it way too obvious.

194,"Here I am as a 34 year old man. I hate that it has taken me (give or take) 15 years to partially recover of a bully experience during highschool, where I learned not to trust friends/others and certainly not allow them closer. I haven't befriended people since, let alone fellow guys. I hate how it has undermined my self confidence and distorted my self image into that I am not worth it as person.


I hate how it holds me back, even now. There's this one guy whom I work with that has befriended me. I've dropped most of my guard down and he avoided/bypassed the ones that I left intact. It makes me feel uneasy, cause I'm not used to it. I hate how I've passed on friendship circles/activitities all these past years. And now it makes me unsure how to proceed. This friend and me are meeting up tonight for a night full of drinks and fun. I've been worried all day. Worried if I should call him, asked him weither he wants to grab a bite as well. All day I've struggled and feeling restless. So I've called him, he was already at his tennisclub with his mates drinking etc. I even had the courage asking if he'd stay there long and if I could join, but helas. And at the same time I feel such warmth that I am able to have such a friend/co-worker.


I want that. I want such mates, I don't want to spend my weekends at home wondering, but my social circle is so small and I'm afraid to reestablisch old connections. I don't know how to. It would just be odd and I'd be intruding. I want to have friends whom I can call at inappropiate times and vice versa. The friendship with said co-worker is getting there slowly, but he knows so many people and has so many mates and yet he has time for me as well. It amazes and frightens me. How, why would he make time for me as well? Why would he reach out to me as well. I don't want to spend weekends worrying and missing it all because I worry. I don't want to be alone. I don't want to spend another weekend in inaction because all the doubts, the insecurities etc. paralyze me to act with wisdom.


I'm worried, afraid and all such things. Worried that I will fuck up and worried that I will get betrayed/hurt again. Worried that I'm not good enough and worried that it will never change. That I'll remain w/o friends. I hope that tonight will be a night to remember (or to forget depening on how much beer) and that our friendship is strengthened even more. I hope that next time I'll have less doubts and insecurties etc. and act more on friendship. I worry that it is too late.

Maybe tissue paper?

Btw sorry if this isn't the right sub Reddit to ask a question like this :-/

211,"To Faith

I first met you
on a Sunday in my early childhood.
Everyone was there, begging for me to greet you
and clothing your image in reverent words.
“Ah, Faith,” they mused.
“What a wholesome girl. We love her like family,
cradle her like the blood inside of us.
There’s nothing
that we wouldn’t do
in that darling’s name”.
Before I knew it,
you and I were sat down together during every family dinner.
The food I tried feeding myself
couldn’t measure up to even half
of the acclaim dedicated to you that they gobbled up
and regurgitated down into my unsuspecting throat.
Faith, you were determined to be part of my identity,
and I was going to be full with you
whether I liked it or not.
Nevertheless, I did not spit you out.

Faith,
you followed me, and I you,
throughout young days when
I should have been unapologetic.
Your dwelling space stretched
all the way from the pit of my churning stomach
to the holes carved by curiosity into my brain.
At times, I would question your character;
“Faith,” I would say to them,
as their ears opened and their minds narrowed.
“Is she really true? Are there actually things
that she can do?”.
Faces replaced their smiles with concern
as the mouths replied,
“Of course. You just need
to get to know her better”.
With that, I knew that although
words were spoken,
answers were not given.

So Faith,
I did get to know you,
and I unearthed characteristics
that they never could.
I read your favorite books
and excavated every single line,
but what I found was no shining jewel;
my discoveries were quite the opposite.
Faith, you blind them with your charming white smile,
your dusty lips coated in false benevolence,
and the empty promise you make
to wipe away all suffering.
You tell them
that they need you,
or else the bolt of tragedy will strike.
Love you, worship you, praise you,
or flames will swallow up their disloyal brains and bodies
and their names will forever be soiled with sin.

213,"Before I tell you what's wrong let me give you background info. I am 20 years old and am currently doing my Erasmus+. I have had problems with my relationships in the past due to my clinginess and obsessive personality. 

I have been seeing this girl for 2 weeks now. We met in a bar and everything has been going great except I am anxious about expressing my emotions as I fear that she will reject or discard them. I lay next to her thinking of touching and kissing her constantly (even though we have had several sexual intercourse and she usually initiates most of the things such as hugging, kissing). She had broken up with her boyfriend about a month ago she met me so when I told her that I am jealous and wouldn't want to see her with another person (whether it be flirting, sex etc.) she wasn't the happiest to hear all that. (We were sitting in a bar and I thought she was flirting with the waiter and once we left there I asked her if she indeed was flirting with him in a somewhat joking manner not to completely annoy her if that makes sense. She told me she was just being nice). She told me she did not want anything like that and at the end of the day she would do what she wants. I reluctantly replied with ""okay"" because I can't force anything on her. My biggest conflict is me wanting to ask her what's wrong (whenever she keeps distance) but it is impossible to do that without seeming desperate for attention. She also needs space because we were together for 2 consecutive days and each day it seems that she puts more distance between us. I respect her wish and am trying my best to give her the space she needs. I think I am obsessive and am ashamed of it because it fucks up everything. I am in need of a lot of distraction so that I don't keep annoying her. What would you suggest I do? I have asked my friends for advice but the things they say do not really satisfy me. Thanks in advance.

Edit: I told her I was jealous because she asked me if I was after having asked her about flirting with the waiter.",28Oct2017,1

219,"You have just moved into student accommodation two months later than everyone else. They have all had the chance to settle in, party and make friends. Now you have been assigned to a flat full of international students who are very quiet and don't socialise with one another. They spend the majority of the time in their rooms and aren't too bothered about socialising with you. There is only one other student flat on your floor, this is yet again full of international students whom you never see. You can hear other flats blasting music and having a good time on a night. You so desperately wish you could somehow become friends with these people.

You want to make friends who like to go out, party, socialise and have a good time (essentially nobody on your floor).

222,"So this kind of came to a head this morning but has been a problem for many years. 

I have a really hard time opening up to people in general, even people I've known for years. I don't like to talk much about hobbies I'd like to try or interests I've developed, I am afraid of being judged or made fun of by everyone.

I recently started an Instagram for one of the hobbies I've gotten into and I thought it was anonymous by I guess it isnt because a coworker followed me. So I suddenly feel super anxious that they've followed me and are seeing the posts. It doesn't bother me that the general public sees my posts, it's just people in real life that I find it hard to be genuine with. I guess it comes down to a fear of rejection.

Has anyone here had to deal with this and if so, how did you overcome these fears? I usually tell myself that if people don't like me I'll just move away and start fresh but that's ridiculous, dramatic, and not a real solution. And I think my fears are preventing me from having a rewarding life (I have no friends).

228,"So for the past 2 weeks now I've been a floater for my vendor job for a potato chip company. Today I was told to work a store at 3am - 6am then call another employee to help him out at another store. When I was done with my assigned store I called the number given to me. No answer...I texted...no response. I called my supervisor (person who told me where to start and who to call afterwards.)..didn't pick up. I wait around in my car for about an hour. At this point I just clock out and go home. 

2 hours later the person I was suppose to help finally responds, but by this time I'm asleep. An hour after that the Supervisor calls me asking me where I am. I explain to him, how after I was done with my first store I called the number given and was given no response, and I also called him and he didn't answer. 

He did gets mad on the phone saying, that I didn't leave a voice mail or a text message to him stating I was going home, so now he wants me to come see him in the office on my next work day for a one on one. 

Was I on the wrong for just going home? Should I have to give him a call again after I reached out. He is management, shouldn't he be on top of this stuff and have a dam schedule ready for me. 

At this point I don't even care if I get fired. I'm super annoyed by the lack of communication from this place, and the fact if feels like I'm just given late notice adjustments to my given schedule half way into the day. An example being...Thursday I started at 4am. At 10:30am I received a text saying my last store scheduled was switched to someone else and that I am to report to another location which just received 5 racks of product. I end up working a little over 12 hours that day just super annoyed with everything. So for only working 4 days I was already over 46 hours for the week...I was done and tired so in a way I was happy no one answered me.

241,"Hi all i need some feedback with a decision im trying to make. I'm having a hard time organizing my thoughts so I apologize if this is jumbled. 

I'm getting married in 2 months, FH and I plan to start TTC in January. I am female and if I get pregnant I will need insurance coverage [USA]. I have always wanted kids and would love to have at least 3. I'm almost 31 and most likely will have a hard time conceiving because I had a gnarly cyst that took out one of my ovaries and tubes. The sooner we start trying the better is kind of where my thought process is. I have always wanted to be a mom and it is really important to me.

Problem is... I am graduating with a degree in IT in may. I would love to get some work in the field before I have kids. I don't know what to do. 

It's not a good idea for me to look for a new job now because I dont have my degree yet and I need a good chunk of time off for our wedding/honeymoon. 

 I really just don't know when would be a good time to switch jobs. I've worked at my job now since I was 22. I don't know how insurance works when you move to another company. Do you get cobra for 3 months or do you just wait until your new companies health insurance kicks in?

 I'm sure it's illegal to not hire someone because they're pregnant but realistically I feel like it would hurt my chances. 

I always wanted to be a SAHM but am fairly certain that won't happen. I feel like my degree will go to waste if I don't do anything with it for 5 years  [minimum] especially a degree in IT. 

Another option I have toyed with is to go on for more schooling once I have a baby. Issue with that would be the price of tuition and having an infant on one income. 

Anyone have any advice? What would you do in my shoes? When should I try to get another job, in your opinion? ",28Oct2017,3

243,"So last week I went out on a date with a girl I had been talking to for 2 weeks off of Bumble (dating app). Our texts are mainly me cracking jokes and asking questions as she responds (I text her about once a day or two to initiate conversation).

The way our date went is as follows:

I arrive on time at the bar and text her. Half an hour passes as I’m sipping my drink. She texts me that she’s at her friend’s distillery and got buzzed and apologizes, asking me to meet her there. Red flag goes up. 

I’m a curious (not to mention lonely) fellow so I finish my drink and head there. There’s some type of celebration going on outside - a wedding recepetion, I come to find. At this point I’m getting hesitant. It’s night outside, I haven’t met this person before, and this is a very odd place to meet up last minute. But... I proceed to the distillery. A couple of minutes go by before I finally hear from her, asking me to meet her... *by the dumpster?*

2 Red flags. I immediately call her out, saying that’s pretty sketchy, but she gives me her number so that I can find her - which I do. Turns out her friend has a small house by the distillery that she helps provide alcohol with. 

At this point things are going well. We have some drinks, I meet her friends, and we’re just enjoying ourselves and chatting. Eventually her friends leave and she hints at going back to her place so I suggest it and we proceed, getting to know each other, and having an enjoyable Netflix and chill night. 

I tell her I’m looking to get close with someone and she mentions she’s going with the flow for now (her ex was a closet homosexual that came out). We have a lovely morning and part ways.

So now I’m back to my routine with the texts. We converse a bit Monday before I stop hearing from her. Mind you, I’m usually leaving the conversations open with a question, and if I don’t hear back I’ll just wait until the next day to text again. However, 3 days go by and I don’t hear from her at all. 

By Friday I’m a bit bummed out. I’m thinking *Hey, it’s Halloween, she’s ghosting me. Har har* I’ve been ghosted a few times before so I decide to call her and leave a message saying something along the lines of “Hope to hear back from you. If you just wanted a smash and dash it’s fine, but it would be nice to know.”

To my surprise she answers. Turns out she’s been super busy with work and that maybe she can meet today, she’s just waiting on a favor that might take awhile. So we might not meet, but I’m honestly just glad to hear back from her.

**So**, if you happened to have read all this; what do you think? Am I being too pushy here? Or maybe she’s not as interested? I honestly want to meet up with her again, I just hope I’m not being blind to something.",28Oct2017,2

* I'm applying for jobs almost daily, but the field I work in is very hard to get into in my city without 2-3 years of prior experience (journalism, RIP), so responses have been hit or miss.

* I'm 5'4 and 130ish pounds, which I know is a healthy weight for a woman my age, but my whole life I've had a fast metabolism and rarely weighed over 110. I knew it wouldn't be that way forever, but the pounds hit me like a ton of bricks after I turned 23, so my self esteem is a little shot right now.

* I have wonderful friends and a great boyfriend who love and support me (which I'm wildly grateful for), but I just feel so stuck. I'm in a headspace where I consider it an accomplishment to shower and leave my apartment for basic stuff like groceries/etc.

**TL;DR:** No job, gained weight, slipping into a mild depression and desperately seeking the motivation that will stick and help me get my shit together.

263,"tl;dr at bottom. 
 
Basically title. The last 5 years for me has been wasted on playing mostly League of Legends and World of Warcraft. While I love these games to death and beyond, I think it's time for me to part ways with hardcore-grinding-ten-hours-a-day sessions. 
 
I do have a problem, though. I'm in my early twenties and the dreams I had as a child got shut down pretty hard by my parents (they thought they knew what was best for me), so gaming felt like the only thing I enjoyed and was actually able to do. As I'm getting older I realize that I want/need new friends and I do not want them to be gamers. I feel like I'm growing out of that phase and I do not enjoy being with people who concider themselves gamers anymore. 
 
[Sort of ranty. Feel free to skip] I know it's never too late to start with something new, but the things i dreamt of as a kid (including dancing, playing the violin or piano, becoming a professional swimmer) are all things that take way too long to learn as an adult. I have not really been taking care of my body either, meaning that these things are even harder to learn. It's hopeless, really.
 
I know there's no rush, but I have to start figuring out what I wanna do with my life and I have so many ideas, but I think gaming's become a distraction and is just stopping me from pursuing my interests. Gaming has become my identity, but it shouldn't have. I regret spending that many hours on games (probably spent 5000+ hours the last three years when things really took off) because I grew into a community I now don't want to be a part of anymore. I tried doing something different, but I don't know how to socialize with non-gamers now. 
 
 
I do still enjoy gaming, but times are changing and I don't know where I wanna go and what I wanna do. I've realized that I can't do both. I have to make a choice, so I'm asking you for advice. Thanks &lt;3
 
Tl;dr: Been spending a lot of time on games, but want something new and meet new people. Started gaming because my parents didn't approve of my other plans and all my friends played a lot of games. Gaming's stopping me from pursuing my dreams. Am stuck. Send help. ",28Oct2017,5
265,"Same old story.

I’m a shy guy who’s smart.
I work a job where I get dominated.
Yelled at, abused, picked on.
In an industry and state where if you’re not a c&amp;@t to everyone then you’re the weird one. 
It’s a family run business with 5/9 people being related to the boss.
I get left behind at the office when they go to get drinks.
I get told to do bins even though I’ve been there 10 years and am the most senior.
I’m 50/50 mix and 99% of people think I’m european but one of them saw me out and about with my mom who’s Asian. 
I came to work the next week and they put rice in all my office stuff... since then I’ve been called a chink. Told I spent too long out in a rice field when I had a sunburn. Where was my round pointy chink hat. Been asked if I have my newborn already working in a sweat shop. That’s not the worst of it the list goes on of how bad it is. 

I work in a small regional town. 
There are zero jobs.
Houses here are super expensive and my home loans about 40% of my income. 
I have a few thousand saved - it will cover the loan and living costs for 8 weeks. 
I had a kid a couple months ago.

I had to pack tissues in the car now because I’ve found as I drive to work after 5-10 minutes every few days I start crying for no reason. My office is a 5x3 ft grey cubical with ceiling high walls. When the work days over, I drive home and every couple of days I have to pull over from crying.

When I go to sleep, I have nightmares about work. I literally dream about work and have constant nightmares about work then wake up. Go to work and live the nightmare. Then come home. Dream about the nightmare. Wake up. Work at the nightmare. Weekends come around and I think of work. My wife walked in on me crying but she couldn’t see my face so I pretended like I was doing something for a bit till she left. Our sons a few weeks old but we have already had some major medical expenses which took our savings from 20k to 3. Were on a knifes edge and I hate it. To cap it all off I have been diagnosed with depression before and been on suicide watch. I’d never do anything but I never want to be in that situation again. 

What’s the fastest way to make as much money as possible. I dont care how at this point - I just need cash. If I can get 50k I can retrain and afford my home loan and pay bills for a year. I can maybe even afford to leave this place. Anything please I’m super desperate. Super desperate. If I was a woman I’d start doing escort. I don’t know what men do.",28Oct2017,13
267,"Hey all, 

I just turned 30. I'd like to start a family. I feel like time is of the essence because we would like to have a couple of kids. 

I have been at my current job for 3 years. The pay and benefits are good. The environment, however, is not. I'll give you some background: Our boss is a non-manager and plays favorites with the bookkeeper. He hardly gives a ""hello"" once a week to the other staff, but is constantly giggling it up with her and telling her where he's off to, his weekend plans, saying ""Goooood morning!"" etc. 

This bookkeeper was supposed to train in a new assistant but didn't. Boss never held bookkeeper accountable. So, I took it upon myself to train her because she was so lost. As a result, bookkeeper got pissed, ignored us, and refused to work with us for 6 months because we were ""in cahoots"". Assistant filed a harassment complaint with HR and eventually quit. We replaced her. Guess what? 1 year later the SAME EXACT THING happened with someone new (though I just let the assistant struggle this time, which killed me). My boss never addressed it and blamed it all on both assistants. ""We've had such terrible luck with shitty assistants, guess they just want the benefits. We aren't hiring again for that position. You and bookkeeper split up the work"" (BTW, my job sector has nothing to do with finance/admin/etc).  

I complained to my boss about the bookkeeper and all he told me was ""she may have health issues causing her bad behavior. Let's support her as best we can"". (This was complete bullshit, by the way). 

In the past when the last assistant was here, bookkeeper has lied about some pretty horrendous things, like: blamed me for accessing her computer, told the boss I skipped work, said I was lazy and untrustworthy, etc. Boss even called IT over to have them do a full investigation which was inconclusive. Even saying ""Bookkeeper said only you had her computer password. Weird huh?"" (I never did) and walked out of my office. 

Anyway, things are going well now that I guess we've eliminated the assistant position, but I harbor a lot of resentment. And he will always play favorites with the bookkeeper and she will always be invincible. I don't see any opportunities for advancement here either. 

I guess I can't be fired for being pregnant but the strange, previously VERY toxic and somewhat still toxic environment gives me a lot of stress. Though things are going OK now, I don't know where I stand or how I'll be treated. I don't know if I want to get a new job either. I don't want to start something new and then have a baby a year later, I feel like that might piss off a new employer, but I could be wrong. 

I haven't felt this lost in a long time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! thanks!

270,"Ok so here's the whole story (sorry for the lengthyness) so me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years. We have a great relationship, love each other, support each other, never fight. Anyways we met on line and met in person after a few years. Got together it was long distance (he was in Orange county I was in the central valley) so after going back and forth taking a train to visit him( I don't drive due to anxiety) his mother suggest why don't I try living with them (he still lived his parents we were 21 and 19 at the time) for better opportunity and a better area (I kinda lived in a small ghetto town) so we did so I can live somewhere better and we could be together. After about a week of me living there one night she just goes off on me for absolutely no reason. I was always very polite to her and respected her and her home. But she said some pretty horrible stuff. She said that I was a burden to my parents, my entire family and to her, said that I just invited myself to live there and she never said I could live there and mocked me for missing my grandpa (we are very close he is almost 90 and was depressed that I moved away) so after this woman just said all these horrible things and said I wasn't welcome there I left that same night (she did all that in front of my boyfriend btw) he wanted to come with me but his parents wouldn't let him. A day later both of his parents weren't home so he packed his shit in his car and left. My parents welcomed in to the house with open arms we lived together there and had jobs. Fast forward two years later.

His mom gave some fake ass apology after he talked to her and said what she did was not ok because he loves me and she needs to accept me. I forced myself to forgive her for him. His uncle offered to pay for his schooling and my boyfriend found a school in the Orange county area he wanted to go to so he wanted to move back. After some time he convinced me it was a good idea to go back and his mom had apologized and I could also go to school. So I quiet my good job to move back to support him

So now were back living with his parents and can't start school till next semester  he was able to get a job quickly and works 40 hours a week. So I'm stuck at the house with his mother all day all week, looking for a job. When she does talk to me she is so obviously fake and takes passive aggressive shots at me. Like saying my shoes are ugly, pointing out any break outs I get (I have sentive skin so I break out really from some food, a little bit of sweat or dirt), or telling me I most likely won't get a job she sees me apply to. 

I am so miserable and depressed  here, I'm all alone, and I feel stressed all the time cause I can sense she hates me and I miss my family (which she gets mad at me for btw). Idk if I should go back home and be long distance with my boyfriend again or tuff it out till we can find our own place.  Please some advice DX

(Side note he is the only child and adopted, he is no way a mama's boy. He has sided with me and supported me through everything she's done. He also doesn't know she says theses things while he's gone to work i haven't told him yet)",28Oct2017,1
271,"Before dating, I was on a normal 8-5pm shift.  Normal sleep schedule... in bed by 11pm.

After meeting my fiance (then-boyfriend), he introduced me to the night owl sleep schedule.  We stayed on that schedule for several years.  And I even changed my schedule around to work overnight and a 3pm-11pm shift since we were getting serious.  But I started feeling lonely because it's hard to make friends when you work overnight or don't get up until 3pm to go to work.  And the people that do stay up that late weren't the type of people I really wanted to hang out with.

So I started working 3pm-11pm instead of overnight and trying to wake up by 10am to start a semi-early day.  This also meant going to bed just a few hours after getting off of work.  

I feel exhausted and just absolutely drained lately because I'm starting to dislike the evening shift.  I don't ever get to hang out with friends or family because I don't want to feel rushed in the morning before work and I don't have the weekend off when everyone else seems to.  

Lately I feel like I'm in a daze and only have 2 days off to relax.  Because my after-work relaxation is cut short so I can wake up early (vs relaxing after work for at least 5 or 6 hours before bed).  

I temporarily went back to the morning shift and tried to make it work with my fiance, but it put too much strain on our relationship and we were both miserable.  He doesn't go to sleep until 4 or 5am and I had to be in bed by 11pm.  I'm also a light sleeper and any little noise or light will wake me up.  Not to mention that I've gotten used to not sleeping alone.  

I don't want to ask my fiance to switch his sleep schedule around,nor would it be fair of me to ask him to.  But I just can't take this mid shift and miss the morning schedule so I can have a social life with my friends and family.  But if I switch back to the morning shift, my fiance and I both agreed it puts too much stress on us.  We never get to hang out with each other and it isn't fair to make one of us go to bed early or stay up late.

I'm clueless what to do here.  I don't want to break it off with him obviously and would prefer not to go back to a later shift to get back on HIS sleep schedule.  Any advice or tips for what I should do?",28Oct2017,1

277,"Ever since I was a kid i've always needed advice, on making friends, college, careers, you name it. Sometimes I would be so confused or problematic that my mom would get furious or cry. Especially as a child of a family without a father.  
For over two years now, i've been living by myself for college. After the first few months I realized my mom never called me. I always reckoned she wanted me to call her instead, since they didn't want to disturb me while i'm busy, so I did that once, telling them they could call me anytime.  
half a year past, nothing. So I call my mom again and the same thing goes on.  
Cut to the last week where I finally asked my mom to call me, telling her it was kinda weird to never get a call from her, and she actually just ignored my question and said something like ""I hope you're doing a fantastic in college!"" and then nothing.
I've literally spoken to my only family member 3 times for the past 2 years, and its fucking depressing. I know I bothered my mother, but I didn't know it was to this extent.  
I later found out that she picked up a new job and now works on the weekdays. It all makes sense now since she'd always yell how I basically ruined her life as a free individual, although most times she was a kind, average mom.    
I just feel so fucking worthless, especially since i'd been trying to pay my mother back for college by working my ass off. Because i'm so busy all the time, I only have two friends in the entire world, whom I consider family that I contact almost everyday.

280,"So I've been talking to this guy for about a couple months. I'm 18 he's 19. We hang out often so it seems like longer. We basically act like we're a couple, but we're not. I have slept over his house a couple of times and we are intimate. Every time I ask him what we're considered it doesn't get very far and leaves me confused. Basically, he's going through a rough time with everything because his mom passed a few months ago so he has to support his family (long story) He's a really good person and told me he has never been in a serious relationship before, and no he does not hook up with random girls. He's a virgin but he told me he has had a lot of opportunities to lose it but didn't want to lose it to just any girl, he wanted to have feelings for her, and he wants me to be his first. (Which is believable that he had many opportunities because he's very attractive.) This is where it gets confusing. I've talked to him about this a few times, he said he's scared of getting hurt if he gets into a relationship. He's also old fashioned and said if he does get into one, he wants to love the girl first. Him and I agree that too many people nowadays get into a relationship for the sake of being in one. We are considered exclusive, he said ever since we met he stopped talking to other girls. Another way to put it is he thinks relationships are just a title and has also told me he doesn't know what he wants. He cares for me and he said he would be very upset if he were to lose me. He said he's never had what we have with another girl so it's all new to him. He told me as well that in the future, if I could convince him about why we should be boyfriend/girlfriend, then it's possible we could be. He's a really genuine caring guy so he's not a bad person at all, I just honestly don't know what to think about this. It seems like he's scared of getting into something because of the fact that things do end and no one stays together forever, which I mentioned that it shouldn't stop him from pursuing a relationship. I know it's just a title, but to me that means commitment and that's what I want in the future. I don't want to be just ""friends with benefits"" even though we're more than just that, I don't know what to do. I just don't want to get hurt if this is all he wants but he says it's not. I just don't understand why it's such a big deal to him to be in one when we practically act like we're dating as it is. I just want to know where this is going in the future, I don't want to waste my time even though I know we're not. Just every time we have this conversation we go in circles and he says all of what I just told you above. I'm sorry if it's kinda of contradicting what he's saying that's why it's hard for me to understand completely.  When I tell people about him, they're confused when I try to tell them we aren't official but we act like it. They don't understand either so it's kind of awkward when they ask what we're considered.

282,"So, like the title says, my mom's got some mental issues that are really putting strain on my family.
As a bit of background, she used to tell us that she was estranged from her family because they were all out to get her- which, as a child, I didn't really question because mom's word is law. She'd pick fights with anyone around her (neighbors, her kids' teachers, kids' friends' parents) and would find something-anything- that she'd blow out of proportion and play the victim roll in her made up paranoid fantasies. I remember quite a few times when she'd call the cops on the neighbors because she thought their security cameras were pointed into our windows, and from that moment on those neighbors were her ""enemies""
In recent years, since my brother and I left, she's really gone off the deep end. She regained contact with her family (who, it turns out, had never estranged her, or done anything wrong), and then lost it again after thinking that, again, they were her enemies.  She's currently pushing away my brother, father, and myself because she'll come up with a thousand reasons why we're all against her, when she's taken some small thing (like not responding to a text fast enough) and taken that to the extreme (it means we don't love her, we're conspiring against her). She even thinks I contacted the DMV to get her eyesight checked months ago, because I ""was always the one to complain about her driving.""
You know. Paranoia.

She doesn't believe in therapy, and thinks that doctors are lying to you when they prescribe medication for mental health. She refuses to listen to us when we think there's something very wrong with her, and we can't deal with it anymore. She's become a burden on my father's mental health and she's not a big help to mine, either.

My cousin and her boyfriend have 3 kids together, the youngest was about 3 when that information came to light. She kicked him out and he got a place in town. They share custody about 50/50 of the kids. Thankfully, they were never married because of his debts and bad credit. She cut her mom out completely. She stipulated that the one condition of not taking him to court for custody was that her mom was not allowed to see the kids.

Anyway, now he wants to go to court so that he, the mom, and the kids can hang out together. She's asked me to write a letter of character on her mom to present to the judge, with the aim being that her request to keep her away from the kids is granted.

Basically there's a guy in my class who pretends that he's my friend and really likes to act like i'm his ""pet"" if you understand what i'm saying, he looks down on me and says degrading shit sometimes and is generally really fucking annoying.


One thing that's bothering me especially is that he started making me look like an outcast and every time i'm talking with a group of people with him he says ""why you stitching"" and shit like that trying to seperate me from others (in my school, stitching is when someone who isn't really liked tries to fit in and hang out with people that don't like him) he does shit like that on a regular basis and i'm afraid other people will start doing it too and i'll get really bad reputation.


But he also pretends that we're ""buddies"" or something, he sometimes winks at me and does weird shit like that, to be honest, i t makes me feel really ""inferior""


I've punched him in the head multiple times because he crossed the line and threatened to beat him up too (i'm way stronger than thim). He usually stops doing it for a week or two and then starts with his shit again.


I never say hi to him or start conversations, i even told him multiple times that i don't want to be his friend and that he should just leave me but he ignores it.


I don't want to punch him or threaten him anymore because it never really solves the problem and it makes me seem like an asshole.


Could you guys help me out? I have to see that guy on a daily basis because we play basketball together and we also go to the same bus stop together.


Some other stuff he does that's obnoxious too is that a group of girls started calling one guy ""bad boy"" and weird, silly pet names like that, they started calling him like that because he made a joke that involves ""bad boy"" or something like that and now it's their inside joke and my toxic friend started calling everyone bad boy and shit like that because he thinks it's a sexual thing and he gets jealous.


 He also called my best friend an autist bunch of times and really likes to make fun of his shyness by bringing him into uncomfortable situations. But he stopped doing it because, again, i threatened to beat him up if he doesn't stop it.


He's pissing another guy by doing the same shit but since he goes to a different class, he's not doing it as much. Again, that guy is stronger than him too and he's basically getting away with all the shit he does to us because of our kindness and cause we don't want to look like the bad guys.
