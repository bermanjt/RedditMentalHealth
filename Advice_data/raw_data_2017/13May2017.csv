0,"I have been friends with this online friend for almost 5 years now. We found each other through gaming, and we still game every once in a while. We actually one time bonded because both of us have complicated relationships with our dads, basically being nonexistent living a state away (with a text every once in a while). How should I help? What can I do? Do I just play games with him and ignore it, talk to him and then play games, or what?",13May2017,2
2,"I'm a 24 year old who is currently going to community college. I plan on transferring once I'm done. For the past 4 years I've been working part time at a pet store. The pay is decent, but I could really use a change of occupation to something that makes more money. Last year I started paying for a used car for $318 a month. I also need money for school, I'd like to save up for a trip to japan (currently have about $800 in savings account for it), and I'd also like to move out sometime in the near future if possible.

I could sell some of my games and anime, but that wouldn't really make a ton necessarily. I'm willing to switch to any occupation as long as it's legal.",13May2017,1
3,"For brief context, my ex is in my circle of friends at uni. We've had our rough times and she thinks I'm crazy but I still give a shit about her.

We have a group chat and last night one of my friends in there who doesn't like her was drunk and removed her from the chat. I wouldn't have minded so much normally but I talked to my ex earlier that day to check up on her because she seemed really down. She hasn't been coming to uni and I know she's in a lot of debt right now. I don't know how she feels but I feel like her getting kicked from the chat wouldn't have been great, regardless of how much she hangs out with us anymore.

I have 2 questions.
1: Should I say anything to the friend who kicked her out? I know my friend doesn't like her but I thought it was unfair.
2: is it a bit weird that I still go out of my way to make sure my ex is ok? A lot of shit went down after our breakup but I still want her to be happy",13May2017,2

10,"I work my very hardest, and I make it very clear that I am not only committed to doing my job really well, but committed to learning. I have a great attitude all the time, even in the face of criticism; ""thank you so much for pointing out that mistake.""

She constantly yells at me, doesn't give me a chance to explain myself, seems incredibly exasperated if I have a question for her.. she seems very friendly with her other employees, or at least neutral, but she never smiles at me, ever. she is only ever cruel and dismissive. 

I've been working there for about a month, and she's given me 4 write ups. the first was for a no call no show.. It was my second week, and I had Thursday, Friday, and Saturday off. on Thursday, she changed my schedule to include a Saturday shift, and didn't call me. when I showed up on Sunday, she gave me a write up. then it was for smoking in my car in front of the store.. something I've seen about 15 other employees do. I've actually seen a few smoking *right next to the door.* then it was for ""insubordination."" she told me I was making pizza wrong, and the next time she saw me making pizza, I was still doing it the old way out of habit. write up. then another driver took a photo of me talking to a customer on my phone while I was driving without using the Bluetooth. she called me into her office and said ""I'm going to give you one chance to tell me the truth. were you talking on your phone in your car?"" I normally use Bluetooth, and didn't remember doing that, so that's what I told her.. she gave me a write up for it and told me that although she doesn't have the authority to fire me, corporate might fire me. I talked to that other driver, and he said people are talking about me behind my back. I asked what they were saying, and he said they were saying I'm a kiss ass. I just want to be good at my job. he also said someone heard me say I was going to be the best in the store.. I never said that. the assistant manager said that when I told him all the stuff I was doing off the clock to learn how to be a better delivery driver.

What the fuck? I work *hard.* I show up early *every day* with a good attitude, and I do my best to learn how to do my job better. I am committed, and I'm given nothing but discouragement. my manager *constantly beats me down,* and yells at me *every day.* several other employees have asked me why she treats me like this, because I am clearly being singled out, and inhale *no idea.* the only difference between me and most other drivers is that I have a great attitude, and I'm working *hard and fast*, whereas they're kind of just strolling to and from their cars, slowly doing dishes, etc. maybe it's because of that?",13May2017,3
13,"Hello. I apologize if this post is a little long-winded, but I'll attempt to narrow it down. I'm having some major conflicts that I need advice for, and I feel the people in my life won't know how to answer them. I definitely need to give some backstory otherwise my questions will seem a bit strange. I'll start with categorizing my problem(s), and then proceed with questions.

A quick biography: I'm an introvert and I regain my energy from being alone with hobbies. I also consider myself to be pretty social as I have a good amount of friends and am happy with where I am right now. I have some life goals that I need to achieve like minor weight loss, better fitness, pursuit of an internship, future career goals, etc.

**PROBLEMS** 

 * Since the college semester has ended, I have more free time to engage in things that I want to do. Right now I have this major knot in my gut from twisted emotions about not being around people, wanting to ask people to hang out, being afraid of getting let down/rejected, and trying to find the right people to hang out with. I can totally just call someone and ask, and there's really not much preventing me from doing it. The only thing is, I don't want to pester people with requests to hang out and make it look like I'm desperate. I guess my problem, socially, is that I feel like I need to be out doing more than what I'm presently doing. I also have things that I really want to do and to share it with other people, but I know that they'll either say they're busy or say no. I feel like if I go out and do this stuff by myself, it will feel empty...

 * There was a time (2-3 years) when I felt like being around other people wasn't necessary. I was genuinely happy with doing things by myself and enjoying hobbies. I still talked to and hung out with an amount of friends, but I was overall content with being alone. I didn't care about love interests, new acquaintances, or really anything outside of personal gain. Eventually, I joined a social group through one of my friends and developed an affinity for being around people and sharing time with others. More recently and over time, being alone does not have as much charm. I'm really conflicted with who I was and who I want to be, and whether or not I prefer the former or latter. I feel like I am stuck between two sides of myself and I can't be happy with either of them.

 * I have recently been trying to find a significant other. I know for a fact that I have had some girls interested in me that I could have gone after, but for some reason I don't engage. I can't engage. I think it's because I'm afraid that I'll ruin the opportunity with something stupid that I do or say, and I won't even be able to at least be their friend if it goes badly. I know that ""you miss 100% of the chances you don't take,"" but I'm just.. afraid. I'm confident in being me, and I know what kind of person I am, it's just that I can't stomach the thought of something negative happening. I also don't know if I'm willing to sacrifice so much of my time to commit to someone else, but I also want to be with someone else. I want to know someone on a molecular level, but I need to have my own space.

 * I have a best friend and co-worker (we will call her Blue) that I've had a growing infatuation for that I fear is not productive. Basically, she is in a relationship (Not totally sure; she doesn't talk about him) with a man in the military, who she has a child with, and who she is living with his parents. From an obvious standpoint, she has three layers of personal security that bar me from any chance at attempting the slightest inquiry. My brain is telling me *ABORT ABORT* but my heart is pointing at signs of her reciprocating my interest. There was a night she and I went out for food, and we must've talked for hours. We both laughed, talked about serious stuff, and just enjoyed each other. She expressed interest in things I thought she would absolutely despise, and it sparked this little flame that grew. To summarize my experience with her: I feel like I have gotten signals from her about being intimate, but I feel like I am misconstruing them from the hope of a chance at a relationship. From past experience, I know if I say something I will ruin this friendship and so I am very conflicted. I seriously value being her friend, but a chunk of me wants to be closer to her and it's starting to ache.

**QUESTIONS**

 * Should I just ask friends to hang out regardless of their answer or the negative implications of asking (being perceived as annoying and desperate)?

 * Should I feel like I need to be out in the world and enjoying life, or should I just stay introverted?

 * Should I pursue more constructive goals first, and then worry about my social life? ... Should I even worry about a social life?

 * Do I go out and experience the things I want to do, even if it isn't with someone else?

 * Among three of the girls I'm interested in and I know would reply, how can I nonchalantly ask them to go out without it being obvious that it's asking them on a date?

 * What is the best way to start a conversation with them to make it seem like it isn't my sole purpose just to ask them out?

 * Do I pursue Blue, or force myself to stop crushing on her?

These are some things I really need some insight on. I can't seem to come to a conclusion on my own and it feels like there is a war going on in my mind. My stomach is churning with a melting pot of positive and negative emotions that I can't choose from and it's really maddening.

They've told me I'm one of their best employees before and I feel kind of guilty quitting, but I'm just not happy there.

They're losing all of us at once. Nobody likes hosting, it seems.

How do I go about giving my two weeks? Should I tell them one day after work, or should I write a letter and give it to them (along with explaining what it is, but the letter would just be me telling them why and thanking them for giving me this opportunity etc.)?

35,"Got to the point where I feel humiliated and there's unfair treatment in my workplace. My boss pushes everyone until they break, literally until they cry or negotiate with him. We've also needed more employees for months, but it's just not in the budget, so we look highly unorganized and stressed. My boss has as many people intern/volunteer so he doesn't have to pay them. Also, he hires people with little experience so he can start us on a low salary. 

I'm an events coordinator and global liaison. 

When I say 20 hours it means 20 hours a week: 40 hours, 60 hours 


My girlfriend and I were in the midst of changing visas in order to stay in this country. Basically, if you're not a skilled worker then your only other option is to be a student. Perfect, because I work at a school! I asked if my gf could study at our school with a 50% discount. He approved it, as he should, because it's common practice in our company for family members/spouses to get discounts. 3 weeks later, I asked if I could study at our school, but he said they ran out of space (literally a document issued by the government that allocates a spot for students). And that I would only be paid 20hrs a week, except for during my holidays where I could earn more. He said my gf was lucky, and that I was unlucky. 

My colleagues told me to approach him again because we had a British person studying at are school, which isn't suppose to happen because it's an ESL school. So my colleagues were confused because it's common for our coworkers to take free courses within the company and they weren't sure why I hadn't yet (especially because another girl, my colleague - lets call her Yumi - had successfully got the legal document and started taking courses). 

When I spoke to my boss he said that  I was unlucky because the courses for native English speakers start in 4 months, so he'd be unable to offer courses to me. I needed the visa stat, so I applied with another school. I was ok with this... I trained people to aid in my role to spread my responsibilities because I could only work 20 hours legally. This is current and it's incredibly hard to manage because I could have used people to aid in my role when I worked 40 - 60 hour weeks. But all of my coworkers are incredibly hard workers so I sucked it up. 

Then I found out Yumi got a full time scholarship to study at our school, and is now getting paid for fulltime hours. I tried to not bring it up, but I started obsessing over it so I told me boss we had to talk. He told me it is because her job is external, while mine is only internal (meaning she deals with the Japanese market), and I told him it doesn't matter it's still unfair and illegal. We talked in circles and I made it clear I was unhappy. The next week he met with me and wanted to explain himself more, he said that Yumi was exceptional and that ""I can't allow you to work full time, because then everyone - receptionists, counselor's will ask for it.""

It also sucks to see Yumi get these benefits because I've walked into her office while she broke down, cried and cussed a storm about our boss.""i fucking Hate him i fucking Hate him"" It's really not professional. 

When it was my holiday, I asked if I could work more hours and he said, sorry there's no work to be done. 

The person who aided me, let's call him Tony, also had to change his visa. Tony was so pissed, he was about to leave because my boss hadn't offered him full time. So he gave my boss an ultimatum and it worked. Tony also received a study rights at our school, a fulltime scholarship, and a promotion. 

I love my job, it's unfortunately, the most prestigious job I've had, but I feel like I should just walk out. Have you ever walked out of a job before, what was the aftermath? I feel so humiliated, and undervalued I don't even want to give a 2 weeks I just want to leave. It's hard because Yumi thinks it's because I'm American, and I just get this condescending vibe from Tony now that he has surpassed me. Anyway, leaving will burn my bridge to the school, how bad would that be for my future? This is an international company, before this I only worked at Starbucks and some school in an Asian speaking country. ",13May2017,1

It's in a small town and I can hear them saying that it's a safe place, but everyone thinks that til something bad happens.

60,"Hey Reddit,

I just finished up my 3rd year of college. Today was the last day of finals, most people are leaving campus. I have to stick around for another two weeks to finish up my nine week session at work, but it's normally fun and easy. So basically, I'm living alone for the first time ever (since roommate left two days ago) and I'm finding myself to be mostly just lonely and bored all the time. I called my mom earlier this week to ask if she had sent mail, and she was actually in the hospital. She had gotten a serious bone infection in her left thumb that is eating it away and this has been going on for 4 months now; I always thought the swelling and pain was just arthritis symptoms or Lyme disease flareup, but either way, a huge problem. I'd say it isn't THAT much of an issue seeing as it at least isn't immediately life-threatening, but of course, there are underlying problems and complications within the situation. 


Startled at the news and slightly upset I didn't know about this happening earlier, I let her go to bed. I spoke to my dad the next day, calling him later in the evening to find out what happened the previous night. He told me that they had a small emergency procedure and a picc line inserted to intravenously administer antibiotics, but they were not taking well to her. She would have to see a specialist the following day as well as meet up with a doctor to get the new antibiotics.


First of all, she made a big deal about putting the picc line in her right arm. Her career as a dog groomer requires use of her right arm and right hand extensively (her scissor/clipper hand), as well as her left hand (mostly holding, positioning). She believed that having it in her right arm would be too inconvenient and she wouldn't be able to go right back to work. I also do believe she understands that having the line inserted into her left arm is extremely risky, because the infection has a much higher chance of getting into the picc line and being immediately sent to the heart. But she still argued it anyways, because she seriously values working and making her client base happy, opposed to taking the best, safest treatment route. She eventually caved. At an appointment yesterday, she waited to see an infectious disease specialist for 1.5 hours before getting fed up and she straight up just left. My dad went with her but he couldn't stop her, and they went home. Upon getting there, my brother tried to spark up conversation with her, but she simply screamed ""I'm so fucking done"", grabbed her shit and left. The only place she would possibly go is back to work (she sleeps there most nights anyways), so we weren't worried of her whereabouts. But I am still deeply concerned, for many reasons. 


My mom is stubborn. She can know about a medical problem going on, and still ignore it and not seek out treatment. She works 100+ hours a week owning and running her own business- most of which is demanding labor. Her body has many, many problems that need attention, or at least need just a little bit of a break to start getting relief and back on track. I try to explain this to her, that this is a perfect time to take a break and focus on treating all the nagging problems, and encourage her to please take the time off and say fuck the people that don't understand that their appointments had to be cancelled for a serious medical reason. Honestly, if the client doesn't understand that their appointment had to be cancelled because their groomer developed a problem that needs immediate medical attention and directly affects their ability to do their job...fuck them. That's not a client I want. You should always take care of yourself above all else, in my opinion. 


So I'm sitting alone in my apartment, already feeling sad and isolated knowing all my friends are reunited having fun, but now also deeply worried about my mom. I think she's really scared. She has to be on IVs for weeks, months even. There is still a possibility that she will lose her thumb, and that would effectively end her career. Her trip to Vegas in four weeks is almost surely a long gone dream. I've tried calling her twice today just to ask how she is feeling, and I haven't had any response. After posting a brief message on Facebook about ""taking a leave of absence"", she's ignoring all messages and calls, stopped eating, and has essentially stopped talking to anyone.


Mother's Day is this weekend, and I was upset I couldn't be home for it like I normally am (first year working this job). Now I'm worried I won't even get to talk to her, or worse, that she still won't even want to talk to anyone and will spend it alone. I want nothing more than to just be home with my family right now, trying to make sense of what's happening and to stop waiting on the next phone call from my dad, just to get updates. This all sucks and it's already making my two weeks left here miserable.


I love my mom to death and I don't want her to feel this way and go through this. If anyone has any advice about what I can do to make either of our situations better, anything is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading my long post.",13May2017,2
62,"I work for a large, unionized, taxpayer-funded employer. The President seems to have very good intentions and is well-respected, but leaves the business operations to the senior managers. One of those managers recently did something exceedingly unprofessional (public humiliation) and has shown poor judgement and terrible communication skills. He also has a poorly-thought out business plan that will impact many others negatively and will likely lead to grievances. He is proceeding despite broad protest. He says all the right things but his actions don't match.

He seems to have Golden Boy status from some previous successes but I believe he is now a liability to the organization. It would be difficult to flag this manager's behaviour anonymously because I am one of a limited number of people who is aware of his behaviour. Is there any reasonable way to inform the President without suffering negative consequences? I am certain he wouldn't stand for it if he knew what was happening.

66,"Okay, so me and this girl were friends in high school but have since grown apart. I don't know much about her personal life anymore and only keep up with her through Facebook.

About a year ago, I saw she had gotten married to a man that she had only been dating briefly. They seemed like they had the perfect life in the beginning; always posting cute pictures of each other, bought their first house together, and gave birth to the most beautiful baby boy I have ever seen!
But a few months ago, after she gave birth to her son (postpartum maybe?) she started posting some really cryptic things on her Facebook late at night. She would usually delete the posts by morning, and replace them with new ones saying how much she loved her husband, which always seemed odd.

Well tonight she posted some seriously alarming things. She first admitted that her husband has been cheating on her throughout her relationship, with women that look nothing like her; which has caused her to have extreme body dysmorphia. She says that she hates her body, to the point where she doesn't want to leave the house some days. She has attempted to kill herself 4 times in the past year by taking pills, but hasn't been unsuccessful. While she was down, her husband would kick her to wake her up and tell her how stupid she was, threatening her that he would use this to take their baby away. She says that she has no relationship with her family back home, and has nowhere else to go because she rely on her husbands military income and benefits to provide for herself and her baby. We grew up together in a navy town in Washington State, and I know a lot of girls our age (21), think that becoming a navy wife straight out of high school is the easy way out; but don't understand the responsibility that comes with being married so young.

On one hand, my mind is just telling me to stay out of it and mind my own business, but the other half of me is worried sick for this girl and her newborn child!!! I don't know if there are resources I can lead her to, or advise I can give her... I want to tell her that things will be okay, that she needs to pull out of this situation for her son; but I don't know if she even wants to hear that (she says she still contemplates suicide every day).
Nobody seems to be reaching out to help her, and it's frustrating for me to just sit here and watch. I'm in college myself and have no means to physically move her out of her situation, but I'm sure there has to be SOMETHING I can do!

I guess I just want to know what you guys would do if you were in my situation... Thoughts?",13May2017,1

71,"What is a reasonable amount to break the lease?

Hello everyone. My Landlord a month after we moved in informed us that he was going to sell the house, he offered us no penalty and our deposit back if we broke the lease(1 year lease). We declined that offer because honestly moving sucks. 

Roughly 2 months later today, the property manager sent us a text offering us 2000 dollars which is our rent plus security deposit to move out because they got an offer from someone if we move out in about 2 months.

There are 3 of us and we have been polite to the landlord and cooperative with people coming in and looking at the house however I believe 4000 dollars is not worth all the work we have to put in to try to find a new house in the same area since we like it and also rent went up in the area since we moved in.

I was thinking about counter offering 15,000 since it would cover the movers and decent compensation for each of us for the trouble of making us move after 4 months. Im negotiable with the 15k but my question is if its unreasonable to ask for that much? I really like living here and I hate moving.

93,"Hello

So here's the context: 

I'm currently studying Music but I've come to realize this is not the future I want. 
I decided to sign up for admission into another school, much better with good reputation that give me access to a dual major of Science and Music
However, I'm not sure I'll get into that school, during my 2 first semester, I majored ( top of class ) and have 2 letter of recommendation, but my highschool grades were shit ( math is average, physics was below average, average is a score of 15/20 ) 
In order to increase my chances of getting admitted, I've thought about sending them a program that I made that would prove that I'm not shit at math and physic, I was just lazy in high school.

During the last few months, I took programming and machine learning class. I finished the programming one, got the basics of Python, but didn't finish the machine learning one.

I have 9 days until the deadline to make something remarkable.

I have 2 choices :

- Rush a machine learning MOOC ( https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/learn/v4/overview ). Replicate this : https://github.com/MattVitelli/GRUV make it a bit crappier, tell them I made one that was heavily inspired by the guy's work. Learn how his program work to the last bit so I can explain it during interview
- Rush the machine learning MOOC mentioned above, take more classes and make something from scratch but less amazing I suppose ( more tedious ) 

For now, I think I'm comfortable with the first option : I'm not signing up for MIT, they don't expect me to reinvent music right? I could also tell them that I modified his work to my preference. That will show that I'm honest, but at the same time I have logics that is good enough to understand something as complicated as as machine learning and that would mean I'm prepared for whatever they throw at me. And I mean, during my programming classes, I was told a few times that "" everything you're trying to do, someone else has already done it ""

Help me out there guys",13May2017,3

97,"I woke up to hearing my dad yelling at my mom but not in a bad way, but in a way of him telling her to sleep. Before you say &gt;lives with his parents
There's a reason. They're both disabled. One's physically disabled and the other is mentally disabled. My mother has Multiple Sclerosis, and this is not the first time this happened. This is the 4th, within 5 years. Last year it happened, she almost burned the whole fucking house down playing with candles. Also last year, we were able to find out she had small ""mini-strokes"" between my birth and to 2009 (further proof from the doctor who told her to abort me saying it's worth more trouble to give birth to me)
Why can't I do it today?
She lost her fucking insurance out of the blue. Salt in the wound, mine gets more benefits. She used to have state healthcare (TennCare) and it just disappeared on us. No warning, no letter, nothing. She goes to an appointment and they say she's uninsured.

So why do I say she ""needs"" insurance? She needs medicine and therapy to function. Not survive. Function. Now I don't mean to offend anyone but she acts like a mentally disabled kid beating things in the walls, except not beating things in the walls but just rather being loud and doing the weirdest shit. The last 3 times this happened was because she got new medicine that did not mix well with her others. This time is because she has no medicine. Of those last 3 times she also tried to use the bathroom in the trash can and the porch on two separate, I guess breakdowns? But this time it's pretty tame, she's just not able to think right but she still needs to see a doctor, but also needs to get insurance fast.

Is it possible to maybe use my insurance or anything like that? She needs to see a doctor because this wont stop until something like that is done.",13May2017,2

When we met he was broken, he was not sleeping or eating he was not in a good place I did all  could to build him up and to try to reverse all the damage his ex had done!
 
We moved in pretty quick and his ex still had a lot of her belongings at his house I always asked him to get her go come take her stuff but they had some arrangements and her things had to stay for the time being!

I always had a an uneasy feeling about the ex they were together for 6 years he started dating her wile she was pregnant (not his kid)she also had a boyfriend for the beginning of there relationship so he must have really loved her to let her move in and helping to raise her kid!! He told me how bad things were for the last 2 years of there relationship but she simply wouldn't leave and the house was his but she had no where to go and she had a young child so he stayed in the bad relationship.. I guess this is enough about their back story... here's the lies... in February I found a couple of texts messages that he had sent to her the messages were from back in November wile the messages were old when I found them  they broke my heart, in the texts he told her that she was the only girl for him.. he asked her come back and told her he missed her,when I saw these I was heartbroken I freaked out and told him I was leaving him I couldn't believe he sent her these messages!! We were only together for a month or so when he sent them but we were in an official relationship and I was going so far out of my way to build him backup from all her damage I was also finically supporting him and I had gone out of my way to meet and connect with his 11 year old son I was doing all this wile he was sending these messages!! 

He told me all the messages were made 1 day when he was not thinking clearly and that he didn't want her and even if she would have offered to come back he wouldn't have taken her back.. I know it makes no sense but that's what he told me I decided to let it go and after some time I got over it and we moved on!! 

I recently started a job that requires me work long hours and I would have to commute if I stayed living there so I decided to go back to my apparent that is much closer to work! I stay at my old place during week and  on my days off I would go back to stay with him.. I was tired and going threw some issues and I didn't go to his house for well over a week! Well when I finally went home with him he told me that his ex had been over with her kid and her new boyfriend and moved almost all of her stuff out.. I thought not much of this till I found 10 cigarettes in an ashtray in our bedroom, Nothing in the bedroom belongs to her!! I found it weird that she would be in the bedroom smoking if her boyfriend was moving her stuff out so I asked him if her boyfriend was really there cause my gut told me he was not there.. well he was not there,  my bf came clean and told me he lied and told me that her current bf being there so I would not flip out but now I don't know what else he is lying about I don't if he's telling me the truth when he says nothing happened..  she was obviously in the bedroom and her bf was not where!!!I have never used Reddit for love advice but I'm really sad and really confused and I'm hoping some one can give me some Objective advice!!

I have asked for diet advice on here before but then i just end up giving up my diet because i just don't feel motivated because i lose some weight but then it just stays at that weight and i don't lose anymore. I'm really determined this time, I've been using a calorie counter app and everything. Here's the thing though, i cheat my diet more than once a week, and i keep telling myself that its bad to cheat, but i need to keep going with my diet. But then i just cheat again. I have really bad self control, whenever my dad comes home with groceries my mind goes blank and i pig out, then i remember that i am on a diet. I try to see food as just energy, and that i only need a certain amount of energy in my body each day, but food is just really good????? I eat healthy but i'm still hungry, so i just eat more veggies. I think i'm bored so i try to just focus on my hobbies. I really want to lose weight and i don't want to lose motivation like the other times I've dieted. My mom calls me fat, but i'm really just overweight. My brother and father agree that she is being kind of a jerk by screaming at me that i'm fat all the time, when i'm clearly not even fat. Yes i can pinch fat on my body, but no i don't have a bunch of fat on my body. My BMI is around 26% and i think that is considered overweight? I'm definitely not obese though, i know i am in danger of becoming obese if i keep eating the way i do though. I really want a diet that is filling, but that will help me to lose weight. I'd like to at least lose 5-10 pounds a month if possible, but i can be patient. I can't afford any super nice diet plan or personal trainer. Heck i can't even exercise due to my physical illnesses. The doctor told me i'm not allowed to do any heavy exercising until i get better, which could be a while. I have a lot of problems with my body, i have bursitis, anemia, overuse injury's in my wrists and TMJ. The most i'm allowed to do is a 45 minute - 1 hour walk, which i try to do as much as i can. I can't even climb up stairs properly because it is so painful. My brother is really big on dieting and exercising, he lifts weights and does all of that stuff, because he lost a lot of weight of his own. He tries to help me as best he can, but he is not always around to tell me what to and what not to eat. I just love sweets, pop and chips. I've been trying to give up pop but i really don't want to give up chips and sweets, but now i am considering i should. I feel like if i follow some recipes off of a subreddit i go on (i think its called 1200 calories is enough or something like that) it'll motivate me more to lose weight. My mother says that she refuses to do anything fancy for meals, but some of these recipes seem really simple? My dad is the one who buys all of the groceries and i'm sure he wouldn't mind adding a few extra items to the grocery list, although we are moving and he might not be able to.

1) The materials I make the product from are essentially the cheapest I could find on amazon (because I'm in uni and I don't have a ton of money), and thus not very high quality. However, since it is an aesthetically valuable product, maybe that doesn't matter so much? Also, I have tried using more expensive materials but that would have to drive my price up to a level I'm not sure other people would pay for, and there is almost no change in the quality of the raw materials.

2) The product itself is very easily replicated if anyone puts 2+2 together. That doesn't mean it's not a cool product, my friends who got the prototypes absolutely love them. But I'm not sure I'll have tremendous success because of how easily the product can be replicated.

115,"Over the past few months we've broken up and gotten back together many times. Yesterday I broke up with him again and I want it to stay that way. He always finds a way to convince me to get back with him and he is quite addictive for me so I happily go along with it.
Some details: 1. The majority of our relationship is online (semi-ldr)
2. My parents really do not like him, and I live with my parents - a HUGE strain in the relationship
3. It never really hit me that he was verbally/emotionally abusive until very recently after we spent some time apart and I gained new perspective on everything.

It's difficult because he never struck me as abusive. At the time nothing felt bad but looking back it often was. He never laid a hand on me (other than the night he took my virginity when he slapped and choked me. We'd both said rough sex turned us on but I was surprised by it.) 
Everything still confuses me: was he even abusive? He called me a lot of names, insulted my family, threatened me, wished horrible things on me, belittled me and our relationship ('It was only really a fling' 'We're only fuckbuddies really'). He'd know my insecurities and really get at them if we ever fought.

127,"Hello all, a friend of mine recently got into a car crash (both parties are fine). It wasn't his fault and the driver that hit him was uninsured. The state I live in is NOT a no-fault state so just an fyi. Police were called but would not file a police report yada yada, the uninsured driver is willing to pay for damages (trust game starts now) if my friend gets an estimate from a shop and they go from there. No money was exchanged on scene and both parties have driven off so this a question of what to follow up on if the deal goes sour.

This got me thinking since I've never had an accident where there was a driver with no insurance. From what I've looked up and understand, the only thing you can do after is follow a law suit. 

- What are the chances of winning a case of an uninsured driver (who is at fault) vs. an insured driver, considering it'll probably be just words against words?

(Plates/damages/IDs/Names were taken. btw)

- Is there anything I'm missing? What other routes can my friend go and what should I do in a situation like this?

Thanks.

128,"I'm at a bit of an indecision here regarding possible living situations for the following school year. A week ago I got accepted into a university I've been meaning to go to with the intention of living in the dorms and whatnot...and now I'm starting to get massive cold feet due to the huge costs that come with it. 

At the moment, I have three options; 1) Continue living with my parents for the next two years and attend the local university until I get my bachelor's degree, 2) Move into the dorms for the next two years and take the extra debt, or 3) Move to the city with my first choice university...but stay with my grandparents in their aging house (who at the moment also have to deal with my aunt and her teenage daughter living with them). I have until tomorrow to decide what it is I want to do

I really wanted to go out and try out the ""college experience""; thing is I can't drive and have an awful amount of social anxiety (to the point where I didn't really talk to anyone in high school. I'm better about it now, but elements of that still kind of linger) so to be honest I don't even know who I'm kidding there. I'm probably gonna end up paying $5k just to lock myself in my dorm, leading to a possible $20-$25k student loan for the year. I do have *some* scholarships and grants from FAFSA and whatnot...but that only covers about $4k.

To be quite honest, I'd much rather stay living with my parents than live at my grandparents...and I really don't want to stay stuck in this city for another two years (which to be quite honest sounds *really* fucking entitled, but that's ultimately how I feel about it)

Either way, I will end up moving out of whatever city I go to within the next two years to attend whatever law school/post-graduate school is willing to accept me; so that's gonna be *even more* debt to consider on top of all that.

Thank you in advance to whoever reads this and is willing to reply. This is all just kind of pointless, entitled whining in the grand scheme of things but I've kind of been losing sleep over it for the past few days",13May2017,1

I am wanting to get into exercising again like I used to do because I want to become more fit, and gain confidence. However, I am deathly afraid to.

One reason I'm scared is because of other people. I've been scared of what people think of me for all of my life, and it's been taking a toll on my confidence. I've slowly became more awkward because I don't really talk and hang out with anybody, except for people who are extremely racist, only care about themselves and try to make me the laughing stock of the group, which also took a toll on my confidence.

Another reason is because of people (particularly girls) using me for my body. This is the sole reason why I stopped working out, is because of a couple bad relationships, with the girls into me for my body, and not who I am.

- Used normal body creams
- Use creams prescribed by doctors
- Rubbed apple cider vinegar on my legs
- Bathed in Apple cider vinegar
-Switched my detergent to a more sensitive skin baby friendly one
- Stopped using fabric softener and tried different kinds
- Washed my clothes more often
- Drank more water
- Used different kinds of body washes, including eczema body washes
- Switched shaving creams, used conditioner as a shaving cream, stopped shaving for two weeks
- Taken skin allergic reaction pills
- Tried wearing different kinds of clothes (100% cotton, 100% polyester, combinations)

No matter how much i try to get women to be interested in me, there seems to always be something that pushes them away or makes them not even be interested in me.

Im starting to feel like there might be something wrong with me... Even though 19 is not that old, i still feel like someone should have had a crush on me atleast, but alas, that moment has yet to come :c

163,"I can't say that I've ever given too many shits about my father. He's around, he and my mother are still together and this year will be 31 years of marriage. I'm 26, and still have to live with my folks because it's simply too expensive to move out, and I have not as of yet been able to find someone to be my roommate. 

The problem is that my dad is really... touched. Stupid, even. Delusional. Alcoholic. Literally all he drinks is  alcoholic beverages. He recently started working about after being unemployed for 10 months, and during that period he was at home, drinking. He also took my car during this period, and would fetch me from work in the afternoons, all while swerving all over the road because he was plastered. He's always been a drinker, but lately it's worse. 

The amount of time he spends sober during the day is only when he's at work. The literal first thing he does in the afternoons when he gets home is pour himself a vodka and sprite (zero). And on this past Thursday and Friday he took off work to be home, drinking. 

Last weekend my mother got into a fight with him because all he does on the weekends is drink and sleep, drink and sleep. It's come to the point where if they're planning on going somewhere for the weekend, they cancel because he's passed out drunk and is unable to be roused. 

They've had words many times about his alcohol abuse, and always he denies being an alcoholic (obviously) and is just like ""well I drink because I like it"". 

And today, he hasn't even eaten anything, and was drunk by about 10am already. He's somewhat overweight, and even though we've told him that he's not losing weight because his body is literally fighting to metabolise alcohol and nothing else, so now he's eating less than a fucking anorexic person and is only drinking alcohol. He doesn't *want* to make the connection that he's staying fat because of the booze, and straight up denies scientific fact so that he can continue poisoning himself. 

But the thing is... I don't know if I even care anymore. He's 55 now and probably won't see 60, because his health isn't where it should be and he'll probably have a heart attack at some point and won't be able to get through it. But... meh. I'll be sad for my mother's sake, because I have no rapport with my dad that is worth a damn. 

And he's too argumentative to the point of physically attacking someone to even attempt an intervention. He's delusional enough that he'll think we're trying to take control of his life, that we have it in for him somehow. And last year he even attacked me over an email I sent him just telling him that I didn't have time to chat with him while at work. He only read it much later in the day when I was already home, and he went off at me. 

Now, as a 26 year old man, I really don't need this shit. But I don't know what to do about it, either. I can't afford to move out, he's not willing to acknowledge he has a problem and it's negatively affecting his family, and my poor mom is stuck in the middle.

I am basically a 23 year old person who is at university in his last year studying psychology and right now feels like he is having trouble letting go of his past and at the same time, I feel like my past is the guarantee of my future. I feel like it is already too late for me to be what I wish to become. I feel like that it will take forever for me to become what I want to be.

I know that I am going all over the place. My apologies. This is a VERY long and VERY complicated story and I am known to an over-thinker. Heck, I am known to be THE over thinker. Seriously, if I think of something, I will not stop. Heck, I have a mind that is on constant overload.

I think of things from the holistic point of view, reductionist point of view (mostly), multiple perspectives, left, right, up, down, diagonally, all around ... you fucking name it. If you mention it, you bet that it popped up in my head.

I am someone who has poor social skills, meaning I often find it hard to understand others and most of my studies involve understanding others and I feel like I have very high expectations based on my age and the current situation that I am in but I feel like it is too late and I feel like my future is fucked. I feel afraid of my future and I feel that all my struggles in my past was all for nothing. It is like I was doomed before I was born. I know that I am 23 meaning it is the time when I get to learn the real world but I am 23 years old ... I had an entire life to prepare myself for the world out there but I was too busy fighting against myself or feeling sorry for myself but life decided to throw shit at me constantly. And it makes it worse with a fucked-up mind like mine. I feel like its puppet. I don't feel like I am the one who is in control.

And not to mention the sheer buttload amount of mistakes that I made. I made plenty of foolish and stupid mistakes. I don't like myself for trying hard to be someone better but failed constantly and making an ass of myself. Turning myself into a joke

I feel like I am surrounded by sharks. I feel like I cannot trust anyone. I do not feel safe or feel like I can be able to become what I want to be without fear of being exposed or taken advantage of. I feel like I am in some gladaitor match against my will

If you are seeing a pattern here, I focus a lot on my academics or anything involving smartness .. which I often fail and feel like giving up before trying. I feel like I am trying to be someone what I am not.


I tried to do this as short as possible and not leave anything out but if I did that, I will be writing forever.

So again, I should apologise for the long post but highly humble ask you to read this and do take your time.

____________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________


So, I’ll try to write as short as simple and as simple as possible because it is a very long story and I am not willing to bore anyone.

So basically I am a person who had a ... not-so-nice life. 

I am someone who 

-	had to go through 5 years of bullying *(age 11 to age 15, though it was from age 13 when it was really getting serious)* which had an effect on how I saw myself as a person deep down. I felt inferior and weak and full of self-hate and anger.

-	after that, I had to endure an eating disorder for around 3 years *(Anorexia Nervosa from age 16. The disorder was “over” at age 18/19 but the mentality and the compulsion were still there for a few years later till age 21 approx.)*. To this day, I regret it because I feel like it was my fault that I let it happen. I know that there were factors that made me susceptible to that disease because I desired control after what happened to me in my bullying days but ... I feel guilty, especially that it had a lot of effect on my family *(and the fact that I am a male. It is rare for people to think that even males can have eating disorders. And also the fact that it is an eating disorder – during that time, the silent stigma against mental disorders was kinda more popular. Well, not really. It’s just that here where I live, the subject on mental health is rarely talked about)*

-	I had endured a “rough” upbringing. I had a mother *(who was mostly the alpha)* who put a lot of pressure on me on my studies. So that I won’t make this very long, she was someone who had issues of her own – often had trouble with her job, came from a background where she felt like a failure or a disappointment, so she mostly put her frustrations on me and put a lot of pressure on me on my studies to find a good job in the future so that I won’t do the same mistakes that she did. Anyway, when I had the eating disorder, it had an effect on her and my family. She became more and more frustrated and angry and she was becoming increasingly abusive. It had, even more, effect on me and my development and how I saw myself. I feel like the black sheep of the family and she constantly projected her frustrations on me *(I think that she has depression and borderline personality disorder because of her emotionally and psychologically manipulative parenting)*. She was very hard to co-operate with because we do not see eye to eye because we are two generations apart and she sees things her way and her parenting was not always the most nurturing. Like she often used fear tactics to put some sense into me to study *(it was a time where I found it very hard to study because I was full of anger and I was treated as the nerd when I was bullied and when I internalised it, I found it very hard to study because I felt that I was becoming what I was bullied for. Sometimes to this day I find it hard)* and she is very rigid. Basically, you cannot co-operate with her and her way is always her way and because of that, I see her more as an enemy than a mother. *(bear in mind that I keep mentioning my mother because she had a LARGE impact in my life. She was the alpha and the family environment was probably the only social environment that I ever interacted with for almost 10 years. I had interactions with other people but not that meaningful. No friends. Barely any contacts. I felt like a recluse for almost 10 years ... well, 5 to 10 years because during my bullying days, social interactions were there. Just not the good kind)*. Anyway, we fought **A LOT!!**. We often beat up each other *(though I mostly wanted to hold back because I did not want to become like her. Though sometimes I held back because I eventually went into a state of learned helplessness because I was the kid and I had no power and I was dependent on my parents and I had nowhere to go and some therapists that I went to were not always so helpful. They mostly picked my parent’s side because I guess everyone falls for the crying mother. I guess not many people question the unconscious bias that the mother is always right or the female is always emotional and nurturing or the damsel in distress, no matter whether her actions are questionable or even moral. I guess some people do not question that when parents scold their kids, it was always discipline)*

-	I managed to avoid a sexual assault ... kinda *(I was 19 if I recall correctly)*. I somehow befriended someone who was much older than I am *(he looked like someone in his 60s)* and thought that he was a friendly man. During that time, I was someone who was extremely lonely and desperately wanted a friend. During that time, you can say that it was like someone in an apocalypse or someone lost in the desert. Meeting or befriending someone felt like hope. But ... he looked at me funny and touched me funny. He never forced me and there was no penetration but it felt uncomfortable and I regret it. Sometimes to this day, I have those feelings of extreme discomfort. They sometimes come without warning or sometimes because a dirty thought popped up in my head and made me **VERY** comfortable

-	I used drugs and alcohol to self-medicate myself and also for self-harm *(I was around 21 at the time)*. It only happened for a few months and only used medical drugs *(only paracetamol)* but I was in a time where I felt very angry at myself. I felt a lot of guilt and shame. I felt that I should do something to myself but at the same time, I really wanted to hurt myself too *(sometimes I even hit myself on my temples and had explosive anger and was impulsive)*. I was very, very angry at myself.


__________________________________________



Right now I am in a process where I am looking back at myself and I am having trouble forgiving myself or letting go.

Facing my own inner demons is one thing but facing the past, facing something that I can never change or alter is another.

You see, I am someone who ever since he was young had expectations. A lot of expectations. Most of them were academic. Good grades. Being highly intelligent and study a lot.

I internalised it and it stayed. I am not sure why *(maybe it was because of my upbringing like I mentioned earlier or maybe because it was something I wanted to become. My ideal self, as I learned in psychology because I often idolised people who were high up. Like Batman when I was young who had 11 Masters degrees in the comics, or Einstein who is the archetype genius  with an IQ score of 160+, or even the characters I play in video games who go through all of those obstacles and enemies and overcome unbelievable roadblocks to become the iconic protagonist that they are)*

Anyway, there are a lot of backlashes.

-	 It was very stressful *(like I said earlier, my mother used a lot of fear tactics to make study which is not an effective parenting method but like I said, her way is her way. No questions and since I was young and her mother, I had no other choice because she was the one in power)*. I received a lot of criticism as well. Well, most of them but the criticism was the one that got stuck with me

-	I was treated as the nerd which I **HEAVILY** disliked because it made me feel unloved and alien and for years it stayed and I was not able to study or even think at my optimal level. So for ten years, I tried to be the opposite that I was treated as and it was not very good for my studying and my grades

-	I often felt “distracted” with my traumas getting in the way and affecting how I saw myself and had a lot of pressure and also ... the anger. A lot of anger. 

-	Oh, and I almost forgot ... depression. It would seem that I developed major depressive disorder when I was a teenager *(probably because of the bullying)* and I kept going deeper down that hole for almost 10 years and I did not realise that it was depression because it was very insidious *(well, I kinda was aware but depression can be very manipulative and also, the stigma and the apathy and resenting  behaviour that the depression made me do was very powerful)*. 


-	Oh, and the treatment that I got as well. My mother often made comparisons. A lot of comparisons which made me feel very inferior so I developed a core belief that was stuck with me for years that whatever I do, I can never do it well or right so often gave up before even trying or not doing it right. Heck, I often remember when I tried to study and I was often in a state of high ambivalence. I was more busy trying to fight against my own head than prioritising on my attention on my books. I was not able to speak out about this because I was afraid of judgement.

__________________________________________________________________


I’ll try to put the way that you can understand. *(most of it as about my depression, at least how I see it right now and I feel that I allowed myself to go deeper and deeper into a hellhole which I believe that I was the one who did it)* 

Imagine you are going through a neurodegenerative disorder for 10 years and but since it is an invisible disease, you are surrounded by stigma which hinders your ability to speak out

So you go through 10 years of going deeper into that hole that you built without even being aware of it and by the time you reached your tenth years, that neurodegenerative disorder, like an invisible devil inside your head, has you by the balls in every single way possible

Try to imagine fighting against an invisible demon that you slowly accepted in your life and knows your every single pattern of thought and can turn it against you in every way possible
it's kinda like being a victim of mind control or brainwashing without being fully aware of it
you feel me?
trying to master your mind while the mind had 10 years of mastering you
and the worst part is that it is invisible and you thought it was a part of you. like a cancer that become a part of your body and soul and mind holistically
You feel me?

Now try to imagine the burden or the shame you feel that you let it have you by all of its strings for 10 years and let it dictate your every move, thought, feeling and so on.

Not to mention how much it affected my studies

________________________________________

Anyway, I am right now with a very, very **VEERRYY** manipulative and very self-critical mind. Like seriously, it will not stop bullying me ever

And right now, I feel like I am on the losing side. Well, to be honest, I felt like that for 10 years.

Right now, I am at university – in a school setting where I have to use my brain to the next level and where my expectations are high. Heck, right now, I still feel **EXTREMELY** ashamed of the mistakes that I made in my earlier years at university because I was not at the right state of mind. To this day, whenever I make a mistake, I feel like I shamed the gods

And right now, I don’t think that I have what it takes.

I feel like everything is against me and I feel like that whatever happened to me so far was my fault. My psychiatrist lately told me that I am a brave man for coming out to seek help but I do not see myself that way. If I was a brave man, I could have stood up to the bullies or my parents or even stood up my own mind. 

I feel like it was all my fault what happened. Like the bullying or the eating disorder which later made my mother turn into a monster. 

I do feel that I should have done better. A lot better. If I did, maybe right now I feel like I am in a much better position.

Maybe I could have had a better mind, a brighter mind and even better grades. 

I know that right now I should focus on the here and now but  .... I am not really sure how to put this but I feel like I am trying to be something that I am not.

I am focusing on my studies and right now I feel more “in control” so to speak. My mind is telling me “Now you are in control? What about when you were 15? Look at your grades. Does that look like the grades of a brilliant mind?”

10 years is a long time. it's worse when you believe that all that you have tried was for nothing or whatever happened in your life was your fault

If I am here and still fighting against my head, is it because I have let it or because I had things against me that made me susceptible to it? I know that people who already have a clear vision of what they want is a possibility because of good support, decent upbringing and perhaps even decent background like coming from a high social status or well-adjusted parents with a lot of wisdom and knowledge. I know that I had factors that were against me.
Though I do feel like this
If I was told to be up there, to be at high levels, if I was expected to be there, then ... if I am at this position where I am now, is it because I don’t have what it takes? I feel like I am a pathetic person walking among giants and geniuses and my past shows.

I feel like my past is my staple of my future. I feel like because I was not able to do it well when I was younger, I don’t like I can do it better right now or even in the future.

I feel like I am a person who has a eugenics type of philosophy – the weak ones must die and the strong ones must survive. I am one of the weak ones. I feel like I was born weak and will stay weak till I die. So am I still here? Why am I trying to be someone that I am not? Someone great or someone brilliant? 

______________________

How can I .... let go? How can I be able to of my past or perhaps see it in a more positive aspect? Perhaps I can see it from a more constructive view? Like a build up, so to speak?

I may not have been a person with a good background or a good build up for when I become an independent adult but ... maybe I can see my past and my troubles from a more positive view? Learning from mistakes? 

How can I forgive myself and be able to forgive myself for not fulfilling expectations?

186,"My husband had a nasty divorce. He left the marriage with literally just his clothes, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. His ex wife was the cliche horror story military spouse, who had lots of fun with his identity while he was deployed. In the event of their split, she had always promised to never take their daughter from him. He ended up staying in that relationship for five years too long, I assuming because deep down he knew it was all a bold faced lie. 


It's been four years since he's seen his daughter. She was six when his ex took her back stateside (they had been stationed in Germany at the time of the split). About three since he's spoken to her. And every time he tried after that, his ex claimed that his daughter had no interest in speaking to him. The ex was adamant that she wasn't going to force her to talk either. He even tried contacting his former mother in law, whenever he knew his daughter was staying with her. Two weeks after he did that, the woman's home phone was suddenly disconnected and the ex refused to tell us her mother's new cell number. The last contact we had from the ex was an email in Jan of 2015 that stated ""do not contact us again or else...."". So we stopped trying. 


He was taken to court for child support in 2014. He provided everything he could. Tax forms, bank statements, all of it, proving that he had been paying her (and quite substantially) during the remainder of his time in service. His ex was given three chances to provide the same documentation for her side of things, and failed to do so. The court dismissed the case but warned my husband that she could reopen the case anytime until his daughter was 18. 


After the divorce, my husband had to file bankruptcy. It's been about two years since that went through. He went back to school and got himself a degree. Within the last three months, he got himself a stable decent paying job. He and I have also had two kids of our own. While we would've loved to have gone for custody sooner and even started paying support, we're probably only just now stabilizing. 


But now his ex has contacted us, through my husband's mother, about giving up his parental rights. Since he ""chose"" to walk out and ""hasn't tried to make contact"", she wants her new fiancée to adopt his daughter and for the girl to take this new guy's last name. When it comes to custody I understand that it boils down to what's best for the child. But in this case, what IS best?


My husband is truly heartbroken and has been on the verge of tears since his mother passed on the message. This girl's baby pictures are up all over our walls. It's not that he hasn't wanted to see her. He loves her dearly. We couldn't afford a lawyer to even try and fight. And her mother......her mother is quite simply one of the most evil manipulative vile women I've ever met. We have no doubt that for the last few years, the poor girl has been fed ""well daddy didn't want you anymore"" and ""daddy has his own babies now."" 


So do we fight now, and reinsert her real dad back into her life? Or should my husband just give in and let this new guy take over?",13May2017,1
189,"So I recently rated my apartment complex negatively online. We live in an expensive, high class area that's known for being safe and clean. Yet this place is a mess: dog crap everywhere, roaches, ancient appliances, noisy rude neighbors the staff won't address, etc. So yeah, I gave them a poor review anonymously online. What then happened was one of the staff contacted us, calling us out on it being our review (though we never actually admitted it) and trying to guilt us by saying that, I kid you not, it hurt their feelings. Perhaps I'm too big into virtue and all that, but this was the worst offense of all, trying to get the review changed by calling us out on it. I'm wondering if we should contact the sites and inform them of this?",13May2017,12
201,"So I'm nearing 30, still live at home and am miserable at work. It's not a dead end job, but it's just a sales job I absolutely cannot stand and my performance at work is suffering because I just can't find motivation to come to work and work hard everyday. I go through waves of being interested an trying hard, but being a sales a manager just isn't my thing. 

I already have a bachelors in criminal justice, but decided against going into law enforcement due to just losing interest early on and after interning. I pigeon holed myself into essentially getting a degree I don't want, and working in an industry I don't like. I've been applying to other jobs as well but haven't gotten any substantial bites. I make good money. Enough to chip away at student loans and live comfortably.

But since what I've realized what I enjoy doing later in life is actually doing creative work I decided to take a stab at going back to grad school and getting my degree in digital marketing. The only catch is the only school I got into is one far away. I would essentially have to uproot my life go back to school and take on more debt without the promise of a career after I graduated. Sell my car, defer my loans, take out another, etc. The saving grace is I have friends where I got accepted and I feel like it would be good for me to get away for a little while and start over. 

I've already written out a pros and cons. They're pretty even. I just need some random strangers perspectives to let me know if I should go away or stay and deal with it. Any and al advice is welcome. If I left anything out just ask. Thanks guys. ",13May2017,1
202,"We became friends a bit over half a year ago. She had this amzing personality which alowed me to be able to talk to her, which for me is quite rare. Most of the times i can not really talk for an extended period with somebody. I have been bullied 7 years ago and i have dealt with that in a pretty unhealthy way. Making me pretty shy and not feeling comfortable around anybody. Except her. 

She became the only person i really talked to. She was exactly who i needed. She helped me partly over the dead of my best friend. She became some sort of starting point to trust people again. 

Sadly enough i fell in love with her. She has a boyfriend, but i still told her. Not because i thought she would choose for me or something, but because she deserved to know the truth. Well, she had to draw a line, so we are no friends anymore.

It has been over 3 weeks, and it still hurts so much. For the first time i felt like i wasn't completely alone. Now that she is gone i just feel all alone again. I feel lost and empty. I seem to get obsessed with suicide options in my head. I dont know if i would. I think not. I just hate myself for this all. I know it sounds idiotic to be so moved by losing a friend, but i think it is more a rebound of all my former experiences.",13May2017,1
205,"hi everyone! hope y'all are having a great day!

206,My [21F] partner [28M] is thinking about going on a lads holiday. Is it normal for me to feel bothered about it? we've been together 2 years and have 2 small children together.

I've just finished How I Met Your Mother, and to give you some idea, the previous shows I've watched are Friends, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Leverage, Limitless, White Collar, Lost, 24, Rick and Morty, and Cheers.

219,"I am working with a Debt Collection agency to pay back a phone bill and I had a payment scheduled April 19th and I was ready to make that payment (It's a one time faith payment to ensure Im working with them) and it's now May 13th and they still haven't pulled the money for it. I am seriously worried it will just come out randomly and put me in the negative if im unprepared. Legally, im not sure if they can just pull it out randomly seeing as I only authorized that April 19th payment. I could really use some legal advice or tips on handling this.

Also, I cannot get ahold of them to ask about it, the number they called me on doesnt link to an operator or anything.",13May2017,1
221,"I'm a black woman. I was molested from age 2-10 by a family member. I'm 20 now, and I haven't had sex yet but I've finally started being somewhat interested in men. I've noticed that I tend to automatically dismiss/avoid men of a certain skin shade, which happens to be the same shade of my abuser. I feel horrible because of it, I don't want to go to therapy (broke college student) but I would really appreciate any advice on changing it. I'm well aware every man of a certain color won't hurt me, but I've been leaning towards white men since I can remember and that just doesn't sit right with me.
