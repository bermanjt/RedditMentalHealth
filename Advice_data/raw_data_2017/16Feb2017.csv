But tonight I found people reselling the tickets and she's decided that I can't go. I'm so upset, me and my friend were really looking forward to it. She ruins everything, I've been so excited and she chooses today to ruin things. Her reasoning is that the venue is too far away and I would get back too late which is fair enough but why not tell me that before? Ugh I don't know what to do, I'm so frustrated.

15,We have a schedule that's comes weekly and it's subject to change. This week though my boss requested that I come in early so they can leave. However they are not actually allowed to leave and boss has told me that if work found out they would be fired. Obviously they are trying to work around the system but what can I do to cover myself? Is it reasonable to ask for boss to physically sign off on the schedule as proof just incase or have them write something up? Can I decline because it's going against the company or if it happens again?,16Feb2017,1

21,"So yesterday, I bought a lot of things at a big box office store. The older woman at the cash was a sweetheart, pushy about their protection plan, but overall nice.

However, she wouldn't let me finish the transaction without putting in my email. I was on company time, and I did not want to put my email in, as it's really long and we were talking two languages anyways. Too complicated.

She said I **had** to give it to her, and swore that it wasn't for their spam list. I could clearly read on the computer that it was, so I said that and continued to refuse, but she wouldn't pass my transaction until I entered it in.

I live in Canada where we have extremely strict spam laws, and personally, I felt really sour about the encounter. I sent a little polite email to the main company (especially since she *was* a nice employee), but didn't hear back (duh).

Now... I'm getting their damn emails.

I'm really annoyed by this, I feel like it was really deceptive of her and I want to maybe speak to the manager about that. But then, I also don't want her to lose her job because of me, just maybe realise that they could totally get fined big time if she's not careful. (Not by me.)

**TL;DR?** An cashier coerced me into giving my email, and lied saying it was obligatory and not for email spam. It *was* for email spam, and now I feel like I should bring it up but don't want to get her fired. 

I sincerely believe she probably didn't realise it was a big deal, but my country has strict laws on spam too.",16Feb2017,1

25,"Hello, i am 13 years old and i go to seventh grade (i dont know about your country but where i live we go to highschool after eighth) and i am very intrested and very good at math, computers and programming. I wont get into details about that because it is not the point of this post.
So the school where i am planning to go requires lots of ""points"" i counted that it reqiures as most of highschools (good grades in history, croatian(my country), math and basic classes like that) BUT NO it requires As from math (that i have) croatian (achiveable) and chemistry and physics. Now i am really good in physics (im not bragging or anything,there are ton of stuff im very bad at) but we have one of most srewed up professors in basically all seventh grades. Its extremely hard to get an A at her class and only one kid in 6 classes she teaches has an A. Chemistry is currently a b like physics. So my question is: is there a workaround to get into good informatics school without having A from physics and chemistry. I am 100 percent sure i want to go there and that i can handle it! My informatics profesor was basically too lazy to get our school into competetion and whoever gets into finale is getting bunch of ""points"" for highschool. I am planning to ask my math teacher to apply me for some competetion in hope i can maybe get some points from there. But in meanwhile do you guys have any advices on earning extra points to get into good math school? Maybe if there are some activities that could earn me some extra points or anything?

26,"I just got home from the Verizon store after spending an hour with an associate who helped me upgrade to an iPhone 7 plus. As a young female college student getting ready to graduate, I was stressing out over job applications and happened to break my phone today beyond repair.

He was an overall nice guy and I felt the need to make conversation with him as he helped me through the process of paying and setting up my new phone. I asked him about the Jet Black option and he ran to the back to grab his personal phone to show me which convinced me to go with that option.

After we unboxed it, he handed the phone over for me to enter in my iCloud information. I was struggling to remember the email and password combination but finally got it after a few minutes. He ran to the back room again for a second and came back with a small piece of paper and suggested I write down my iCloud account info + password so I don't forget it. Ok, smart suggestion, so I did.

We then finished up everything after about 10 minutes, and we're putting everything in the small verizon shopping bag when I see him sneak the little paper into his back pocket.

I kinda froze for a second and it hit me that I can't leave the store without getting that paper back. I kindly asked him ""wait where's that little paper with my info..?""

He started looking through the Verizon bag and then patted his pockets before saying ""I think I might have thrown it out hang on"" ... so he ran to the back room. He was in there for what felt like enough time to find the piece of paper if it were actually in the trash, but he definitely did not go to the back room again after I wrote down my information.

He came back out and handed me the crumpled up piece of paper before offering to rip it up for me. I said it was fine and just to toss it in the bag.

I left immediately and walked to my car to change my iCloud password. I'm now on hold with Verizon to report this as this was definitely some sort of violation as well as a breach in my personal security.

I'm wondering if there is anything else I need to do to secure my account information/photos/etc.

I changed my iCloud password immediately and clicked the option to log out of all devices.

My old phone had a completely black screen but it was still on and receiving texts when we were sitting there. Is it possible that even after my iCloud password was changed that this asshole could plug in my phone and download the phone's contents?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.",16Feb2017,1
27,"Hi, 
I am a 24 year old M living in germany. I just got expelled from college because I didn't meet the minimal requirements to go on with my studies. I went to college when I was 18 and switched subjects when I was 20, so I started again. Now it's over and I am kinda relieved that it finally ended because it never felt right for me, but now comes life. 

I have a beautiful girlfriend (2 years) whom I love very much and I am healthy. I live at my parents (they don't know I got expelled yet) so I have a place to sleep and enough to eat for which I am very grateful. That is more than many others will ever have. Writing this I now think that my present actually looks pretty bright, but I am scared shit of the future. I was suicidal when I switched studies at around 20 because I was scared back then as well. It seems like my problem is that I have nothing else to worry about except the future. I am not scared because I won't be having a college degree now, but because the fear of being forced to do something I don't enjoy for the rest of my life just to get up the next day to do it all over again is enormous. The thought scares me to death which I now think is why I was suicidal. Suicide seemed like the better option. Today I think different as I've seem so many people do things they love and live a happy life while doing so. I envy them and I want to be like them. I envy every person who has found their 'calling' in the younger days. I wish I was one of them as I still haven't found it for me.

 
Never had a job nor do I have any qualification to show. I am fluent in german, japanese and my english is ok (or so I hope). Currently developing mobile apps (not being paid yet, still early stages), for which I now will be having more time.

What would you do in my situation? What are the options you would consider? ",16Feb2017,1

29,"I am currently a college sophomore, but my first 3 semesters of college have been fairly rough:

My first semester, when I was rushing a fraternity, and while tailgating (read: drinking) before a football game I was encouraged (read: forced) to drink a solo cup full of vodka. Unsurprisingly, I blacked out; next thing I know, I had escorted out of the stadium and a campus police officer had my fake ID. I was put on disciplinary probation for that.

My second semester, I failed a writing class that was required to gain sophomore standing, so I was put on academic probation over the summer while I took a class to fulfill that requirement.

My third semester, a professor in my Intro French class accused me of plagiarizing part of a 300-word assignment. He thought that the writing quality was too high for someone just starting out learning French. The assignment was to write a short description of a celebrity, I chose someone and looked them up on Wikipedia (both in English and French). As it turns out, two simple sentences in the assignment ended up being the same as in the Wikipedia article—one said the person was a singer-songwriter and the other listed a few awards they had won—and the honor council found me guilty of plagiarism and failed me in the course. As a result, I didn't have enough credits for the semester (there is a requirement to complete 12 credits in a semester) so I was placed on academic probation again.

I am not sure how to explain this on applications for jobs or internships that ask about disciplinary and administrative action. How should I go about doing that?",16Feb2017,1

36,"UPDATE: After considering all of your advice, I've determined it's too risky, she could be a very good con artist. I'm going to wait until I have an offer in hand, let the empire put me up for a week or so, and then scope out places in person myself during that time.

Hi everyone, I could really use some advice. There are a lot of factors, but here is the situation (I'll try to be concise):

I just graduated from college in Michigan. I had a phone interview, an in person interview, and a follow up phone call about a position at a hotel - all of which went incredibly well. The interviewer (who would be my supervisor) has heavily implied that I got the job (I can provide specific examples if you want). During the follow-up call, we were discussing start-dates and relocation services. I asked if this was an official offer and he said ""it's not an official offer yet, I still need to draft the documents and get the higher-ups to sign-off on a few things first, but it's very promising."" Then he and I scheduled another phone call for next week (Wednesday the 22nd at 11am- he made a point to say that he was putting it in his calendar at that moment) with me, because that is when he will have all the information needed to go forward... All of this makes me feel like I can count on getting this job. That said, I can't be completely confidant in that because it still isn't in writing.

Which brings me to the next factor concerning a lease.

On craigslist, I found a room for rent in an apartment that is shared by a journalist/writer and other young female grad students/young professionals/interns etc. I am female for the record. The apartment is in my budget (the high end of my budget, but still in it) AND IT IS WALKING DISTANCE TO THE HOTEL WHERE I AM PROBABLY GOING TO WORK! The bedroom is small, but that's totally fine for me because it's so close to work, in a safe neighborhood, near one of my friends in the city, etc. It's basically perfect.

But since I'm in Michigan I can't go view it for myself, which is concerning. So I asked the Journalist if she'd mind if I sent a friend to tour it/meet her on my behalf. She said that would be great! She's away visiting her mom right now, but near the end of this month she'll be back and can make time to meet with my friend. We have also talked on the phone, communicated via her work email, and also over whatsapp.

Today when I reiterated to her that I was VERY keen to rent the room in her place, she said she'd ""love to have me but full disclosure, there are two other students who are interested in the apartment.""

Now, I know apartments in NYC get snatched up in the blink of an eye. But, she is understanding that I am nervous about sending a deposit for an apartment sight unseen to a person I haven't met. So to verify her identity and credentials she sent me a photos of two of her old drivers licences, the credit card tied to the bank account where I would have my bank deposit rent if I decided to sign, a bill of her name and address on a Time Warner Cable statement, a bill from The New York Times addressed to her, she added me on linked in, and has a twitter, and I also found a radio podcast of her as a guest-which definitely matches her voice.

I googled her name, her phone number, her email address, and so far everything aligns with who she says she is. So I talked with my entire family about it, and told her that I am definitely interested in the apartment.

She emailed me a draft of the lease terms, etc. Now all I have to do is sign it, and send 1/2 of the deposit amount to secure the room as mine. (The other half I pay on move in day).

r/Advice, do you think I should trust her? If so, should I send the money ASAP to secure it even though I don't have my job offer in writing?

Or should I risk losing this great apartment waiting for the official job offer?

Do you need more information from me? I'll probably be awake all night fretting over what to do, so just ask and I'll answer everything I know.

Thanks all. :)",16Feb2017,1
37,"Ok, I know this day and age teeth are very important. Obviously, they have always been important. But I have some very very fucked up teeth and I have no idea what to do. They aren't just yellow, I have at least 2 or 3 rotting ones and a few that have just fallen out. I know this is bad and I'm probably going to get a lot of shit over it, but let me explain. From a young age it was never instilled in me that I NEEDED to brush my teeth. My parents always told me ""Oh they'll be fine."" or ""We'll get you toothpaste next time we go to the store."" So I slowly just stopped using it and brushing them all together. I never noticed that my teeth were that bad either, and my friends never said anything to me. I also thought that they naturally stayed white and would straighten on their own. Well I was wrong. It really affects me in day to day life, like I hate to smile because my teeth are so so ugly.

38,"My sister was in art class last week and two guys that weren't normally in the class came in. She left her phone sitting on a table behind her, it was stolen, presumably by the two strangers.

My sister refuses to involve the teachers at this point because ""I don't want to get punched over a phone"". I sincerely doubt this is an actual problem but regardless, that's where we're at. 


The person who knows who stole it has a facebook account open to the public with 164 friends so I tried to get her to go through the list and see if she recognized one of the strangers but after I suggested just telling this guy's mother she ran away. I intend to try to get her to do it again later with the hope that we can deal directly with the person who stole it, maybe without them finding out that my sister had anything to do with it at all. Since she only saw the person who stole it once I'm not very hopeful, I'd like any and all advice on how to deal with this. ",16Feb2017,2

52,"Here's a little background:

I'm in the medical field, I have two certifications that allow me to make great money and continue advancing in my career. I have been in the same job for 3 years and I love it. In a basic sense, my job can be titled as a doctor's assistant. I work for two doctors, there are only two assistants, myself and my coworker.

Like most medical settings; cleanliness is  crucial. I'd also like to think that punctuality and professionalism is also important in keeping your job...

Well..for about a year now my coworker (who was hired off the street with no previous experience) has been the laziest person on the face of the earth and she still has a fucking job.

Now, I'm not saying she should be fired. I'm beyond frustrated that she thinks pulling her half of the job means that she can nap, eat, talk on her phone, gossip or surf the web. The office I work in Needs her help but we will not fall apart if she's gone. I work by myself with the doctors often when she calls out. My problem is that she can't seem to get it into her head that work actually means getting off her ass. We use machinery and medical tools on patients that need to be disinfected after each use, she never does this and I was going behind her and cleaning everything because it's gross to have makeup left on a tool and then give it to an 80 year old man to put on his face.. I've caught her sleeping too many times, she makes phone calls on the clock. The list is way too long. I've mentioned to my boss that I'm frustrated that I feel I'm doing all the work and then having to go behind someone and do theirs. So we had a meeting..

Nothing changed, my coworker tried to turn the blame on me accusing me of being bossy. Well, two months after the first meeting the same shit is still happening but worse. She shows up late everyday with fast food breakfast in her hands (if we are late we have to call to avoid a write up) but how many times can a person be late in a month and not get any fucking notice of 'hey there if you continue this you'll be fired'? After bringing up her lack of effort to my boss again I was told she has been talked to but that I don't need to fixate on what she's doing. I was told the doctors have nothing but positive things to say about me. Well that's great, I was aware of my work relationship with the doctors. I'm often told of how well I work and I'm proud because I've worked hard to get here. 

It makes me angry to think that someone not only has the balls to act like my coworker does but that the 'manager' (who is the reception desk manager and never works with me and the doctors) tells me that I shouldn't focus on someone else's job. The thing is, I get blamed if her work is incomplete so that means when say a chart is missing key info and I'm asked about it, if I didn't work with that patient I have to say my coworker did it. That makes me feel like a child. 

I don't know what to do here. I've tried ignoring everything she's doing and just going on about my work but her lack of work flows over into my daily stuff. I can't get away from it. I don't want to leave my job. I can't talk to her about it because she has a terrible attitude.

53,"Two weeks ago while at the grocery store (in Texas), a well dressed older man approached me and commented on my college t-shirt. He seemed friendly enough, and maybe just lonely, so I chatted with him for a while. He asked questions about my education, my job, my personal life, and ended the conversation by asking for my name. I gave him my first name and he asked for my last. I gave it to him, but instantly felt stupid for doing so. Other than that, the conversation felt natural and two-sided, so I wasn't too concerned. I left the store and forgot all about it.
This evening, my girlfriend and I were at the same store. I noticed the man was there again, this time talking to another guy my age about his job. He asked him the same questions, and ended the conversation by asking for his first...and last name. Just like me, the guy gave it to him.
A few minutes later, we were on our way out and the man approached us. He didn't seem to remember me and started up a conversation with my girlfriend. He then proceeded to start asking us the EXACT same questions. My girlfriend was friendly to him, as she didn't know the backstory, but I was pretty cold and that got him to leave quickly.
All of this seems very familiar to a recent encounter with a too-friendly man we ran into at a yogurt shop. He had a ton of questions and wanted to talk all day- then my girlfriend was notified of $300 fraudulent credit card chard a few miles down the road within 24 hours.

I told her it was Anthony and she was over it, but I said that I wished she could trust me more and not think I might be texting another girl right next to her. She said she trusted me entirely but that feelings could change and I could want to be with another girl any day. In my opinion, her believing that means she doesn't trust me fully and I told her that she has to trust that if there was another girl (unlikely) that I would be upfront with her about it and not talk to that girl behind her back.

72,"To clarify, he gave me strep throat AND he didn't tell me about it until now, the very last day of his course of antibiotics. 


After fooling around and lots of kissing he told me he was worried he had strep throat. I was feeling relatively okay, but I made a plan to go to the clinic the next day. He said he was also going to his doctor to see what was up. They give you a swab to check and see if you have it, then you get on a course of antibiotics. 


The day I was supposed to go to the clinic there was a terrible ice storm so I decided not to risk it. I asked him how his doctor visit was, and I remember he never really answered me exactly, but he mentioned he was feeling better and that he wasn't positive it was strep throat, probably just a cold. 


I worked literally EVERY DAY since. I work 2 jobs and I have a placement as well. So since he sort of reassured me it might not be strep, and since I've been really busy I didn't bother, going in to the clinic, which in itself is like pulling teeth. It opens when I start my serving job (5pm) and you sit and wait for an hour at the least, but sometimes 2 or even 3 for something simple. So I told myself he probably doesn't have strep, so I probably don't. 


Sure enough just tonight, after a week and 2 days has elapsed, he randomly mentions over text ""I take my last antibiotics today!"". I'm like ""WHAT antibiotics?"". So yeah, he went to the doctor and tested positive and has been treating himself all along. Never once mentioned it to me.


I've been feeling up and down over this time. It's not like my throat kills every day, but I have felt feverish a couple days, and I have a dry cough. Some days I have felt off. I just figured I've been working A LOT lately, and the stress is probably dragging my cold on. 


 It is totally my fault that I didn't go get checked out myself at the walk in clinic, but since this guy is lucky enough to have a family doctor and works 4 days a week tops, I'm pissed off that he wouldn't have the decency to mention he gave me strep. 


He told me he didn't want to tell me because he didn't want me to worry. What the fuck is that!? I told him off and cut the conversation short. 


Seriously what is wrong with someone who doesn't even mention they have strep throat when they know for sure they gave it to someone else. I was completely open about not going to the clinic too, so he knows I didn't get myself tested. 


Ok part of this is me ranting but really I'm wondering if I should get over this or move on?


We've been dating for about 2 months. He's sweet and all but this is honestly really shocking to me. I flat out told him ""wouldn't you tell me if you had an STD or if you had ebola or something?"" And he said of course he would. 


**tl:Dr** guy I've been dating gave me strep throat, then told me it might not even be strep throat. I was going to go to the clinic but it was an ice storm so I didn't make it.

74,"Hey, so yeah, as the title says, I'm 22 (23 in August, yikes) and I'm currently a full-time student. Had I gone to college like a normal student, I'd be graduating soon (if not already graduated), but I changed my major after my 4th year because what I was studying wasn't right for me (computer science). I'm now studying geology (and composing my own music as a serious concentration on the side) and I'm happier than I've been in a while. 

I used to work...*a lot*. Since the day after I graduated high school, I worked full-time, and a minimum of 30hrs/week during the semester. Unfortunately, I wracked up student loan debt, as well spent the majority of my money on transportation (one lemon car, and a new one to replace it). I also wasted a lot of my money on stupid things, and I guess you could say I'm learning the hard way now. I quit my job of 3 years back in September and then had temporary part-time employment afterward during the holiday. But since January, I've been unemployed. Plus I blew through all my savings. 

On top of delaying my graduation and having no money or job, I feel trapped still living at home. I remember growing up the *first* thing I wanted to do when I was of age was move out. I don't live in the happiest of households. It's run like a business. My parents don't necessarily love each other and it's as though I live in a massive setup when I'm ""home"". Thing is I live in NY and it's mega expensive here. I've looked around for places and can't afford any, let alone as a full-time student. I've thought of doing school part-time, but that would only delay my graduation even *more* and dealing with depression and having shitty jobs has never suited my mind very well. 

I know I sound picky, I know there's probably two options. But if anyone has any advice or insight, I'd much appreciate it. I'm beginning to consider staying in my car. I just want to escape this pathetic place and these sad people.",16Feb2017,3

I'm terrified to get a job because if I make too much n get kicked off ssi I'm scared my health might get bad again and I will be screwed if I can't work. I definitely would have to move out of my parents home because my income going up will cause the rent to go up n they already need help with the bills.

77,"My friend has been in a relationship with her boyfriend, or I guess fiancee now for 9 years. The last 4 maybe (?) she's voiced some concerns to me regarding him maybe not being the one. They've had a lot of issues, almost broken up, however their comfortable long-term relationship have made it hard to break it off. He has made comments about her weight and given her ultimatums, etc. When it comes to kids I think they disagree about what they want to do. I've told her numerous times to break up with him, I can tell she's not happy. 

However, it gets a little more complex. They've been engaged for a year now, their wedding is set for this summer. She's buried so many of her gut feelings and has taken her mind off things by wedding planning, building a house with him, etc. I know it's all going to fizzle out if she goes through with it and she will be stuck in a harder situation. She even told me that if she takes away the wedding and house and their families and thinks of just the two of them together for the rest of their lives, she is not excited to marry him.

I felt bad even accepting her invite to be in the wedding party because I know it's not going to feel right knowing that she may be making a mistake. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation where their friend has voiced concerns about this, and you know it'd be better for them to step up and just break up with someone? There's a ticking clock and once she's married, it will only get tougher. I just want to give her the best advice possible and be there for her, because I'm one of the only people she's told this to. I want her to ultimately be happy and I'm praying that she can have the courage to go through with it. Obviously it will be the hardest thing she will ever have to do, but I've told her that the money spent on the wedding or the time people have set aside for it mean nothing compared to her happiness and future.

I think he knew something was wrong and asked if I was okay during the sex but I just said it felt great. I truly felt disgusted the entire time and wanted him to stop. Now I've been on edge for a couple of days and I'm scared he will want to have sex again. I'm starting to hate when he touches me anywhere or calls me certain names. He wanted a blowjob and I gave him one and I was able to act fine while doing it but I had a mental breakdown after he left. I don't know how to make my panic attacks stop and I just want us to be happy. 

I don't want to tell him about my past and I can't go to therapy either. What can I do to avoid these triggers and make sure he doesn't sense that something is wrong?

81,"Hi Reddit, first of all I'd like to apologise if I'm posting this in the wrong section but I'm new to using this, I've had an account for like 200 days but never used it before now.

Anyway I'm just posting here as I need some serious advice and I don't know who to turn to. This might sound a little bit ridiculous but I think I'm addicted to being high on weed... I was quite a bright sorta guy until this stuff started taking me over, I can't think straight when I'm off of it and everything gets cloudy in my mind, I sometimes slur my words and struggle to think about the process of a sentence; I'll pause for a second to think about what I'm saying, and then attempt to say it properly, that's just one thing.


I absolutely know I have to stop but I simply just can't, If I've been away from it for 3 days or more I reassure myself I've had enough of a break to justify doing it again. Like 6 months ago I got so stoned I ended up grinding my teeth away (I have this problem with stress anyway as my parents live aboard and I find it hard, I'm a family person) and I've been telling myself to go to the dentist to get it sorted because I swear I'm down to the dentin bit inside the enamel and every time I smoke I swear it wears it away a little more. I've been telling myself to go to the dentist for half a year and haven't bothered yet, and I keep telling myself I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow and never do, I'm making myself more and more worried because I used to be a very active person and I was quite 'switched on' per say. I knew how to deal with situations, nothing really seemed like a hard task to me but now I can't think for shit.


The biggest problem for me is that when I do smoke and get stoned I can think like my old self, everything is a lot clearer and I know how to approach everything properly. I know how to learn easily and I put myself in other people's positions when speaking to them so I know what to say, I listen to myself as well as them, I don't do that sober anymore, I'm on my final written warning in work and I've already fucked up again since then so that's going to be dealt with shortly :/


The only reason I'm writing this as of now is because I've had a smoke tonight and can think like old me, I absolutely know I need help and I just don't know what to do, I've purchased jogging gear to try and make myself fit again to try and get the 'adrenaline' feeling that comes naturally to us all when active, old me used to be active every day of the week and I was basically high on my own bodies natural 'adrenaline' rush all the time and I think that's how I felt better in myself and did more with my life, now all I do is play rocket league and go to work, I don't even give my girlfriend attention anymore...
We're supposed to be moving out soon and I have to get my shit together before I fucking lose my teeth for good, lose my girlfriend, lose my job and fuck my life up forever, I just need some advice on what to do 😞 I've had enough of sober idiot me not being able to function.

89,"TL:DR at the bottom. 

I am a veteran and so is my friend (we'll call him Bob). I exited the military back in late 2015, moved to a city about 350 miles away, and started going to college as a full time student. I am married and my wife and I have 2 daughters. I work while going to school as well. 

Bob got out of the military about 2 weeks ago. He was forced out because of a DUI on the military installation. So it was a short notice type of thing, but he obviously knew it was coming. He didn't have a place to go or a good plan, so I offered for him to come stay with my family and I, while he got a job, got on his feet, and found his own place. He was always known (by myself and others) as the type of guy to always stay busy, and help out anyone at anytime. 

Ever since he got here, he has done nothing but drink all day, everyday. Some days he will get up early and go fishing all day. I've encouraged him to apply for jobs in the area. I've polished his resume. I even submitted his resume to a few companies. He will not try to better himself without me ""leading the way"" for him. If I don't try to push him, he will just drink and do nothing all day. 

The past 2 days, my wife and I have caught him lying. Not big lies that are earth crushing, but small things that wouldn't matter either way. 

This weekend, my wife and I are planning to go to another city to spend some time with one of her childhood friends. Our kids are staying with family. Bob claims he's going to drive about 450 miles away to see his girlfriend. I get the feeling that he's lying and his girlfriend is coming here. I wouldn't care about that but he could just be honest and tell me. I figure he's lying because he's asked what's going on here in town this weekend and how much an Uber costs to get downtown. 

Part of me wants to kick him out of my house but the other part wants to give him another chance and help him. 

Opinions?

TL:DR... Old friend gets out of military. I offer him to stay with my family and I until he gets on his feet and finds a place of his own. He drinks all day, everyday. He won't attempt to get a job. He is lying now about dumb shit. Kick him out or keep trying to help?

94,"I have friends but I just went away for college so in a completely new environment. Doesnt really help that I dont speak their main language either even though they speak English fluently, its not their mother's tongue.

I have always been the introverted person. It was at it's worse at high school when I have 0 self esteem and confidence at all. I was kind of seen as the loser in school, but nobody picked on me - they just dont talk to me.

I have since improve my self esteem and confidence, but it's still low. To improve on that, I started working out, i seen results but not nearly enough, so i ill just work on the gym thing - maybe it will help. Basically, i have low confidence and an introvert who prefers being alone, but that sometimes makes me feel lonely and I want to change that.

One of the MAIN reasons for my low self esteem is due to the fact i consider myself ugly. Some people have even called me out on it to make themselves feel better. But the majority just say I am just average - just the assholes say that I am unattractive to bring me down even more. I know I am just average looking, but I cant shake the fact that I am not good looking or probably never ever will. I just think that nobody ever wants to talk to me because I am ugly (even though I know I am not hideous). This makes me very self concious about my hair and stuff and thus lowers my confidence and self esteem.

I am having a hard time gaining friends at my new college. People dont really talk to me because maybe they see me as the quiet kid. Not nearly as bad as in high school as sometimes i get invited to join them eat and stuff, and I try my best to not be me - to fake confidence, to be energetic and stuff, but I just cant do it, no mater how hard I try, and it just sucks.

I made a couple of friends, but those are all people who are quiet and reserved too. I just found something in common with them and get along. But the more popular kids, even though I sit right next to them everyday, they dont really talk to me and sometimes ignore me in conversations - even though I have something to contribute.

I dont really know what to do. Other than going to the gym to improve my scrawny body to get a lil more self esteem - which works, i gained a little confidence in my body ever since - I dont really know what to do. I need to change. But, I tried, and it doesnt really work out. I never look in a general girl direction because I just think that she will find me unattractive, so why bother?

What pisses me off more is that I swear I have a bottomless stomach and it only fills up when we our out. Yes I'm overweight, I'm 209 pounds as of currently. I would like to be able to watch a quality show without stuffing my ass full of food whenever I do it. I believe I just need to be doing something with my hands and who doesn't love to eat am I right? I've tried eating healthy foods that are long lasting like something I can snack on slowly but, the only near healthy food I can eat like that is fruit. Man do I absolutely love fruit. I would live off of it without a doubt, but the problem is fruit (Especially green grapes) are pretty expensive for someone who makes $50 a week. And even fruit has sugars in it but it's gotta be better than what I currently eat.

I don't even know why I'm posting this, I feel such guilt every time I look in the freezer, but I literally feel like I can't watch a show without currently eating something. What would also be nice is to shrink my stomach because god I swear I can eat more than a damn sumo wrestler. But when I'm going out with family I'll get full from my first 3 bites. I just hope someone out there can help me out here. It's not like being overweight is exactly easy in school and definitely not comfortable. I can workout at a gym 4 times a week with my uncle, but I'm pretty much canceling out that if I eat this much and all the time. Any help or advice is appreciated, thank you

I just want to add that my laziness is good for nothing but being a huge procrastinator. I practically don't do any of my school work. I've been borderline passing all my grades since highschool. And if I wasn't overweight I wouldn't be so lazy, this problem is affecting me on a mental, physical, social, and an educational level. Thank you",16Feb2017,2
106,"So I'm coming here as a reddit novice because I need some help. My summed up story goes like this: I grew up in a well off and put together family. I was always quite smart and athletic  (high school gpa 3.9 and 3 year varsity basketball captain) and a very social person. I went to a local college, got good grades and enjoyed my first year in 2012 and declared my major to be exercise science. My sophomore year also went pretty well. I took 2014 off to join the military and later that year got a medical discharge. Because of my discharge, I decided to return to school but everything began to change. It has been a relatively slow process to get to present day me but things have just slowly gotten worse as time went on, my current state is like this: i know I have become much more introverted and pessimistic than i used to be. I have developed what I believe to be anxiety and recently accepted it and went to the doctor to get medication (which does not seem to help at all). I have slowly gotten into more drugs and worse drugs. I dropped out of school this past fall (2016) and have absolutely no idea of what interests I have or what I want to do for work (also currently unemployed). I feel like I have lost all motivation or drive to improve myself or my life. It is rare for me to leave my home at all these days. I have even created a fake chronic migraine illness so I have an excuse to lay in bed all day alone.  I'm beginning to wonder if I have depression but am still undecided. I feel absolutely terrible because I know the amount my mother is currently worrying about me and stressing over if I will be ok (all she knows is that I dropped out and went to the doctor for anxiety), I keep telling her I'm fine and will figure it out but I am starting to question that myself. 

I apologize for the seemingly random array of thoughts put into sentences, I wrote them down as they came into my head. I am here hoping for advice to help me and hopefully to hear from people that have been in similar situations and how you have made it out of the seeming darkness and improved your life?",16Feb2017,2
109,"Hey there reddit! So I've been needing a car, and my parents told me I could have their old beater. Unfortunately, it's still sitting in Ottawa, and I live in Seattle now. How can I efficiently and cheaply ship it to my new place?

110,"I'm 21 and live at home with my parents.  Recently I matched with and really clicked with this girl that's 17 on tinder and we hit it off pretty well.  We just went on a date and I kept everything quiet from my parents by lying to them about going somewhere.  I don't really have any friends around ere anymore as they chose to go to college far away and I didn't (thus me living at home).

Basically I don't want to tell my parents I'm in my first relationship as it's just something I want to keep private but I can't make up an excuse every time I go on a date (also, they pay my phone bill and see my credit card bill so they would figure it out).  How should I tell them that I'm a) dating a girl for the first time, b) that we met on tinder (they think it's just for hooking up but the two of us are just looking for a real relationship) and c) that she's 3 1/2 years younger than me and in high school (graduating in a few weeks).

I'm not embarrassed that I'm dating someone that younger than me and in high, but it is a significant age gap for a person my age. I'm also not sure how they would handle the fact that she's in high school for a few more weeks and that we met on tinder.

I've always kind of kept to myself and I feel like I shouldn't have to tell my parents about this but they will find out it if I don't tell them.",16Feb2017,1
111,"My girlfriend is way out of my league. She is, without a doubt, the most beautiful person I've ever met. She is so kind, considerate, caring, creative, fun, sweet, everything... etc. She was my first, and only crush in my entire life. She makes me happier than anything else I've ever had in my life before or since then. She is one of a kind, an I would never ever want to lose her ever for anything ever.

My feelings are not one-way. She loves me to no end. In fact, I think she loves me more than anyone else has ever loved me. She  has expressed so many times that there is no other person she'd rather be with, and wants to spend every waking moment by my side. She tells me that I'm the most beautiful guy she ever met, and she is so concerned over how I feel, and can just listen to me talk for hours and hours. Remember how I said I was her first and only crush? Well I was hers too. It's so perfect how it all works out. As of right now, too, I know, for absolute certain, that nobody else will ever feel for me the way she feels.

Except, she shouldn't be wasting her time with me. I'm none of the things she is. I'm not beautiful like she is, I'm not smart, I'm extremely rude and inconsiderate, I have so much trouble remembering basic manners and social rules and how to be a nice or kind or caring person, and it's really so much less than what she deserves out of a guy. I constantly tell her about how I feel, and how she deserves someone better, and that she's just way way too good for me. I sometimes tell her (as heartbreaking as it is for me) that she shouldn't be happy with me, and that I've tricked her into thinking she's happy when really she's not. The one thing she says that makes her unhappy about me is the negative way I talk about myself, but she can't see how i'm just being honest about who I am. The way i talk negatively or say sad things like that she shouldn't be wasting her time with me really upsets her and makes her sad, which, makes me feel so horribly guilty and even worse for everything in the first place. To tell the person I love most that they shouldn't be with me, is one thing, to think about all the ways I've been terrible to them is another, but to make them actually devasted and distraught and sometimes even cry is another. I really really am an awful selfish person for doing all three of those things to her. I wish I could stop or that I was smart enough to learn, but my brain miraculously always find some new way to fuck up and i'm back at square one. keep in mind, I think about how shitty I am and how awful I am for her every day. in fact, almost always.t. I've become such an emotional burden on her just because I can't stop talking about all the bad things I'm doing (while she still thinks I've done little to nothing wrong). On Holidays, especially, I get so worked up for being such a bad boyfriend I've spoiled them by breaking down and telling her what's wrong with me. This includes Christmas, New Years, Anniversary, both our birthdays, and even Valentine's day

This really puts both of us in a Catch-22. Even if she is happy with me as I am, i constantly am selfish and have to go and sour her mood with my negative feelings. She so obviously deserves someone who treats her perfect already, and doesn't do any crying or introduce sadness to them. 

The thing is I'm just too lazy. I'm so rude and selfish; I constantly have to remind myself to think about her. So often I get lazy, and I stop working on things for her, and I think about myself too much, and it really isn't healthy for either of us. I've been realizing recently all the sacrifices she's made for me, and I really am not worthy of any of those at all. I can't satisfy any of her needs, either. She's a very sexual person, but I think I'm just more emotional. I have to constantly act more sexual around her even when I don't always want to be, which is so sad. She really is so attractive, but I can't give her all of her sexual needs naturally. I have to force myself to do them. The other sad thing is that I am not very handsome. If I were to rate myself out of ten, I'd say at best I'm a five and a half, and at worst a three. I don't workout nearly as much as I should to make myself more attractive, and I don't look nearly as beautiful as her.

I do nice things for her, as I think anyone in a relationship should. They're really small things like flowers or badly written poems or I drive to see her by surprise, but they aren't enough to make her say she's ""the happiest girl in the world"" like she claims to be. All these things are standard; any guy lucky enough to have her would go out of their way daily to do these things. I can't help but feel that I've institutionalized abuse into her, that she thinks all the things I've done wrong are okay or to be expected out of a relationship. It's extremely worrying. At this point, I sometimes catch myself thinking that I hope she'll meet a guy as beautiful as she is, and always I hope she comes to her senses as to how unhappy she really is with me.

My real emotional conundrum is this: she says she does not want to breakup and netiher do I. 

But I really really only want what is best for her, and I can't help but feel that maybe she'd be much better off without having to deal with my emotions and my mistreatment; she already has more than fucking enough to deal with on top of me. I'm such a constant source of stress in her life to a point where I doubt happiness can outweigh the negative feelings I give her. Not in the slightest. At this point there is more sad in our relationship than there is happy, and I have no clue why she hasn't left me or why she wants to stay with me, or even has begun to fall out of love or something. Especially after all the terrible things I've done 

I really can't bare the thought of being without her, but, at this point any reason I have to stay in this relationship is completely selfish. Like I said, I know she'd be much happier without having to worry about me, and without me she wouldn't have to deal with having to clear her schedule to see me, or deal with my childish fits of sadness or self-pity, or even have to deal with me treating her like shit ever again.


I'm asking because I really don't know what to do or how to find a way to address all of my feelings to her properly at once. IF we both feel this way about each other, even though I make her life worse, is it worth it?? I feel like her losing me would be like ripping a band-aid off of her in the long-run but I just cant make her sad by doing that, and, I'm just too fucking selfish to breakup myself.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much

115,"They were young and in love and got married/pregnant after two months. Three years together now, she recently went onto his Facebook and discovered he was trading pictures with girls he meets through a private Facebook group. She had a meltdown, called and told me it was over and she was leaving him, when I saw her the next day she said it was not the first time this has happened and she'd also found proof of him physically cheating when she was pregnant. I told her I was supportive and would be there for her and her son as much as I could, but called him a scumbag for doing what he did.

She went home and they didn't talk about it. They just went to bed without speaking. Within the week they were fine, back to having sex, she had an expensive new ring on her finger, and she was pissed at me for the things I said about her husband. She invited me over for a movie night last weekend and when she told me he'd be there, I declined. I'm an unsupportive friend, I'm rude, I'm judgmental, it was a super fun conversation. 

What the hell do I do? I love her, I want nothing to do with her husband, but they seem to be a package deal. Do I just suck it up and pretend I don't hate his guts to be a good friend?

124,"Hello,

I'll keep this pretty short because I tried to get advice last time and it didn't really pan out.

I'm a 20 year old female who goes to a high-tier university in the U.S. I'm in business school but my goal is to switch to econ and work in international development at an institution like World Bank.

Unfortunately, I've had some rough times and trauma and I'm worried that I'm screwed for life because of it.

1. Freshman year, I had trouble fitting in and became really depressed. I ended up writing a suicide note and leaving my dorm to end things. During this time I was reported missing and all the details were on the news, both on TV and in dozons of articles. However, I got lots of notifications and messages and saw the damage that going through with it would do, so I decided to come back. Unfortunately, although I got kind messages of encouragement of support on my phone, they weren't matched in real life. The administration tried to force me into a medical leave (which I refused after much struggle, including having to voluntarily stay in a mental hospital for a week to ease their concerns as well as write an apology essay.) I knew it was a subtle way to get rid of me, so I didn't take the bait, because I would've never been able to come back. I continued my studies and I'm glad I did, but most of the student body stopped talking to me, for reasons I don't understand. I don't think that my experience makes me a bad person or someone scummy, but that's how I've been made to feel. Perhaps they felt awkward, or perhaps it wasn't personal, just a matter of social liability. But either way, it's been a year and to this day, I have few friends and all this shit is still online, linked to my name. I had a really nice boyfriend this fall who accepted me and told me he was committed for the long haul, but then he abruptly dumped me a few weeks ago. This was not encouraging, and I feel like he's almost a metaphorical representation of society's reluctance to accept me for too long. 

2. I was taking a test a few weeks ago and went to the bathroom. In the bathroom, I ended up getting into a conversation that included one topic on the test. The dean walked in and gave me an honor code violation. I suspect this is connected to bitterness about the rejection of the medical leave proposal, but I have no proof of that so I can't raise the issue to them.

3. My grades suffered immensely during that time and afterwards. I have a 3.0 (low for me, considering I had straight A's before) but my transcript is a mess of selective withdrawals. My grades are falling again because I struggle with self esteem and hope. I feel like I could have straight A's and not get a respectable background-checked job because of what happened last year as well as the honor code violation, so it's hard to feel excited for my future. I feel like my identity and name are tarnished, so there's no way for me to really win in the industries I care about. It's hard for people to invest in you if you're linked to stigma. I'm crazy, I'm a risk, I'm a cheater...you name it, the associations are there, etched in writing. And I just don't know how to reclaim my identity and future. 

My teachers have called me intelligent, innovative, and articulate. In my classes, I'm always leading the discussions, and in the internship I had before this stuff happened, I initiated all kinds of research projects that unfortunately were credited to my superiors. But I feel like all the talents I have are a waste, because my identity and reputation were ruined. I want to contribute to positive change in the world and be a high-level professional with international influence, but I'm worried that a lot of avenues are closed to me now.

I absolutely love philosophy, social analysis, economics, and anything developmental. I'd love to be a project manager at a bank, lead an NGO, be a world leader/social analyst, or be a professor at a high-level university. But when I think of my future interviews and applications, all I see is unanswered calls or, if I'm lucky, scrutinizing questions. I don't want my life to be over because of things that happened when I was 19 years old. But I just don't know how to rise past all the red flags. What do I do to make sure my potential isn't wasted?",16Feb2017,3
125,"I used to be friends with this girl, we met online, only meeting once. A few years ago we were looking into romance but it didn't happen, and she ended up with someone else. I then cut her out for a few months then messaged her back, offering friendship. 

For the last year and a bit I've had issues of drinking alone on weekends, getting absolutely tanked. This unfortunately led to two nights when I drunk messaged her nasty, jealous things about her boyfriend. The first time she forgave me, the second not, telling me she was done with me. She blocked me on Facebook as I advised.Last December I tried once more through her Instagram to say I was serious about friendship, stupidly got drunk again and although I didn't say anything nasty she got fed up with the drunk messages themselves. This truly was the last straw.

I've focussed on moving on, new year and all that. The abstinence is mostly good, only caved in two weekends of 2017 so far but working at it. Although she blocked me on Facebook as I advised, and I've deleted my Instagram, one of the roles of my job is to manage my boss's social media accounts. Stupidly this morning, I found my ex-friend's Twitter page and didn't realise I was logged in my boss's account, accidently clicking a like on one of her tweets. I'm at home just now, not in the office.

Basically I'm terrified that I clearly have an issue in moving on, and this is clearly internet stalking, and second the impact this could have on my job if she decides to get in contact. I fully accept responsibility, it's my own stupid fault and I clearly need to sort this behaviour out, I was just wondering if you Redditors have advice for future action depending on what happens, if anything.",16Feb2017,1
126,"I've always had a tendency to become sexually attracted to fictional characters. I am a lesbian and haven't really had problems in the past forming relationships with real women, but it often feels like my attractions to fictional characters are nearly overwhelming.

This will sound stupid, but currently my running fantasy is in the Steven Universe world, where I am Pearl and have a relationship with Garnet. Essentially... I can't get off without vividly imagining sex between us. And it's a very intense experience.

Eventually I will move on from this and inevitably move onto another cartoon fantasy. But while it's current I am obsessed with it. And I develop a kind of deep attachment to the character and feel a sense of heartache that she is not real.

135,"My SO works at a large bank in New York at a call center. Overall the job is okay, decent benefits and decent pay but as soon as she finishes her degree she wants out of there. In the meantime, she's just trying to stay sane. This was not difficult for the longest time but about three months ago her manager moved to another department and a new manager was assigned to her department. The new manager came in and seemed to be an upgrade at first with all sorts of ideas and suggestions for improvement but my SO soon learned it was all talk and nothing was really being done.   

Now the problem isn't so much with the empty promises (although that does suck in many ways). At the call center, management listens to calls with customers and grades the employees based on the quality of their customer service. Too many bad grades is grounds for termination. The big issue is that my SO has a medical condition (cystic fibrosis) that among many other things, affects her lungs and causes her to cough pretty frequently. Now, she has always just muted the call briefly when she needs to cough and it's not a big deal. But her new manager is now criticizing her calls and docking points for the coughing even if the call is muted (it always is, the customer never hears the cough, just brief silence). My SO was told not to cough on calls and that she needs to warn customers if she has to cough. It was equated to burping during a call by this new manager. This pissed me off beyond belief but I don't know how to advise her on the situation.

My question is in regards to my strong desire to strike out on my own. It feels close to impossible living with my mom given her excessive rules and her tendency to berate (read: yell at) me for the smallest of things. Not to mention the lack of privacy what with me sleeping in the living room.

I would very much like to find a room in an apartment or basement unit, but rent is very high in this part of Canada. Plus, with university studies starting soon, I don't know if I'll be able to manage a full time job (which will be necessary if I don't want to cut into my savings). 

I'm curious as to what you guys think would be a smart move. Grit my teeth and continue to save money? Or find more work, a room, and have a (hopefully) more pleasant home life?

154,"I am a freshman in college, and I attend a small state university in Massachusetts. This state university is in my home town, and is about a 5 minute drive from my house. I didn't do too well in high school so I got rejected from the universities I really wanted to attend, which forced me to attend this state university. My plan out of high school was to spend a year at this university, do really well my freshman year, then transfer to somewhere I truly want to go for my sophomore year and rest of college. I do not like it here, and I am not enjoying my time. I want to leave as soon as possible.


Well, leave it to me to continue fucking up my dreams/goals. I didn't do good my first semester of college. I came out with a 1.89 GPA. I kept the same mentality I did in high school which was not paying attention, not studying, not doing homework, etc.
Now, I have finally realized that I need to stop fucking up academically, and am on track to receive above a 3.0 GPA this semester. Since I fucked up my first semester of college, there is no way I am getting into schools I really want to attend.


Now I am stuck with this decision, and I came here to ask for a second opinion. Should I transfer out after my freshman year to a different college that isn't somewhere I really want to go, but rather somewhere I would possibly enjoy better, OR should I stay at this state university another year, do a hell of a lot better (3.5+ GPA), and then transfer out after my sophomore year to possibly somewhere I really want to go?


College's I REALLY want to attend:

* University of Michigan

* Boston University

* University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill

* Florida State University

College's that I don't like as much as the ones above but better than the university I'm at now:

* University of New Hampshire

* Keene State",16Feb2017,1

160,"Long rant: 

I need advice dealing with people I think who aren't really my friends. 
I have been diagnosed with severe depression at the age of 9 and I'm socially awkward (though I improved lately), so I have no friends irl. I have some online but I'm not sure, I feel like they found better things and think it must be boring talking with someone who has been diagnosed with depression and questions everything (plus very different hobbies and music tastes). I also went through an abusive friendship but thankfully I managed to cut that person out of my life. 

One of my ""friends"" simply forgot my existence after finding ""better"" ones, other after finding a douche boyfriend (and this person were always sharing feminist shit at FB, hipocrisy at it's finest), other only remembers me when they want something like talking about what they did at the party hard, but when I am the one who wants to talk (not only about my life but anything else) they immediately get into ""I'm busy"" mode and disappears for DAYS, then start talking as if nothing happened. I once asked this same friend to see if one of my youtube videos was working and then I found out after this person saying the video was fine but there were no views. It's always ""I read/watch it later"" - that later RARELY comes. My family is totally messed up and I can't trust them. I left facebook because my personal profile was a mess (and how boring that website has become, more like a playground with people being angry and throwing tantrums and politics at anything) and I was really annoyed of a real life classmate fetishizing everything from japan and south korea (what people call ""weeaboo"") and writing kilometric nonsense texts about sexism vs feminism, how men used to cat-call her EVERY DAY (do I even need to tell how a freaking lie it is?), although of this nuisance I thought that person was a good trustworthy one until one day I was mad and decided to make a test (I aimed 1 and hit 4), I said ""funny how you think everything I paint is ""perfect"", but wouldn't pay one single cent if I decided to charge for them"", the friends who were soooo busy INSTANTLY appeared (someone even got mad at me because of the shade and the weeb liked her comment saying that no one is obligated to pay me (as if I really have said that, ok guuurrl), this person spends literally 24/7 at FB posting weeb shit and cringy giant texts, and marked every post I did with a heart but wouldn't pay any cent on it, funny, eh? Though I never said everyone is obligated to pay for my art but the weeb and the other person understood like that, it's not my fault if they lack basic interpretation). 

I'm an developing artist and I get much more feedback and people interest in what I do at DeviantArt than my so called friends. It's strange to know people I barely had a talk with or I don't even know supports me (with both encouragement and criticism) waaayyyy more than my ""friends"". I want to definitely stop talking with them, disappear from their lives as I'm only important when they want something. Yet I have no one else to talk with and I don't want to annoy people at forums.

Because of this I have always been somewhat frugal with my money, and I have this mindset that you need to work hard and grind for your money. I want to be able to have a more ""free"" relationship with money. I don't want to be filthy rich I just want to be comfortable. I want a mindset where having money come into my life is easy, I don't have to struggle for it. For example, if I won like 100 grand, I feel like I wouldn't deserve it because I didn't work for it. I want to clarify i don't expect some law of attraction stuff to just appear in my life, I think it's good to work hard and build a business and what not. I just don't want this money struggle mentality anymore. If I ever was able to receive significant money I dont want to feel guilty about it.

176,"This is a re-post for me from legal advice, and it has a lot of backstory. I 'lost' my first child when I was 17 from when I went to receive treatment at a hospital for my mental illness. Up until that point, I was not diagnosed. I still have custody to this day, but my in-laws have guardianship assigned to them.

The title is very vague and it's a VERY complicated situation. Here is my best at trying to explain.
I was 17 when I had my first child here in Oklahoma. I got married at 16 a few months before I gave birth (because I was an idiot). My husband took off for boot camp two weeks before I gave birth.
I've always had mental health struggles, but never sought treatment because I was afraid. Alright, so fast forward to my first post-op appointment with my doctor four weeks later. I told him I was feeling depressed and anxious. He knew of my previous issues toward the end of my pregnancy, but decided it was getting worse from postpartum depression. He prescribed Celexa to me. I had awful side effects from Celexa, so my in-laws let me leave my son with them while I was adjusting.

The side effects ended up being mania, which is a tell tale sign of bipolar disorder. My doctor decided to put me onto prozac and depakote, which made me incredibly suicidal. I expressed concern to EVERYONE around me and I was told to get over it. My in-laws were absolutely horrible to me, and told me I was an awful mother for even being on medication.

I ended up hurting myself, and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital. I knew I needed comprehensive help, and quickly to get on the right medication and help. I went to a hospital in Oklahoma city for 10 days. They diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder exacerbated by postpartum depression. They contacted CPS and started an investigation. I did not know anything about this investigation for months after my release. My family and in-laws told me caseworker talked to them while I was in the hospital but I was never contacted. Three months later, I'm feeling much better. I asked my inlaws why they wouldn't let me have my child away from them, they said I couldn't legally.

Confused and upset, I called the DHS office to get a hold of anyone who could tell me what's going on. I had never received a phone call, letter, or visit at the time I made this phone call. I was told I was horrible for not contacting them sooner and that I'm a horrible mother and I'm going to lose my child. What? The caseworker comes to me for a meeting. I'm confused. They said they want my medical paperwork to make a case.
Okay. We go and get the paperwork and the caseworker says they are going to follow the hospital guidelines on what to do. At the time, I was living on my own. The hospital recommended I move back in with my parents and have my child with me so we could both be supervised while my treatment is still in it's early phases. CPS didn't like that and decided to keep my baby where he was with my inlaws. I asked why, and they said he was already comfortable there and moving him anywhere would be detrimental to his well-being. He was only a few months old. They went through the process of approving my parents house for nothing. They told me I needed an outpatient psychiatrist which I was already waiting on my appointment. It takes months to get into one around here. 

The first time I went they did a diagnostic evaluation, as is routine for psychiatrists.
Instead of schizoaffective, my doctor said it was much less severe and I was diagnosed with depressive disorder NOS and mood disorder NOS. He scheduled a psychiatric evaluation with a nearby psychologist in a few months time for me. I went to a meeting with my caseworker and he told me I did something VERY wrong going to that psychiatrist and slid a piece of paper over the table for emergency custody of my child. What? What did I do? They told me I had to go to a state approved psychologist for my evaluation, which was never told to me.
So I make the appointment, but I had no vehicle to get there. It was nearly 2 hours away from me. My caseworker said he would take me. Great. He cancelled on three separate occasions the night before. I didn't know what to do. I had one last meeting with them. They told me if I didn't sign a safety plan to keep my son with my in-laws they were going to take custody of my son and keep him away from me forever. So, of course I sign it out of fear. This was fall of 2013. After that meeting, I never heard anything again from DHS or CPS.


My husband and I are currently separated. He doesn't have our son, and hasn't made the effort to. He lives in California and the last I spoke to him two years ago ,he was getting out of rehab for alcoholism. He refuses to divorce me, and I have no idea where he lives. I cannot afford a lawyer to fight any of this and get a divorce. Most recently in October of 2016, I was served for guardianship of my son from my in-laws. I scrapped up as much of my money as possible and hired the cheapest lawyer I could find because I was terrified. My lawyer explained that guardianship is not losing custody. I hadn't seen my son since the end of 2013. What they were claiming in me not being able to have my son was not being able to provide a 'safe and proper' home. I had and have a safe and proper home, which I have proven.


I asked my lawyer what I even did wrong besides being mentally ill, which I have been treated for years and haven't had any issues since 2014. She wouldn't tell me. After speaking with their lawyer and them, she decided I was an awful mother. This entire family goes around telling everyone that I'm abusive and have a protective order against my son. Which I don't. I had my son for 5 weeks before having him taken from me. I still visited him for the rest of 2013, and hadn't seen him since he was 10 months old. My inlaws told me I lost custody years ago, and would tell everyone that.


I was scared and naive and honestly believed I could lose custody without knowing. I ended up getting a visitation plan for 2 hours a month...that's all they would give me. I'm not allowed to have any family with me, or leave their house with him. I asked my lawyer what the end plan is for me to have him full time and she told me there is none. I have absolutely no idea what I did wrong besides being mentally ill. I haven't been able to go to my visitation with my son yet, this was just ordered last month.


My mother just died, and I'm taking care of my disabled younger brother because my dad is gone 2 weeks at a time for work. I can't leave my brother alone, and the only days that would work for me our sundays to have the visits. It's been 2 weeks and my lawyer hasn't told me if it's okay yet. I asked if I could bring my brother to the visits and she said if I bring him I'll lose custody for being a horrible mother.


I don't know what to do. I don't know what I've done. Now, I'm pregnant with another child. I'm worried with this not being solved yet, that the state will take my child for being mentally ill. I'm not divorced yet because my estranged husband refuses to contact me, or tell me where he lives. He tells everyone he's already divorced, and so does his family. I'm in legal hell, and I'm concerned for my unborn child.
What rights do I have here? I'm 21 years old now, and still incredibly young, but I don't want to have this child taken from me. I never abused, neglected, or mistreated my first born in any way. He was taken from me for having a mental illness at 5 weeks old. I don't know what my rights are here. I'm in the process of trying to get divorced and get my child back, but more than likely I will give birth to this child before that has been fully dealt with. Will I lose this child too?

Edit: The investigation that took place over the course of 2013 was incredibly comprehensive. They deemed there was no abuse, neglect, or mistreatment of any kind. I have no criminal record. I have a stable home life and income. My doctors and therapists have sent multiple reports to the DHS office on behalf of me stating I am perfectly fit to raise a child. I was told my doctors have no legal bearing when it comes to a DHS/CPS case, which baffles me. If the entire case has been based upon a medical condition, what authority does it give them to make decisions based on a condition they aren't trained to know how to deal with? The caseworker I had from CPS was fired for being sued by multiple families in this town, and proven to be unfit. I'm working on my son being back with me, but I'm fearful my newborn will be taken from me before I have any say. ",16Feb2017,1

My sister is worse. In school she was one of the girls everybody wanted, she was smart and got good grades, she even was nice to everyone. Well she was a senior, so our grandma finally got her the laptop she has wanted since forever ago. After that she quit going to school and played games on it all day and night. My grandma couldn't do much and it does piss me off my sister did that too her.

I'm 20 and I have a job trying to support my grandma so she doesn't get too stressed out but my sister over the past few months has been horrible. First things first, she bothers my stuff, she goes into my room and takes my playstation so that she can play and talk with people. She does go out but not really for much besides stealing our money and buying more games. But that's not why I made this.

The worst thing is her hygiene, since she quit school months ago, she has let her hair get so messy you can't even comb it without her going OW OW OW... Her room smells worse that a dead skunk, she leaves food, trash, paper, pads..., piles of clothes... etc etc etc... I let her have my PS4 because walking in there is torture. Our grandma tries to clean some, mostly food, but it's so bad in there it will take days to fully clean it. And her friends have tried and failed.

She doesn't care, she sits on the floor all day playing her game, even moved her bed to the wall and usually sleeps on the floor and worse she smells worse than her room. She stinks, like extremely bad. She wears a sweat jacket or hoodie, anything long sleeved and then her panties, that's it. So I'm technically sure you can smell her vagina 10 ft of her. And I'm sure anyone who'd be naked with her would die... It smells horrible she smells horrible. I don't think there is any hope for her room but her. She walks around the house for food, to take my things, tv because hers stays on the game, whatever. 

I can't take it anymore, I feel like just looking at her burns my eyes, she's so disgusting... gross... all I want is to know if I can wash her, obviously not without consent, I get she's a lazy lazy lazy person. So she probably wouldn't mind if someone else washed her. My grandma can't carry her or do that, she won't do that. So can I?

TL;DR My sister smells like death died in her room and she smells like her smell probably killed him. Can I wash her, please. Or is that wrong or something. Nothing perverted just simply getting rid of her horrible smell... Anyone have advice for me instead or has been through this? I need help bad.",16Feb2017,22

So, I've been taking swimming lessons for the past 8 years so you could say i have a history with swimming, but for the past year i stopped enjoying it at all.
I've been fighting with the coach almost every lesson and i don't have any friends left in my team just me and some people that are way younger than me, so going 2 times a week for 2 hours a lesson, really gets me in a small depression sometimes.
I've tried talking to my mom about it almost 5 months ago and she started crying because she saw that i was serious about this and i just couldn't do that to my mom so i stayed.
Fast forward 5 months from that and i told my mom i wanted to talk about my swimming lessons, she sayed ""okay"" and the day after we sat down and i calmly explained to her how i want out how i can't do this anymore and she just snapped at me calling me a manipulative and how I'm just doing this because I'm lazy etc etc.
So i went to my room and locked the door and i didn't start crying or anything like that, i just knew she was mad and she was saying stuff she didn't really think about.
So fast forward 5 days later and I'm writing this for any advice the holy people of reddit will bless me with.

Sports helped me out a lot with my life and I'm currently considering learning any sort of fighting technique like mma or boxing which many people say are a sort of fighting art but you know what i mean.

Disclaimer 3: this one isn't necessary but do know that my mom isn't a psychopath she cares about me which is why she doesn't wnat me to quit swimming because she's sort of a perfectionist on basically everything so nobody worry about me.

my other co worker also has no idea how to operate the thing. so we left it, when he came in, before we had a chance to tell him why it wasnt shovelled, he flips out WHEN THE FUCK ARE WE MOVING THE SNOW??!! he then storms out and takes out the plow.

so we stood there dumbfounded at his reaction. 
he proceeded to give us silent treatment all day long.
I go to his office thinking maybe he just had a bad morning. I tell him, ""hey boss, listen Im going to head to the docs and figure out whats going on with me and get some medicine.""

He responds. ""oh for fucks sakes... "" and continues to browse his computer.
i walk away and stay at my desk all day working.

secondly, when we have lights burned out, we go out and replace them. just to keep the building looking nice. 
this involves taking a ladder 16 feet up to replace little pot lights in the morning.
We just had a nasty winter, the ladders are wobbly at the best of times and I just dont feel completely comfortable setting them on a sheet of ice and possibly falling.
I am a funeral director not a contractor. I don't use a ladder daily and dont want to risk my arm or leg over a pot light.

so we wait until the ice is melted, i go out that very day, buy new lights and replace them all.

This has my boss all riled up.
today marks one week of him being a sulky whiny little asshole.

i asked him what his problem is and he responds 

""well, i have a lot on my plate and my staff are too lazy to replace lights or shovel snow""

i just look at him and walk away, he doesn't see reasons behind why these things were done the way they were, just that he needs a reason to be angry.
I dont know how to deal with this. I want to lay out the logic behind everything but usually when i do that. He cuts me off and says ""NO EXCUSES""

im sorry but saying no excuses whenever you are being given logical reasons for cause and effect. it is a cop out way to show your management title.

What the fuck would you do with this attitude.

he's been silent for over a week over this and it really needs to stop.",16Feb2017,9

188,"I just moved to Charlotte NC a month ago and walked outside my home two days ago to find my car gone. It was towed because the HOA has a contract with a towing company who comes by periodically to check for tags that aren't up to date on their registration. I just forgot to update it. But I got no notice for the tow. Had driven the car just the day before. The way the car was parked in front of my house they would have had to tow it from behind and it is front wheel drive and they did not have my key to put it in neutral. They towed it that way for 30 mins on the highway from my home. I went to pick up the car today and they would not let my girlfriend use her debit card to pay for its release even though she was standing right there with her identification and I was standing there with my registration and license. They made me sign something before I could even access the car or they wouldn't release it to me. We had to go to the bank to withdraw cash from my girlfriend's car to pay for the release of my vehicle. Then on the way to the auto place where I was going to have it inspected so I could renew my registration as required by NC law, the car started making a terrible noise when I went to turn it and would not shift gears correctly between second and third. It's scheduled to be inspected tomorrow for what damages could have been caused by the tow. It had recently had work done at the same place only a month before and was in good shape. I have the paperwork to prove that it was in good driving condition a few weeks before the tow. So what can I do about these damages now? Are they allowed to force me to sign something before I can see the car? Are they allowed to refuse payment from anything but a card in my name or cash? The car was only in their possession for about 15 hours and it cost 250$ to take it out. 200 for the tow and 50 for storage fees. What can I do to prevent my car from being towed while parked in front of the place I'm renting again until I can get it repaired and passing inspection so that the license plate registration can be renewed?",16Feb2017,10

190,"Hi Guys

Just before I start, I would like to state my current situation. Been working at an MSP (Managed Service Provider) for 1.5 years, first ever job and come of an apprenticeship scheme after a year, had zero training apart from the simple advise of ""ask if you don't know something"" and have always been told to just ""get on with it"", on top of this I will add that I am getting paid a very basic minimum wage at 19 years old working mostly on Level 1 but also getting exposure to Level 2

Well I will say that this has been going well with no issues until recently, whereas a big client had complained about me because of my communication skills, and then that had escalated to me not updating ticket notes correctly and now what seems to be escalating to a disaplinary/performance review. I know everyone does wrong which is why I am fine with this but I am walking into a meeting next Tuesday to defend myself and I will admit, working at my first job and having no way in my head to back myself up even if I did back my self up I still get in the shitter, I am pretty fucking scared because my personality just goes down in the shitter when stuff goes wrong.

I was just wondering if anyone has any tips for going into meetings in regards to getting a disaplinary or going on a performance review. I'm not trying to get my self out of this, I just want some tips on what I should be saying when I walk into this.

195,"I know this is one of the most issues we boys talked about, but I’m just wondering is there something I have been doing it wrong?

So briefly about myself, I’m 20 this year which I just entered university. I have dated for a year in grade 10 and it ended pretty badly. I sorta took around 2 years to get over her and started to get out of my comfort zone last year. During this time of period, I have been on tons of dates, second bases with a few and I think it’s either we stayed friends after, or we just stopped talking because the girl isn’t that into me. Most of my friends are female, and I sorta started this because I want to be comfortable with speaking to them *at first I choke and got frozen a lot* 

The issue is, I always screw it up by expecting too much, over-text sometimes, and lack of making actual connection. I have seen tons of videos like how to get girls to like you more than a friend and I actually don’t know what my problem is. I feel like most of my convos are either created by the girls or the ones i created is just pointless small talk. A friend of mine suggested to focus on myself instead but all my hobbies and likes are nerdy af such as gaming and sports. 

I know what I said might not be that clear but also the thing is I am sorta picky and If i have to rate myself, I’m just like a 5-6 in appearance. *though i know looks might not be the most important thing*

198,"This is a very tough issue for me to deal with, and I think because it's such a universally taboo topic, it's hard to get help for it. I've been struggling for 12 years and I'm still no closer to dealing with it, but here goes my story anyway.

As per the title, I am way too aware of my own mortality. This awareness causes a lot of anxiety for me, which manifests in different ways, each of which vastly reduces my quality of life. 

The most obvious manifestation is hypochondria. I am always worried about having some kind of illness that will kill me, whether that's cancer or some other malicious disease. At age 26, I've had more medical diagnostic tests than most people average in a lifetime. 

Hypochondria affects my life in several ways; most obvious is the fact that it causes me to miss out on other enjoyable activities, such as socializing or doing anything besides worrying about dying, which let me assure you, gets old pretty quick.

The thing about death is that it's something everyone has to go through, and what happens afterwards is ultimately unknowable while I'm alive, yet I still can't stop myself from thinking about it. 

The hyper-awareness of mortality also manifests as social anxiety/shyness, which I'm guessing has something to do with the whole evolutionary ""if the tribe doesn't accept me, I'm dead"" response being too active in my brain.

I'm not sure if this post sounds bizarre, but it is what it is. And I really just want to start living life so that when the time comes to die, I can at least say I made the most of it. 

I recently read a book called ""The Denial of Death"" by Ernst Becker, which helped me to understand that nearly everyone fears death, but everyone isn't super aware of it. The author postulates that most people avoid death by distracting themselves with life. 

It's difficult being an introvert who thrives on deep thinking - to just bury these thoughts in my mind while I go out and try to live my life, including making friends, having children, and other stuff. I spend way too much time pondering issues that are too big for the human brain to understand. There have been many people on earth much smarter than myself who had no more idea than I do what happens when one dies, so I have no idea why I waste my time trying to answer the question of ""why am I here?"" and ""what is the point in anything if death leads to eternal nothingness?"". 

Thanks in advance for reading this anyway, and if anyone has any suggestions as to how I can distract myself from this hyper-awareness of death, I'd love to hear them. ",16Feb2017,13

She was crying and yelling and would not even let me explain why I disagreed.

In less than an hour, I am meeting with her and our boss to discuss the situation. I know that she is very emotional, so I'm counting on her yelling and crying again while I sit across from her cool as a cucumber, hopefully showing our boss who the problem is here. 

My questions:

How do I convey that I am calm and not concerned with the issue without looking cocky or coming off like I just don't care?

How can I, as a man, assert myself in a way that shows I won't be treated this way, without coming across as an insensitive asshole as I sit across from an emotional train-wreck who will likely be sobbing and yelling like an Iranian woman at a funeral?

So a year ago we adopted a cat who was microchipped from our local humane society. We kept it as an indoor/outdoor cat and one day it went outside and never came back.

Honestly, it was kind of a relief when she ran away, but I don't wanna tell them that I don't want her. If I didn't call back would they give her to another shelter? I'm planning on calling them back tomorrow, but don't really know how to go about it. We don't even have all the stuff wed need to look after her anymore.

I did all the research about the best place to stay and let people know about how much it would be for the place. I told them about $65 and it comes out to around $75.

217,"My mom has lived at home with her parents all 52 years of her life, she was never able to find a full time job or career and spent most of her days partying. There were brief periods where she worked and it seemed like things would finally turn around for the better, but something always came up to take it down a peg. In 2007 she was in a car accident, surprisingly not as major as the damage it caused her. Two cars intersected a small town stop at the same time, they were both going 15-20 mph. She had a head injury and has spent the last ten years unemployed, without a car, resisting treatment or refusing to see doctors for key things with her health.

  She's suffered depression for a major part of her life, and is easily dejected / upset with others remarks even if they're not negative. The only thing she has going for her is going uptown to feed feral cats every few days. She's always been an aggressive person, somehow managing to get on the wrong side of the other people who feed the cats. She hasn't dated since 2003, refuses to be happy with another person or get married, spends all her time on Facebook (from waking up until going to bed), makes enemies online by gossiping, tries to boycott the local grocery store where the feral cats live behind, stress eats...  

The worst part of it is? Every day I hear the exact same words about wanting to get a job and saving up money. Every day for the last ten years, it hasn't changed. ""I gotta get myself a job and save up money so I can get a car, then a house"". She thinks it's that easy to just forget the last 10 years and lackluster working years before it and just have a job. The only problem with that logic is there are no real jobs where we live, and she refuses to do anything that involved a new skill - resorting to janitorial work as her go to. I suggest to her places to apply to all the time, and she lightly considers applying before forgetting about it. When being asked if she applied to x or y, she'll run around the question to avoid telling me no. She lies about petty things, gets emotional over the slightest remarks, eats an unhealthy amount of food and talks about losing weight the same way she talks about work. When she found out what her actual scale weight was (binds herself to a scale, puts it on carpet so she weighs less) she viciously screamed at me and my grandparents for not supporting her weight loss even though there wasn't any.   

It's a really tough situation, there's a lot of disillusion and entitlement going on, some understandable considering her situation, some not. I know she's my mother, but I end up taking every approach in life the exact opposite that she has, because I don't wanna make the same mistakes as her. Another side note, I mentioned her refusing treatment or checkups for her head injury (self diagnosed). She refuses to go to the doctor for any normal checkups even though she has govt. health insurance. She also keeps applying to jobs far distances from home when there's no car readily available to take her there, like it's her attempt at getting a job and once she's applied she doesn't have to think about working for a few more weeks, as long as the effort in applying was there that's all that matters. She definitely doesn't want to work, but tries to create the image that she's looking very hard for a job.  

Her other problem seems to be conformity - since she's online so often she can find groups of other people who have similar problems, suddenly making hers okay. She's found feral cat feeder groups, head injury groups, bladder problem groups (another issue), and everything that's wrong on her end is okay because other people are experiencing it too.   She has a friend who lives 4 hours away, they mirror situations and talk almost daily on the phone, I feel things like that are holding her down because just like the online conformity she's talking to someone who can reassure her that everything happening is okay.

  My question I suppose is what do I do to help? I'm scared for her future, because I know exactly who she is, but I don't think anyone can be instrumental in changing the path she's on unless she decides to herself.",16Feb2017,6

223,"Long time lurker, first time poster, please bare with me. I don't really know where to begin with this. but uh, Hi! I'm in my first year of college, I grew up in a poor family and I am paying to go to college myself. I don't talk to my family much now because they have always been extremely shitty to me. I was very sheltered growing up, I could never go anywhere and really just worked my ass off to make money and get good grades in school to be where I am today. I'm grateful for how this has made me as a person, I feel like I appreciate everything a lot more than most people do. But I also feel like I'm so far behind everyone else. I never got the opportunity to leave my house, and hang out with friend and enjoy the freedom I have now and its exciting, but it makes me feel like I've missed out on so much. I don't know, its hard to explain. I really don't know where to start any of this, I really don't have anyone to talk to so its just bottled up inside. I have a boyfriend (I'm a girl), we have been together for 4 year. He used to be extremely shitty to me, to the point where I would consider it emotionally abusive. He turned into an asshole when he met a group of friends, he would stop texting me for weeks and then be nothing but rude to me, he basically became his shitty friends. That was about 2 years ago, we are great now, and I'm glad I waited for him to stop mimicking his dickhead friends. I have never actually felt in love until now. He lives about 30 minutes away from my school so I drive and stay at his house on the weekends and its what I always look forward too. He treats me so well now and things are incredible, we are even trying to move into an apartment together with one of our friends (he's great, and not an asshole like the other friends). I have never had many friends, I lived 40 minutes from my highschool and couldn't leave anyway. So making and keeping real friends was almost impossible, I do have a few friends from high school but they all go to college now and are too far away and busy to ever see and talk to. When coming to my school this fall I didn't have any friends here, I was put in a triple but one girl dropped out and the other one was nasty to me and her and her abusive boyfriend were always trying to fight me and my boyfriend (for no reason, they were just aggressive and mean. They didn't even know my boyfriend.) Shit was weird, so SHE requested to leave, but that's a whole bunch of shit I really don't care about. So I have a room to myself now. That was a bit of sidetrack, but I came to school and my boyfriends shitty friends were the only people I remotely knew and they insisted I hang out with them, they have been friends with my boyfriend for almost 2 years and I have never spent anytime with them, I never could until now. So I have been hanging out with them since September but I think that is all coming to an end. Its a group of 3 boys, 2 who are(were?) bestfriends with my boyfriend and 1 who is a roommate. They started out being very kind and nice to me and it was great, but now they just make me feel like an asshole all the time. I feel like I could write a book about this but I want to keep this as short as possible. 

 One of the bestfriends, we can call him Steve, asked me for nudes one night while I was super trashed in my room by myself and I said fuck it, sure. It is honestly the biggest fuck up of my life and I think about it everyday. I love my boyfriend and I feel so much regret. Steve has a longtime girl friend as well, and is extremely close to my boyfriend. He has continued to ask and I always say no, I finally told him to stop asking and told him that I regret it and he should feel shitty too. he continues to go on about how it isn't a big deal and I shouldn't worry about it. So basically he's a fucking asshole. Since then he has been nothing but nasty to me because I refuse to send nudes. But best friend 2, lets call him Gabe, heard about it from him. They are a bunch of lairs and it became a huge story that I tried to make out with the both of them and they turned me down. My bf doesn't know about this, I hope he doesn't find out from them because I know he will get a fucked up story. I don't think he will find out unless one of these boys gets extremely salty. Even if i told him the truth nothing would ever been the same, I fucked and I want to have this one secret to myself. My lesson was fucking learned and I don't want to loose my relationship. This happened months ago and no one has really brought it up since. Also, on Halloween Gabe was trying to lift up my skirt and do all this weird shit too. He was sober, and then later started telling people he was trying to cover me up and that I was making up a story. I'm not a liar, I hate liars. So basically both these boys have been trying to smash and its gross. I try to move on from it and they do too but then something else always ends up happening again. The roommate is great, he's never been rude to me or tried to bang me. But every time I see these boys now they just shit on everything I say, argue with me over simple things for no reason, tell me how shitty me and my boyfriend and how we will never be able to afford to find a place together and that basically we are both fucked. It was never this bad but the past month it has been incredible how much they go out of their way to make me feel shitty. I have have met a few of their other friends and some have pulled me to the side confused and ask me why they talk so shitty about me. So what happens is they tell people I'm the worst, but when those people finally meet me they realize I'm not a piece of shit and actually really like me! Which I'm glad about, but I wish peoples first impression on me wasn't me being a huge dick, which makes no sense. I don't want to talk myself up but I am extremely generous and nothing but kind. I really don't say or do shitty things I'm not like that at all.

I haven't been spending as much time with them, I have had it with the shittyness but we still do occasionally get food or something together. But last night was the really just the last straw. Steve had a friend stay the night (I'll call him Jim) in his room, he has stayed before and always borrows my extra sheets, its never been an issue. He came in my room last night and wouldn't leave. He was there so long Steve texted him and said he was shutting the door, going to sleep and not letting him back in. All his shit was in there and he had to stay in my room, which is ass. I texted everyone I could asking for him to take him and no one would even reply. So he stayed the night and before going to bed he kept asking if I would make out with him. I said no, what the fuck did Steve tell you and he said nothing, I believe him. Jim is also friends with my friend, so basically all my boyfriends friends have tried to get with me and its gross. Jim left in the morning and never tried anything else, which I'm super grateful for. I told my boyfriend and he's had it with all of them too. Jim texted me today and basically was trying to start shit and be fucking rude to me but I avoided. I'm done with the shit. 

I've never had a group of friends, I've never been able to spend time with people like this. I feel like I'm surrounded by shitty people. I've been talking to other people and trying to hang out and make new friends, but I feel like I'm getting no where. I know my life isn't shitty, I'm so glad I can go to school and stay at my boyfriends house on the weekend. I bought a car, I can drive. I have a decent amount of money saved. I just feel so scared that nothings going to work out in the end. I've been thinking about life so much recently and I feel like I'm being so generous and helpful to the people in my life and trying to enjoy myself when everyone around me is nasty, rude and works for nothing. I have basically answered all my own questions and I'm glad I wrote this all out, even though its basically just giant rant. I have never had depression or anxiety and I don't think I do but I have just felt like my life is so bad and its only going to get worse. 

I hope I posted this in the right place. I really just need anyones response. I have no one to talk to about this with, my boyfriend is great and always listens to me but theirs so much I have to leave out because my mistake, I wish I could tell him how fucked up his friends really are without ruining what we have. I know I need to find a new group of friends, I'm working on it and have met a few super cool people. I also need to get an apartment (my bf and our other roommate to be are being kicked out their houses) I can't afford to live on campus and I don't want another shitty roommate. I have just felt so alone, and like I have no where to go. I want a real place to call my own and when I do that I will be surrounded by people who actually support and aren't dicks to me. I've been doing well in school, I work alot to make money, I work out, I put a lot of work into my shitty car and love all of it, I'm just afraid I'm fucking up and making wrong decisions. I don't know. Sorry this is a mess. I really just need to write this all out and get someones thoughts. I already feel a lot better after typing this all out.

tl;dr. I made shitty friends, I fucked up. and I feel like I'm a piece of shit and my life is going to fall apart. I know everything always works out, I just feel like I'm all on my own and I'm wasting my time.",16Feb2017,2

230,"Last night, my partner blacked out, fell forward and hit his neck on the footrest of a solid wood bar stool so hard it cracked in half. I was sitting right behind him and sat trying to wake him up for about 15 seconds after it happened. It was easily one of the most terrifying things that's ever happened to me. 

I rushed him to the ER and they gave him a clean bill of health, told us to watch for other symptoms, and told him that sometimes it just happens. This has never happened before and I'm terrified it will happen again. 

My question is how do I recover from this? I want to be able to leave him alone without being terrified and I want to be able to make it through the day without having a flashback to watching him fall and holding him on the ground. How do I deal with the anxiety and fear that hits me every time he doesn't respond to a text or when I leave him alone?

231,"I want to move somewhere far away and start my life over again. I am not running from anything bad, as I know some folks have to. This is something I've thought about for the last five years and haven't wavered on. I'd go into all the reasons why but I have too many RL friends on here and don't want to ID myself. 

I currently live in the southern US in a major city. I have an undergraduate degree and doctorate from fairly prominent schools. I hate my field and was foolish to think I'd feel differently. However, there is a fairly good market most places for a less stressful job in the field that pays anywhere from $10-$25/hour. I anticipate I would not have difficulty getting a job based on my credentials, though I'm not sure how to explain why I have no experience in the field in the state and why I randomly moved there. I don't know whether to try and line up a job before I move (which seems like it would be difficult) or just show and try and find one. 

I am also unsure how much money I should have saved up. How many months rent/budget in savings, etc. I also worry because loans from school ruined my credit, but I have about 12 years of perfect rental history. I really, really, really hate living with roommates but I may just have to suck that up.

I want to disappear from my old life completely. This doesn't include debts, just people and places. I know I will need to eradicate my online presence, phone, etc. I'm also unsure what all I should bring with me. I feel like its smart to go light. 

I also don't want to say good bye to anyone but I don't want anyone bothering the police that I'm missing. I've read somewhere the thing to do is go in and explain that you are leaving and are not missing. 

I'm worried that there are a million things I haven't thought of. I'm also worried because I've never really learned how to cold make friends. I am an introvert that forced myself to become an extrovert. I have plenty of friends and make friends easily but they are always introduced to me through another friend or a girlfriend or a class or something. I'm terrible at just attending an event and meeting people. I am a loner by nature but I like having people I can call on to hang out if I'm lonely. 

Suffice to say, I want to pick up, move across the country, and start anew. Any and all advice welcome.

234,"Crossposting to get as much information as I can.

I am a 20 year old Caucasian female living in northern Austin, Texas. I weigh 82 lbs and am 4'11"". I was diagnosed with a growth hormone disorder as a child and administered weekly shots for a year until it was ended because they didn't seem to help. I also had IBS four about four years until just last year, where a sudden move to university cleared up all of my symptoms.

I'll try to be concise. In the spring of 2017, I took half of a Five Hour Energy at home to test it out and felt fine, then took half at a work shift I had and only two hours into my shift was overcome with this horrible flushed, sick feeling, and shaking very badly. My supervisor drove me to the ER where I was given an anxiety pill and told it was a caffeine overdose. Laughing at my stupidity, I went home for a few days to deal with the sideeffects (which just felt like miniature attacks) and then went back to work, no problem.

Five months later, I noticed my big toenail was turning yellow-ish, so I went to a walk-in clinic and was prescribed Bactran. After a few days of taking it, I suddenly had another attack similar to the Five Hour Energy and had to leave work. I went to the clinic and they said the Bactran may have dehydrated me since my pulse was greater upon standing up, and put me on a less strong antibiotic.

Two weeks go by without a problem (except that my toenail wasn't getting any better and it seemed to have migrated to the other one as well). Until, well, another attack. I was pissed and went back to the clinic since I had been shovelling water in my mouth all day, and they said it was dehydration again.
On Halloween, I'm on sick leave from work, and in pajamas, watching Twitch streams, eating salt and vinegar chips, basically treating it as if I was sick with the flu. However, I start feeling very ill and call my mother crying, asking her to come home. I ask that she take me to the ER again to see if anything else was wrong. I even had an IV put in me. But the urine sample, blood test, and EKG came back fine. All they found was I had somewhat low blood sugar.

I go back to work armed with apple juice but unfortunately it just doesn't work out. After having to go to the bathroom five times in half an hour and getting those horrible flushed feelings and always having to leave my station, I end up breaking down crying and stepping out of my workplace in my work uniform for the last time.

It's kind of hard to describe what went on since then. I stopped keeping my journal and everything's a blur. I was started on Celexa which had helped my IBS, but it didn't work. I admitted myself to a mental hospital feeling I was unable to take care of myself where they put me on Zoloft which worked for a while, but then they increased me to 100mg which put me on a huge downward spiral. Now, I'm on my second week of Paxil and just stopping the Zoloft, along with Vitamin D, Fish Oil, Ashwagandha, and a Multivitamin.

Some days, I feel almost normal. Like I want to start an OkCupid profile or travel to Peru or some stupid thing like that. But I can't tell my mother this because then she'll get hope, and I'll start spiralling downwards another day for no reason at all. She can't leave on long trips because my mood is so unpredictable, I've become extremely sensitive to sounds to the point where sometimes I have to leave a room if she's talking loudly, and I am tired. All. Day. Even with 8 hours of sleep.

It's gotten to the point where I'm looking at holistic sites and other such crap to find a treatment. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder along with depression and told to be patient with my treatment, but I've had anxiety since I was a child and it has never manifested itself like this. It's a little more manageable now but I still feel like I'm at my wit's end.
Well, sorry, that wasn't concise at all. If any of you could share advice as to what you think this is, please tell me.

Sorry for long post but please read!

Room selection comes out in a few days and I've had an agreement with someone to room together, we can call him John .He was the first person I met while at college and was my only friend for quite a while. Eventually I have widen my horizons and made a new group of friends that I enjoy spending time with more than John. I have tried to bring him into this new group but he just doesn't fit. Over the past couple of weeks I have been informed that this new group of friends find John somewhat annoying and wierd.

When I found this out I kept to myself for a while and then it happened - the glass shattered. Everything they were saying about him, stuff that he did, it became noticeable to me. Since this glass shattering I sometimes become annoyed with John as well. Last week, I brought up this new tension and told him what everyone was feeling. He knew something was going on but couldn't figure it out

Later that night the new group of friends invited me to their room to drink. I told them i was with John. They then said that he could come as long as he wasn't annoying. So we went to their room and disaster occurred.

John isn't a huge drinker. He does not have a high tolerance for alcohol. He drank way more than he should have citing ""I'm just testing my limit"". He got so wasted he threw up all over the floor. The room owner(a very good friend of mine) was then further annoyed she had to ""take care of him"" as he was throwing up and such. Eventually he was taken to the hospital - he has recovered since.


When he came back he refused to to listen to our suggestion on how to make himself feel better. It seemed like he was milking it to the fullest further annoying everyone.  He waited for someone to get him a chair(at a table with plenty of chairs), he asked someone to get him bread when it was two feet away from us.

My issue is that I'm starting to become really annoyed with him, and I don't know if I want to room with him next year. I plan on keeping the same friend group I have and they all don't like him - and I'm starting to not.

Keep in mind the group of friends are not influencing me at all. This has been a long time coming- the just shattered the glass( if u don't understand this term it is from The show How I met Your Mother).

Should I back out of my agreement? How should I approach him about this?

239,"So basically a couple days ago at work (McDonald's) I was scammed by a short-changer to the tune or around 50 dollars.

I get a text later from owner saying that he really didn't want to lose me and was willing to adjust my schedule to minimize drama, and that i was one of his best.

I tell him i can work such days and the issues i got fed up with at the site ( i had something to say about almost everybody and i'm pretty certain the owner mentioned it to some people)

i ask him to let me know if i am to report back in wednesday which he doesn't do, but just texts asking me to come in tomorrow - after seeing the brightside of staying home and focusing on school. i was to use my fiancial aid refund to cover my finances until next fall. 


so i don't really know what to do now.

reasons I want to quit for good:
- just a bad place to work
-too much drama
- after quitting abruptly saturday and telling the owner the issues with his store i'm not sure if people would want me back.
- as a college student with options i feel out of place working there. it's a competetive environment with older people who need these paychecks and i'm mainly there for pocket money.

Reasons i might wanna stay
-i'm one of the better workers and people have told me so

242,"I have a job that I liked for... awhile. My boss was a little passive aggressive, domineering and controlling in the beginning but I kind of just dealt with it. I'm in my 30s, this job is pretty senior and I left another senior role at another F500 job where I ran board meetings...etc. 

In the beginning, it started with making me watch him narrate how to check his email or buy something on the internet (so I could learn?). Every little decision, for some reason, involves watching him do step by step mundane tasks. It will literally take us hours (followed by days of discussion) to order cleaning supplies off the internet. These are all things I could probably do in 20 minutes.

I've dealt with this fairly well for the past 6 months because he has his own office across the hall and spending a few hours every other day is just-about-bearable.

However, about a month ago, he just announced that he wanted to sit in my office. He still has his own office but he moved all of his stuff into my office. He now sits here all day, every day. This means that this ""watch-me-check-my-email"" happens all the time. A lot of times, its not even work related. He likes to stare at construction out of the window and would make everyone get up from what they're doing and stare out of the window.

He moves stuff around my desk and logs into my computer when I'm not there so I'd come back and essentially find myself gaslighted. He has some OCD problem where he feels the compulsion to pick things up and move it 2 inches away. When he is in a bad mood, he rants and raves the whole time to make sure everyone hears. He mutters under his breath in a loud and obvious way. The other day he said to me, ""I wish I had your job."" 

Today, he decided to watch an instructional video on speaker.

I sit in an enclosed space and there is nowhere else to go. If I leave, he always says something. 

This is starting to give me a lot of anxiety. My job isn't stressful but sitting in this office is. I'm naturally an introvert and I haven't gotten anything done since hes started since now my whole day is filled with watching him complete some menial task. I feel like I'm regressing into a small child and I'm worried that when I leave this job, I won't be able to command a room or run a meeting as a fully-functional-senior-leader.

I thought about telling him but I'm 99% sure his ego won't understand how his little ""actions"" bother everyone around him. He'll either blame me or it'll go on my performance record.

I thought on my life and where I want to go with it and I want to backfire at everything I have been going through. My option was to start on my health, I want to get super fit. I already have a passion with my diet since I'm vegan so I thought 'why not put all the stress out in working out and work on that body that you have been abusing for the past few months'. there are so many ways that I am thinking of what to do so I can become a better person and I'm really excited to start everything up. 

Even my attitude has just burst out of no where, I used to be a very fiery girl and I lost all of that when I thought there was no point to life but now I want a point to life and I want to move on from everything with no drama and I want to reach for every one of my goals. 

My question is, is that I have many people who drag me down. One being my cousin, I would cut loose of having negative people in my life but I cant just get rid of a cousin who is so dependant on me.

So I am regularly driving with my driving instructor and I (him as well) noticed that sometimes I just blur out, like my brain stops processing the information it receives.

I also had this when I did the official exam for my driving license, I basically started driving on a junction even though a car was coming our way. (I did see the car)

It's really annoying and I don't know how to fix.

Ps: I don't use any drugs

260,"Like for example, when someone is drunk driving and ends up killing someone. I feel sympathy for the victim and their family but I also feel sympathy for the driver/defendant. Everyone is always like, ""Oh send them to death row! Sentence them to life in prison!"" Idk, I know that drunk drivers aren't like, ""oh I was planning on killing that person as I was driving drunk."" I feel the person should go to prison for a while but again at the same time, I know that the person didn't mean or intend to hurt anyone. 

Another example, When someone is addicted to drugs and commits crimes to buy drugs. Everyone just seems to want them sent to prison and have the key thrown away. Okay, let's just put them behind bars instead of helping them? I know people that have become addicted to heroin after they had surgeries/injuries. Some of them have committed crimes to get heroin. I guarantee if they were not after heroin, they would not have committed these crimes. 

Why am I like this? ",16Feb2017,1
