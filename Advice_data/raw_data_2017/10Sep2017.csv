2,"My parents don't want me anywhere near my ex. Without going into too much detail, he has deep-rooted issues and they don't think I'm safe around him. He's never hurt me or tried to hurt me but it's clear that he isn't exactly of a sound mind. They ask me if I'm talking/seeing him and I always answer with a resounding ""No way!"" when actually...

I hang out with him quite a lot while away at college. The reason is pathetic: he's all I have. I'm pretty much a social failure and I've never been good at making friends. I don't fit in at all. He's someone I'm actually able to click with and someone who actually likes and enjoys my company. It's so hard to throw that away and go back to being alone and depressed. 

Another thing: I'm sleeping with him. They would disown me if they found this part out. We're basically friends-with-benefits. Why? I'm super horny and don't feel like meeting someone new for sex. 

My parents are amazing and very protective and I feel sick lying to them. They'd be so angry, worried, and disappointed if they found out. But it's so hard to get rid of my only friend (I'm his only friend as well). Please help.",10Sep2017,1

8,"My ex and I have always had a good relationship, even when we broke up, we were still okay with being around each other (we were in the same class and were sometimes forced to work together). That being said, I was always very nice to him, I still care for him deeply and always act genuine around him. I am always happy to see him still, and even try to make conversation with him. However, I noticed that he began to start acting distant shortly after the breakup. I understand this completely, because we were best friends, then dated for a short amount of time, but he was acting cold and seemed to hate just being around me in general. We agreed to remain friends, so why is he acting like he wants to get away from me all the time? One time we were working on a project together, and he purposely invited another one of our friends (a girl) to join us even though she was working on work from another class. Ok. I got the hint and gave him distance after that event. 
Anyways, this behavior goes on and he now has a new girlfriend, and completely erased me from his life. I can't help but feel sad that he's been treating me like this, we were best friends and we didn't even date for that long. We agreed to remain friends but we've been anything but that. We barely even stay in contact even though we see each other every day, and he'd only talk to me for class-related things. 
Recently, he had an open conversation with his new girlfriend on twitter. They were talking about bad past relationships and he said something like ""Ikr every time I see my ex I'm like what was I doing lol"" and other things about me that he would never say to my face. 

Well, that hurt. Before we dated we were best best friends! HE was the clingy one, he was the one always wanting to hang out and be around me, arranging hangout times and just being together. I'm the only ex he has ever had so I know this is about me. I have been nothing but sweet and caring to him, in fact I feel like a loser because I've wasted so many months worrying about him and missing him. I have never done anything wrong or said anything mean to him or about him, I even tell our friends that I miss him. 

I just feel like a loser now, I am moving on from him and don't even want to be his friend anymore. I can't believe he would do that so openly. I'm just so upset and don't understand why he's being such a jerk to me. ",10Sep2017,0
9,"My girlfriend has a temperature and I think I might have some aches which could turn into a cold. I've googled this tons of times over the years whenever I'm sick, and it feels like there's no real answer. We can send rovers to Mars, but we can't seem to grasp basic nutrition science. 

Should you only eat when you're hungry while sick? Is it better to fast? There are apparently different answers depending on whether it's viral or bacterial, but as a regular person how the fuck am I supposed to know what's making me sick? 

We already try to practice intermittent fasting, only eating from noon until 8. This is supposed to be good for the body's immune response, among other things. Should we just stick with that, or some other plan? What do you do? ",10Sep2017,0

Anyway, the first day of the semester came and she was unable to add the lecture due to not being on the waiting list, she didn't try to add the lab.  I called her at the end of the week and when she brought up not going to the lab I said if she had gone to add the lab the professor would have added her into the lecture as well.

33,"So I just finished 2 months part-time employment at a local bar. It was a short job to put down extra money in my pocket until I move to university. Overall my experience has been pretty mixed, and whilst looking back over my time I've found myself feeling quite upset over a great deal of it.

First of all, I'm not the most extroverted guy. I can't walk into a situation of new people and instantly start cracking jokes. Usually I play things pretty safe and reserved, but I do try to make conversation.  Secondly, I had never worked in a bar before, and on top of this I only worked two shifts a week for just two months. Because of this there was only so much I was able to learn in my time there. At the start I only had a few very relaxed training sessions that went over the very basics of the job. However there were many more complicated areas that were never properly explained until it came up in an actual work shift. So I would need to ask for help, I'd make mistakes, and I'd need direction during clean up at the end of the night.

Because of all this, I essentially became 'the bitch'. I was the 'new guy' with only a limited knowledge and a small personality, plus the one they could make fun of and play tricks on. I'm not sure if my personality rubbed people the wrong way but I often felt like I was been spoken down to, and this was by people that are a similar age to me. Even after we had gained 5 new bar staff I was still bottom of the pecking order.

One common 'joke' that started was related to my name. Basically there are two ways to pronounce my name based on two spelling, and despite being spelled one way it's actually pronounced the other way. Obviously at first many people pronounced it wrong, but after I corrected them they refused to change the way they pronounced it because 'they liked the other way better' and also because it was a reference. This came with an unfortunate side effect, where the incorrect pronunciation is extremely satisfying to say in a disappointed sing-song voice. And so now whenever anything goes wrong or a mistake is made, my coworkers just love to follow it up by saying my name. These aren't just mistakes I make either, I mean whenever anything goes wrong it's my name they all call out.

The next is that I was constantly on the receiving end of 'jokes' or comments. One guy in particular seemed to show no remorse in anything he said. It was past the point of a casual joke and turned into what felt like a relentless attempt to diminish me as much as possible. The stuff he would say probably seem fairly harmless when isolated, but it's in the context of it being regular and his overall demeanor that makes it hurt. Overall it seemed like people felt like they could just say whatever that wanted to me. Some coworkers would swear at me, for example being told to ""shut the fuck up"". A different guy once just started shouting a string of insults at me when I walked past with a mop, the last thing I recall him saying was something like ""Don't you fucking walk away from me you fucking mopping cunt."" For me it really began to walk the fine line between a joke a genuine berating.

I should probably finish up now and head to bed, mulling this over was keeping md uo and I just needed to get it out and ask someone's opinion. So if you could give me any feedback, maybe highlight anywhere I went wrong or ask any questions, then that would be great!",10Sep2017,1

The guy is a hardcore narcissist too- so it's like all narcissists just kind of screwing you over.

So what they do is connect to your 'family members' in this way and do this sick stuff to them...for people who dont know about it- it's something they can do with energy. So they can connect to someone and almost do some weird sexual sh*t to them in this way- and what if this person is doing it to your family members..and seems to be into doing it to them.

66,"So the brief backstory..... I met the man of my dreams last year. It was love at first sight, I've never felt so strongly about another person in my entire life, even after being in two very long term relationships. Because my feelings for him were like nothing I experienced before, I got scared and pushed him away, multiple times until one day I pushed too hard and he broke up with me 2 months ago. I lost it, it was like all at once I realized I threw away the love of my life.... 

I did everything wrong that you're not supposed to do after a break up...I begged, cried, emailed and text way too much until he blocked my phone number and blocked me on Facebook. And it went even further downhill from there if you can believe it. Seriously, if one of my friends had behaved the way I did during a break up, I would have smacked her and said she looked like a fool. My behavior was nothing short of embarrassing and shameful and nothing I had ever done before.

Fast forward to the point he speaks to me again. We've seen each other a few times as we are involved in a volunteer group so I have been to his office a few times. The past few weeks we started talking and texting a bit more. I've seen him in passing and we've hugged. We have talked in depth about our relationship. He knows I want him back but I'm at least acting normal again.... He admits he misses me and that he still loves me though said he was not IN love with me anymore. He said he is hopeful that we will get back together but we have to ""see what happens"" and be friends for now.

So we decided to have dinner last night. We met at a bar and decided to drive to the restaurant together as it was about 40 minutes away. I arrived after him and walk in to see that he had shaved his gotee, which he used to do just for me since I hated his facial hair and I know because I have seen him, he's had it back, thicker than ever since our break up.....he was also wearing a purple shirt which is my favorite color.....in the car, he had my favorite song ever on his iTunes...of course, this could all be coincidence but.....then we go to dinner. It was perfect, we went to one of the best restaurants in the city, we kept everything in the conversation light, we laughed a lot, he said something wonderful about my eyes, ....and then when we drove back to where we met for the night we had one more drink before we left for the night.. he walked me to my car and....hugged me 😩 didn't even try to kiss me. Is that bad? Or..... ugh.

I'm clueless. On the one hand I don't know if we were on a date or were just friends hanging out, but on the other I don't think you spend 300 dollars on a dinner with your buddy 🤔....Do you??

He did text me today, nothing serious. One text we both said we had a good time....then normal how was your day stuff and things about our dogs. We have made no plans to see each other again but we do talk or text fairly regularly...

I just can't believe I'm at the point I don't even know if I was on a date last night or if we were just on a friendly hang out and I'm certainly not going to ask... HELP!!!",10Sep2017,1
69,"I'm seriously debating just never talking to my family ever again, with the exception of two people.  I'll just admit my family members are not great people.

It's kind of hard to just cut ties with them to be honest.  On the other hand dealing with them is a drain on me as a person and emotionally; five years ago when I moved out here I was a bubbly happy person that had about thirty friends, but their constant cut downs, insults and such has turned me into a introvert person with clinical severe depression.  The worst I got from them was about how I can't have kids; I'll admit how they treated me cause I can't have kids was probably emotional abuse.

Anyone here that has cut ties from family members any advice?  I'm tired of being the black sheep of the family that everyone hates.

I was happy where I was (I understand what people meant when they say don't transfer unless you were truly miserable). Moving back into the city, meant that I had to live at home again and it feels like my parents just wants to control me. Even though there is a degree of freedom, there are certain things they don't want to compromise on. I have to go to church, even though I am agnostic and find the whole ritual a waste of time.

Like we even talk outside of work and we share some of the same friends. He's a super nice dude and I honestly have nothing negative to say about his personality or anything. But lately he's been whistling at work and it bugs the shit out of me. And not just like a little 'whistle-while-you-work' tune. Like full blown whistling for 5-10 seconds to the music we have playing. I know the customers hear it and it's not like it's a 5 star restaurant but it's just annoying and to me it seems disrespectful. I even made a small comment to him one time like, ""ahhhhh *insert name* getting that whistle on!"" Just trying to kind of let him know I notice it but in a joking way and he replied, ""oh yeah sorry man, my roommate literally whistles all the time and I just caught on to it."" And just laughed it off. And I honestly understand where he's coming from. Like I don't have a genuine reason for me wanting him to quit other than it's annoying me and it's disrupting the customers.

94,"Hello. I just want to explain my situation a bit and get advice from some more experienced people. Around 3? months ago, I started taking anti-depressants for my Depression,anxiety and OCD thoughts. Since 3 months ago, i've tried 3 different types of these pills. Each varying from different side effects, the ones i'm taking now have basically none, been taking these ones for around a month.

Enough of background, since I started taking these pills I can sleep better, I don't have racing thoughts(around 50 different thoughts per minute every minute of every day, I estimate) but it doesn't really help with the depression/anxiety part much. Especially for anxiety it's useless. But ever since I started taking these pills, I feel a lot dumber, I barely think about anything so i'm just a retard, I don't really have any confidence like I did before. Before I took the pills my confidence levels would vary randomly, sometimes i'd be on a god level, other times I was the absolute worst and dumbest person in the world. But to me that's better than feeling nothing. I am nothing now. I want off it, but since i'm only 17 and live with mom she wouldn't really let me. I heard it's dangerous to just get off of them without consulting your doctor for a lower dose and going from there, but she wouldn't let me do that either. So what do I do?

Mark keeps talking about how he should have gotten the role and that i dont deserve the role. (For some quick information, our school really encourages us to create our own personalitys and characters, so i chose to play the mad hatter with alternating personaltites, leaving him like a wild card.) Something that really struck a nerve was Mark saying ""You cant play him properly, i would act like a true, 'Mad' Hatter"" which is obviously taking a jab at my acting style.

99,"So I'm 14, and my room often stinks. It's not me, it's my hamster. I keep my two windows open wide whenever I'm in the house, but I hate open windows at night, so overnight the smell of hamster accumulates. I give her a proper full cleanout every two weeks, and change any smelly bedding every day. She's my second hamster, and with my first I did the exact same thing, and my room never smelled. She seems to be exceptionally brilliant at making some form of strong smell. 

However, it really bothers me and family members because the smell gets disgusting overnight. I immediately remove ALL bedding that smells and bin it, (sometimes half of what's in the cage!) And replace it. I'm always worried about friends coming over because I've gotten so used to the smell that sometimes I can't smell it at all, and I'm worried my friends can. When I sit at the computer at my desk next to the hamster cage (very narrow room and there is nowhere else  I can put the hamster) it stinks. I have a lavender bag which I keep on my desk between me and said hamster, but it still gets through, ruining my gaming experience (shock horror) 

Also, sometimes my room gets the normal teenager smell, and I just open the windows and poof, out it goes. I change my bedsheets every week, and hoover about 2/3 times per week, do a big bedroom tidy once a week, and dust regularly. Basically the only scented thing I have is a lavender bag, is there a way to make a homemade pet friendly air freshener? Or just something to de-hamsterize my room?",10Sep2017,1
100,"I don't know where to start. I am a 19-year old currently starting his second year of medicine and God do I feel like shit. Not because of the added stress that comes with the title of the major but because the institution I am in is despicable.

I study abroad in the Russian Federation. Or at least part of it. I'm currently in Simferopol, Crimea. I'll pause while you Google that. 

Now you might be wondering how I got here or came to know of ""here"" in the first place. I was catfished into this place. And I didn't do my research. I graduated high school with a GPA of 4.0 so the natural course of action was medicine. And I went with the flow. After the intial month of shock; the ""I want a plane ticket back home"" calls with my parents; and the existential crisis, I got into the mix of things under the umbrella of ""I'm transferring next year."" ""I am not staying here"" was the first thought to cross my mind whenever something absurd happened or I simply wanted to buy something other than clothes. My first semester was rife with solitary walks and suicidal thoughts. This wasn't the life I wanted. But I am leaving. 

By the end of the first semester I made a lifelong friend who ended up making me enjoy this place. She brought the color back to my life. I was ambitious again rather than just ""scraping by"". And saying goodbye to her was painful. I am not an introvert. It's quite the opposite actually, everyone knows me. I made myself known even by just scraping by. A lot of things happened after. As I couldn't stay here to personally see it that I got my transcripts with no issues, I asked another close friend of mine to take care of things. The process was long and tedious and the university wasn't making it easy for anyone. If anything it was presenting one abstract obstacle after the other. And my friend was going through it all for me. (Thank you S.) When I finally got the transcript it got flung me into a well of despair. I was unfairly graded. It did not do me any justice nor did it depict my true self. It was completely unfair and unjust. Just like this institution. You see, some classes we have are just a display of authority for the teachers. A teacher would give you a mark without even knowing your name. Or an F when he himself is not attending. I endured all for the sake of not wasting time. Time is of essence after all, but I didn't heed that. I submit all transfer papers to a university in Warsaw and was ready to repeat a year if need be. transfer admissions opened in July so I waited and applied. They said they'll reply in the middle of September so I was conflicted because this sorry excuse of a university starts on the 1st. Two things happened after that. 

* I did something dumb. I committed a grave mistake that left me broken. I saw no future after that. I felt like my life just stopped.  
* I was just waiting. I didn't apply for any other university... I just waited.

The plan was to stay here should I be rejected. I was mentally relatively okay with that. Right until I actually got here. And everything came back to me. I could not go through this again. 
Now I am desperately emailing uni's that I have missed deadlines for begging them to take me. Take me away from here. The effect this has on my psyche is baffling. I am also considering quitting medicine just to get out of here. 

I am honestly at a crossroads, I do not know what to do. Stay here, finish another year and make sure I apply to all the uni's for a transfer next year or leave and start fresh as an engineer. ",10Sep2017,1
102,"Hi everyone and thanks in advance for every comment. Me (18 M), my gf (16 F)

Since my girlfriend revealed that she had been sexually abused I can't sleep, we are in a long distance relationship atm and everytime I call her I can't get this out of my mind. It's really haunting me, I want to make it stop. The worst is I fear my feelings towards her have changed since then and it really hurts to only think about this when I talk with her. I don't have anyone to talk this with so I am begging you please if you can give even the smallest advice, do comment.

Last week my girlfriend told me she had been raped roughly 2 months before we met. When we met for the first time she told me she wasn't interested in me and that she would prefer to start a relationship with a woman instead (she's bisexual). I love her and she really loves me because I'm the only boy she decided to be with after this thing happened. Now I realise I really mean something to her. She really gave up on men. I can't think that vermin like this exist. They're not real men.

I knew something was not quite right with her and she was hiding something when we saw a movie and there was a rape scene and she started crying. I did not dare to ask then but I knew she was hiding something. Eventually she told me about that day. Since then I can't get this out of my mind and I refused to go to school for 2 days.

When it happened she told me she wanted to die in the following months after what happened. I can't feel bad enough for her, but that's not the end of it.

It turned out to be worse than I thought.

Not only she knows who abused her, she is also friends with him and sees him everyday at school. She thinks that he excused himself after what he had done to her and that she felt bad for him. I know I may sound like an arse but I call bullshit on that. She told me that she just goes on with him as it never happened. That's complete nonsense. I don't understand how can she do it. This guy no matter how much he is sorry for it HAS to pay for his crime. That's how it works. I believe in justice. That's why I'm a law student.

I think she is still haunted by what happened and that she is only trying to chase it off her mind. She has only told me and her bestie about this. Her parents know nothing. I know for a fact that she can't go on hiding it forever. Again, I may sound like an arse but when she'll grow up she will realise it and feel even worse for not having done the right thing then.

When I told her if I see this bloke's face I will rip his head off his body she told me not to do anything because she didn't want problems. I told her I can't promise her that, since I wouldn't be able to control myself even if I wanted to.

I don't want to hurt her. I want to help her. I want justice to be made. But she doesn't see it my way. I really want this guy to stay as far away as possible from her. She really doesn't understand the gravity of it. In that, her bestie (the only other one who knows) and I both agree. But if I have to make her sad to serve justice, I will.

I want to help her and myself as well because I really can't get it off my mind. And I can't continue a relationship like this.

This october I'm travelling back to see her for a week and I'm planning to take action once I'm there.

What should I do? Should I talk to her first? Should I tell her parents? Should I tell our friends? Should I go straight to the police? Should I just bash the arse's face? Should I be doing anything at all?

Please help me

During my ""what should have been brief"" unemployment, I was getting support from my dad as much as I HATED it...but the money has run out. He's a contract worker and recently admitted to only earning approx $400 last month, half of which went to my rent because he is a supportive guardian angel whose loyal to a fault!
I haven't been able to pay this weeks rent because of it tho...
I'm entering a vaccination program which will land me $50 for each time I get my blood read (this will be monthly) but the first $50 has to go to a parking fine that I got because I wasn't concentrating like an idiot when I visited the post office. 
I am keeping a small stash of cash (like $10) which I'm going to put in my car in case GOD PLEASE I get a job interview and need to travel to it. 
I have been trying to get payments from the government as I am a student but they are taking months to process my allowance claim. 
It's not as though I can move back though because the plane ticket is too expensive as my home is rural af..
Maybe I was naive thinking that I could move out on my own with only my savings. Maybe I was stupid to think i'd easily get free government support. Either way I have to fix it!! 
I have already overdrawn $100 from my account to pay last weeks rent and unless I can pay it pack within the next 2-3 days I'll start getting fees. 
FUCK!
I don't know what to do...I know some very seedy ways in which I can get money...I don't want to do it but I'm not sure whether my dignity is worth risking homelessness... 
So guys...I've adequately fucked myself and am seriously contemplating jumping off a bridge and not even in an ironic way anymore...any suggestions??????????????

106,"i'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but it's something that's been eating at me. I've never known exactly what to call what happened.

when i was 12 i looked older than i was because my body matured faster than the girls my age, and i also tended to have older friends -by a couple of years- in general. there was a guy who i somehow became aquatinted with, maybe through myspace or a mutual friend. Said guy was 21. i knew his age, he knew mine, but we had spent many nights flirting with each other through myspace despite the fact. the day comes when i finally sneak him over to my place where him, our two friends, and i hangout outside of my house in the middle of the night praying we don't get caught. long story short, he made a move of me and we ended up spending the whole night making out and rubbing up on each other. i distinctly remember him whispering the words to me ""you're the hottest 12 year old i've ever seen"" and those words still make me cringe and shiver in hopes of shaking off the disgust. he even asked the other guy with us if he would like to have a go at me too, and he was being serious- didn't ask if i myself would like that either. 

during the time that we were kissing and being all touchy, i was totally into it. i thought he was cute, and thought it was cool that he was older. then days pass and id feel sicker and sicker about it with every thought of the situation, and i felt completely humiliated. i had no idea why i would do something like that, i felt disgusted with my self. it got worse and worse for years, to the point even thinking about it made me utterly sick to my stomach. 

truth is, i never knew if i could really call this molestation if i, at the time, was completely willing. i'm aware it made him a pedophile, but today someone claimed i had been molested.

i guess i'm just curious as to what people think about this. it took me a long time to stop blaming myself and putting myself down. anytime i feel comfortable enough to tell someone this, i always feel as though they might think less of me and think of me as someone disgusting for willingly doing something so raunchy at such a young age with a man who was nearly twice my age. 

i know there are people who get it 100x worse, so i don't want to get that misconstrued.

TL;DR i willingly made out with a 21 yr old when i was 12 after he'd sought me

115,"I moved into the Apartments in June of 2015 during which time it was run by a different management. The management I had when I first moved in was very friendly and accomidating with me, anything I asked for they did for me because they knew it wasn't unreasonable. If I had notices I couldn't read, they would read it to me, if I had issues with anything breaking in my apartment or not working properly they would fix it.

Fast forward to January 2016 when we got the management company that is here today. At first things were okay, but things went from bad to worse very very quickly. As the apartment got renovated, staff people came and went. We got new maintenance staff that were not very friendly at all, and they show no sign of quitting or retiring.

Things got even worse beginning this year, as the current property manager moved in and immediately took dislike for me though she didn't show it until I started having financial problems. I was the victim of a scam to where I was scammed out of almost $5000.00, some of the money I got back, but it was a real struggle and fight with the bank.

During all of this, my management was very unkind and rude and nasty towards me and threatened to take me to court because I fell behind on my rent as a result of my being stolen from.

Even when I managed to get my rent situation under control, that still didn't stop the management from continuing to give me hell. Anything that was broken or not working properly in my apartment, the maintenance people immediately accuse me of damaging the apartment without listening to my side of the story.

They violate ADA laws by placing notices on my door that I can't read, and even after I've mentioned both verbally as well as in writing personally and through my legal team, they still refuse to listen. They scream at me and tell me never to come to them for help ever again.",10Sep2017,5

120,"Hey!

I do need to give a heads up that there MAY be some triggering content in regards to eating disorders!

I have a history of eating disorders and was medicated for that and other mental illnesses. One of the medications was a weight gain medication and a hunger stimulant which at one point made me gain over 20 kilograms in a short period of time. 

Ultimately I recovered from majority of my mental health complications and began reducing the medications I was on - one of which was my weight gain medication. Now I've begun rapidly losing weight without meaning to (note: this is NOT intentional). In a short couple months I've dropped over 15 kilograms which is concerning.

Onto the issue!     
Since dropping that medication I'm not hungry often, I eat dinner consistently if it's put in front of me but I'm either not hungry or incredibly nauseous any other time - nausea often will come from making or being around food which causes extra strain.

I've been having breakfast drinks for breakfast and I wanted to get some 'diet shakes' (I know they're often bullshit) to put something in my stomach and have energy to get through the day.

**I was wondering if there's any particular ones with the most beneficial nutrients or with better 'stuff' in them than others? OR if there's brands to avoid or ingredients to avoid**

126,"Background

- I'm a working professional for a small (26~ employees) company. - No HR.
- I have a chronic sickness, debilitating although not immediately obvious, the meds cause me side effects. 
- I'm having a surgery to try to cure it.
- My company is fully aware of my illness and my upcoming surgery.
- We only get 5 days per year of full paid sick days and I've used 4.

First issue is related to my surgery. It's soon, and they are fully aware and have been understanding (seemingly) and haven't raised issues with the 3 weeks I will need off of work. I enquired about booking myself holiday days off (as I have hardly used any holiday days this year I have lots left) for a trip after my surgery/recovery to go on a trip with my family. My director (who is also my direct manager) strongly suggested that as I won't be getting paid I should use holiday days for my recovery period so that I get some payment during this time ""to help me financially"", not that he knows any of my finances other than what they pay me.. 

This raises several concerns for me, firstly him saying I'm not getting paid, does this mean he doesn't know about Statutory sick pay? surely thats like 101 of employment and we don't have HR to advice on this stuff? Secondly is using holiday days to cover sickness legal? and thirdly I really don't consider lying in bed in pain to be a holiday.

How do I bring up SSP without coming across as aggressive? Like if they don't know its the LAW then will I come across as coming after them for stating my legal rights? I shouldn't have to but how do I justify that I should be paid SSP but also that I should be able to book myself holiday days off for a holiday and not for being sick (when I already should be getting paid for those days with SSP anyway)

Second issue is lateness. I have had issues with it in the past (only by a few minutes), I find mornings particularly difficult as a direct result of my condition. I made them aware of this when they brought it up with me. A few months ago I changed medication so that I am on meds 24/7 which helps with mornings which has resulted in me not being late in months, but in the last week my medication has been making me feel like throwing up in the night and as a result I have not had much sleep in the last week. I was late by 4 minutes after only 2 hours sleep, and I was cutting it very close to being late for a couple of weeks leading up to this. Another employee was 2 hours late the same day, has a reputation for being late, and calling in sick when he is hungover etc. He put us both into a meeting room and has said we're both going to be watched for 2 weeks and need to be in before X time every day or we get a warning. I did explain the reason, but he still handed me the same consequence. Once again I'm concerned as we have no HR and I'm relatively sure that usually HR should have sent me off to an occupational therapist before handing out warnings where there is any chance it could be directly related to my physical health. But I don't feel like I should be the one to teach them Disability Act etc. as I don't want to be on bad terms or come across as ""coming after them"". I don't want drama I just want my rights to be recognised. What do I do?",10Sep2017,1

129,"Hello everyone.
I am 17 years old and I live currently with my mom and her husband. I've had issues with her, her husband and my biological father since I was 7 years old. My dad lives and was born in Amsterdam so I don't see him often, thus I was raised by my mother.

My father didn't contact us for 7 years and then started paying child support then. My mom always gives him shit for not paying the 7 years, still now that he is actually paying for 10 years, without fail. My mom refused to tell him how much she makes and forces him to pay more than the legal amount each month.

Anyway, recently I couldn't take it anymore at home and I've decided to move into the school dorms at my new college. Also because my home is 2 hrs travel away. I thought that my part time job wouldn't be sufficient, so I thought I could just take up on the child support for the months I have until I'm 18. I figured; it's for me, and once I'm not living with her she technically has no reason to have it, right?
HELL NO.
She blew the f up, and I was crying for hours because once again I have no idea what I could've missed this time. I don't understand. She claims it is her money and I have no business touching her money, and that I'm being manipulative and disgusting.
My dad offered to send it to me instead of her each month but I don't want to ruin my mom and Is relationship but I cannot live properly without this money that make my life go from sufferable to being happy.

What should I do? 

Edit :
It is not a legal child support agreement. My mother and my father did not either of them have the finances to gather this in court. My parents have both doubled their finances and are well of now.

So now this is a huge concern of mine and I have expressed this to her. She is still adamant on keeping their identity concealed. If I see something new and comment on it sometimes I am met with ""her god father for it for her"" now this is her way of saying ""mystery guy"" bought it. 

How do I express to her in a way that shows I will not back down off this subject and I need to know who this person is that is not in our daughters life if nothing more for my sanity.

So that teacher got transferred and we received one that knows nothing about the course, I mean he literally took 30 minutes to put 2 stock photos and write his name on Photoshop.

He also gave this project of turning in weekly [donut selfies](http://donutselfie.com/). Which is really weird and I've never taken a selfie before, much less presented it to a class I barely know.

She said she has a close friend who lives in South Carolina who has offered to take us in since she has a 2 story house and that we should all go there. 

I said no and opted to stay home as did my sister. Now she's driving 8 and a half hours to get there all by herself and we have a tornado watch for Orlando as well. Am I a bad person for not going with her? She asked if I could drive half way there and she would drive the other half but I said no im staying home to weather out the storm. Now I feel guilty and bad that I let her leave alone like that.",10Sep2017,1
147,"Hey guys! so just a quick rundown, im 24, male, i have a panic disorder and anxiety and am prone to wrist/hand pain.(early carpal tunnel and arthritis from injury, nothing to doctor will do yet).

I have tried so many hobbies but ultimately quit because i talk myself out of them. I need something i can do every day to make myself feel like im improving myself, while also relaxing.


I've tried the following.


Drawing: I got to a very decent level but ended up giving up on it because it stressed me out more than it relaxed me.

Instruments: I have a few insturments (piano, violin, and guitar) I like to jam on them but i cannot do them too long due to hand pain.


Knitting/Crochet: Fear of carpal tunnel and tendonitis keeps me from doing it because if i do it too long it hurts badly.


Creative Writing: SO much writing already out there, not sure where to begin but it is interesting.


Origami: ran out of interesting patterns. although i did very much like working with paper a lot.


painting: Toooooo Messssssy.


Anybody have any advice that might help?

My SO gets really overwhelmed when we go to my house though because we've got lots of dogs and my sister and mom can be really loud and obnoxious. So we spend lots of our time at her house. Her family is really toxic, passive aggressive, and puts a ton of responsibilities on her and for the last few months, she hasn't had a day where she doesn't break down. 

I'm interested in moving out because I'm on good terms with my parents finally and I work and have classes in the city 30 minutes north of where my house is and 50 minutes south of where my SO lives.

162,"So yesterday, my friend asked me what my game plan for the upcoming school year is. I began answering the question, but then he interrupted me and asked me if I was going to quit my coffee shop job. I said no, and my reasons for it were; I just got promoted to a supervisor and am learning valueable skills such as being a leader and becoming a good judge of character (other minor skills are being learned as well), I genuinely enjoy working there because the people are very friendly and fun, and I get payed a little more than enough for what I need. 

After I explained, he got upset and said I could be working at a library where I would get payed about a dollar more and would be able to do my homework while I work. He does have a point, but I like being occupied in my job and I love interacting with my co-workers on a daily basis. I do not see myself enjoying a library job. He didn't even want to listen to the rest of my game plan for the school year after I told him I wouldn't quit the job. He says I need to let go of my pride and that the reason I don't want to quit is because I'm comfortable there. I disagreed.

167,"**I would REALLY appreciate some life advice. I tried to make this as short as I can and organize it to make reading easier. Thank you**

**Who I am:**

I'm 21, living in Western Canada

**Prior issues:**

When I was 15, my life was in total chaos. (Drinking/self injury/nearly failing school/running away from home etc). Since then it's been an incredibly difficult and painful struggle to recover and improve but I'm proud to say I'm doing pretty damn well in comparison to my peers and in comparison to where I was.

Main issues in my life from then until now has been 1. No self confidence/self love/self respect. and 2. Lack of social connection/very isolated (not by choice)

**Current Issues:**

*Job, Living location, Friends/Romance, Self Esteem.*

-JOB: I have a excellent paying but unsatisfactory job with a highly saboting and competitive co-worker, So I want to make a career shift into a field I am passionate about. I have done a ton of work and research on how best to do this and have a well detailed, effective plan arranged for that. Done!

-LIVING LOCATION: I either live in a place I love with a great economy/good land and opportunity etc but without family (Western Canada). Or a place I don't like much (Eastern Canada) but with my family that I love and miss a lot as well as our cabin there that I miss a lot too. Its a very tough decision that I've been doing a lot of thinking on but its not a pressing issue and I have a vague plan of living here for some more years before moving back out east with my family in an area there that I can stand and possibly start my own business. Maybe! Done for now!

-SELF ESTEEM: It has improved a TON but it was so low and I was so destructive towards myself that now I'm just at slightly below average which is good but could do better. I am actively getting better and better all the time but it will take a while but I'm on the right track. Done! Sort of.

-FRIENDS/RELATIONSHIP: This is where I am stuck and am trying to work it out.

**Trouble forming friends/relationships:**

**-Friends:**

I have absolutely zero friends back home, not even someone who can remember my name. At least here in the West I have some co-worker friends I go out with about twice a week (But we aren't that close or have much in common), some old college buddies I do things with maybe once or twice a year, some really good friends I loved but I never see at all except for on Facebook because they are many hours away or in different provinces/countries. My social life is dead. Don't get me wrong, I am busy and do lots of exciting things to make myself happy, but always solitary things like fishing/camping etc.

The issue I believe is opportunity to meet compatible people as well as my own ability to form a connection. I basically have been living in one small town to the next, moving every year or so. Never getting a chance to settle down but also never liking a place enough to settle down. I follow where my career path takes me. Which includes next year living for a year in the North, gone for weeks at a time away from civilization in a small crew. So that doesn't help much either but it makes sense for my career path. Also small towns dont have much to offer and there arent many people, especially young people.

I have tried numerous ways to meet people. I volunteered at the old folks home for a year (Surprise surprise, I didn't meet many people my age but still had a blast). Working at various farms, attending all sorts of public events and clubs, some online dating, meetups, gameboard cafes in the city, other online (local focussed) communities, seeing friends of aquaintences and taking up every single opportunity that presents itself to me.

An issue I have connecting to people is everyone I know thinks I'm weird and it's not an exaggeration, because I am weird. I'm sorry people find it weird that I like to collect coins or read about politics in Latin America or spend a weekend in a tipi on a native reserve or listen to a podcast on global energy production or whatever other random thing I like to do but fuck it, I'm sick of trying to destroy myself and what I find interesting because other people are too closed minded.

The ONLY significant interest I have a passion for that is one that many others also have and might be a good idea is the outdoors. Fishing, canoeing, hiking, hunting, canoeing, trapping, skiing, atving, gold panning, snowshoeing, sailing, orienteering etc. But so far everything I try to attend under that interest is only available in the city and its full of middle aged moms in yoga pants or old hippies which are not really much for a social base for me. I also just cant connect well even when its someone my age, either they are too rural/redneck or they are too urban/city and I'm inbetween and just really suck at opening myself up as well and forming a connection. I'm very unlikeable and suck at forming relationships and I'm trying as hard as I currently can.

**-Relationships:**

I guess for relationships you have to love yourself first and usually friends come first as well. Nonetheless, it's still something I've been trying to pursue. I think I might be afraid of relationships or I may be sexually confused or low libido or something. I've gone on a few dates this year from online dating. I've also had some girls really show interest in me that I've met from work or real life but I didn't share their interest back because (I hate to sound like a snob) but they were just so boring and always said I'm weird whenever I would be myself. 

The girls I went on dates with got along with me but there was nothing at all romantic or sexual in between us. Its my fault though because I restrict all romantic or sexual feelings for some reason and never make any moves or act in a way I wouldn't act with an aquaintance, I dont know why and I can't stop. 

Also, I am just not very sexual, I never check people out or have much of a sexual drive at all. I dont know what the hell is wrong with me, I'm open to being gay too but I really dont believe I am since I have no attraction to men in any way. A month ago I went to get my testosterone checked and I'll see how that goes but the doctor doubts it and I will only get a call if there is cause for concern, still no call. It's not just low sex drive, it's like I have almost no appeal for anyones bodies. To complicate things more, there's also a strong attraction to BDSM in me that I wish I didn't have. Really, I do like sexual activity/behaviour/talk and I like girls but I hardly care about bodies at all except face.

174,"I've been thinking a lot about my life, and the future of it, lately. One of my several realizations is the horrors of OCD. At this point in my life it's almost as if it's embedded in it. I know what I can and what I cannot do; I know how I'm supposed to do certain things and how I'm not supposed to do certain things. Sure, it changes over time, but I still get used to it; eventually. 

This, in part, I suspect, has made me almost blind as to how damaging it can actually be. It's like my life is controlled by some kind of a preternatural force. How great would it be if I could just go about my day without all of these thoughts and rituals? Without all of the needless, because let's get something clear, it is absolutely needless (even if it doesn't feel that way), counting?

As I mentioned earlier on, it's almost embedded into my daily routine; which means that this is completely normal for me. However, at times I just lose all control; I become more isolated. I barely bother moving out of my room lest it'll prove to be too stressfull. 

I fear for my future, sometimes. I was supposed to start a treatment for OCD a few months ago, but I had to decline the offer for various reasons (one being dissatisfied with the behaviour of the people who were supposed to treat me. They certainly didn't make things any easier for me.).

178,"I am a 30 year old who finished his experimental High Energy Physics (Particle Physics) PhD last year, and have been working in a tech startup in my hometown since graduating. It's currently three other senior engineers or PhDs, successful in their field, all 55+ with lots of experience, and then myself. The work is very interesting. I love going in every day. I believe very strongly in the technology and business plan, and once we get funding, things will continue much more smoothly. We're currently presenting to potential investors at the moment, and I'm confident we'll get the initial capital. But it's going slower than I thought it would.

I am really struggling at the moment to hold out until we get funded, when I get a normal salary. I am paid $2500 a month, 1099 contractor, a low amount for my background. I wanted to contribute as well, and I thought I'd have no problem living on that amount. But payments have been getting behind, at about $6500 past what I'm owed at the moment. It just seems to be that other members don't have liquid cash to catch up, and based off several conversations, I truly believe they are not trying to pull anything over on me. Our physical location is in 15 employee engineering firm of other members, and I think contracts have just been low lately. I have significant options in the startup, but they aren't worth much because 1) they are options and 2) it's a prefunded company.

I have no one else to support, and no relationships or major financial obligations. Cheap car, very low loans, 1-bedroom apartment. Used to happily living off grad student stipend. But I really can't lower my standard of living any farther, and most months my checking account hovers dangerously close to $0.

I need to find some extra part-time work to make ends meet. However, I haven't been able to get anything finalized. I have the physics background, and work well in a systems engineering role. Very good at picking up a new language or set of technical standards and coordinating between vertical knowledge groups. Experience in C, Java, Perl, Python, VHDL, TCL, AWK, R, JS, tons of data analysis frameworks, ATSC 1/3, H.263/4/5, FPGA work. But, my last year of grad school, I had a TON of problems trying to find any engineering group willing to take the chance with a Physics PhD, just for full time positions. Part time or Remote work, I am finding to be even more difficult. I only really work 40-50 hrs a week on the startup stuff, and lots of other free time. There's no excuse for me to be running out of money when I could fill extra hours in my week working.

At this point, I'm almost considering just walking into a grocery or drug store and asking for 10-15 hrs a week in evening hours. But there has to be a better option.

180,"(Sorry in advance for grammar, english is not my first language, and sorry for a long post)

I know I am not a depressed person because I have been like this since I can remember. It's just who I am, but I fucking hate it because it seems like I am in the miniority. Everybody else I know is so full of life, excitment, dreams, they are very social, basically they are everything I am not. It is kind of depressing, but I know people are different. I wish I was different, but whatever.

I do appraciate life and all the little things, I enjoy nature, sun,snow, forest, I appraciate that I can afford the basics, I love seeing animals and I like educating, but I can't bring anything interesting to the table myself, and I don't bother getting deeper with anything.

A lot of people including my friends and my family over the years always made these type of comments directly to my face, and behind my back. I often hear shit like ""why you're so quiet"" ""ohh you're putting me to sleep"", ""don't be so fucking grim, live your life"" ""you have so little energy!"" ""what are you constantly thinking about?"" 

I know I can't be mad at the stuff they are saying because they are right..but every time I hear this, it hurts, it really hurts.

This is why I usually hang out by myself because I noticed that I don't bring anything interesting or relevant to a conversation. Unless I force myself, and when I mean force myself, it's like a constipated person trying to take a dump but just can't. It is just so unnatural to me. This is also why I never had a girlfriend because they would quickly notice that there's literally no fun being around me, and I  would understand them. Somehow I also don't feel need to have a girlfriend and it also fucking annoys me, I just want to be normal like everybody else. 

I don't have any trouble meeting new people though and talk to a stranger. I don't actually mind a short logical conversation, but when it gets deeper I just try to bail as fast as I can.  

I used to have many friends and I have few now. But generally hanging out with people just don't feel natural to me, I always make an excuse to bail early,  I just can't freaking help it. 

When I moved out on my own to college, at the age of 21 I imagined things would be different, but boy I was wrong. I isolated myself and I failed so hard at college, there was a period of time (around 5-6 months) where I did absolutely nothing besides going to store, forest, fotball(soccer) field and gym (all by myself) The weird thing is I actually didn't mind doing that, this is the scary part. Of course I made a lot of small talk with strangers, mostly from my own initiative and that was enough to refill my social need for some time.

I know we should not compare eachother to other people but I have this friend whom I visit from time to time and his apartment is literally filled with thousands of gadgets, toys, games, consols, movies, guns, swords, gym equipment, guitars, tech staff, books, he's had 4 different girlfriends, I swear he is interested in everything. He accomplished a lot, he constantly has to do something new, experience new things, he's just so full of life and boy I feel like a such a zero whenever I am at his place. But nevertheless it's still kind of funny for me to see how different a person can be. It's not like he's much richer than me, we have about same economy, but everything I spend my money on is the basics and I save a lot of money. I just don't feel any need to have a lot of stuff like he does, and do all the stuff he does, but I just can't understand how can people be so different? 

Anyways, I don't know where I am going with this, and I don't know where I am going with my life at this point. I am 23 and dropped out of college few times, idk why I am even trying. But honestly I have absolutely ZERO clue what to do. What can a person with such low need for social life and no passion do with their life? It seems like every job requires social skills and actual interest for the job. I've had few jobs before and I have a job right now, but I fucking hate everything about it and consider doing something else.

Seriously, what is the point of me being even alive if I don't have any dreams? I always laughed at this quote from Rambo 4 ""Live for nothing, or die for something"", but maybe because of the way Stallone delivered it, but I see his point.

Please don't think I want to be a special snowflake, I never talk with anybody about this type of things, this is second time I make a post in hope for some advice. I just fucking hate being like this, it fucking sucks.

I am always so envious of people who are excited about something, who talk about stuff they enjoy doing, kind of makes me sad that I will never experience that feeling. 

I just want somebody to point me in the right direction because I haven't been happy in many years and I feel like I am so used to not be happy I wouldn't mind if something happened to me because there is no way I could be less miserable than I am right now. 

If you read this whole thing, thank you very much it means a lot to me.

I have free time and bored so I browse the web and many time I share a unique song I found or interesting information in chat groups, some times the things I share is strange and after one minute i send it I think to myself""why the fuck did I just sent it,it's very dumb of me"".
I have a fried that knows me well and knows that I share it just out of boredom but he says that from other people perspective its very strange and that I should stop.
But the problem that in the heat of the moment I don't think about if is it socially unacceptable or not and I just share it,afterward I regret.

Is it your career? Marriage? Family? Owning a home? Living within your means? Your education? Living debt free? Being happy with what you have? Something entirely different? I know this will be different for everyone, I'm just curious. At what point do you feel like ""I've made it!""? ",10Sep2017,1
183,"I'm one week in, and I feel like complete crap. 
At the end of high school I didn't have any school friends, I had a friend group of about 10 people but none of them went to school and I rarely had one on one time with any of them. My biggest fear was that I'd forget how to make and keep friends after losing all of mine. (I lost my school friends because the guy who was the 'leader' type of the group was really horrible to me and eventually tried to sexually harass me and became manipulative so I cut him out and in turn couldn't hang out with any of them because he was always with them.) 
Anyways, that was last year and now I'm in college and I'll admit the first week I talked about how much I loved it, but there's an issue that is really taking its toll on my emotional and mental state. 
We have 5 roommates. One of them is never around- she always hangs out with her boyfriend who goes to the same school. One of them is moving schools and is always on her phone with her old high school friends. Then there are the other three, they are all party girls and they get along super great. Now, I'm pretty sheltered so I've never partied or drank or done anything, but I'm willing to! I got someone to buy me alcohol and I drank a bit, and I will gladly drink more at a party or something. 
But I also just wanna hang out. Just a few minutes ago me and two of my roommates were out and my one roommate was going out with a few guys and offered my other roommate to come, I was sitting right there and expressed that I may want to come (to which I got no response) earlier. I didn't get an invite and they left. 
Even the girl who is leaving and talks to her high school friends gets along with one of my roommates better than me. It's like they always sincerely invite each other out and places but not me or they plan something invite me and then pretend it never happened. I don't want to be pushy and invite myself to stuff but I don't know what to do.
I feel invisible, guys don't talk to me often, people don't invite my out, and this one guy that comes over talks and jokes with everyone but me.
I have some friends from classes but I desperately want more friends that actually wanna do things with me. It seems I always have to make 100% of the effort.
I'm generally pretty, I try to be kind, people say  I'm pretty funny, and I know I'm really smart and know a lot of little things about random things. Sure I can be annoying but I don't understand where my lack of popularity among people (especially college kids) stems from.
I'm just like everyone else and I just don't know why I seem to repel people when I really don't want to. I love people and doing things. It's really rough, I need help.",10Sep2017,2

187,"Hey, I'm a junior in high school. Recently, I've been feeling pretty negative because of all these events happening at once. For starters, my first girlfriend of 14 months and I have decided to stop dating because she's having personal issues leading to what we both considered after a while of talking to be not that great of a relationship. I'm gonna be alright in the long run, just in the short term I'm really confused about how to feel. I've never had a relationship before this so I don't know what it's like to exit one. I've been feeling off, a weird kind of sad but not really. Is that normal? How should I distract myself?

The next thing, is that my twin sister is becoming a burden on my and my parent's life. She's attending a special arts school, and she's overloaded with work to do, and a learning disability which leads to severe, humiliating tantrums about twice a week. She's also unhygenic, addicted to her screens (and gets huffy when they're taken from her), and in general a very shallow person with not much regard for other people. I am starting to feel ashamed to call her my sister. My parents are good at dealing with it, but I know they're sick of her antics as much as I am. We've said to pull out of the school and come to my public school, but she flat out refuses. I have no idea what to do with her.

On another, bit less life-changing topic, my parents are both doctors of the brain and control my computer and phone use, i.e. time I'm allowed on daily because apparently I can't control myself with it. The problem with that is that 75% of my recreational activities involve the computer. I do digital art, video games, and general computer hardware fiddling. I want to go into graphic design as a career. I'm very electronically inclined, and I feel my passion for it is being blocked by my parent's system that's been in place for years. I get outside, exercise plenty and socialize in person and online a lot, but they're still worried I'm going to no-life it. I can't help but be frustrated that infrastructure put in place when I was younger without much willpower is still holding me when I'm going to college in 2 years. I've mostly stopped arguing with them about this because I'm losing hope and reason to fight, but now that I'm here I might as well say it.",10Sep2017,5
189,"Me and my mom have had a lot of rough patches and though I don't know the exact dates of most of what happened here is how constantly things like abuse happen.

She doesn't drink or anything so you can't blame it on alcohol, but whenever I bring up things that happened a long time ago she says she NEVER did them and that I was lying for attention. But I know it happened. along with these things, she has pulled my hair a lot this summer and called me a b**** and a spoiled brat because I got to do show choir. She always threatens to take my phone or show choir away because I didn't do something fast enough even though I always listen. She tells me it isn't abuse because she left no marks when she hit me but is that really true? Plus she has pointed out all of my insecurities and brought me down and told me that I'm worth nothing and that I'll get nowhere because I want to be famous and inspire people one day. Keep in mind a lot of this happened before August I just don't remember the dates and it happens often, but not daily.

I feel like 6 months out though, is too early to ask someone this. I don't want them to be annoyed with me. 
No apartment is available yet for 6 months from now obviously, but I like to do things early to avoid anxiety.

I don't believe she's the sort of person to cheat, she's honest to a t so if she felt like she was going to she would tell me and obviously we would be over. 

I've had some shitty experiences with sort of romance before where I get lied to and stuff. 

I'm kinda just stressed about the concept of her cheating on me or leaving me etc without sort of believing that she would, but the sort of what if thoughts keep me up and give me hassle

TL;DR - long distance relationship- doesn't believe the other partner would cheat - but just worried about the idea of it.

But we no longer have a bully who puts us down but my mom seems sad for right now but I know she'll get better and I just want to make her happy again. Any advice?",10Sep2017,1
197,"Okay. A little background on me. I'm 27 and just got out of a four-year relationship. From 21-23 &amp; 1/2 I moved from home to Seattle, to Puyallup, to Chicago, back home, to a college town near home, Seattle again, Denver, then home again where I vowed myself single. Lo-and-behold I met my recent ex and we started dating a month after that. So I've always ran. I've always moved. I've always thought the place would make all the difference.


In the four years we were together I stayed in my hometown around the Black Hills. It was stable and I had routine, and for the most part I liked that. When we broke up I lived with my mom for a month trying to decide where I was going to move. Stay in my hometown? Move to Lincoln, Nebraska where my cousin lives? Back to Seattle where my best friend lives? Bozeman, MT because it's pretty and in between home and Seattle? Denver with a friend? Minneapolis with a friend?


I decided not to move anywhere where I had a friend asking me to come because I wanted to move on my own accord. Family is family so I chose Lincoln after visiting. I didn't want to stay in my hometown because I wanted to get away from the people, get away from people's judgments, not be in the same town as my ex, and gain some new experiences. I thought: the food and shopping will be better, my new job will be better, and I was in a sort of manic state of mind looking back on it. 


Well. I got here a bit over two weeks ago. I fucking hate it. I don't know where to go to do homework, I don't know where to go do yoga, the gym, no pretty hilly trails, no hiking, no places to relieve my stress. And yeah, I haven't really tried to find them because once I get in my apartment all of a sudden I get majorly depressed and lethargic. I started drinking too much and then when an especially shitty night came into existence, the next day I decided FUCK IT I'M MOVING HOME.


So I made all the arrangements. A place will transfer me in so I'll have a job in my hometown, I have a place to live (my grandma's until I save up enough money for an apartment), I found someone to help me move, and my lease is charging me $250 for breaking it. My manager wanted me to think on it for a bit without being impulsive. I'm supposed to have an answer by tomorrow.


I'm horrible at making decisions. I wish I'd have never moved here to begin with but then I wouldn't see what I'm taking for granted now so at least I'm learning. Like maybe I was running away from home (again) to get away from all of my problems because I didn't want to face them. I feel like if I move back home I'll have healthy habits to turn towards instead of drinking, I'll feel safe, and I'll be able to attack my old problems head-on. 


But if I move back wouldn't that just be running away from my problems here? Drinking too much, depression, not really looking for new yoga places or gyms or trails... but there's no Hills here. It's just flat. I miss the mountains (they're small mountains but still) and all I've been wanting to do is go on a hike by myself and figure this shit out in the Hills, my hometown, and I can't. 

**So do I stay in flat, Lincoln, NE and work out my problems or do I take this opportunity and move back home with a new sense of how I'm going to tackle my problems?**


I felt so overwhelmed because of the break-up that maybe I was being too manic in deciding 'I NEEDED TO GET OUT TO BE AWAY FROM MY EX' because that was the biggest thing. Maybe being in a new place away from close family and friends was the wrong decision, maybe moving back will help me because I can go back to my yoga studio, my gym, the hilly trails, the hiking, I know my safety and comforts, and I can get thru this break-up a lot easier without distracting myself when I know how to have healthy habits.


I know this is really long. I wanted to work out my thoughts on here. I don't know if any of you have been in the same position before or anything but it's hard to keep a schedule and routine right now I feel like I'm a plastic bag lost in Irma right now just fucking going crazy. I just want to be still.

Especially since the last girl I was dating months ago treated me like crap, kept ending it and coming back to me, and said it was all my fault and she still gives me disgusted looks to this day since I decided to stop pursuing her. Anyways my self esteem is shit, I am more awkward with people, I stutter more, being social at all has always been difficult but its worse now. I go out with friends but I always feel off being around others especially people I dont know.

Being a virgin and never making it to a relationship, plus feeling that the last girl I dated was the best I could ever do has made this all worse. Im waiting for my counseling appointments to be scheduled but for now I want some advice on how to improve myself so that I can at least network and come off more fun to people I interview with. I believe that Im just too accomodating, shy, awkward, and skinny to ever be enough for any girl and my past experiences solidify that for me. So Im working on moving away from ever trying to date again and to just be someone that people like having around so that I can at least get a good job and be bearable for my coworkers. 

I do seem liked by my friends and current coworkers amd other people Ive met over the summer basdd on all the great things they tell me but I still feel very awkward around people. Im just not that social, party kind of guy and I can tell its a buzzkill at times. No one ever says that Im a buzzkill but hanging out with me wont be anything great and I dont add much fun. Im just that guy that people like to go to for help or a favor and I like to help so I go for it so Im usually the designated driver.

200,"So I have a big problem in school. To you, it might seem like a problem that will never matter, a problem that seem small. To me, it is a big problem and it being solved means the world to me. The problem is that everyone at school hates me, but I like this really pretty girl. This girl seems to be the only one that understands my humor and doesn't think I am an asshole. When I go to school, people would bump into me on purpose. They say it is an accident but the amount of times they do it makes it obvious that it is on purpose. Even in an empty hallway, people would still do it and say that it was an accident. Whenever I get partnered up with someone, they always seem irritated when finding out that they have to work for me. In the end, they would dump the work all on me. And sometimes, people would leaves notes on my desk, saying that I shouldn't be here and that I should just keep my mouth shut with my unpopular opinions. The reason people hate me is because I have these jokes that are sarcastic and offensive, and that is a part of me. I have jokes that are about 9/11, suicide, and hitler. I also have unpopular opinions, like about shows, and music, and there was this one girl who everyone felt sorry for because she got in a fight where she got more beaten up by the other person, even though she was the one who started it by setting up the fight and inviting the other person to do it. Everyone says she is a victim and the other person was a bad person, but the other person was just defending their friends. Anyways, that is besides the point. Almost everyone hates me. 






Normally, I would be fine with it and wouldn't care but in this case, I care a lot. I like this girl. She is kind, smart, sweet, and just perfect to me. If I make a joke out loud in class, I would see her giggle or hold back a laugh. She is a quiet girl, and she is really shy. If you were to try to hold a conversation with her, she would reply with an answer that is really short and quiet. She doesn't really hang out with anyone. Usually, I would see her in lunch, not eating and just reading a book alone. When we are allowed to go outside, she would sit in front of the entrance to the school and read a book. She always wears this black hoodie and black tights. Everyone seems to like her. People would try to befriend her but she would push them away. I haven't tried to talk to her, only when we have to work together would we talk a little but otherwise, nope. I feel like if I try to be friends with her will just pull her down with me. I feel like it will just make people think that she is as bad as I am and that she deserves to be bullied or something, which I don't want to happen.















I really like this girl but everyone at school hates me and tries to hurt me in some way. I am scared that if I start talking to the girl and if we get along, that everyone is going to think that the girl doesn't matter and is as bad as I am and that she might get the hate that I do.

203,"Okay, first a quick background of me. 

I am an 18 yr old male living in Pennsylvania. I cook for a living and passion, and pretty damn good at it. As cutthroat as the industry is, I wouldn't trade it for anything else. I graduated high school this past June. Into video games, skateboarding, guitar, music, tv, psychedelics and weed.

Onto the actual issue: I need help getting friends again. My social life has crashed and burned and I need to start over. Why? I recently had to break up from a terrible relationship with my girlfriend for a year and a half. On top of that, I am not going to college, but getting certs relevant to my profession. Because no college, any friends I did have are either moving away to college, straight up moving states, or all of a sudden work fulltime jobs where our schedules dont match up.

 I work 45-50 hrs a week, I have little time for things I wanna do. The hours I work are either 11am-8pm, taking up the whole day, or 5am-3pm, and I'm too tired for anything so I just oversleep the rest of the day until my next shift.

Because I am only working, the only interaction with people are at work, who are all significantly older than me. I dont have anyone to go with to any social places, and I hate going alone to places. Too young for bars and 21+ venues, but I hate alcohol with a passion. And the servers at my work are all my age or younger, but they either are in school or just dont like me cause I've tried all the worthwhile ones (I'm also in the market for a new girlfriend)

So I feel stuck. Anyone I happen to meet is:
-Not my age
-Share no interests
-Going to school/college
-Other factors which make me dislike them

Now I understand the only way to meet people is to get out, yet I still just can't understand how, in today's world, you get to meet any potential friend or girlfriend. People just dont walk up to others and start conversation from where I'm from (Philly area). People just mind their own. Really the only reason to think someone is okay is judging off of their looks (which I dont believe in, but probably only because I am not too great looking myself. My hair is the only thing I got going for me. 

I dont know what I should do. My friends are gone, my relationship failed, through no fault of my own. And also I do come from a good middle-class house and family, but I dont really get any fulfilment from talking to family. I feel its just forced cause they're family sometimes. I'm not asking for sympathy, I'm looking for a way out of this endless cycle of wake up, work my ass off, take a random (safe) drug, sleep, repeat. Hell, I shit more at work than I do at home.

So if you made it this far, what can I do? And is anyone a similar situation? Thanks for taking the time to read and reply. I will respond to comments as much as I can. ",10Sep2017,1
204,"Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to create video games for children. I wanted to make them happy and that's all I cared about. I'm 22 years old now and I just dropped college after 3 weeks...

After 3 attempts (4 years) of trying being accepted in a 3D animation program in the best College of where I live. I decided to drop it because I was starting to get sick and depressed. When I was a kid, I hated school because I was getting intimidated (violently/psychologically) by my teachers and the students.

First week went well, but I was quite exhausted. I already have an anxiety problem linked to school (but which doesn't apply to my job, don't know why). I started to vomit sometimes because of the anxiety, crying, not being able to sleep and barely eating.

The second week I was feeling empty inside, I stopped laughing, smileing and telling jokes. So did a bunch of students in my program. I was barfing everyday because of the anxiety, crying in my bed, not being able to sleep and barely eating.

The third week however, was a disaster. We did an activity in our class talking about what time we should take to study, eat etc... I ended up with a result like this :

-PER WEEK- -37:30 of time being at school. -19 hours of homeworks/study. -4 hours at my work. -21 hours for eating (most definitely less, probably more like 12) -17 hours of travelling. -38:30 hours of sleep.

My teacher was stunned when I told him the result. He asked me if I was gaming and such, I told him that I was playing video games 5 hours per week. He was in shocked.

I started to have trouble to understand and being focussed in my classes. All of my teachers were nice dudes tho, but I still had problems. I asked an employee of the administration of the college if I could have some help, he referred me to someone, which I met. When we both sat down, I started to tell her everything. She told me that the schedule was like that on purpose, that the college wanted everyone who wasn't able to deal with it to leave. She told me that it wasn't alright at all that they do that but the director did anyway.

She then rudely told me '' there, sign your name on this, so we can cancel some classes for you so you can complete your degree in 5 years instead of 3, so sign now, because I have to meet other people.'' I took the pen and...I wasn't able to sign. A voice inside me told me to leave NOW.

So I did. I told my parents the news and they respected it. My mother came to pick me up. I wasn't crying until I saw her, I was so ashamed of myself, I asked them to forgive me and she was surprised of my reaction. She told me that it's alright, that when in the morning she was seeing me, that she was sad, troubled, wandering if today I will be able to make it or not. She was really preoccupied by me.

Should've stayed?...Was it a good price for being in a school where I

**tl;dr**: I dropped college due to my anxiety getting out of control. I wasn't able to sleep, to eat, to laugh and to be joyful. The college gave an inhuman schedule on purpose to kick out the people who wasn't able to do it. Should've stayed there anyway?...

207,"Hello ladies and gents! 

First things first, I just want to say that this seemed like the most relevant place to post something like this, but if anyone can think of somewhere the post would be better suited to, please let me know through message or comment. Right. I’ll get started. 
Two friends of mine (and myself, obviously) have recently moved into residence for our first year at university. We’ve had a lot of tertiary friends over the years, but have remained as a ‘core’ group for about 13 years. Not trying to waste your time, just giving a little context.
 
However, there’s always been one individual who is consistently ‘on the outside looking in’. We’ll call him Josh. Despite his quirks, we made a great effort and took great pains to include Josh during the high school years. We lived in a pretty intolerant place, and like I said, he has many quirks (for example, he runs a Facebook page where he posts entire Wikipedia articles about superheroes and claimed he wrote them himself – his Nerd Rants. He wore The Riddler’s suit to prom, to which he did not have a date, apart from his mom for all the pictures...) He made himself comfortable, but we never considered him a permanent fixture. We believed he would naturally drift off when high school was finally over.

But that was not to be. He managed to determine which university we had all been accepted to, and put in an application himself. As it turned out, he was accepted as well. He effectively followed us to our choice university, with no regard to what school would be best for his career. He displays almost addiction-like magnetism to the three of us. 
I know I might be judged for not automatically welcoming someone like that, but I expect many others will understand the issue. This person does not mesh well with the friend group, but persists endlessly. The three of us arranged to be placed in a dorm together, alongside a fourth roommate, a stranger. This was ideal for us; we got to meet someone new, and we were spared rooming with Josh. Still, he was not dissuaded. He moved as well – and managed to track us down not ten minutes after arriving on campus. He too lives in residence, a floor above us and on the opposite wing. 

Here is the heart of the issue.

Being in this kind of environment has amplified his behavior. He is at our room whenever he is not in class; leaving only to shower, sleep, and change clothes. He does nothing but sit around on his phone and simply exist in our space. He segues all rational or relevant conversation into topics he’s more comfortable with; video games, comic books, movies, and other pop-culture material. Which is fine. But it paints a picture of an individual who lacks anything defining about him. Our attempts to meet new people are stymied by his incessant need to prove how ‘nerdy’ he is. We managed to sneak out and have lunch without him today, only to find him in our suite when we returned. We forgot to lock the door on the way out, and he just kind of let himself in and waited. I was thoroughly creeped the fuck out by this, which spurred me to write this post. And please don’t recommend that I lock the door from now on, that’s just a given. 

My friends and I are at our wits end. The ideal situation would be if he left entirely and found a more fitting group to be friends with -  I don’t want him to be miserable and alone. But I also want my peace back. Please understand, if you can. I’m not vindictive, and we’re not malicious people. But every time we attempt to be honest with him, he takes extreme personal offense to what we say. Nobody should have to change who they are for their friends, I understand that. But the way he presents himself at presents makes everyone uncomfortable. For example; someone will mention that wearing a Riddler costume to prom is cringe-worthy. Josh will respond: “What’re you talking about? The Riddler is a cool character. He teamed up with the Joker in such-and-such issue of the comics. What’s your problem with him?” It’s completely tone-deaf and absolutely compounds the problem, especially when others are listening and form an opinion based on what they just heard. And that would be fine, but no one else in the group reads comics. It’s difficult, and I’m hoping even a small fraction of you can see my point of view. Thanks, reddit. 

TL;DR: Overly clingy ‘friend’ will not leave our group in peace. Let himself into our university dorm and waited for us to return when we avoided him. Any words of wisdom or advice in dealing with this without being the worst person ever? Thanks reddit.

209,"for now, lets call my male friend John who is 23 years old and the other girl Helga who is 16 to make it easy

So it's been happening for a while so basically there's this girl named Helga who has a pretty shit life irl and my friend John has been hanging out with her and after finding out about her I felt bad for her and became her friend just so she wouldn't feel like shit. So around mid-June John has started to ignore me and part of it had to do with that he had family over at his place and I was totally fine with it since real life came first. But Helga would always bug him to come to her Discord voice chat despite John being busy with his family and came to Discord VC regardless and was feeling pretty miffed at the time since Helga legit had many other friends she could have bugged to come with her on VC but seemed to have specifically bugged John to be with him on in VC

After that happened I stayed away from Helga and let John be with his business since being around Helga wasn't doing me any favors and felt like the day I got mad at John I was being clingy but as time passed on I got invited to VC to talk with some friends and Helga was there was telling John if she could call him Daddy and asked to marry him as a joke and John said yes to both offers and that was when I started to get suspicious since John has said in the past that he was asexual and was very against dating underaged girls and I feel like he's only going along with her flirting just because she has a mental illness and like I don't even know I don't want to say anything to Helga or otherwise she will everyone that I hate her but I also sit there and do nothing either and I feel like Helga is going to pressure John into something questionable and will only go along with it just because Helga has a mental illness and can't decline her wishes",10Sep2017,1
213,"Hey guys, recently, I completed college with my BA in Economics and, shortly after, I became a contracted Inventory Analyst for a company. I was with the company for about 5 months (my contract period) and we'll ultimately I wasn't happy/satisfied with working an 8-5, sitting behind a desk all day type of job. I'm good at what I do, but I was wondering if others, here possibly, have a career or could give me some ideas of a career path that require an economic background; however, isn't confined to a desk.

214,"Ok so this here is all about my heart/ in the meaning of love and stuff. 

I'm 20.5 years old I had 2 relationships till now One Not so good but 2 years lasting and One wich was a blast but only took 2.5 months.

The 2.5 months One is the Most recent was really the best time i could have until she and presumeably I changed. It just Started to hurt and after a week i just couldn't anymore. It was to much when looking at the circumstances (fam. Is really f*cked right now). So I ended it and after 3 days I was over it (somehow my first relationship even though it was sheit took me weeks to get over) 

Anyways fast forward to last friday went on a roadtrip with a friend of Mine visiting 2 friends wich live ~ 300 km away from my place, One is a girl i get along with pretty well and yeah it comes pretty sudden but Not surprising, I think I Fell for her somehow, but she is confusing me my heart can't decide what the freaking Heck is going on and my mind is just blurry and without orientation.

I could really need help to understand that, or somebody explaining me what kind of morron I am (even thou i think I am pretty much an Idiot)

216,"Okay, so I'm gonna be very honest with you guys. Because, I need the best advice possible. My girlfriend have been in a Long Distance relationship for over 2 years now.. We've gone back and forth to see each other often. I'm 21 and she's 20

She's coming here for a month in January for her holidays to spend time with me.. She doesn't know quite yet that i'm planning on proposing during that month, but we both are just so tired of this back and forth thing going on. 

So that being said, I don't want to spend a crazy amount of money on an engagement ring but I don't want to spend little amounts of money either... 
You see I've never thought about the idea of marriage ever in my entire life so this concept is just entirely new to me.. It didn't even hit me that I wanted to marry her until almost a year ago. I am madly in love with this woman so this whole process and mindset is just so new to me and completely overwhelming. 

What should i do? Where should I start? Should I plan the proposal first then get the ring? Should I get the ring? How much should I spend? ",10Sep2017,1

219,"I'll be moving from the Pacific Northwest to the United Kingdom for a year to complete a Masters program. A few of my friends have said they'd like to come out and visit throughout the year and I've been looking forward to seeing them and showing them where I'll be living and learning. A friend of mine was asking about specific dates, about 11 days, where she would stay with me in my studio room. She then tacked on in the end that her friend, one who I've known for four years but am not friends with at all or particularly like very much, would probably come along too. She asked if that would be alright with me.

My issue with this is two-fold: 1) I don't like this person very much, but even more so 2) I feel like I'd just end up hosting them for their vacation together as a free place to stay. This happened to me when I was living near Downtown Seattle and it felt really shitty. 

That being said, I wanted to hear what other people have to say on the issue. I do understand that it is a vacation for my friends who will come to visit me, but at the same time I want to spend time with them without being used solely as a cheap host. ",10Sep2017,1
222,"I've been a math instructor at a learning center for the past 14 months now. Two weeks ago I was given a paper pay stub for the first time in all my time working there. Our pay stubs were emailed to us but you needed a password to see it which I literally didn't know nor was one given to me. 

Anyway, I looked at my pay stub and it said I was being paid $9.00 and hour and minimum wage in my state is $10.00. I was kinda confused for a second because I've been employee of the month three times as well as I only really work 16-17 hours a week. 

I feel as if I've been taken advantage of by my boss, who drives to work in her Audi A7 :( I can't really save for college effectively with &lt;$250 every two weeks when I work really hard every day. I have never taken a sick day, NEVER been late, came in early every time when asked, never complained, never even taken my phone out of my pocket ONCE in 14 months while my boss goes on Instagram every 20 minutes. 

I have gotten an interview for a new job that can pay me well and give me good hours. But I really don't want to give a two week notice and I just want to leave and never go back. Thanks in advance for advice and I apologize for my run-in sentences. 

TLDR: I'm paid minimum wage and I don't want to give a two week notice I want to leave and start my new job.

224,"I want to ask my friend if she’s into me. How does this sound?

Hi
Hope your evening is going well! 

Yesterday you said we are friends and I agree 100%.  But sometimes I feel as tho their might be something more or maybe I’m reading to much into things.  I also don’t want to ruin our friendship or get in the way of you and (other friend). But I had to ask. I’m sorry to drop this on you like this, I wanted to ask last night but I’m very unsure of myself.   I want you know I am ok with just being friends, hanging out and having fun if that is still possible.

225,"Ive really tried to be polite and friendly with this guy. We dont always see eye-to-eye and thats fine because ive never let it bother me or never let him believe I had any less respect for him. but the other day he decided that he didnt want to follow proticol and wanted me to do something different than I was suppose to and I didn't like that. I tried to meet him and protocol half way and he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful and I (who was not responding correctly) yelled at him saying that he was just upset cuz i didn't do exactly what he wanted. I should note that my supervisor is Tanzanian and im a women so there is def a cultural barrier and thats fine, doesn't mean Im going to obey his every whim. So he decides to report me and I get written up and its basically cuz i yelled back at him and yes that was not the right response but there is it. Like I said we sometimes dont meet eye-to-eye but thats just the industry we are in and I have never treated him any less than my supervisor and coworker and I've always been crazy nice to him. I say hello to him every morning, ask him how hes doing, i joke around with him and do everything to make sure he knows that just because we dont agree on things doesn't mean we need to hate each other. So now that HIS OWN ego is bruised by my lack of obedience I get written up for being insubordinate or whatever. I feel like he has crossed a line in our relationship and gives me no reason to continue to be nice or cordial to him. Would I be fanning the flames if I reduced our conversation to nothing but work? Am I being too spiteful about this whole thing? Cuz from my end if someone is gonna act like that about a little tift between us I really dont wanna put in the effort to make our relationship less tense. ",10Sep2017,1
