1,"I'm a mess, lol. Don't really want to deal with reality anymore. Don't actually care that much. Just feel like thinking about it a little too much from time to time ( and posting things like this post ).
I'm completely delusional. I despise, absolutely despise, the chain of events that has led me to be this person, in this space and time, in this life. I despise reality. I despise the context I live in, the people, the society. I despise it. I despise my family. I despise parts of myself. The parts that have to face the outside world and don't belong fully to my own little world. I'd like ( but not really want, I don't really ''want'' anything ) nothing more than to have all of *this* erased and start over. Maybe reincarnation? Like, another person with my good bits having a good life and opportunities to pursue related interests? Or maybe still me, but like, everything that's wrong being erased and it all starting over, right this time.


I don't have dreams, nor goals, nor anything really. I don't want to try to bother getting into anything too much, because doing things is absolute torture. I only like, and want, immediate results. I only like the perfect ideas, the imaginative plane. Dedicating myself to seriously trying to anything at all? In...reality? I'd rather keep fantasizing about whatever I'm interested in, and consume related media, and stay in my comfortable little world until I can't anymore. 


I'll definitely end it next year. I've made up my mind. I can't and don't really want to talk to anyone because I'm delusional. None of the normies around me would ever understand. They have no idea who I truly am inside, what I really think and feel. 
lol I sounded a bit edgy there, sorry


Anyway, uh...advice? Or maybe just replies in general. I don't think I can get any actual advice from here. Not like I'm gonna follow it. I've made up my mind. If I could live in fantasy, perfectly, with infinite potential, possibilites, freedom, like a God, I'd love it. Maybe I'll get reincarnated, maybe I'll just free myself from this torment and it'll be over. 
I'll also post this on the more appropriate subreddit I guess. 
But still...uhh, don't ignore me? I'd like replies. ",23Nov2017,1
3,I live with my Grandmother and I have an Aunt that is quite abusive to her. She lives elsewhere but she occasionally comes to visit to either leech off of our internet or take out her anger on my Grandmother. This morning while I was away at school she had locked my Grandmother in her room for 6 hours... This is not the first time she has done crude shit to her. I want to get the police involved and make it so that she is not allowed to meet my Grandmother anymore but my Grandmother adamantly does not want them to be involved. I'm quite concerned since my Grandmother is not at the best of health and I am not sure what to do. It is quite hard to get other family involved since my Aunt is deaf and not many of us are well versed in sign language.,23Nov2017,1
4,"So my boyfriend and I broke up briefly. On our 10month anni he walked with some other girl who he's been interested in. We argued etc; and 4 days later he had me drive down to him so we could talk about moving in together and see each other. We immediately had sex (twice) but he was still saying he had plans with the other girl. 

We got in a car accident the day I came down, caused by his best friend. I saw his head slam against the windshield and he still talked about plans with this other girl tomorrow.. like we didn't almost just die. 

That night we stayed in a hotel. I've been destroying myself for close to a week now at this point with alcohol and not eating. I can still barely eat it just tastes like ash in my mouth and moths in my stomach. That same night he took me back and we made love. 

We spent two weekends together and last night when I came back from seeing him my brother scared me and shook me.. he told me I was being lied to and left... I panicked and didn't react right. I wanted to talk to my boyfriend but I wanted to protect him and us from anything bad happening.

I msg'd him random things like betrayal and that I was heartbroken. He was confused but I feel like he had to know somewhere (he doesn't take responsibility for his actions and is a bit selfish) we argued and he ignored me and my feelings. I wanted to be civil and just talk but he only got more angry and eventually hung up on me..

I made another bad decision and called him numerous times on every different media. Panicking, feeling misunderstood and abandoned by the person I love most... I didn't mean to... 

We talked today I have no idea where he stands. He still says he loves me but it sounds again like he wants to leave me when last night was just a mistake and if he would've just talked to me and told me what was going on everything would've been fine.. but he hung up and abandoned me...

He said he wouldn't call me on his break because he didn't want his day to suck... 

He said he would call me after he's off work...

I've been drinking and wondering the streets like a maniac because this is my last straw. I just can't keep giving to people and having them abuse and misuse me. For them to not consider my feelings. 

I want him to understand and us to be together. I want to work past and forget about all of this so we can be happy again like we were...

Do I answer him tonight if he calls? If he doesn't do I call him tomorrow? Will he see and understand what I do if I leave it be? What do I do? How can he say he loves me and yet wants to leave and treat me like this? I have never been of acted like this...

What do I do?",23Nov2017,1
5,"Hey there Reddit, I'm a 21/M and I'm Stuck on this decision. The choice goes as follows: rejoin the army or stay as a civi and see if my civilian career becomes fruitful. So some context is in order to explain my army career I joined at 18 and being a soldier is all I ever wanted it's what kept me going when I was Living in my abusive home getting beaten and emotionally degraded. When I joined however things didn't work out how I thought. I could deal with basic drill sergeants and the stress of soldering but what was breaking me down was the constant mocking of others. Growing up my father would break me down by teasing me about being skinny and not as fast as other kids, and when I went to basic it was the same thing. Every day I was being made fun of and ridiculed because I was skinny and I didn't act like ""a black guy"" (I'm black by the way) basically because I could talk well I was being made fun of by the other black basic trainees, but I pushed through it I wanted to be a soldier and I wanted to probe the people who looked down on me wrong so I graduated and got shipped to my unit. I was stationed in Fort polk and when I made it there THE same thing happened to me again. I got made fun of every single day by my entire platoon because I was tall and skinny and talked different I would ask for them to stop but no one would and I didn't want to fight cause I didn't want to have them take my rank and shit away so I just sucked up. I also started having family issues back home so id beg my fellow soldiers and even talk to my nco about it to just give me a break no such break was given. They even made it worse would come in my room and destroy my shit it was fucking hell. I thought it was my fault that I was doing something wrong I would always help everyone and try my best to not fuck up but I just felt alone. My roommate was the only one who was cool with me never made fun of me and he taught me a lot honestly, but no one likes him either but he could fight so no one fucked with him. What eventually happened was my entire platoon excluding me and my roommate jumped a new soldier we had coming in and my roommate and I were able to record it and brought to ig and they began kicking them all out, but it was a slow process they would try to make sure I knew they weren't happy I told. I remember when I finally snapped they threw pizza all over my new truck that I freshly bought I was so mad I went up to them and for the first time challenged everyone to fight if they hated me but everyone didn't want to do that and no one fessed up to it but after that they all laid off. After they all left I started working out heavily and gained weight I also got made a team leader because we needed that. This was the happiest part of my army career honestly we got a whole bunch of new guys and they loved me and I loved them. I took care of everyone made sure to be the leader I wanted it actually became a thing that everyone knew if something goes wrong I'll be there to help. I even talked a soldier down from suicide and helped him rehabilitate I felt like a leader and a good one I even had my battalion commander thank me and shake my hand for helping as much as I did. That shit didn't last lol. My company command did not care for me though cause they preferred the old soldiers and because I didn't have amazing or scores had like a 240 of score at the time so they decided to take my team leader spot and put me under the command of a guy who was friends with all the guys that kicked out. He made sure he knew he hated me for getting his friends kicked out. Every shit task or duty you can think of I got I went from being a team leader to being treated like I just got there and the fucked thing is HE WOULD OPENLY ADMIT HE TREATED ME LIKE SHIT all the time and no one did shit. I was miserable I felt like nothing I did mattered so I made the biggest mistake of my life I tried to kill my self. I know it was stupid, and this isn't an excuse but I just felt horrible like all I ever would get is bad and I never deserves life so I went to slit my wrists my girlfriend called me and stopped me and I took myself in the hospital. After that I was just done with the army I did the little time I had left and got out. Now that you have context here is my choice.     
  I miss being a soldier it's all I ever wanted to be, but I'm also waiting on becoming a police officer should I just wait to become an officer or go back and give it a chance again?",23Nov2017,1

8,"So me and my friend have known each other for a while but have recently became good friends in the past few weeks. The other day we were hanging out and took a bunch of stupid videos then posted them on instagram. The next day I was watching them and realized how dumb they made us look, so I deleted them. She texted me asking why I deleted them. I answered honestly, she never answered back. Next day I texted her asking if we were still going to the event that night. No answer all day. I know she's been online.  I apologized for upsetting her, no answer.  I never went to the event (which mind you, I was really looking forward to) because she never answered. I was thinking I'd just give her some space and she'd get over it, like I've seen happen with her and several of our friends. 

Thoughts? Advice? I don't have many friends and I really felt like we clicked better than I do with most people , so I'm disappointed that our relationship might be wrecked. ",23Nov2017,2
9,"I have had paranoia since I was small but I am losing it now! I always went on vacation with my parents but this time around they are going alone and I fear for their safety, the paranoia thinking ranges from plane crash to whatever is bad in the world! I can't focus properly now, my exams are coming and the paranoia is taking away my focus.

I always had this thought of needing to protect my family from harm and when I can't do it I start losing control of my thoughts and emotions. This paranoia is the worst I have ever had because every second even when driving I keep on thinking about it. I can't stop imagining how planes will crash, how someone might kill my loved ones, I can't stop this emotion, paranoia and bad imaginations from coming in.

11,"I'm 18, 5'4, and I weight about 138 pounds at the moment. A few months ago I used to be at 116 pounds but ever since I started going to the gym, I've been eating a lot more. 

Back when I was a freshman in high school, my belly used to be flat, like really flat. My abs would show and I think at that time I weighed around 95 pounds. I have a fast metabolism so that's why I weighed so low back then. 

I still do have a fast metabolism I believe because I am still skinny everywhere else (my arm length has always been the same how it was back then) the only place I gain fat is my belly. I'm literally skinny everywhere else but my belly. 

I started gaining weight like probably in my junior year of high school, I don't know how I gained 20 pounds to become 116 when I've always been eating the same. Back in freshman year of highschool I used to eat A LOT of junk food and still had no belly fat. I didn't even eat much at the time, back then I'd probably eat like 4-5 meals a day. I'd never get hungry.

Ever since my junior year of high school, I just gradually started gaining fat in my belly area, i don't know how, but maybe my metabolism is slowing down? Mind you, I'm still skinny everywhere else.

It must be genetics though, so I guess there's not much I can do. I feel like if I started eating less again, I'd just get skinnier in other areas beside my belly. I've been doing a lot of cardio specifically to burn the belly fat but it's only helped a little.",23Nov2017,0
12,"Two weeks ago, a friend of mine bought two beta keys for a program. He sold me one of them, and he told me the program was going to be fully working for last week.

The company has a no-refund policy and I'm trying to get my money back. I'm going to need the program again this weekend, and it seems the developers are not going to solve the problems in a short time. Should I ask my friend for my money? Or should I push the company so they refund everyone who wants it? The program is literally not working at all. They're saying they're working on it but it seems it has too many bugs and that it could take months so it works correctly. (The program isn't in beta anymore, it's open to public.) ",23Nov2017,1
13,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to put this!

I have been considering changing doctors for awhile. I've only been seeing my current one for a short time (and she is in the same practice as my first doctor), but I really like her. She was one of the first people I've discussed my depression with. She recommended me to my current therapist. She is understanding of some of my medical-related phobias and is willing to work around them.

The problem comes from the expense. I have had to go to the doctor a lot this year, from physical illnesses and from trying to figure out an antidepressant. I am also unemployed/starting a business (ie. living off savings).

I was considering concierge doctors in the area. Unfortunately, it would increase my drive from 15 minutes to 30. I would be paying monthly, but it looks like it would still be cheaper than what I've paid so far this year and I wouldn't have to consider if something is worth the cost of an office visit.

On the upside, I wouldn’t have to deal with rushed appointments. I wouldn’t have nearly indecipherable bills passed through insurance showing up all the time. I wouldn’t have rushed appointments after sitting in the waiting room for an hour.

I am worried about the doctor/therapist relationship, although they do not communicate regularly.

I am worried about finding a doctor who is understanding of my issues, and I am scared to go through the interviews and possibly face judgmental doctors.

I am worried about changing doctors in the middle of trying to find an antidepressant that works.

A big part of my hesitation is because I feel guilty about the thought of changing doctors. I know that is not a good reason to make this type of decision, but I still feel it. She has been a wonderful doctor. When I first went in to discuss depression, she was very supportive. She even scheduled it before her lunch break (I think) so that she’d have extra time. If it were simply a matter of the doctor, I’d definitely stay with her.

Does anybody have advice on this?",23Nov2017,1
14,"Today I was driving my friend back home to his house. After dropping him off I continued on and turned the corner. Before you ask, it was 10:30 AM and I was going the speed limit. A dog ran out in the middle of the road and I didn't see her in time and clipped her with the front of my car. I found the dog's owner just up the road and told them what had happened and exchanged my information. They took the dog to the vet and it will cost them about $800 just for the visit. Would I be able to use my (parents) car insurance to cover this? Do I need to call the police? This is exactly the opposite of what I wanted to happen before thanksgiving. Fuck me

16,"Hey Reddit, This is the first time I post on this subreddit. I'm a 22 year old guy and I seek advice on a certain topic. This may be a long and boring text, but please hear me out. Recently, I've been abundantly travelling. I absolutely love to do so. There isn't much that can get in my way when it comes to exploring a new place or living an exciting adventure.

However, I was offered an important position regarding work. This position will alter my schedule and my vacation time. Ever since I was hired in this company, I was always super interested in this particular position. I didn't think the opportunity would come so soon. I recently had an interview for this job and it went very well.

Long story short, Reddit, my question to you is, should a 22 year old guy give up the love of travelling, meeting new people and exploring the world? or should he take this opportunity, that may never come back and tie himself down to his hometown and work from there?

This is quite a broad situation and i'm absolutely torn in between both these options. If you were to choose one or the other, please tell me and try to explain why you would take that decision. This is really a black and white situation, it's either one or the other.

24,"I was recently sexually assaulted by a girl I knew at a party in a hotel. Her name is Fiona, and she's one of those hot college chicks that's super into sports. I'm a skinny teenage guy, so she had the upper-hand physically 100%. I've known her off and on for the past few years. I was solidly drunk, but not wasted after drinking two Four Locos and a PBR. She was moderately drunk, but not very. At the party, she was really affectionate; like all handsy by touching my neck and chest. None of it was overtly sexual, but there were obvious undertones now that I think back. I should have noticed those red flags, but I just didn't. At the party's peak, there were around 20 to 25 people in the hotel suite doing everything from watching TV in the bedroom to snorting lines of Cocaine off the countertop in the bathroom that was connected to the main area of the room and also the bedroom. That peak happened at 11 PM. Everything was fine until the crowd thinned out because a guest in a neighboring room knocked on our door and told us that we had to quiet down or he'd call the cops. That spooked the guys doing coke in the bathroom, so they left. The guys in the bedroom also left out of boredom I guess. That left my core friend group and also Fiona. Fiona asked me if I wanted to walk with her to get some ice from the machine down the hall. I went with her and while we were getting the ice, she made the bold move of putting her hands under my shirt and worked them under my waistband and down. I honestly didn't care. I was too drunk to care. If I was sober, I would have honestly probably welcomed it. Her and I went back to the room and she walked with the ice into the bedroom. Confused, I followed and asked why she brought it away from the main area. When I got closer to her, she put on this different, more suave personality. She asked me how many different people I had had sex with and then it slowly moved from talking to acting. I have no idea what happened. I was nervous, and froze up. Then it happened. I never really thought it would be so easy for a guy to be raped because there has to of course be a constant erection, but she made sure that wouldn't have been an issue. She forced herself on me, and everything went according to her plan. Physically, it was sex, so it was amazing in a twisted sort of way, but emotionally, I felt completely betrayed and tricked. She pinned my arms above my head and rode me cowgirl-style. I was a fucking goner. 
My overwhelming feelings are telling me that I don't care and that it wasn't a big deal. I'm completely lost. I haven't told anybody close to me about what happened because the girl's hot. This is a classic case of victim blaming, and I feel like a textbook example of sexual assault. ",23Nov2017,1

29,"I moved to a new country recently where it seems people are very sensitive to me. They're always olagonin’ that I smell terrible, I stink, that I need bathe. I get stares, people walking away, and people covering their noses. The nicest thing anyone said was as bad as I smell like the scent of death. I'm starting to imagine that they aren't just taking the piss at me and I actually do have an odor.

Now in my old country, I didn't take traditional baths, I was actually homeless, or houseless. Not a beggar either, I lived in the forest/woods and would usually hunt game for food. I was quite proficient with a bow and able to make wears and outfits out of them. But I did actually go to usually the same waterfall and wash myself in it. Even sometimes relax in the water like a hot tub.

In my old country I also had to many lovers and men that I would occasionally try living with or sleep with. Even would occasionally go out on the lash and get langered. None of them mentioned any smells. In addition to that, I have had more men and even women that I could count give me cunnilingus pleasures. So I don't understand all the heat I get now.

I've tried fitting in with the new traditions, plenty also say I'm too caked up and that I'd be clean on natural. I like and I want to have tons of mascara and makeup that's more of just a habit. There's also the talk about my choice of wears, I try to fit in, but I do occasionally wear the animals skins and fur as outfits I used to wear back then. I'd assume maybe this is why people walk away from me, but they say I shouldn't show so much skin; and that I'd never get a job with all the markings and tattoos I have. I do wear clothes from this country every now and again but it doesn't help the comments I get.

I'm still scundered when they say I stink, living here with a man also from where I'm from, no one has ever said he stunk. And here I am taking bathes a day trying to rid of the odor. Even when I ask him do I smell bad, he only responds close to, I don't smell like the people here do. Which sounds like a nice way of saying I do have an odor.

How, how do I get rid of it? I've been boggled for weeks and ends trying to get rid of the smell. It just won't leave, even the few guys that walk up to flirt with me ends up running off because they claim I smell or nicely enough finds an excuse to change their mind.

31,"I'm having an issue with the guy I am with. I am extremely jealous of the past. Yes, the past. Everytime he compliments me or says he likes me, there's a little voice in the back of my head saying, ""he's said that before to others."" It kind of invalidates what he is saying about me. It's completely fucked. I don't know why I'm like this but it's tearing me apart. It hurts him that I don't believe what he says and it hurts him that I keep bringing up the past/getting upset about it. 

I sincerely do not understand why his past with other girls makes me feel so insecure about what we have now. Maybe it's because this is my first time being with someone who has been with other girls. Sometimes I just sit and think about all the good times he's had with them and I feel so fucking miserable about it. Like how could he have a good time now if he had a good time with another girl?

I mostly compare myself to them. Like, ""has girl A done this before?"" or ""what did you love about girl b."" He answers honestly because he has no problem talking about them.

36,"So like the title says, there is an unknown person trespassing on my parents land. They first thought something was off when the were driving the 4 wheeler around their trail and find a pocket knife. Not to weird since they just bought it earlier this year. Maybe they missed it. Who knows how long that might have been there but it looked to be in good shape. Then just today they were riding on the trail again and found a fresh piece of cornbread! A little stale but not moldy or anything. I am willing to bet money someone dropped it somehow out while walking around out there or something.

44,"I know women are just as unpredictable, so advice from anyone is appreciated, but this deals specifically with a guy. 

I met someone on Tinder who lives a half hour away from me. We exchanged Snapchats and spoke for a month straight, where we agreed to only be friends and stuff. Basically right off the bat, we had this awesome vibe and we would kinda flirt? He would send me videos or pictures every now and then and I'd do the same. Well, one day he just never opened my chat. 

I checked on him to make sure he was alright (he has depression) and he said something - long story - was bothering him but he threw in a white lie about the date of the event that was bothering him. So that was a little fishy to me. We didn't talk for a week, at which point he sent me a video of him and his sister. I responded in a chat and he answered, and then I complimented him and his whole mood changed and I could tell he was happy and literally blushing at this.

Later that night, he asked to hang out in person the next day so we did. We grabbed some food and talked for about three hours... ever since that night we talked for almost a week straight like normal. He wasn't sending me snaps though, but we were talking about future plans (as in doing stuff together soon; not getting married or anything like that lol) and he even said he wanted to meet my family. I said I'd love to meet his as well because I wanted to show I'm interested. 

Today is my birthday. He knows this, I told him in person and he even said he was going to buy me something (which I don't actually expect). We were talking normally yesterday up until the evening where he stopped responding again. No happy birthday today... nothing. I sent him a message and I'm gonna yell at him if he responds. Basically, I caught some feelings and I'm a little upset. Thankfully not upset enough to ruin my birthday.
Everyone is telling me to drop him, but for whatever god damn reason, the universe is telling me to not give up and it's this feeling really deep inside of me. It just feels right.

That's until one day, when my Spanish professor, did something that left me thinking if this wrong or not... Note that is my first time that happened to me.

When I arrived fom my university, I was on time to take the 2nd part of my communication class test. It was easy, but the section where I have to choose five questions is where I spent a lot of my time plus the revisions into making sure that the questions are correctly answered (or I think that's the correct one). I spent all the entire class doing the test, and I have studied and  I got the extra time (I'm into vocational rehabilitation) to finish the test. Then I go to my Spanish class and I was 10 minutes late...

What I did (unconsciously) is that I entered the class, they we're on class discussing about the accents. The teacher was on her desk and the student on the chair, just a few feet away and I just passed right through them saying nothing (I'm also that kind of person who is very quiet and for me is hard to even say good morning with morals, which makes me feel awkward myself, so I think that counts) and sat on my chair. My teacher tells me, in FRONT of the class of why I was late to class, and I explained why I got late: ""I got late because I was doing a test."" Later said ""That's okay"" but then it later say: ""But you need to know how to use morals."" All in front of the class. I felt nothing at first, but it hit me later when I was talking to my mom.

I told her about what happened in Spanish class. When she heard about it, she thought of 2 possible things: maybe the teacher was trying to correct you or correcting you but in a bad manner. By a bad manner, I mean, that behind that last sentence she says, and how is constructed,  including it was talked in front of the class, it can also mean something more like ""You're a uneducated person"". She passed through that as well in her university years. It leaves me confused if this teacher really humiliated me in front of the class, in a indirect way. Also I have morals, just in crowded settings I get very shy and not talk a lot and is hard for me to show morals in front of everyone because it can get awkward, unless they ask me something. I didn't show her that also I'm into vocational rehabilitation and dosen't know about my ""condition"".

So do you think that the teacher humiliated me? I need more answers to find the truth of her sentence about I need to have morals. To be honest, later I felt bad about it... also I don't know if it's my fault because my failure to show morals, I have seen people getting late and passing through them on class, and they didn't care about it.",23Nov2017,1

___________________________________________________
**Hi name, 

In this email I would like to discuss the coursework marks i have gained during this semester for infomgmt 392. Based on the canvas results, I have gained a total of 25/60 for coursework marks this semester, which is not above 50% to pass the course. Which is what I would like to discuss in this email, During the semester I had suffered from severe anxiety and depression, which really prevented me from attending university classes in person, and this had heavily affected my ability to gain the visualization critiques marks which would have been enough to put me above the 50% coursework mark. Having looking back at this semester, i wish i had the courage to push myself to attend class and present to a live class by myself. I really struggled this semester with interacting with others, especially during my Group assignment, i felt like I couldn't be myself, and this affected my ability to contribute fully to the group, as seen in the group comments, i had moments of providing great contribution to the group with research, but I couldn't interact with my group members properly which resulted in the one feedback I received. For the individual tableau assignment, I recieved 54/100 which was decent, but could have been improved to boost my grade above the 50% for coursework mark. I really struggled with this assignment because I had to really rely on myself at home to do the work, I could not ask for help in person from the tutor at labs.
 I have passed the final exam with B-. The only thing I would ask for is if the exception could be made with my coursework mark so i can graduate and begin a new life after university. If you would like to discuss further in person I would be glad to do so.

57,"Hi Reddit.

I don't know if anyone will reply to this because it's so late on Thanksgiving eve, but here goes.

My girlfriend was browsing through my phone and found a video that had downloaded earlier in the day. The video was pornographic and featured a girl fingering herself. 

My gf quietly picked up our one year old child, grabbed some diapers, and left out in her car. She texted me later on that we're over. We've been together for almost three years and I've never seen her so upset.

I normally don't watch porn, but I owned up to it right away, obviously. We have a strong relationship, but I have told her in the past that I'm not the type to watch porn (true, my sex drive is normally really low like hers), but I did today.

She told me I can have my daughter on the weekends and that she expects the minimum child support the state provides. She is being dead serious. I've apologized and tried to explain myself... own up for it, etc. Nothing is working. 

What the hell should I do?

**TL;DR : My gf caught me with porn, left out the door with our daughter, is making demands and acting really really upset. I feel like my heart just broke and my soul just collapsed in on itself. Help. Please.**",23Nov2017,150
58,"Hey r/advice, 

Last Thursday I did the dumbest thing possible and spilled coffee on my 2015 MacBook Pro. Initially, the keyboard and trackpad stopped working but I got that fixed for $100 at a local tech repair shop yesterday. He cleaned out as much coffee as he could and replaced some connectors, claiming there should be no more issues.

All was well, until I suddenly noticed earlier today that my left speaker had stopped working. This was not the case when I had gotten it back yesterday. Although not at all a dealbreaker, I'm more concerned about the possibility of future issues arising that are worse than just a speaker. The biggest issue for me is that finals are approaching soon, and having my computer possibly screw up during that period would be really tough on me.

So I have a couple options. Either a) I keep going and hope nothing else goes wrong, b) get it repaired which will cost me a minimum of $100, possibly more if he has to replace the entire speaker unit but also risk future issues coming up, or c) say to hell with it and avoid future problems and purchase a [new computer](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-surface-pro-core-m-with-black-type-cover-platinum/6111206.p?skuId=6111206). This will be $630 once Black Friday deals begin, and although weaker than my Mac, could be quite useful once I start getting to things like calculus as it's touch screen and supports a pen. It also has a good form factor to read books with.

I hate asking my parents for money, so all the money I have is what I worked for. Even if I ask my parents, i’d get $20 at most and if I ask again a week later they’ll ask what I did with the $20, so theres no point.

I’m very cautious on how I spend my money. If I have food at home and one of my friends wants to go get lunch, I will decline or go but not eat. I plan on moving out in the near future and want my money saved up. I never spend money on myself unless I need it so I can save up as much as possible. She knows that I sometimes decline lunch and sometimes try and go on less expensive dates because I always pay for everything (one date is usually about 60 dollars and we see eachother a lot)

So yeah I don’t think being smart with your money and spending it on things you don’t need is being cheap

I call her today and she’s just really grumpy. I ask her whats wrong and she tells me she doesn’t like it when people are cheap. I’m so confused and I ask her what she means. She says people shouldn’t have to decline lunch with their friends to save money, and people shouldn’t have to worry about money. She talks about how she always goes out with her friends and spends money on whatever she needs. She was like ACTUALLY in a bad mood, even making “ugh” noises out of nowhere, because she thinks i’m cheap and she doesn’t like cheap people

Soo all the money I have is what I worked for, when I look at something I want the first things I ask myelf is “how many hours do I have to work for this” being the first, and “how many dates can her and I go on with the cost of this one thing” being the second. If I have to work 2 hours for a small pizza at CPK, it’s usually not worth it for me (only when i’m alone. when i’m with her I go crazy with my money). And second, if I can spend 15-20 dollars on food i can also take her out on a date with that money so instead of wasting it on food i can eat at home, i save it for a date with her

She just thinks i’m cheap for all that and when i explain that i have to work for my money and my parents don’t give it to me, she says no you’re cheap and says i’m too pussy to ask for money from my parents. What do you all think

The basis of the break up was money.  He wanted to control it all and I was resisting and he saw that as me ….silently working to get out the relationship  

That and another fight led to him leaving me in the middle of the night.  

Anyway,  we got back together but during this time he turned to her.

He came back to me 2 months later and she threatened to never speak to him again if he went back with me.

It continued….she didn’t have much of a relationship with him but she started to talk to him again.  But I didn’t talk to her.  We live in different states..so it didnt matter much.

So 8 months into our relationship, I saw texts between them where she is encouraging him to leave me still.  He is telling her how depressed he is with his liFE…AND saying he’s so worried about how depressed he is.

She responds and says look at the common denominator…she is the problem…  (meaning me)

He responds with “i know” …

I got upset and texted her and asked her to please respect our relationship and stop encouraging him to leave me.

She called me a bitch.  Said I was unloveable.. and said the fact that I don’t have a good relationship with the woman “who gave birth between her legs” was very telling to her..

The reason my mom isn’t close with me is because she doesn’t approve of him and won’t even agree to talk to him.  He was very aggressive when we met and my mom couldn’t get past that… especially since I changed careers to be with him.

I said look…don’t talk to me that way.  She said that I am clearly unloveable and that my fiancé (her son) didn’t really love me … when I told her he did and needed to respect me.

When this exchange happened he immediately called me a liar.  He asked to see the phone number of the texts.  I showed him…he thought I was spoofing the number…

He finally saw it was her but he would not respond to her.  SHE texted him and said are you with her…he wouldn’t respond.

She texted me and accused me of stealing his phone and lying…. I sent her a pic of him sigtting next to me.

Again I asked him to stand up for me…to her.  he wouldn’t “participate in the drama”  

He told me I as crazy for cotinuinuing this.. and that I need to block her.  He told me that she is not one to fight with …and I’m crazy for participating in it.

he said she had a friend who already agreed to trying to ruin me with over 1.5 followers on a blog…and I should know that his mother goes for blood.  He said “freedom of speech __Instert my name”

I blew up and said I was leaving.  No one threatens me.  He said he was not threatening me…but he was trying to get me to understand that she isn’t one to argue with.

I BEGGEd him to text her and tell her he stands with me.  He wouldn’t. He said that was me trying to control him.  He said it didn’t matter because she wouldn’t care…I said “I” care. Stand up for me. He wouldn’t.  

So apparently last night she emailed him the pic I sent of him (to prove he was with me) and said WTF…. 

He said yeah I was with her…. why are you doing this?

He told me it didnt make sense that she would seek this out…that she has been quiet…He  is right..i fibbed.  I told him SHE texted me first…but I texted her first… 

he said you know…i jut need the truth…cause if I find out that YOU texted her first…it will be a very different situation.

I never admitted to it…

fastforward 24 hours…I asked if he had talked to her…he said no

Well on his car bluetooth I saw they talked for over an hour.

I asked him WTF …he said..yeah..what are you worried about “you are acting guilty” 


He said why are you so worried…you hate that I talk to my mother…you wan to polarize me right???

I said NO…I want you to stand up for me.  You said no.  You wouldn’t even test her and say we were sitting tougher and now you are talking to her for about an hour without telling me??/

He said …you just want everyone to hate me…you want to polarize me…I’m not taking your shit anymore…you have a real problem…”

SOOOOOO do I?  Am I the problem here?  I feel very alone and wonder how to proceed…  advice please...  I raealize i'm not perfect...",23Nov2017,1

83,"Okay so I feel like a total idiot right now. The power button on my phone stopped working last week. It was annoying, but I could still use it. Monday the sound stopped working out of the blue and I couldn't use it. Today I took it in to get fixed, but apparently the insurance I had on it had a $200 deducible that I didn't know about and definitely wasn't something I'd had before I renewed my contract last year (don't be an idiot and listen to sales people, read the fricken contract). It seemed stupid to pay the deductible (and a $100 rental fee for a loaner phone while it was getting fixed) since it was only $150 to buy out my contract, so I just opted to get a new phone. 

I got home and tried to get the SD card out of my old phone to insert in the new one. It was jammed and I ended up breaking the tray while trying to get it out, so I watched some videos on how to open my old phone and did that, pulled out the SD card and what was left of the tray, then put it back together and turned it on. 

It fired up and the god damn sound and power button now freaking work. I don't know how or why just opening it fixed the problems, but it did. Now I don't know wtf to do. I have 14 days to return the phone so long as it's resellable, which it is, but I'd feel like such a douche going in tomorrow and being like ""uh, yeah, I don't need this"" since the sales guy spent a good two hours with me (and my sister who was due for an upgrade and got a new phone at the same time, she won't be returning it so he'll still have made some commission) 

The tray is also, like, totally destroyed on my old phone, and I can't seem to find somewhere that can over night me a new one for Friday so I don't have to go all weekend without a phone (I'm on call for work), but my sister said I can borrow hers until I get it? 

Do I return the phone? (Obviously, yeah, but I'm a baby that needs to be reassured of this, preferably from someone that works on commission, because I feel so bad for wasting the sales guy's time) ",23Nov2017,2

85,"I'm 21 and pregnant, me and my boyfriend live together and have a roommate. My boyfriend and I like to keep the house fairly clean as this was his Grandma's house before she passed away. We don't really care what the roommates room looks like unless there is a build up of dishes and we have no dishes left in the kitchen. Our roommate has his girlfriend over a lot and she has now pretty much moved in as she is here everyday, we have no problem with that but what we have a problem with is that she starts all of these projects here and never finishes one so there is like 5 projects going on in our dining room at a time and then it just gets left there for weeks. Our roommate doesn't have any crazy expectations or chores, just clean mop the kitchen floor every couple of weeks, take the trash out every once in awhile and clean the cat litter box out daily and bleach it every couple of weeks, clean up after yourself. This seems to be such a hard task for him as he will leave the litter box soaking in the bathtub before he leaves for work and will leave the cats without a litter box for about 8 hours til he comes back home, this causes them to use the bathroom on the floor in the house. We come home to crusty cups and dirty dishes not even washed off in the dishwasher. They aren't sanitary what so ever with the litter box and making raw meat in the house not washing hands, touching handles, splattering it placesthis is hard for me to live with as I'm trying not to be pregnant and sick since I was for the last couple of months already.

She’s kinda socially awkward like me but when she asked me out earlier this week I had to say no because she told me why and I knew I didn’t feel the same way. I didn’t think I wouldn’t later on in the relationship either if I said yes. Why? She seems nice and a good person but there’s just something that makes me not want to.

91,"good afternoon everyone, this is my first post here, ever. i am having suicidal thoughts (not to the point of planning to act on them, but to the point they are making my life hopeless and depressing), this is gonna be a slightly long post, but please bare with me, i am in dire need of help.

Let me first start by this, i am a 23 year old international student in the U.S, i weigh over 350 pounds (which for some reason does not show as i dont look like an elephant, more like a stacked human ball), my height is 5'10, and got a somewhat hairy body, not gorilla hairy but still hairy nonetheless, which may be relevant later.

i came here a few months back, my life was shit before coming here, which at this point isnt relevant because i came here to start a new page, which by the way, was hell. when i first came here, a guy from my country was waiting for me at the airport, who i paid a lot of money to, in order for him to get me a room and help me start my new life, which he did, the room was a little expensive, and on the day of arrival, he drove me straight to my room, i paid the rent, next morning roommate who holds lease tells me i have to leave because i was snoring and did not let him sleep, this guy is from my country as well and knows the struggle, but that doesn't move a single shit particle in him. the first guy who waited for me at the airport, lets call him D for douche bag, D came to pick me up and took me to his house, stayed for him for a week, he found me another room (in NY btw), the room was in NJ, latina in her late 40s with a pet, complained about every single thing i did, threw a fit at one point and kicked me out, i had nowhere to go, D was not willing to help and practically abandoned me. i went to a hotel and stayed there for two days which cost me $200, i made a few calls, managed to get some help, stayed at someone's basement for over 4 months, the basement was dirty, a lot of mouse droppings, roaches, bed bugs, etc, but was grateful nonetheless, through some help i got a living room on my own, which i am currently staying at, it is pricey for a living room but the location is nice and slightly convenient. first two days i got bitten by bed bugs all over, used spray, still same problem. guy with the lease tells me someone messy used to live in the vacant bedroom before and he left, he says hes tired of dealing with people and plans to move out next month and get his own room, which does not sound convincing to me, as i felt it was a polite way of him telling me to pack my shit and find another room, which was within the first week of my rent, currently im in my third, he said he cannot pay for the other vacant room as the apartment is too expensive and hes trying to get someone in there, if he cant, then he will have to leave. today he comes and tells me he found someone, then he says he will need the living room for his family and i need to start looking for a room, then he switches the subject and says he can stay for another 6 months if the guy wants to rent the room, and asks me to deal with the odor and says he does not want to babysit, i understand that people have different odors but i never had anyone complain about mine, although after a long day i do smell funky and no matter how much deodorant or antiperspirant i put on i still smell awful after a few hours outside, but i usually take a shower when i get home and spray air freshener around my space and put on some axe, which the guy says it only makes my odor more intense, i honestly have no idea what i am dealing with, how do i smell, if its that bad and how to fix it and its taking a toll on my mental health, i switched degrees and my new program here is taking me  a lot of effort to catch up and to get used to the system here, each week the assignment take manage to take a lot of time from me, and its preventing me from functioning as a normal human being. i just came to my space to lay down and the guy went to his room after he told me all this, i want to do something about this, but there are other things going on that make me demotivated and i just have no idea what to do or where to start.

also a few more things that i am having trouble dealing with:

-i have a girlfriend, still a virgin and left her back home, i do not plan on having sex with any other girl and have to wait after marriage, which is resulting in me having to masturbate at least 3 days a week, something i really want to avoid after hearing of the NoFap movement and its benefits.
-Bedbug bites, these things are itchy and i wanna get rid of them, but extermination is expensive and i am on a tight budget.
-Body odor which no matter what i do still remains.
-i have made 0% progress towards my goal of getting a job here or an internship and potentially becoming a resident due to issues like this.
-i cannot stand for more than 15 minutes which having my feet hurting.
-i feel lazy or demotivated to do some basic stuff like going to laundry or even taking a shit sometimes.
-i do not take my studies here that seriously despite getting good grades, which is mainly because the college is a for-profit private college, which leads me to another issue ive been dealing with.
-a consultation office back in my country took my folder and documents and told me they will help me study in the U.S, i paid a hefty amount of money for a risk when applying for visa which i somehow managed to get, they sent me to this college i am at right now, its a for-profit private college, with only international students who're mostly indians and jamaicans in it and other branches consisting of mainly black students, which is fine and i do not mind but that is nothing close to what i had in mind and it shat on all of my motivation (seeing as my english is at the very least decent and i managed to get a high score in toefl, i thought i would be studying with americans or a vastly diverse college), i do not know if i have any chance of getting a job or an internship because of this, nor am i getting the college experience i always dreamed of, and now im just going with the flow with no goals, no passion, and only depression and hardships dealing with everyday life. and i do not want to disappoint my family back home who spent a crap ton of money on me and are really proud of this piece of shit that i am despite being a total failure.

Please help, i have never needed this much help in my life, i am lost and depressed and i am starting to think i have anxiety and i feel like i cant bring myself to enjoy the smallest things in life, i need advice.

97,"Background information: I am a junior in high school, the girl is a year younger than me. So I have been friends with this girl for about 1 year and throughout that year we had been on and off. What I mean by that is that any time one of us caught feelings, the other person wasn’t interested. It was pretty stupid but whatever, and we kinda lost contact over the summer while I was outta town. Fast forward to junior year, we have one class together (gym) and I really caught feelings for her again. We start talking more, decide we are gonna give this a try. We pick a date and decide to go on a double date with my best friend who was talking to her best friend. We go to some movie, idek the name, wasn’t focused on that at all, but I made sure to do all the little things right before the movie, held the door open for her, told her how pretty she looked, just made good, safe small talk. Once we were in the movie theatre things seemed to be going even better, I almost goofed by forgetting to raise the middle thing dividing the seats but my bro gave me a wtf look so I saved the night. After the movie started she was curled up on me and all was going well. Was a slow movie so I decided we were going to have fun, we were kinda whispering in each other’s ears and stuff, eventually I just spilled all my feelings to her that I had saved up for over a year and it was getting positive response. So I made a move and we started kissing. I started slow and gentle at first but then after like 5 min we started French kissing and getting more intimate. I really could feel her energy and I was so happy and content. We ended up making out for basically the whole movie (was awkward when my mom asked how the movie was 😂). So it was a great night and as we were driving home, we talked and I personally thought it was a successful night. The next day though things didn’t go anything like I expected. I sent her a message thanking her for a fun night, and telling her I couldn’t wait to hang with her again. She opened it up but didn’t say anything. She finally sent me a text saying we needed to talk at 7:45. I was really anxious and could barely study while I was killing time until 7:45. 7:45 hits and bam my Snapchat explodes and there’s a 3 paragraph essay from her. I read it immediately and was so devastated. I’ll sum it up for you guys, basically it had 3 different points and one overarching message, 1) She didn’t really know how to say this and was scared for my reaction. 2) She still cared about me 3) I deserved someone better than her = Basically she didn’t want a serious relationship and didn’t think our personalities would match. Now I was really mad at first because I thought, and still think, what she said was complete bs and that it was a horrible message. Obviously I responded with some anger, which wasn’t the best thing but I was really hurt because I waited so long to try with her and she was dashing it all away before we even could elevate our relationship to anything. We didn’t speak at school at all for the next week and all my friends and her friends were hitting me up, asking if I was ok, but I was still hurt even though i masked my pain and said I was fine. Eventually I sent her another message apologizing for how I responded and saying how I get it that things don’t always work out. Honestly, the only thing I sent her in that text that i meant was when I said I didn’t want to cut her off completely. I can’t lie, I want round 2, I seriously have no clue why this happened and I asked all her friends and no one has a clue, maybe this girl is just scared of the label or something. What should I do? I’m slowly talking to her more online, I’ll see her next Monday so I’ll try and talk then. Everybody knew we were talking and lots of people thought we would be a good match. I’m just so perplexed on what went wrong, one of my friends said it was the car ride home, but I don’t remember anything bad or awkward happening. Thanks guys, and sorry for the super long read.",23Nov2017,1

100,"Hi all, 

Tldr: Car dealer RV owner tries trick to cause last-minute panic in us and jack the price up by 7000$ when we arrive to pick unit up.Is this a standard trick? Should be pursue this deal further (as unit is good) or just gtfo considering this a good sign?

[Previous posts here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoRVing/comments/7e9e5a/extended_warranty_related_question/)

Long story below:

We found a sweet discovery 39R from a private seller, who seemed nice and works as a buyer at a local sports car dealership. We drove to Tampa for 700mi after we agreed on a deal for $68000 over the phone on Monday and the plan was that we pick it up Wednesday, Nov 22nd.

When we were 100mi from Tampa, we texted the guy saying we are close, he replied that the unit is nearing a wash + oil change, all looking good. But 25 min later, he called again saying there was a new interested buyer who was offering 75000, that they were putting a deposit down, were happy with the coach (without seeing it) and our deal for 68000 was off. If we wanted to buy, new price was 75000.

Having driven 600mi all night, we were unhappy and panicked. We drove to this guy and spoke to him. He was very focussed on telling us that the new buyer ""truly,  really"" contacted him in the last 20min. He wanted to show us some random texts, calls and emails  as proof for this sudden development (all of these can be faked too, so who cares, we didn't look).

He is saying if we pay him 73000 now, he'll sell the unit to us. We agreed on 68000 just 3 days ago.

Is this a common trick by dirty people and sleazy dealers? In case we do get a bargain from this guy under these circumstances, is it worth it to trust him and buy the unit? He could be lying about anything else. I feel that my wife and I are naive dumbasses for being getting stuck in this situation, being in a one-way rental 700mi from home on a verbal deal.

Please help folks. We don't have anyone else to talk to or get advice from in this matter. We spent the day in really high stress instead of being happy about living a dream. Our thoughts aren't clear and I seek counsel from you.

Thanks in advance.",23Nov2017,2
101,"I don't know a very good way to unpack the necessities of what I need help with but might as well start

Bombed High school, graduated early from a continuation school that I got sent too because I had something like a 1.0 GPA 

0 work experience, working on getting a job however (hard procrastination however)

No license, getting behind the wheel time is incredibly difficult for me but I'm planning on having this done by the end of December which is nice

I have no diet knowledge and I feel like this is starting to heavily affect my day to day, I grew up with a dad that worked in oil so most of the time I was cooking for myself and my father would happily oblige to me  getting what I (as a child) would want to eat. I basically have a diet that has never once consisted of fruits or vegetables and the lot. only maintaining weight due to the gym

I have none of the ""skills"" parents are supposed to help you with: disorderly, never schedule anything, etc. 

All of those are relatively self manageable however I have a huge problem with playing games. All throughout childhood it's basically all I did, and it's still all I really do. the issue manifests from me not enjoying games for the last arguably 2 years now, but it's still taking up a large amount of my time. If I can't manage to break this stupid habit that's been engraved into me I'm just going to sell everything, but then I feel like I'll invest that same amount of time on my phone. I don't understand how I can have all these things in front of me that I need and want to do but I always succumb to just playing games all day.

102,"Hey guys. So I quit my part time job (worked there for 6 months) a few days ago and just started a new job today . It’s a family owned restaurant and the environment is great, total improvement. I even did a delivery and got 10 bucks in a 4 hour shift. (On a side note, my parents said I couldn’t deliver, and they even track me, but if I just get a GPS for my car, I can leave my phone at work all shift 👍🏽) 

But where I have anxiety about the situation is getting paid. The guys there didn’t give me any paperwork to fill out and haven’t told me anything about linking the job to my account, I didn’t clock in or anything. I’m just wondering what the best course of action I should have from here on, because it is early and i have another shift lined up Friday 12-2. It may just be that since he’s the owner he doesn’t have to do all the corporate mumbo jumbo that my last job required. 

I could ask them about it or just focus my energy on working hard and showing I’m reliable/consistent, and then just see what happens, but I kind of need some reassurance I guess.

I dont know how to deal with this, this was my first girlfriend and I really can't deal with the pain im feeling right now. I still have feelings for her and still see her as someone i want in my life although I know that is not possible.

109,"Over 6 years ago, I walked out of a college party with a beer in my hand. The police saw me come out and stopped me essentially the second I reached the sidewalk. They charged me with an Open Container and Minor in Possession and sent me on my way. I went to the courthouse the next day, spoke with a DA for a minute, pled guilty, paid a $200 fine in cash, and went home.

I never told my parents, my school, my subsequent employers, or anyone else other than a couple friends. I always check ""No, I have not been convicted of a crime."" on any form that asks, and I've had several background checks over several years, none of which have found anything. Even the CBP found nothing when I applied for Global Entry. 

I never worried about it before because I figured the worst-case scenario was that I'd have to do some explaining and maybe get fired. But are graduate school applications a bigger deal? Could I have a degree revoked many years down the road and suffer serious consequences for leaving that out on an application?

It felt like such a small issue that never impacted my life in any way, but I don't want to get caught lying on an application and have my life ruined in 30 years.

112,"My main focus is her job. But I know for a fact there are other parts of her life that need a new outlook.

She has worked as a waitress for years. But, she now works delivering medicine to hospitals. 

She has worked for this medicine company for about 2 years. She has been complaining for about a year that she doesn't get paid enough. I personally think she deserves a raise, as she has worked there for 6 months and does a good job, and needs it. She lives paycheck to paycheck, her car is breaking down, her apartment is in a ghetto with crackheads and bedbugs, and she asks me for money.

I told her that she should ask for a raise. She said ""I know"" But she never has. She's been complaining for a year but keeps saying ""I'm going to do it around this time"" and she never does. About 3 weeks ago, she came home and told me that she asked a new person what he made, and it was $3 more than her. She said she flipped out and started complaining to the boss in a rage, and asked for a raise. He said ""sure"". So It's been about a month, and I keep telling her to ask him when he's going to give her the raise. and she keeps saying ""I'll ask him next week"" But she hasn't and I know she won't ask him. 

She is so passive about it, but comes home to complain so much she's starting to say things like ""I'm going to sue them for female discrimination. It's inequality"". I told her it's ridiculous cause she hasn't asked for a raise or anything, and that she's making things up cause she's to afraid to ask.

This is so frustrating to me, because she is constantly out of money. Her car is shit and it sometimes stalls on the highway (Very dangerous). She always complains about this. She is literally so passive about it... It's disgusting. I'm actually starting to get into arguments about it, cause she keeps bringing it up.

115,"I am an investor in a playstation cafe business and now am recently taking over because one of the employees has been really slacking, made a bad image for the place. It has 9 PS4 Slim and 9 Full HD tvs. 2 Are connected to PSN via Lan and we have Most critically acclaimed games, because I always buy new games for the store that I myself would play. We dont buy the newest games but we have Horizon and Prey and BF1, so we do have 6 month old games. 

Its a store in vienna, austria and for now most customers are 20+ construction workers who only want to play Fifa and smoke indoors. They dont try the single player or online multiplayer of our game collection. Just FIFA and UFC. 

I want to bring in very young people and gamers, the main owner though is turkish and he really wants his friends two just hang out and do whatever they want. I win many arguments saying that his friends won't pay rent. But I still face the conflict of the customer I think the store should have and they ones we do have, as I feel they scare away other customers who don't like smoking or loud FIFA Chatter. 

I am trying to settle this by being the face of business in the morning and banning smoking. But that just lead to the customers complaining to the boss about me and trying to get me fired. They didnt know im not just a friend of the boss but an investor and hardworker. They all feel like because the store is turkish in origin. They deserve special treatment. 

A gaming store needs to be Culturally neutral. Mothers would call the cops on us if their kids were in our room while smoking indoors in an unventilated room. These people are crazy. They like to take a coffee cup add water to it and use it as an ash trey. This is how they think they can outsmart the police. Because the shop can than say the customer smoked without us knowing! 

Its ridiculous. The shop isn't profitable, it makes most money on weekends. There are schools nearby and people from many cultures in the neighborhood. Sadly I feel like im facing a battle of racism I could never win. We even have a back room where I say they can smoke all they want. But they aren't satisfied with that. ",23Nov2017,4

118,"I fell in love with this guy almost 2 years ago. I'd had a crush on him in middle school but I was the weird kid with a rough home life and everyone made fun of me, including him. I got a job back home for the summer as a hostess and he worked in the kitchen. We hit it off immediately and were together all summer, but he acted like I was just a girl he was hooking up with. I saw all the red flags and eventually things ended for awhile when I went off to school. My depression got so bad I tried to kill myself and dropped out halfway through the semester, and ended up moving home, and getting back with him. He was horrible to me. Constantly drunk or on drugs, extremely possessive, manipulative, and honestly I think I ignored the red flags for so long because I had recently lost about 70 pounds and he is the most physically attractive partner I've ever had, and I held on very tightly to the idea that a girl who used to weigh as much as I did should feel lucky to be with anyone. I know that makes me just as bad as him, but it is what it is. We still worked together, and I got promoted to be a bartender and I never wanted any of my customers to pick up that something was wrong, so I never even considered leaving him as long as we both still worked there, even though his drinking and generally mean behavior were destroying me. Well fast forward to last week, his alcoholism finally cost him his job. I dumped him immediately, but took him back about 2 days later. Thinking he was serious about getting sober, that this was finally where things would change. Then I realized I just wasn't happy. I couldn't enjoy a moment I spent with him without thinking of the awful things we had done to each other in the past. I do love him, and I hope one day I will get to the bottom where I can honestly say I don't anymore. So I broke up with him AGAIN, after leading him on for a week. I feel like such trash. I want to stay away from him. We don't work together anymore but we do live in a small town, I'm stuck here for a year in a lease, and I'm sure I haven't heard the last of him. I have never felt so horrible in my life. I am well aware I deserved every bit of what I got because I chose to stay so long, but how do I deal with the reality that I've lost the only person I ever loved? I'm not close to my family at all (they are the example I grew up with that told me this type of relationship is normal), and I honestly have only one close friend and she deserves better than to listen to me complain all the time.

122,"Why? 
Of course I know my desire is ridiculous but is priceless indicator of what is wrong with me mentally and what hole I need to fill in finally.

Honestly, I really feel like that - I know all the hard truths of life, of myself, of my EGO, of other people, of world... 
Not evils not goods - just truths.
And even though I had some hard existential lows for the past year, I caught myself - at the same time I learned a lot and I still see life as very meaningful and worthwhile, not lying to myself anymore.

Yet, my past year is marked with constant highs and lows and I can't help to snap out of this rut I'm in.
And I'm constantly bothered with this fantasy that - my God had I been this more masculine man, not that I would be settled and done (that's not even what I want) - I would give myself full permission to go live life with everything I know it has to offer, even through all the harsh truths it holds, whatever. 

I know what I want, I know what I would like, I hold all the love for living and people but I can't help it but feel like that is not for me, that's for normal people (and men?), I'm not worthy of it, I don't have the right and the competence...

This feeling is holding me down for so long - either I'm active and compensating for it or passive and it's eating me alive.
And now it's getting really serious and ruining my life...
I constantly feel this fear, this anxiety, this need to protect and prove myself....

I think it has to do with self worth or something and of course I project that on others.
You can imagine that the body and world I live in is not very pleasant and functional.
Had I been more masculine - I would prescribe default worth on myself, project that on others perspective of me,  and it would be permanent till I die (I can't get shorter or something)  and it would be real and physical - not just my feelings and thoughts about myself which are very unstable and fleeting, replacable.

What do you think? 
What is the problem? 
I'm ready for any uncomfortable truth, I just want this to stop and finally in my life go and live... I'm so sick and tired.

If it helps, I'm 19 years old male.

136,"Hey guys, sorry for the really long post but i legit need some advice from you, so please bear with me and i sincerely appreciate the people who can help me out in regard to this!

Basically, my cousin has lived in the US for pretty much all his life. my (extended) family is quite conservative and hold very firm family values (my cousin included - i think), always looking out for each other and what not. My cousin is the odd one out. 

Its important to note that he doesnt have abusive parents, and all his life he had the means to live a comfortable life, thanks to his hardworking parents.

Anyways, His parents are tired of his wreckless and passive aggresive behaviour. He's almost a 30 y/o college dropout, and still lives with this parents. He doesn't have a job because he doesn't work well with others. Tries to make money by buying and selling phones off of craigslist or firearms and all sorts of stuff. All he does, is hang out with the wrong crowd, drinks, does drugs, deals with firearms (not in a gang), and loves conspiracy theories. He's also had someone murdered over weed related problems (some guy ran off with his weed or something).

I live in different country where, obtaining firearms is illegal, you need to have a license to be able to buy alcohol, and access to drugs is extremely limited, if none. 

His parents (my uncle and aunt), after continually trying to help him, had enough of his shit and saw him as a lost cause. Here's the catch, they sent him to live with ME and MY FAMILY, because they thought this would serve to be a better environment for him to change his lifestyle. So now my cousin is now living with us, and we gave him a room, and I also hooked him up at a job for the time being. 

From the moment he got here, he started acting all self righteous and saying completely irrational things towards me, accusing me of shit i never did. A few days ago, i lost my patience and really gave him shit for everything he has done in the past (although i didnt bring up how he murdered someone, since he doesn't know that i know about it) and how big of a disappointment to the family he is and he should be more grateful instead of being a hostile stubborn fuck.

I said other things along the lines, but that really hit him hard apparently, because we haven't been talking properly ever since. Now let me be the first one to say, that I don't give a flying fuck if he doesn't talk to me, hell I am actually enjoying not conversing with him because he lacks the ability to have a rational, meaningful conversation.

The problem is that, and its likely that im just seriously paranoid, that he has actually had someone murdered over weed. I dont want to judge him by his past but im constantly thinking about what if something triggers him into doing the same thing with me? It may sound a little over-the-top and he loves family more than anything but what if......... in this case, how should i handle it? what should be my next steps, to the given situation at hand?

137,"Hi everyone, 

I need your advice regarding the safety of my young cousin. She owns her own smartphone, she shares a tablet with her 13y.o. brother and can use the family laptop whenever she wants. She uses Whatsapp (frequently), has a Snapchat-account and regularly watches Youtube. Obviously she might see something that might unsettle her. I want to make sure she doesn't come across age-inappropriate things on the internet and prevent her from talking with weird strangers. Any tips/advices that might be useful to protect her?




I know, it's usually something her parents should do, but they're mostly computer-illiterate. My cousin and I have a very close relationship with each other and we consider us to be siblings. That's why it's important for me to support her.



I already explained her to be careful around strangers. She knows not to share her private data with other people. I also changed the privacy settings on her social networks - other than friends and family members she doesn't have anyone else on Whatsapp &amp; Snapchat.



Are there further steps I should take? Honestly, I don't want to shield her from everything. But at the very least I can reduce the amount of weird things till she's a bit older.

context: 

- i have two roommates, 

- we're all students

- i moved in first and the other two joined (independently from each other) after a month

- the flat was completely empty when i moved in and needed all appliances and furniture

- that was ~a year ago 

So far i have paid for pretty much everything in this flat that is shared, washing machine, furniture, etc. 

(more importantly) i have also been taking care of pretty much everything. Organising furniture, repairing stuff, etc. 

also cleaning, while the others do clean a bit, its fair to say i do 50% and they each do 25%

now i'm generally a peaceful person and don't want to upset anyone, but i feel like a housewife and that makes me unhappy;  also i feel sad about the situation because i've realised that i haven't had a single day of vacation in several years, mainly because the money i have left after rent and stuff goes to paying for shared stuff in this flat. 

I have tried to bring up sharing groceries multiple times and they don't want to participate in even that. ""lets each buy our own groceries"" sounds fine on paper, but of course i pay for the basic stuff like fruits, salt, oil, etc and that does cost me ~$100+/month

I guess I'm always irritated when I get turned down for positions that seem to be currently operated by people with an IQ you could count on a calendar, I know there is supposed to be silver linings with rejection and learning opportunities, but there is a limit to how constructive that can be, sometimes you just want to say ""what the actual fuck hole is going on"". 

I know I'm not a genius, I don't have any particular mastery of  arithmetic, and I'm not a Rhodes scholar, but I'm smart enough to know how to answer application questions, I used to think I knew what government job recruiters wanted to hear, but now I have no idea. 

Everything is a false bottom with those people, every question a trap, and every answer a potential reason for dismissal. I try to blend honesty and rehearsed rhetoric so I don't come off a pandering sychophant, and I also make sure I prove that I have enough life experience.

However it was not enough, and even though it hasn't been some life long dream, it still weighs on me. I guess because, if you havnt had a lifelong dream you want to feel like your interests could turn into one, and it always seem like lately in this overly competitive world that you've just missed the boat.

Anyways I'm sure people will either unanimously tell me I'm a twat and to get over it, or just try again ect, I'm not even looking for crucial advice, just someone to resonate to I guess, a good only fashion pity party haha.

TL DR: got turned down for a hobo job, just generally feel like Shit and am lost in life.",23Nov2017,2
162,"December third marks the 7th Anniversary of my mums death.

A little back ground.
I live at home with my mum til I was 27, purely due to not being able to afford to move out. My mum and I were very close. in 2005 her mum died and they were more like best friends than mother daughter.  She got low after Nan died and didn't do much.
When I moved out in March 2010 she gave me a hard time saying she didn't know how she was going to afford everything etc.
she did get a lodger and that helped but she had about !0k debt. in about July I got a call from her neighbour telling me my mum had been arrested.

Turned out she had, basically, had a mental breakdown. when I found where she was, at the local hospital, she was mentally in a child like state. could barley form words, didn't understand what was going on around her. 
she spent a month in a psych ward. 
But when she came out she wasn't the same. Her work was considering firing her because she wasn't working properly.

December 2nd I tried to call her and got no answer, left a message on the answer machine, the next morning I'd had no reply and this was weird.

 I asked my friend to go check on her, he also had a key to the house, he called me at work to tell me there was a large amount of blood in the house.
I went round and at the foot of the stairs there was blood, there was a slipper on the stairs, another that seemed tt have been flung over the bannister.

I found my mum bed in her bedroom.

the report came back she had fallen down the stairs and cracked open her head on a set of drawers at the bottom. she had crawled up the stairs into the bathroom to clean herself up, then gone in the bedroom and passed out on the floor and died.

I was devastated. I drank myself stupid for some time. 
What made things worse was we couldn't have the funeral till January 27th. I still don't know why, and her birthday was February 3rd.

The only thing that got me through was my friends. 
here we are seven years on and I still don't feel I have fully grieved. 
I blame myself, In my head she fell down the stairs because I called as she was going up the stairs and tried to turn to come back down and fell, and it's my fault.
(the tv was on, the lights were on, it seemed she was watching tv and probably was going up to go to the loo.)

I don't know how to grieve, how to move on. 

and I don't want to keep on to my friends about it.

163,"When I was with my bf at the time , I bought him a truck.( he would be paying for it from here on out) Stupid decision already I know. 
I didn’t find out til later. But 5 days after purchasing it for him he went and cheated on me. 
3 weeks after buying the truck he moved out west for a better job. I was to follow. 
Never happened, I ended up finding out he cheated. 

I forgave him and moved on, another stupid decision. 
Months go buy and he’s suppose to be paying for it. I’m helping him. Having 3 jobs here just to pay my bills and help him cover all of his while he settles in. 

Truck ended up needing to be back home for reasons. So I flew out to pick it up and hopefully be done with him and trade it in for something I can afford and take the loss. 
Didn’t happen, 
He ended up coming back with me. Getting all his stuff and going back out. Fine with me as long as he paid for the truck. 

Well last month he didn’t pay a dime and I paid it all.    We talked about it and I was going to be paying for a little more than half. But that wasn’t the case I guess. 
(He was back here for 2 weeks so he didn’t work and had to pay rent. )I don’t want my credit ruined. But now I’m massively struggling. And stressed and worried about the end of this month , if he’s going to send me money or not. 

I sent him a long text stating I think he should bring it back because it doesn’t seem like it’s a good fit. We’re not together and that he doesn’t care about my mental and finically stability. (Much more in-depth but unneeded for this) 
To which he replied. Worry about yourself and fuck off .. 

I’m at a loss of what to do. 
A month ago I already called the cops to try and get the truck back so I wouldn’t have to deal with it anymore. They were not helpful in any way. They said they would look and then a week later told me I’d most likely have to go to a civil court and figure it out. It’s been very hard because I have no idea where he is out there. 

What’s the best option to do? Is there anything I can do. ? I can’t afford to keep paying for it and not even have it. ",23Nov2017,4

I can link the article if people really want to read it, but the premise is that George Soros funded a coalition to make bot comments in favor of upholding the rules on the FCC's public forum page, and that net neutrality actually allows companies to engage in censorship. It was clear to me that infowars was giving him a skewed understanding of what net neutrality actually is, so I sent him multiple sources on the issue, like an Op Ed from someone in the FCC, a Washington Post article detailing the issue of commenter bots, and an article showing the effects of a non-neutral net in Portugal. All that being said, there is a very distinct possibility that he will point to the internet left-leaning bias in these articles, and be less inclined to believe them.

174,"Hi there. My boyfriend continually brings this up as an issue and I keep telling him he’s being insecure and jealous when I did nothing wrong in my mind. I can se show it looks bad on his end but he keeps bringing it up and I want to explode.

I was traveling to Austin tx a few months the ago and used Lyft from my ride from the airport to my air bnb.

The Lyft driver was local, pretty chill, and I asked him if there were any good places to eat around where I’m staying. He said yes there’s a ramen or a Vietnamese place nearby- and it so happens the ramen place (ramen tatsuya) was somewhere I’ve wanted to eat looking at the good yelp reviews so I ask him to drop me there.

While there he said he was going to actually eat at the Vietnamese place next door to the ramen place and said bye while I stood in line for ramen. Turns out the Vietnamese place has a 30 min wait and the ramen place has no wait at all (usually busy) and he asked if it was okay to eat lunch with me because he had a client to pick up at 1pm (45 mins from then)

I said sure and we talked about childcare and his wife and being a parent. We finish lunch and I mentioned I needed a ride to a mall nearby (it was almost 1 and checkin for air bnb was 4) called the domain and coincidence has it that’s where his 1pm pickup is at and since he was already going there he would comp my ride there.

He drops me off at the mall and we never interact again. 

My boyfriend said I was irresponsible to have lunch with a stranger but he was chill and I was exhausted from the flight and coincidence had it that I got a free ride and tips for the city while having lunch with him. Does it look weird on his end? Is he being insecure/jealous? Am I being naive?

175,"We invited friends over for the holidays and there are five children involved. One is 2 and has auto-immune issues. One is over 1 and is the child of anti-vaxxers who claim they only postponed vaccinations so they would be spread further apart. And three are younger than that child.

I'm concerned that a child could get sick as a result of being around the anti-vaxxer baby. I want my husband to ask his friend to get a baby sitter. As far as I know, the baby isn't allowed in daycare, so shouldn't be around other children unless their parents consent, but it's a lot of trouble to explain the situation. It's easier if their child is left at home. I would not let my baby around her, if I had one.

My husband is concerned that this conversation would ruin his friendship. It's mostly his friend's wife who is against vaccinations. He trusts his friend and believes that should be enough. If his friend says she's up to date on vaccinations, then he thinks we should trust that. But I don't trust that. I don't trust their judgement and it's not worth risking another person's health. They may say she's up to date, but she has been opted out of several vaccines for all I know. I simply don't trust them.

177,"About two years ago I got involved with a church, and met some great people who are now like family. Amanda (names changed) is one of them. She's also 38, and for the last 13 years has been married to Josh, who's 39. Josh exited active Marine duty in 2013, and they have four kids together. For the entirety of their marriage, they've never stayed in one location more than four years. Even as a civilian, Josh has moved the family around--going to a tech school in Wisconsin for two years, then taking a job in Haiti of all places. After that fizzled in two years, he's moved them to Virginia for a new job. 

Amanda is from Wichita, and is extremely tight with her family, all of whom live in Kansas. I met her, because over the two years Josh had the job in Haiti, she could only last two months down there before she lost it and came back to KS. Every comment she'd drop regarding Josh was negative: 
-He doesn't speak her love language (he's quality time, she's physical touch/words of affirmation; he thinks he's loving her by speaking HIS language)
-He's a nomad and never stays in one place
-""sometimes I wonder if I married the right man.""
-""the kids cry when I leave them with him to run errands.""
-etc.

Amanda's two younger brothers are part of the church and I'm pretty much family to them. The brothers tell me of his argumentative and controlling tendencies. He doesn't allow cable in the house. He always has to check-in on Amanda (when she's separated from Josh, she's ALWAYS on her phone, presumably arguing with him). They tell me that Josh refuses to build up Amanda, claiming Christians shouldn't have to be affirmed, encouraged, loved, etc. Amanda has verified this claim...""I have almost no respect for a man who thinks like that."" Josh has criticized her physical appearance...and he of course is never wrong.

Josh even made her sell her Jeep, promising that they'll upgrade to a minivan in a few months when they find the right deal. They do need a van/SUV with four kids and a German Shepherd, but to me, that's another isolation behavior.

So, why does she stay? The kids...and money. She hasn't worked outside the home in over ten years. She has a cosmetology degree, but hasn't used it. She's basically been a single mom while Josh was in the military. That worked, because she didn't have to deal with him. But now that he's a civilian, Amanda hasn't gone more than six months without getting extended time away from him. Amanda homeschools the four kids, so that makes no time for a job.

I believe she's been emotionally abused for a long time. She basically told me that no decision in their marriage has ever been her preference. For example, she wasn't even able to know the gender of her babies until birth, all because Josh didn't want to know. She said she's getting to the point of not even praying to God because Josh controls so much. She told our pastor that she can't stand anything that Josh says. They've tried counseling and Josh won't receive it.

Amanda lacks self-confidence due to her mother's religious legalism that she deposited on her kids, and that's why she took off for college in Texas to get away from the mother. But after a few years there, and Amanda still not having healed from how she was raised, Josh found her. Amanda went from one controller to another.

So, I say all of that to get to this: I so love this woman! Amanda is incredibly smart, funny, can sing the phonebook, is extremely beautiful, and a great mom. But she's trapped in this marriage with no money. I've been attracted to women in the past and it's mostly been about how they make me feel. With Amanda, all I think about is wanting her loved...wanting her to be whole. I don't think she realizes I see all of this. And what leads me on a bit is that, she either likes or comments on an overwhelming majority of my Facebook posts...like three times as many as anyone else. Is that some sort of sign to me?

I'm not sure if there's anything I should do, or can do right now. I try to refrain from messaging her too much just because I know how Josh is. But I'm worried Amanda will either end up self-harming or that Josh will escalate to physical abuse. What should I do?",23Nov2017,3
178,"Hey guys I recently came across this job opportunity which I saw on indeed and then applied directly on their website.

We are trying everything in our power to have her stay, but are slowly coming to a dead end. My main questions for y'all are:

- If she does change visas to a work visa from her current Au Pair visa (I believe it is a J-1), is there an extension of time that she has to find a job after the transition is made?

- How much does it typically cost an employer to sponsor her? We have a couple options of where she could work, one being my work, but since it is the Holidays, we are waiting until Friday to talk with my bosses.

I get upset/sad about stuff but I don't hold it for this long so I'm just worried that it may be something more serious or he hasn't told me the full truth of why he's upset. He was all jolly and happy on Sunday so it must have been something that happened at work. I know this sounds lame and I sound crazy but it's just hard to see my boyfriend like this when he was always so optimistic and happy about everything, I never seen this type of behavior in him before. On monday he said he wanted some alone time which I gave him, but I reminded him that he could come and talk to me whenever he wants, but there hasn't been a lot of communication between us honestly. Should I still give him more space? I'm honestly not sure what to do anymore, I've just never seen this in him before and he doesn't act like this so I'm a bit worried. Has anyone ever dealt with a situation like this before?

**tldr:**

Boyfriend is upset over something at work, said he wanted some alone time, been 4 days since we have actually communicated other than really small talk, what should I do?",23Nov2017,2

199,"Ok. So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and for most of that time I've known that he will eventually leave the town we're in to go do something else (it's his hometown so naturally he wants to leave at some point). Around 4 months ago he had plans to leave on a six month trip. I was super supportive and even loaned him some money for plane tickets even though I was really bummed about it. As soon as I had come to terms with it he decided not to go. Now, he's planning to travel for an indefinite amount of time whenever he gets together the money for it. I'm currently in college, so even thought I would love to go with him there isn't any way for me to travel for more than 1-2 months at a time (and of course even then I would have to save up the money to do so...which would be difficult considering I pay most of the rent and bills).
So I guess what I'm asking is just? How to tell if it's just time to move on even though you dont want to? It's becoming obvious that our paths are just not the same and if we stay together it will probably end up being long distance for chunks of time. I feel like I could manage a LDR especially since I'm really busy most of the time but right now it just feels like im sitting around waiting to know what will happen when he leaves (and it rlly sux). Has anyone been in a similar situation? I just really don't know what to do and I don't want to break up with him but I also just don't want to get hurt.",23Nov2017,3

201,"I’m not sure if I have the right to be upset or if I’m overreacting. 

This morning my boyfriend came over and asked if anyone wanted to get coffee and muffins. My brother asked if he could tag along and my boyfriend agreed. After they left I was thinking to myself I should text him “Don’t speed with my brother in the car”. My boyfriend usually goes over the speed limit but I’ve told him multiple times I don’t feel comfortable with him doing that with me or my siblings in the car. If he wants to do that my himself I don’t care but he should never put my families’ life in danger for the thrill of speeding. 

Anyways he comes back and says to me “I saw your text but I didn’t see it until it was too late sorry”. My brother explained he asked my boyfriend to “do it for the snap” I checked my brothers Snapchat story and it’s of my boyfriend speeding in a 45 doing 85 and smirking.

202,"Preface: I’m 21, a girl, going to a small private university (not a big state type school) in the Chicagoland suburbs. My classes have max 5-10 people in them. 

So recently I’ve come to terms with the fact that my current friends are incredible toxic who treat me like garbage and I’m sick of being walked over by them after a recent event that just drew the line. 
I’ve been friends with them for years  and should have left them years ago but it’s so hard to leave that “bubble” of friends. I’m planning on staying in touch casually with them but I just want to transition myself into being friends with healthier, better people. College is the place to “meet” people but when you live at home and go to a small private university it’s kind of hard because you don’t exactly live on campus and I work a lot after classes so I can’t even stick around campus too often. 

I did meet this girl recently who lives close to me and we have a lot in common. Let’s call her Marnie. She’s super nice and I invited her to my Friendsgiving party, and at my Friendsgiving she met all of my friends (aka the toxic people in my life I need to distance myself from). I bonded with her more and we are getting breakfast tomorrow. I really think she’s super cool, and I want to be closer to her but don’t want to desperate and force it. 

She has a really nice seeming group of friends. I see them hanging out on snap and stuff and they all live so close to me and I want so badly to be invited and just like be a part of them but i don’t want to be awkward and just like show up to the bar they’re at and force it you know? I’m not a stalker lol. I wanna naturally and respectfully attempt to get closer to this girl, and hopefully she’ll introduce me to her friends. But I need tips on how to do this because the truth is... I’ve been friends with my current group for so long, without branching out, that I don’t even know how to do this. 

My current group is elitist, snobby, judgmental, and not true friends. They’re toxic and talk shit behind your back. I give my friendships  genuine effort and my current friends just use each other for Instagram posts and superficial reasons. I only have 1 REAL friend in that group and she and i have been talking lately after something happened and decided we NEED to branch out. We’ve been treated so horribly and walked all over by that group that we have seriously to seriously reevaluate our friendships for our own mental healths sake. I want to be friends with a healthy, nice group of friends. 

This new girl I’ve met, Marnie, her friends seem really chill and nice. I met her once on campus and literally just invited her to my party on a spontaneous whim and from there we’ve bonded some more and she visited me at work (I’m a barista) and now we have plans for breakfast tomorrow. I don’t want to force the conversation or make her think I’m trying to force myself into  her life. But i do kind of want to just open myself up to her a little bit more and maybe vaguely explain to her (I don’t like talking shit so I don’t want to just talk shit about my current friend group) to her that my current group of friends aren’t people I think is good for me to stay friends with. I’m hoping we get along enough for me to be a part of her group eventually if she invited me you know?

My question is: what can I do? how do I let Marnie know I’m interested in wanting to get to know her friends? I want nothing more than to break free of my toxic group of friends. Marnie lives close, goes to my school, is super genuine and nice, actually willing to hang with me even though we just recently met, and seems to have a really cool group of friends. It’s like the perfect chance opening up for me and I need to take it somehow but I have to actually be proactive for once in my life. However I don’t want to weird her out or be forceful. I want to be proactive, but not clingy and stalkerish. How do I balance these?  

Any advice? ",23Nov2017,4
203,"I'm an introvert. I really, really appreciate my time alone. My SO is as well, maybe a tad less. He has a great family, and we visit them several times a month. Almost once a week. His little brother and his girlfriend are my best friends. Best, as in the closest friends i have ever had, but probably not that close to other people's standards. The amount of time we spend together is perfect for me. Any more and i would be drained.

But it worries me that all the people that are close to me, are so because of him. If one day we weren't together anymore, i would literally have no one. I'm not close with my family. We see each for most birthdays and sometimes Christmas, thats it. We only ever call to talk about the next visit.

I want friends of my own, but i dont feel like i have any time for other friends. And i don't want to cut down on my time with his family and our friends, i would feel left out.

What a dumb stupid dilemma with no solution. :(

Do you think of it as unhealthy that i dont have any friends of my own? Is it necessary that i do? ",23Nov2017,4
204,"So, my house is next to a special-needs in-home daycare.   A few of the kids there are pretty severely autistic, which complicates this.   They seem to have around six kids in there at any given time, sometimes up to ten.  I have to have some understanding, here, but my patience is running out.

Basically, they toss anything they can get their hands on into my back yard.   I clean it up about once a week, and sometimes it fills up two yard bags.  Two!!   Everything from plates, McDonalds cups, adults clothes, children's shoes, and TONS of those super-cheap plastic balls you get from the dollar store.   At first I was tossing it back over, but I stopped doing that when the same things got tossed back, plus a bunch more.  Now I just toss everything in the trash.

So, the other two sides of their fence have some latticework at the top, except for my side.   I'm wondering if they could legally compelled to improve their fence height to deter these kids from tossing their trash into my yard?   I'm wondering if the other neighbors got them to do that somehow.

I have indeed talked to... someone (theres so many random adults in there that I have no idea who actually owns/runs the place), and they basically shrugged and said ""hey, they're autistic.  What can ya do?""

My patience is beginning to run out, and I'd like to know what legal options I can pursue.  I feel I should either be compensated for the time I spend cleaning up a *place of business's trash*, or they should build the new fence.    I also fear a reduction in home value if potential buyers are checking the place out and see a ratty old shoe come sailing over the fence.

207,"I met this guy over the weekend at a friend's birthday and I struck up a connection with him. We hung out all night and had a great time dancing &amp; drinking. I told him I didn't want to sleep with him, which he respected. We ended up kissing &amp; cuddling &amp; talking at my apartment, and then he left in the morning. He's a very nice guy and I indeed liked him, but he lives 4 hours away.

Anyways, ever since parting ways...this guy has been nonstop texting me and snap chatting me. Every single message says something cheesy and flirtacious. It's not even like we're having a real conversation, everything is just flattery...which i find cheesy and weird. Every time I check my phone I see a message from him and it's basically started to really irritate me. He asked if we could talk on the phone, and I said yes, (but i thought it was a little weird) so we did for about 20 minutes...the next day he calls again and leaves a voicemail.

To me, this is just WAY too much for two people who had a nice night together. He is essentially acting like we are in a relationship and I'm not ready for it. He even said he'd like to take me up to his city for a weekend, or come down to me. I would much rather get to know someone slowly, with real conversations, over a long period of time, before acting this way with them. I'd rather only text or call someone if it's going to be about a specific topic/be a real conversation rather than him flirting with me and calling me attractive every second. It overwhelms me and starts to feel very forced. I get that we made out &amp; had a connection, but this behavior is really turning me off and overwhelming me!

208,"My boyfriend’s Mum recently disclosed to me that my boyfriend’s Dad (who she is now serrated from) raped her several years ago whilst they were still married. 

Since they have separated my boyfriend (of 4 years) has become much closer with his Dad. I have always got along with his Dad very well and thought him to be a nice man until his mum told me about when he raped her. She told me that my boyfriend doesn’t know, and she does not want him to ever know. This has placed me in the most awful dilemma. 

Rape is something that sickens me, and I could never forgive anyone for it no matter who they were. But I don’t want to tell my boyfriend as I feel that it is his mum’s decision to tell him should she decide. Equally I know it would destroy my boyfriend to know that his Dad did such a thing and the thought of destroying the relationship he has with his dad tears me up. 

We do not live close to his parents so only see them a few times a year. I have not seen his Dad since before his mum told me. But with Christmas approaching I am now in the position where I want to make excuses to get out of having to see him over the Christmas period because I’m so disgusted with what I was told and feel I cannot “pretend” to be nice to a man that would do something like that when morally I think he is a piece of shit.
I do not wish to speak to any of my family or friends who all know my boyfriend about the matter as I do not want to tell them something so serious about my boyfriend’s dad when he does not know himself. 

I know there are always two sides to each story but I feel this never excuses rape. Equally I do not feel this is a made-up story to somehow get me to dislike the Dad as she and him are now on neutral ground and both have new partners and are happy in their new lives apart.  

I want to protect my boyfriend but cant ignore my moral compass and pretend to play happy families with this man….Any advice would be so welcomed. Thank you.

211,"Hi Reddit,

I need your advice on a situation with a friend. I’ll call her X (F, 42). She’d had a shitty year, arguments with her husband and various other issues. X went to hospital and was unwell (stomach issue), so I offered to go in and visit her. She seemed fine, if a little tired. She said that she was being discharged in a few days but had to go in again in a couple of weeks for a minor keyhole op and was on pain meds for the time being. 

A couple of days later, I sent a text to X asking if she fancied meeting up and going for a (gentle) walk. I didn’t get a response, and I found out that X had apparently unfriended and blocked me, along with a mutual friend, Y (F, 33). Neither of us could remember anything we might have done to upset her. We thought maybe she might just want a facebook break and left it at that.

A few days later I got a text from X saying she was at work, but she’d forgotten to pick up her prescription, could I collect it for her? I was a bit confused but said ok. She couldn’t seem to thank me enough, and later on that evening sent me a text asking if I was free the following Monday and we could meet for lunch, so I said yes, we’ll do that. She “re-friended” me and I accepted. 

We text and PM'ed each other over the next few days. Monday comes around and I sent X a text in the morning, asking what time we should meet and where (we hadn’t pre-arranged an exact time or location, just left it that we’d get in contact with each other on the day). I sent X several texts asking if she was still up for meeting but got no response to any of them. I then get a text back saying that this is her son and she has a new phone.

I didn’t know what to do at this point, so I went to a local cafe and connected to their Wi-Fi, thinking I could send her a message to check everything was ok, and see if we could rearrange, to find out that X had unfriended me again, and also completely blocked me this time, so I was unable to send any messages to her at all, by text or by facebook. I messaged another mutual friend and asked if X was ok, and if she knew if I had upset X in some way. She said she didn’t think I'd done anything, but that X had blocked her too. 

I was upset about it for a couple of weeks, I was worried, I wasn’t sure if she was ill or if she was upset at me. My partner said that X obviously didn’t want to be in contact, and to just let it go. Y said that X was stressed and stress made people do odd things. I said that I appreciated that X had stuff going on, (I still wasn't sure if she had had to go back for her op) but that I did too and this was confusing me. After a month of no contact by text or facebook, and still apparently blocked, I just gave up and let it go, thinking that she didn’t want to talk anymore. 

All of a sudden about 2 months later, X started messaging me again. I replied slowly at first because I wasn’t sure what was going on, and left most of the talking to her. I was feeling really confused. We exchanged occasional messages over about 2 months, I asked how she was, she said things were great, I said things were ok but a bit stressful. I went to Y’s, and X was there, being all friendly. I was caught by surprise, I’d spent weeks worrying, thinking I’d upset her or that she didn’t want to be friends, or that she was unwell, and she was just acting like everything was fine. She’s not given me any explanation and has now sent me a friend request.  

What do I do reddit? I don’t know what to make of what’s happening. I’m confused and a bit upset again.

So I like this girl, let’s call her Katelyn.  She’s attractive, plays softball, you get the point.  I invited her to go out to have some pizza and she accepted.

I also invited another girl, we’ll call her Isabel.  The reason why invited her to come was to make it less awkward between Katelyn and I.  She brings along her best friend(they go everywhere together)

So when I get there, all 3 are picking out what pizza they want.  Katelyn and Isabel’s best friend say hi to me but Isabel didn’t even look at me, didn’t say hi or anything.  We order our food, sit down, talk about our thanksgiving plans and such.  They start talking about people I don’t know.

I sat quiet for the most of the time unless I can relate to something.  So it was really, really awkward for me.  Isabel completely ruined the plan, she acted like I wasn’t even there.  So after an hour or so, my ride came said bye to everyone, Isabel didn’t even look at me, didn’t say anything.  Her best friend and Katelyn said bye.  So I got home, I immediately FaceTimed my friend to tell her that I think Isabel is mad at me.

I told her to FaceTime Isabel and Katelyn on another device while I listened.

Isabel answered and my friend asked how it went and stuff.  She said that is was the “most akwardest thing ever.”  Saying that I was super weird and that I always want to FaceTime her. (I only asked twice to talk about something).  And that I was super quiet the whole time.  My friend defended me saying that he’s my favorite person to FaceTime because we never stop talking while you just let me sit there.  Then she talked more shit about me saying that I’m just some white boy.  Katelyn just sat there not saying anything.  I felt horrible just listening to this, I couldn’t talk to anyone for an hour I was so suspect.

I thought Isabel was my friend, now I know that she’s just a fake like everyone else.  I can’t just stop talking to Isabel because she’ll know what’s up.  Any way that I could get a second chance with Katelyn?  What can I do with her so we learn more about each other? What do I do? ",23Nov2017,5

My ex-girlfriend and I broke up about a month ago. We share a lease that we've both signed in Toronto and are moving out of the apartment come the end of December. Since the breakup, she has had a new tinder dude over time and time again. I've informed her that it makes me uncomfortable and I would prefer if said person was not in the apartment as things that belong to me (namely my bed, and ALL of the furniture) are being used. I'm speeding up the process and moving out next week after finding condom wrappers on the ground, and my bed used. Today she asked me if she could have tinderella over again. I asked her politely not to have the dude in our space while I get my life together and get my things out. ""I am uncomfortable with anybody being around my things during this transitional time, I’m asking that you respect that until my belongings are gone from the space
Should you want to spend time with Alex, can you not respect my request and go to his house or meet up somewhere that you can be together?
Just cut me some slack here one time please""

No response.

If I go home and this guy is there, how do I deal with this? Is it trespassing? As much as I want to kick this dudes ass and throw him out I know that I would have a better case without doing such should things escalate. Need some advice here fellas.

I find myself snapchatting many girls only in an attempt to talk dirty with them or get nudes. I know that my actions probably make some of them uncomfortable and I feel gross about doing it, but for some reason it’s not as easy as just not messaging them. I really don’t wanna be that one slimey guy who always hits up girls. Do any of you have any advice?",23Nov2017,2
226,"Our chat this very morning:

Me: Good morning &lt;3
        I don't even have to be in until 1

Her: Sorry I didn't see as I was in class.
        Good morning &lt;3

Me: No worries.
       I actually have to get the bus to college in 10 minutes so I'll talk to you at ~4:30

Her: Okay, talk later &lt;3

I get back at 4:15 and go to message her except all our messages have disappeared and she's not on my friends list, also I tried searching her up on Add Friends but when I click the plus sign, it says ""Sorry [username] could not be found!""
I check Facebook where her profile is blank and Instagram where her account doesn't appear at all.
I went on my alternate Snapchat where I've sent her a couple of messages but she hasn't added me back or shown any sign of activity whatsoever.

Could anybody possibly explain why she would've pulled such a 180?

It was only two weeks and we met on Spotafriend (Which she's also blocked me on) so it's not a any serious relationship but it's really bumming me out since I really liked her, she seemed to really like me, and there's been not the slightest explanation whatsoever. Also I can't confront her in person since she lives 230 miles away and I know where she lives only down to the city, even if travelling that far to talk to somebody who blocked you wasn't weird enough.﻿

228,"This morning for Thanksgiving my mom was out running some errands. My brother (who is spending Thanksgiving with us) comes to my room to ask about this girl and if I know her. The thing is, I already told him no I didn't know her plenty of times. The girl he was talking about is a neighborhood drug dealer who sells weed. My brother pops pain pills, sells drugs, and sells weed as well, so he wanted to rob her. I told him that I don't rob people and it's not a good thing to do, which he proceeds to try and manipulate his words telling me he just wants me to ""set it up while he robs her, not actually rob her."" (Which not even a rocket science should know that's STILL robbery.). So after telling him no about 3 times, he ends by saying that robbing her would be so easy because she sells drugs herself, thus she can't go to the police. If that doesn't sound stupid in itself he ALSO mentions that he has another person, X in on this, but claims since X is cool with her, he might tell where we stay. Honestly, problems like this had been going on for years but this one puzzles me. I don't know how to feel or what to do. He got kicked out of my mom house around 6 months ago, but she's been recently letting him back in. He's only been spending the nights for now, but I think he wants to move back in, and I don't want to put up with any of this.

 What should I do?

FYI: My Mom doesn't know about him selling drugs and doesn't know he robs people.",23Nov2017,3

So I received my Grandfather, who is somewhat hard to shop for. Usually when one of the family in my generation gets him, they get him Oreos because he likes those. I don't want to do that, it seems cheap and not really that thoughtful. My grandmother pulled me aside, apologized for giving me a tough one, and suggested a book he would like. 

I could get him the book, but I wanted to try and be a little more creative. Maybe even get both the book and something else.

Thats the thing,im afraid to talk to girls.Ever since i was a little kid i was shy of girls and every time i saw one i would act like i did not see them.Im not as shy now but i have this voice in this head telling me not to trust any girl because they hate me.I don't wanna be rejected, as it is i don't even know how to talk to a girl.Plus as it is i don't even have no friends,literally my only 2 friends i had don't really talk to me as much anymore because im not a gamer anymore.How can i stop thinking about her?

239,"Hey guys, I wanted some advice or your opinions on a certain problem I feel I have.

For some reason, I feel that I have a problem where I get too invested in someone, even though they barely came into my life, which ends up hurting me when they leave (even if we knew each other for a brief moment). I can definitely say it isn't too severe where I end up obsessively stalking them, but it creates a certain paranoia that leaves these negative thoughts that worry if I'm pushing them away.

I guess a good example would be, I just recently tried online dating, meeting up with one or two people because I get nervous asking people out in person. It went well, and it felt like we were going in the right direction, maybe be exclusive. A large part of me wants to say I only thought that because of the attachment problem I feel I have.

We talked a lot, which was great, but lately she replied less, saying her ex contacted her, and they were sorting things out, and that she needed to clear her head.
It's been eating me up inside, knowing full well it's understandable since we just met, how it's her ex, but still have all these feelings that is screaming to be noticed.

TLDR; I guess what I'm trying to say is, without all the nitty-gritty details is that, how do I stop being so invested in someone so quickly? I know things are happening for a reason, (like her wanting to clear her head) and I know what I should do, but these thoughts are eating me up inside.",23Nov2017,3
240,"Hey so Im 14 years old and absolutely horrible at 3 sports: basketball, volleyball and football. The problem is these are the 3 main sports, my friends always play it at lunch and I don't because Im so bad and I just cannot play. 
The thing is Im fit, I do the mile run easily, I'm very flexible, I have good balance and I have very strong legs and cores, as well as average arm strength. I do windsurf, biking and dance. Im a really fast swimmer and I love racket sports as well as workouts and endurance.

However with these 3 sports, I am horrible. I cannot catch, I cannot throw, I cannot dribble or do overhead shots or dig or anything. My body moves awkwardly; I cannot hit the ball and I just end up giving up. I feel jealousy because I cannot do anything in some social events due to my inability to play these sports. I feel embarrassed in gym class and get the image of being weak even though Im not. I wish I could be good....

I'm really skinny. I get told I'm skinny a lot. I get told it's unhealthy sometimes. I feel like others are probably grossed out by my appearance, or that they think nasty things about me, like I don't know how to take care of myself, or that I'm a slob. These are probably the main reasons why I feel uncomfortable exercizing around others.

244,"So I live away from home and my aunt was feeding our two cats every day whilst my parents are on a 3 week holiday. 

I got a text from my aunt last night saying our oldest cat, normally healthy, upbeat and only recently had his check up, was looking lethargic and she wanted to take him to the vets for a check up. 

An hour later, the vets decided he had a liver problem that had slowly developed and suddenly become acute. They were going to keep him in overnight. Half an hour later, another text saying they had tried to give him IV fluids and his heart couldn’t cope - they tried giving him glucose and resuscitating him but he passed away. 

My parents have been away for two weeks and are coming home in 6 days and I need to decide when to call them and tell them the news. 

Our family is generally really open, upfront and honest about what’s going on with each other - but this will be completely out of the blue. 

I am tempted to tell them tonight so we can grieve together, they don’t feel like they are out of the loop and I know whilst it will taint the holiday they won’t be angry for being told days later without knowing anything at the time, over a potentially superficial reason of enjoying their shopping and restaurants.  Chances are they will be upset and shocked, but will still be able to do all the activities they want and reasonably enjoy them. 

I’ve had a lot of advice telling me that I will spoil their holiday and should wait until it’s been 5-6 days so not to ruin it.

246,"Hi, things have been hard for me the past 10 years, and really bad the laat year, I've been fighting with my girlfriend a lot and I have no friends anymore.

I grew up in a fucked country on war, when I was a kid I saw a lot of combat and dead, is not that it traumatized me, but it did made me way too cold, no 7 year old boy should see that, but life continuee I guess, also my father was never there, the guy left when I was 2

In school I was always seen as the weird kid, somehow I was more aware of reality and never fitted in, it made me a really aggressive person all the stress from high school, some kid put a knife on me once and I had to fight him, I hate violence but things were really hard on those times.

But I guess one of my biggest issues was the sexual abuse that a woman put me through, she was older than me and drug me to abuse me... I balmed myself for it for years and hold it to myself just until this year.

I really know life isn't easy, but sometimes you can't take it anymore, and lately I've been sinking in depression, just a few weeks ago I was in the hospital for a suicide attempt, I seek for help before, and it didn't helped, the drugs make you feel dope but your feelings still there and all that emotional charge.

257,"good afternoon everyone, this is my first post here, and its a long one. i am having suicidal thoughts (not to the point of planning to act on them, but to the point they are making my life hopeless and depressing), this is gonna be a slightly long post, but please bare with me, i am in dire need of help.

Let me first start by this, i am a 23 year old international student in the U.S, i weigh over 350 pounds (which for some reason does not show as i dont look like an elephant, more like a stacked human ball), my height is 5'10, and got a somewhat hairy body, not gorilla hairy but still hairy nonetheless, which may be relevant later.

i came here a few months back, my life was shit before coming here, which at this point isnt relevant because i came here to start a new page, which by the way, was hell. when i first came here, a guy from my country was waiting for me at the airport, who i paid a lot of money to, in order for him to get me a room and help me start my new life, which he did, the room was a little expensive, and on the day of arrival, he drove me straight to my room, i paid the rent, next morning roommate who holds lease tells me i have to leave because i was snoring and did not let him sleep, this guy is from my country as well and knows the struggle, but that doesn't move a single shit particle in him. the first guy who waited for me at the airport, lets call him D for douche bag, D came to pick me up and took me to his house, stayed for him for a week, he found me another room (in NY btw), the room was in NJ, latina in her late 40s with a pet, complained about every single thing i did, threw a fit at one point and kicked me out, i had nowhere to go, D was not willing to help and practically abandoned me. i went to a hotel and stayed there for two days which cost me $200, i made a few calls, managed to get some help, stayed at someone's basement for over 4 months, the basement was dirty, a lot of mouse droppings, roaches, bed bugs, etc, but was grateful nonetheless, through some help i got a living room on my own, which i am currently staying at, it is pricey for a living room but the location is nice and slightly convenient. first two days i got bitten by bed bugs all over, used spray, still same problem. guy with the lease tells me someone messy used to live in the vacant bedroom before and he left, he says hes tired of dealing with people and plans to move out next month and get his own room, which does not sound convincing to me, as i felt it was a polite way of him telling me to pack my shit and find another room, which was within the first week of my rent, currently im in my third, he said he cannot pay for the other vacant room as the apartment is too expensive and hes trying to get someone in there, if he cant, then he will have to leave. today he comes and tells me he found someone, then he says he will need the living room for his family and i need to start looking for a room, then he switches the subject and says he can stay for another 6 months if the guy wants to rent the room, and asks me to deal with the odor and says he does not want to babysit, i understand that people have different odors but i never had anyone complain about mine, although after a long day i do smell funky and no matter how much deodorant or antiperspirant i put on i still smell awful after a few hours outside, but i usually take a shower when i get home and spray air freshener around my space and put on some axe, which the guy says it only makes my odor more intense, i honestly have no idea what i am dealing with, how do i smell, if its that bad and how to fix it and its taking a toll on my mental health, i switched degrees and my new program here is taking me a lot of effort to catch up and to get used to the system here, each week the assignment take manage to take a lot of time from me, and its preventing me from functioning as a normal human being. i just came to my space to lay down and the guy went to his room after he told me all this, i want to do something about this, but there are other things going on that make me demotivated and i just have no idea what to do or where to start.

also a few more things that i am having trouble dealing with:

-i have a girlfriend, still a virgin and left her back home, i do not plan on having sex with any other girl and have to wait after marriage, which is resulting in me having to masturbate at least 3 days a week, something i really want to avoid after hearing of the NoFap movement and its benefits. -Bedbug bites, these things are itchy and i wanna get rid of them, but extermination is expensive and i am on a tight budget. -Body odor which no matter what i do still remains. -i have made 0% progress towards my goal of getting a job here or an internship and potentially becoming a resident due to issues like this. -i cannot stand for more than 15 minutes which having my feet hurting. -i feel lazy or demotivated to do some basic stuff like going to laundry or even taking a shit sometimes. -i do not take my studies here that seriously despite getting good grades, which is mainly because the college is a for-profit private college, which leads me to another issue ive been dealing with. -a consultation office back in my country took my folder and documents and told me they will help me study in the U.S, i paid a hefty amount of money for a risk when applying for visa which i somehow managed to get, they sent me to this college i am at right now, its a for-profit private college, with only international students who're mostly indians and jamaicans in it and other branches consisting of mainly black students, which is fine and i do not mind but that is nothing close to what i had in mind and it shat on all of my motivation (seeing as my english is at the very least decent and i managed to get a high score in toefl, i thought i would be studying with americans or a vastly diverse college), i do not know if i have any chance of getting a job or an internship because of this, nor am i getting the college experience i always dreamed of, and now im just going with the flow with no goals, no passion, and only depression and hardships dealing with everyday life. and i do not want to disappoint my family back home who spent a crap ton of money on me and are really proud of this piece of shit that i am despite being a total failure.

Please help, i have never needed this much help in my life, i am lost and depressed and i am starting to think i have anxiety and i feel like i cant bring myself to enjoy the smallest things in life, i need advice.

262,"I'm [21M] and just returned from the USA to my home country with my American Girlfriend. As we had no place to stay while we found accommodation, my father said he had a room that we could rent while we find work/accommodation which is very reasonable. For about a week we were fine, everyone getting along. Then after a couple week he started setting ""rules""... my girlfriend and I have to get up at 8 a.m. every morning and look for accommodation. Keep in mind we were looking daily for a place and work. He became more controlling and condescending. I love him since he's family but he possesses some very abusive characteristics that have come to light as of recent. When I was younger, he would physically hit me. He cheated on my mum and destroyed our family. I know he is guilty, and is very monotone; lives to work and be successful. He would confront me and scream at me, block the door, say that I'm wasting my life, tell me that my girlfriend isn't good for me. All the while I pay rent, clean, look for a place and work, and try my best to keep him content. I don't want to be here, and we're trying our best to get out of this place. Is it unreasonable of us? We both feel like low lives and worthless because he treats us like it. I researched signs of mental abuse and he does the following which is concerning:


* Increased Anxiety – It is easy for a child to become anxious when questioned about every move, motive or aptitude.

* Nitpicking – Whatever is important to the child is minimized in comparison to the parent’s agenda. The parent belittles accomplishments, aspirations, or personality in front of others.

* Insecurity – From being held to an unrealistic, unattainable or unsustainable standard. Then when the child fails, they are treated as inferior.

* Confusion – Being treated as an extension of the parent, not as a separate person.

* Alienation – Belittling friends and other family members to convince child those people are unimportant.

* Intense Manner of Speech – It is argumentative and demanding with frequently interruptions and interrogating.

* Personal Attacks – Common examples include criticizing, defaming character, berating feelings, and judging opinions.

* No Apology – Parents refuse to take responsibility, become hostile, invalidate or dismiss feelings of the child, lie, and conveniently forget promises or commitments.

* The Stare – An intense stare with no feeling behind it.

* Gaslighting – Lying about the past to intentionally making a child doubt their memory, perception, and sanity.

* Rage – An intense, furious anger that comes out of nowhere, usually over nothing, startling and shocking the child into compliance or silence.

* Restraint – Confines by blocking a doorway, locking doors

* Intimidation – Bullying by standing over, looking down, or getting “in your face” and refusing to back off.

* Budget – Puts child on a strict allowance with impossible expectations thereby setting them up for failure.

* Dichotomous Thinking – Dividing people into two parts: those who agree with the parent and those who don’t. The parent makes fun of, belittles, and shows prejudice towards other’s beliefs.

* Submission – Requires that the child completely adopts the parent’s point of view. There is no room for differing opinions or questioning their authority.

* Public Performance – Demands perfection and happiness from the child at all times. 

Before you criticize me, I am only seeking positive, affirmative, or neutral advice. Please no negativity. Thank you.

264,"I have 4 main friends, im goin to call them Gemma,molly, kate and Anne. I'm just gonna say it, Molly is our leader, everyone always suddenly wants to do what she wants to. I could say I'm going to the bathroom, and nobody would bat an eye but if she said it THEN EVERYONE GETS UP AND GOES. I follow too because I don't want to be left behind and alone. Over the summer Molly and Gemma have been spending lots of time together, went camping and go to each others house a lot, none of the rest of us have ever been invited. I feel like the rest of us are just replacements for their friendship. Whenever molly isn't there, Gemma talks to us and vice Verda with moly. I don't like this feeling and I don't want to be anyone's replacement. I have now begun to feel dislike towards them but I know that if I say it I will look like the bad guy and my friend group will leave 
me and I don't have any other friends. How do I deal with this situation,I need help. Thank you",23Nov2017,1
267,"I am 21. I am currently in college, and ever since I graduated high school, my mental state has started to get progressively worse. I used to have a really strong personality and high self esteem, I had my own opinions and I stood up for myself every time. However, ever since depression and anxiety took over me, I am finding it increasingly difficult to have a personality, an identity. This is because of two reasons:

1). I've been losing interest in everything that I used to love.

2). This one is bothering me the most. I get influenced by peoples' opinions too fucking much. I can watch a movie that I absolutely love and, after seeing a few negative comments on IMDB or a bad rating, I immediately start to hate the movie and never want to watch it again in my life. The most recent example is my favorite band. Used to love them and everything about them and their music until I read a bunch of negative comments, realized that it's probably the most hated band of all time, dropped the band and never returned to them. Why is this happening to me? I am losing things that are very important and special to me because it seems like I cannot control the influence that people have on me. Most of the time I am not even sure of what I feel, I have confusing feelings and I can never reach the point where I'm confident or 100% sure of what I'm feeling. I feel like, if many people hate something, it automatically means that something is bad and I shouldn't enjoy it, even though I have previously enjoyed it, before reading the negative stuff. I tried to change this but the more I try, the worse the issue gets. I really need some advice, because this is ruining my life.",23Nov2017,2
270,"So basically my problem is that I am attending university but I just feel outclassed by others. Others seem to process information faster than me, need to study less and still get better marks.

I am always the one that finishes the test last minute and my marks are not good as well eventhough if others did study like I do than they would most definitely get better marks than me.

But other than going to UNI I don't think I have any other option. I guess my only small talent was when I was a child, playing soccer but I quit at 15/16(regret that a lot) and I am over 20 now so basically any career in sports is pretty much gone now.

I am also from an academic family so University is pretty much expected from me but even if it wasn't I don't have any passion/talent in trade anyways.

I am currently at a point where after years of ignoring the problem it grew to the size of a monster rn and I can't afford to wait any longer. I need to fix my lazyness but even than that wouldn't change my IQ which is obviously lower than the one of my peers.

So don't know if I should continue and need longer/have average to bad marks and then try to find a job or what else..
Was anyone in a similar situation that worked out eventually?

I want to once have a good paying job but I think to myself what is even the point if everyone else is smarter / quick thinker and will probably outclass me in any good position that pays well.

Adding to that I have a younger brother which also studies the same but is a smart guy so he passes everything with excellent marks and I have to deal with my parents asking me why I am behind and have worse marks...",23Nov2017,1

273,"My sister has mental health issues and is abusive to my family. In the past she has gotten violent and threaten to kill us. I went to the local police department to get there help and they told me the only thing they can do is arrest her. 

I don't know what to do. She is always suspicious of my parents and thinks they are out to get her. My parents still take care of her even though she is 35. 

Its thanksgiving and i am just sad and depressed

274,"A point in my childhood, my dad was the hyper-controlling parent. Not that there is anything wrong with regulating your kids, but not to that level where you need to manage even every petty little detail. I never really talked back to him because I know that temper tantrums and anger fits and corporal punishment would be the result. Obeying was the key.

My parents went through a divorce when I was in high school. It was their thing and my mom didn't want to get me involved.

A few months into the divorce (all of us still lived under the same house) he became INCREASINGLY emotionally abusive/oppressive to my mom and me. And every opportunity he saw to stir up some argument and disturb the peace, he would take it. It was usually towards my mom, but often I was collateral damage and he didn't care. After an event, my mom eventually got fed up with everything and called the police to get kick out of the house. He is no longer allowed within a certain distance from the property.

I moved away for college. Throughout my undergrad, my mom paid for all of my tuition and living expenses (after financial aid). She didn't make that much money, so she didn't have much to herself. He provided no support.

Fast forward. I am now attending grad school near home, so I am living under my mom's roof. She continues to pay for my living expenses and I pay my own tuition.

Throughout the years since my dad got kicked out of the house, we've had minimal contact. He would call me every 3-6 months asking to go have dinner, but often times it seemed like it was for the purpose of being in control, it was never about me. He would ask for details of the house. He would ask for bills and receipts from my college years and ask my to calculate the amount my mom contributed, but when I said she paid for everything he would accuse me of lying. I don't think he really understood what being a father meant.

When we still lived together, he often had periods of unemployment. And after the divorce, he's been often unemployed. He's been unemployed for the past 1.5 years and now he's demanding a huge chunk of my mom's salary as spousal support. My mom's health is deteriorating, but she works day and night to make a meager salary, in addition to paying for my living expenses. This is wrong. Even if the so-called ""law"" says it's so-called ""legal"", morally I do not think this is right. Especially for a man who has been oppressive, emotionally abusive, and unsupportive.

So what's the issue?

It's Thanksgiving and he's been calling to have our semi-annual dinner where he asks for information and potential things he can use to bring to court. But this is it, he's crossed MY LINE with the spousal support demand. I want to tell him that I will no longer see him if he continues with this. He wasn't supportive of my education and living expenses, fine, that's fine. But now taking money that isn't his, indefinitely, that is not fine with me.

So why not just tell him? 

Well you see...I've never spoken up to him in my life, EVER. I've talked back, debated, argued, demanded, stood against many different people in life, younger, older, superior, subordinate, but NEVER him. I guess a part of my fear from childhood is still inside of me.

Has anyone gone through something like this? Any tips?",23Nov2017,1
275,"Hello, there's some back story to this so I feel I should give it to you.

Me and this friend have not been friends for a long time but we have had a bit of a different relationship. We met in September, she's a First year student at the same University as me and I'm a second. Our 'friendship' began with us hooking up a few times and then hanging out and stuff. She had recently ended a 2 year long relationship that Summer so she said she wasn't ready for anything serious. We continued to mess around as FWB and then she kinda got into a rough spot in school mentally. She told me she couldn't fool around anymore cause she wasn't stable for it. We continued to be friends (hang out, talk, go to dining hall, study etc). Recently she has told me about things in her past about her mental health that she hasn't told anyone not even her close friends because she ""feels comfortable around me"". I have feelings for this girl and I don't want to lose her by telling her how I feel, but not telling her is also tearing me apart.

Any help is appreciated, and if my writing is confusing I can try and clarify.

Thanks.",23Nov2017,1
