0,"     My goal is to get back into community college and have my drivers licenses before the year ends, but the obstacle to both is my anxiety. 
     When I was learning to drive, I would be semi-okay until I started to shake, then I'd pull over and let the instructor (my dad, bless his patience) take the wheel because I had become so rattled, and I didn't want to put other drivers in danger due to my state. Community was going well (I first took only one class so I could a feel for what it would be like), the next semester I took two, and dropped because I was being reminded of my days in High School, and saw the differences between then and now, which lead to intense feelings of isolation and being overwhelmed. 
     I do want to drive myself around and become a writer (novelist, script writer for films/TV series, comic books, those areas) and I know that I have the ability, but how do I deal with the anxiety? Expose myself to the stressors and adapt to them, or seek professional help? Thanks for reading through all this, I wanted to be thorough. ",25Jan2017,1
3,"I'm a young asian male who made a stupid bet with a friend, lost it, and now I have to dye my hair hot pink in any style i wish. Two questions:


1. What style would you suggest? I have an egg shaped face with a strong jaw. My hair is short on the sides (think slightly longer than a buzz cut) and longer on the top and front- about 3 inches all around. It is similar to MarkIplier's (youtube gamer), but shorter in the front. I have very thin, wispy, black hair. I was thinking of bleaching/dyeing the top and front pink, and the leaving the sides black, or bleaching top/front to blonde and then frosting the tips so that they're pink. Thoughts?


2. I work in a hospital and I'm taking 2 weeks off so I can honor this bet. Luckily, my schedule is flexible enough so that I can make this happen. I'm not allowed to work in the emergency department with pink hair- it's unprofessional. How do I go about dyeing my hair back to its natural color when I have completed the bet? Think very, very dark brown. I'm also okay with a brown that's a few shades lighter than my natural hair color but nothing that stands out.

I've already posted to r/fancyfollicles but had low volume in response and I don't think r/malefashionadvice takes posts like these. So I'm turning to you guys.

4,"Lately I have not been doing very well mentally. Right now I've hit a very big low and I'm kind of scared by my own apathy. I realize that I need to get help but I don't know where to begin.

I'm 24, and when I was about 8 or 9  was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. In highschool I was told I have seasonal depression, however I'm almost positive it's year round. I've been able to manage these on my own until now, because it's becoming too overwhelming to deal with by myself. Tonight I just shut down. 

I don't know what I should be looking for; I don't know if I should reach out to a therapist or a psychologist, I don't know if I'm in a state where I need meds (and if so I'm very afraid to take them), and the biggest thing is I don't know if I can pay for it. I'm currently employed, but I'm not sure if I can spend $200 a month to see someone. I don't have insurance through my employer, and I am so confused every time I try to navigate what medicaid covers and what it doesn't.

7,"I'm being kicked out of my parents house for the last time in 2 weeks. 

My story isn't complicated. I have always sleeped a lot. Needed 14 hours or more to feel refreshed. Spent all of school waiting for it to be over. I loved the weekend not to go out and party, but to sleep. 

I achieved excellent grades and went to university. But I had expected the work to end. I saw highschool as the job. For 18 years. Then maybe I could relax. i didn't enjoy one day of primary or high school. It was one massive 12 year long chore. So I barely made it through 3 months of uni. I then slept. I still had the loan, so i just lived off it for 9 months. Sleeping. 

It was wonderful. I had never felt so relaxed and healthy in my life. i exercised and slept and ate. That was it. And I was utterly content. then the loan ran out. I got a job. Quit two weeks later. The manager was a dick. I am incredibly lazy and just wanted to sleep, and the money just piled up in my bank. I lived on two weeks wages for 4 motnhs. Then my paretns clued up and kicked me out.

I spent 6 months working, and dying. i hated it. Hated the people. hated the effort. Hated all of it. And I had to do it, including the commute for 9 hours a day, 4 days a week. JUST FOR A FLATSHARE AND BASIC BILLS. I had no leasure tiome, at all. id wake up, go to work, hate everything, go home, go to sleep, and repeat... I rarely even got the 14 horus i needed. 

I went to the doctor. I was put on ssri's, maoi's, xanax, melatonin, blah, blah... We tried everything. i saw a psychitrist. A sleep specialist. Apparently i was in great health. antidepressants, of which we tried every form, just made me feel sickly.

I though about uni, but had absolutely no idea what i might find interesting. I realized i needed something in my life. I started working 6 days a week so i could afford to try some clubs. I reduced to 10 hours sleep, and spent 6 months trying every sport, art, activity you can imagine. And I felt like shit. By the end of it, the doctor warned me my blood pressure and cholesterol was that of an overweight middle aged person. I was 22 and very athletic. 

Nothing interested me, and I felt completely drained and sick all the time. I snapped. went on unemployment and had a period of sweet sleep and relaxation again. Until it ran out. Ended up on the streets for 3 months. I actually slept well in shelters and felt fairly good. But my parents found out, and let me back in. Another year went by, sleeping, annoying doctors. After sleep studies, it was concluded I sleep normally, just need a lot of sleep. 

Prompted by my parents, i went back to uni. After one year of shear effort and hatred, and more debt, I gave up again. Slept for 6 months until they kicked me out. 

After another few months of homelessness, I got a job I could just about tolerate, and moved back in, with the intention of  paying off my uni debt and saving for a mortgage. That was 2 years ago. I just lost the job. i've just paid off my uni debt and have about 15k towards a 150k mortgage. But I am falling apart. My skin is againg by the day, i feel like shit, and just want to sleep. I know I will live off that 15k for a couple of years, then try to get another job, fall into the same pattern, and so on...

I feel, if I kill myself now I could get the inevitable over and done with. I mean, ill fall apart and die anyway, especially with the stress my body is under during the working periods. And all i want to do is sleep and rest anyway, so why not do it finally.

I really want a way out. But I cant find it. Any advice?

18,"If the title didn't make it obvious, this post talks about suicide, depression and self-harm.

He's been on this anti-depressant for a week, 6 or 7 days probably. He seems to be gradually getting worse the longer he has used it. He's already been on a lot of other anti-depressants that haven't worked for him so he wanted to keep with it, hoping it would get better. He refuses to talk to anyone besides me about how he feels because he's afraid of being put in a psych ward which he's been in before (involuntarily I believe). His parents don't seem the most supportive from when I've talked to him, they just want him to work and move out of the house and he's had a history of psychological issues and they don't seem to pay attention when he has collapsed at work and is put in the hospital for example. He has no one else that is close to him or really supportive besides me but I've never met him in real life.

At this point he's telling me he wants to die and be hurt but say's he can't do anything because he can't leave his bed in the first place. Nothing has happened lately besides him taking the meds and he wasn't doing this bad before he took the meds especially not beyond a couple days and he would feel a bit better for a little while. My main question is if he should stop taking the meds? Idk if he would if I asked him to but I could try, there's limited amount that I could do personally I think though, he isn't as talkative at the moment, understandably of course. I welcome any other advice you might have as well though.

I'm still getting absolutely shafted on registration dates, plus the computer science department has too many fucking students and not enough staff/classes to compensate. I've been in college for 8 years, unemployed, and I already feel like a piece of shit. Each time I can't get a class I need - it's been two semesters of that now - sets me back a semester because of how prerequisites work. I'm in the upper division courses so there is nothing else I can take.

  Im sitting at 10/12 units right now, half of them NOT prerequisites to other things. Im getting a state grant, a fed grant, and a loan, but due to not having 12 units it's not enough money to cover rent. I live with my mom and my money is literally necessary for us to get by, and it's the cheapest place I can get ($400/month). My loan is capped at 2k per year and I've already taken that full amount.

Those days are done and over now. 

Yet in still one question remains. What now?

It's like trying to find your way home, and realizing that home has been inside of you the whole time. Despite that, I am still living with people that are worlds away from my lens on life. They don't get my angle. Maybe it's just the generational gap, how they interpreted life through the lens of their eyes. Either way though, it's not me, and it gets tiring when you're the only one near you who sees life's gateways to greatness and personal freedom. And honestly, pretending to care way more about their interests are causing mine to suffer.

Of course, I stand alone with no family, no friends, no backup, just me and the world. But strangely, that's not what bothers me. It's more of the what\where now? 

TL;DR:

The first was on march 31st, nearly a year ago and the write-ups are erased after a year. For the smell of weed.
The second was some time a few months later in June.for the smell of weed and having people in my room during that time.
The other two were just noise wrote-ups.
This last write-up was for ""consuming 5 xanax and a large amount of alcohol."" I in fact did not consume alcohol, but had the xanax because I was acting out in a depressed state. I am a type 1 diabeticy blood sugar reached 1050 and I was vomiting all over my on-campus apartment.
The only problem is the school has every reason to believe day I drank, as I appearantly told the hospital that I did so the night I was brought in.
This is a major offense at ucsc, and considering my previous write-ups I am at great risk of being removed from the school.
I have a meeting with the person who will decide whether I can stay on campus or not. My mother can be on the call with me, and is willing to say whatever it takes.

I can think of only one thing that makes me happy, and that's wasting time on the internet. Usually on forums and Youtube.
I know that's extraordinarily pathetic, but I can't think of anything else.
It's the one thing I know for certain I enjoy and life seems to be dedicated to preventing me from doing that.

I don't have any valuable talents either.

The deadline for submission is very soon.
I've been debating with myself for weeks on whether or not to remind them.
My counselor might call and remind them, they might not have forgotten at all, this is all about how I play my cards.
If I ""forget"" about it, I get another year.
I would take the blame for it.
This is my 5th year in high school, all my friends are already gone.
I would probably also get drivers ed, a valuable class that I would not get to take if I graduate this year.
If all goes well I would only have to take two classes next year and leave early, giving me the maximum free time I love so much.
But I'm not sure how well I can enjoy it knowing that it will be my last.

39,"I'm 23f with a steady seasonal job and unemployment benefits in the winter months, living in Spain with my widowed paternal grandmother while place hunting. This is a decision I made to step away from my mum's pestering ways. I have been dating my fiancé (25) for 1yr and we've been planning a super low budget trip now that we can, before the season starts in March and we go back to only seeing each other for a nap because our work schedules are so opposite we're almost never free at the same time. 

My grandmother is very much a normal person who loves him dearly, he sleeps over and eats or dines with us at least once a week and she's happy for us, so she isn't an issue. 

The issues is with my mum. Just for starters, she has a very irrational, unfounded hate of my fiancé, to the point that she didn't send me season greetings this year because the two of us were invited to Christmas brunch with friends and she didn't wish to extend her greetings to him. She's verbally assaulted him through Facebook and instant messaging several times for this very reason and we're seeing a counsellor about dealing with her outbursts because at times it can be taxing on me and that's giving him a lot of anxiety. But that's just half the problem. 

My dad, while very kind and caring when he's clean, has a terrible drug habit that makes him unpredictable. He has been unemployed for most of my life and has never wanted to finish a rehab program (he's been to 19 different kinds of therapy centres and has a teenage boy to look after, mind you). This makes him very suspicious because everything we spend elsewhere isn't going towards funding his drug addiction, to the point where I have to hide any cash, valuables and unused clothing items whenever he turns up for a visit -which is often because it's a five minute walk- to prevent him from having the items refunded or stealing the money, and my mum is naturally stingy but also very resentful of me for taking up a job and ""selfishly"" spending my earnings on tuition (pursuing a career in social work, especially with children from impoverished and dangerous neighbourhoods), living expenses and such (food, clothing, transportation, phone bills, the very cell phone I'm using to browse reddit) instead of giving her all of my truly meager income (280€/month) or taking care of my brother's financial needs (tuition, school trips, clothing, presents, tutoring).

I already told my dad about it when he caught me browsing Expedia last month and he seemed fine with it, a tad nosey for my liking (ie, where are you getting the money from, I didn't know you'd saved up that much, why'd you want to go on a trip to a cold country) but otherwise happy for me, although any moment he may have a mood swing and tell my mum that because I have enough money for a trip, she should borrow from me to buy him a dose -has done it before and I've never given her any money for that but she may have lied to me more than once about borrowing it for food-. I know my mum's going to turn green with envy and guilt trip me. Last week my paternal uncle went on a trip with his wife to watch a football match in Madrid and she put up quite the scene because, according to her, they should've taken my teenage brother along. My brother, who doesn't like going out and whines and moans whenever I drive him out of town for lunch -for instance, on his last birthday, I took him to a beautiful UNESCO World Heritage Site 20min away and he was so upset that I'd taken him out that far from home, he gave me the cold shoulder the whole time and I ended up ordering for him because he'd just give the poor waiter the furry eyeball like the guy had wronged him somehow, and last week, when we had heavy snow for the first time in about a decade, he refused to come up to the mountains with me-. Mum's reasoning is that, because we're all family and my uncle is the kid's godfather, he should be spending more on him. By taking him on a trip with his wife and two other couples all well into their 30s. 

I'm dreading telling her, but I obviously have to. I'm legally an adult and I'm  going either way, but I'd like it if she didn't make me feel terrible about indulging for once after working every weekend, festivity, emergency and co-worker holiday time on the night shift for 9 months out of 12, which makes it virtually impossible for me to go clubbing with my friends and consistently showing up to class. I deserve a social life, good grief.

Like I have a complicated and difficult family and my brother has problems and I've told them so much about him and one of their parents won't even let them come over anymore and I've told them stuff about my dads past that I shouldn't even know about let alone them and I don't know what to do because it's too late to take it back now and I feel like I'm such a mess and now people know so much that they shouldn't know and I just feel like such a big disrespect to my dad and brother. I've stopped talking about it and I'm not going to again but I've already screwed up. I don't know what to do ,25Jan2017,1
42,"So I met a guy last summer while studying and we quickly became friends. I pretty quickly realized I was into him, he teased me a lot and quite a few people thought we were a thing. At one point of time he asked me to watch a movie with him at his place, but I thought he was just making fun of me and not being serious so I didn't really respond to him. I may or not have accidentally rejected him in that moment because... well, I was stupid. 

We were still friends for a couple more weeks until we had to go our separate ways for the rest of the summer, only keeping in touch a little bit. When we got back we decided to meet up an catch up on what had happened since. However, for reasons I still can't go back and place, it didn't quite end up happening for almost two months. We had half of our classes together and saw each other a lot, but what happened was he apparently started to find me annoying and we didn't meet up. I asked him to come and hang out in my dorm once and he declined. 

In late October I attempted to get him to tell me whether he wanted to hang out or not. He quickly brushed me off and said no. Later, I got a text message from him spelling out exactly what behaviors of mine were annoying him. I messaged him an apology, he didn't respond. Next time I saw him he was being extra smiley and nice to me, and he continuously put in effort to reach out to me in classes. 

A couple weeks later we ran into each other outside of classes and he apologized for that message, and more or less said that he didn't want to hang out with me in my dorm or anything like that, but he didn't want to waste our friendship. From then on our ""friendship"" was based off of his attempts to talk to me in class, study with me, or occasionally ask me a stupid question about classes. Towards finals we became closer again because of all the studying we did together. 

Over winter break I was busy looking after my family due to some illnesses and other things. I snapchatted him once to say Merry Christmas, then he responded but I said nothing back again. Then after New Year he started snapchatting me rather consistently and since then we've maintained a streak. He's never been good at responding to snapchats when we first met, so this behavior is very weird of him.

I don't know how to feel about his behavior and the fact that we are closer now. While I guess it's nice to have a friend in classes that I also snapchat in my free time, it feels a little weird, especially given the feelings for him that I haven't quite yet squashed. It just feels like it's been a huge mess, a push-and-pull type thing that I still don't know the answer to.

Also, it's probably pertinent that he's a senior and obviously will be graduating in May and moving away from our university. It's a weird time.",25Jan2017,1

Let me get to my question, I'm thinking about joining the military just because I wouldn't live with my mother anymore not going anywhere working these 9-5 jobs hoping I'll eventually save up enough money to reach my goals.
The only problem is sometimes my hallucinations can be pretty obvious,and there was a point in time where someone at my old job asked me do something very basic.I couldn't for the life of my interpret what they were saying at the same time I was trying to say something but it was like the words just weren't there. Mind you there is no documentation anywhere saying I have schizophrenia,and nobody knows this however I feel like if I where every in the situation with a gun in my hand there's a possibility I'd shoot the wrong person or just out of paranoia.



I really don't know what to do,I obviously want better for myself. I don't want to continue to live off my mother.I could take the 9-5 job that have coming up,and try again to save up enough money this year to pay off what I owe,and than go to a University vs joining the military which would probably allow me to finally travel.





So if I can't join the military how can I reach my goals(travel,college). I can't imagine,I can do this with a 9-5 job making only 8-9$ dollars.All I have is cooking experience and some customer service experience.

This semester (finishing this week) I have two courses, English and Music, and I am done at 11:00am. I spend some days working after this, but if I have a long shift, I'll skip school entirely. Next semester, I only have class: Religion, and I'll be done at 9:30.

I have a high average (around 90%) and have already been accepted into one of the universities I applied to.

At one point in my freshman year I asked her out she denied and said she didn't want to date me cause she said that means she'd have a chance of losing me. I understood and felt with it the best I could from there really odd things turned into arguments for us like calling one another playful names while gaming (which was usually the norm) and being the weird person I am I always felt uneasy when she was gaming without me since we usually always played together daily and at one point started dating a guy over Xbox who lived across the country and acted beyond unusual playing games she hated and such for some reason these things combined led to a friendship break up causing our friends to deal with it and she began dating my best friend on my birthday. We never spoke again and it's now our senior year I see her every day in my classes and it's really weird any help is appreciated I want to at the very least have closure but I'm not sure she if she does on this.

68,"I go to a top 10 law school and have been doing interviews with some big law firms in major US cities like New York and DC.

These interviews are all personality tests and don't really focus on credentials at all.  If you have good credentials, you already get invited to interview.

I haven't been doing well in a lot of these interviews, and I would say close to 80% of the attorneys I met with are giving a very ""bro"" vibe.  I've talked to a lot of people at my school and it seems that the people who get hired by these firms are either people with really good grades, really attractive women, and/or people who love to talk about sports and alcohol.

I went to a huge football school for undergrad, and nearly every single interviewer wants to talk about football.  And not just for five minutes - generally close to 20 if I can keep the conversation going.  There was one point where I spent an entire week memorizing ESPN and Wikipedia to be able to talk about sports.  It kind of worked, but then a week passed and I knew nothing again.

It's just so hard for me to like sports because my family didn't care about them at all when I was growing up.  I really don't care if a team wins or loses.  I don't know them.  It's hard for me to pay attention to so many games for so many hours.

I'd rather be doing something else with my leisure time.  Like watching action movie like Star Wars or something like that.  But talking about Star Wars with these attorneys is not ""cool"" and instead looked at as ""nerdy.""

71,"... And she has no idea what happened. 

I had known for years that I had a few half-siblings. Every couple of years I would check social media to see if I could find them. I was always worried that they would go through what I did or worse. After a few years of searching, I mostly gave up and hoped for the best. I told myself that if ever one of them contacted me I wouldn't hesitate to talk to them, help them out of any horrible situation they might be in, give them a place to stay or to get away for a while - anything that could help. 

A while ago I received a message from her on facebook. She didn't even know I existed until recently, which wasn't too much of a surprise. But what I wasn't expecting was that they haven't faced the same abuse that I had. From what I've been told they love their father and are very close with their parents. The photos I've seen seem to support this, and the sister that contacted me has told me a few times that she would love to re-introduce me to the family. 

... What the hell do I do?

I would love to get to know my siblings, but I can't tell them about what happened. Even moreso, I have no idea how to explain that I don't want anything to do with their father. I don't doubt that he has been a good parent, and I'm so relieved that that's the case... But I can't forget what happened to me and the impact that it's had on their life. I don't want to ruin the image they have of their parent, but I also don't want to have to pretend to play happy families. 

I've been so stressed ever since I was contacted. I finally got to the point in my life where what happened to me wasn't having an impact on my daily life anymore, but now it's all I think about. And even worse, I just feel so guilty. She sounds like a lovely girl, I'd love to get to know her, she has no way to understand that I'm not trying to ignore her. I wish I could just be honest but I know nothing good could ever come of that, even if she were to believe me. I've even accepted a friend request on facebook from my biological father because that was somehow easier than explaining to his daughter why I was ignoring him. Now I'm too scared to go on facebook, I'm ignoring friend's messages, I've deleted photos I feel uncomfortable with him seeing and I just seem to be digging myself a deeper and deeper hole. I'm paranoid, stressed, and stuck in a horrible mental loop that I just can't escape. 

What the hell do I do?

Had to leave school. For the rest of August and halfway into September I miss school due to the nausea and panicky feeling. I couldn't even walk into the building without feeling nauseated. I don't know what the reason was, there was no one picking on me, no fights, nothing. I had a major panick attack with all the symptoms: racing heart, racing thoughts, I felt like I was going insane, etc .Skip a month later. Turns out I have an anxiety disorder.

I had a big fight with my sibling. I've had to deal with it my whole life and basically the said sibling is a piece of shit.

Said sibling blames everyone else for the shit he does. He can't understand that he's at fault too. Anyways. I couldn't do jack shit to him or the law to be involved.

I felt trapped, and I wanted my sibling to just    stop existing, for him to die. I couldn't deal with it any more. But, like I said. I can't do anything about it, which is what led to the depression and suicidal urges. Fast forward to  November-December. I've noticed that sometimes I forget scenarios and forget whether or not they even happened. I have trouble memorizing school work. My thoughts are unorganized and my sentences are too. It's sometimes hard to hold up conversations with people, even close friends and relatives. I also think all of this is from too much weed. I haven't told anybody about it though.

Testing out whether it was true that you shouldn't mix pain pills and alcohol on the 21st -DO NOT DO IT- my slap happy self got on a cougar website and; got some phenomenal pics, crafted an amazing (and true) profile, and just decided to wait and see if I got any bites.
These women do not know how bad off I am left after 2016, even through I told them about the 3 things I listed in the title of this post. I am not paying for this account and am doing phenomenally well. *I don't know whether some of these profiles are site generated, and I'm pretty sure that one of the cougars is a man. But the validation that I am desirable to at least one striking, real, cougar has really affected me.
The dire straights (none financial) of my daily physical ordeals had me contemplating some kind of sugar daddy like scenario - just to have someone who would tend to my medical needs - Finding a druggy woman to support- even contemplating whoring myself out for the aide. 
This was traumatic, because I am someone of especially high moral standards. I sunk that low.
When I joined the site, I specifically said that I had hopes that it would help me get better. I am a very good looking man, but live in a rural isolated area. 
I feel that I have this ""value"" of being able to whore myself out for aide, now. I am in physical therapy, seeing a chiropractor, doctors, etc. However, my morals, and some respite from the pain, have me closer back to my restrained self. 
But the whole series of calamities has reduced my morals to a much lower level, and I'm worried that they'll never be the same. I don't know that I can put humpty dumpty back together again. I have done nothing physically.

Unfortunately, my doctor noticed my thyroid was enlarged during my last physical and sent me for an ultrasound and blood work. I went to my local hospital on Monday to get this work done. First stop was the ultrasound which went smoothly, but made me nervous because of how long it took. I left the radiology lab and made my way to the phlebotomy unit, which was just a minute walk away.

I cannot even bring myself to walk inside of the office, much less sit down and let then take a blood sample.

I impulsively emailed them my appreciation for their talent and ignorantly inquired as to the steep asking prices of 10-20 thousand US dollars a piece. They wrote me back, intrigued/irritated by my ignorance and I'm sure adoration, answered all of my questions, and gave me their personal email. Long story shortened, this famous person and nobody me became very close friends. We talked every day on the phone, emailed weekly, and were planning my internship for them. They told me everything about their life, and I about mine. We sent packages to each other and texted regularly. We talked for hours daily about everything for months. This person's biggest secret was that their father molested them when they were growing up. They were in their 40s at the time they told me. They told me this and many other stories of their secret troublesome life,  and we became very close.

I had a conversation with them, to try to get them to see they were in danger. They got very upset and eventually after a long argument told me not to contact them again... after a few attempts over the next few months with no response,  I decided to stop trying and hope they would get back to me. A couple months later they deliberately overdosed and died. This was a few years ago. I have spoken to their close friends about the funeral and things, but nothing more. Years pass. I learned a few days ago that a documentary about their life and suicide is being made. The family member in charge claims awe and ignorance as to why this person was in so much pain. I want to give them all of my emails and photos my friend sent me during our friendship. I also wonder if I tell them what their sibling confessed to me regarding their father, or let it go? I did send a Facebook msg telling them I knew their sibling and they may like some photos from their sibling's cell phone they sent me. I've heard nothing back. If they contact me, is it my place to say all the things their sibling told me? Or do I keep quiet?",25Jan2017,11
89,"I and another lady report into a person. The lady and I have people reporting into me. Our boss doesnt get involved with any of my work but is very involved with her side of things. She engages him in every small decision making for her areas.
They are usually having meetings all day long. And I have also noticed them disappear around the same time for lunch every day and come back minutes apart from different entrances. Almost everyday! 

Thats their personal business but how this is hurting me is I feel excluded from a lot of decision making and they portray to senior management that they are the ones running the entire team. They have each others back for everything. All the interesting work is also flowing in her direction and they over play the importance of what they are doing. I am also excluded from hiring decisions and  those 2 are usually running with that.

I have tried to ask my boss if I could do anything better to engage him in my areas, but he didnt say anything specific. He is not even aware of what my team and I are doing and has shown little interest in trying to find out more. He doesnt interact with other people on both teams too much besides the lady.

She seems to be the person to suck up to senior management and not care about peers or people junior then her.

I feel stressed out working in this environment as no one really cares what I am doing and I dont think anyone will help me progress in the company.

I used to love what I was doing and am always keen to learn but this kind of political environment just puts me down. I want to feel happier and not care about this.",25Jan2017,1

I found some articles he looked at about being in an abusive relationship, he seems to think that I'm abusive but I don't see how. We get into little arguments from time to time but he thinks that he has to be careful with what he says to me or he'll upset me, and I don't want him to think that way but I can't talk to him about this because I can't tell him I looked through his phone.

96,"So there is this guy who I met at at the beginning of the year at the university. We have be come pretty close and we have been hanging out and talking a lot! No the question (does he like me?) rings in my head every time I think or see him. Now yes I do like him. So that's why I need an honest opinion no matter what. So let me start with this. 
 We first started off talking about our feelings for other people. He got drunk and told me all of his insecurities about himself and all of his girl problems. And that's where I made him the promise that I would stick with him and never be a bitch who leaves. So our friendship goes on and I start to see little things like he told me he never keeps streaks on snap even with his last girl friend it was at most 10 days. Now we have at 17 day steak and we have been each other's best friends for over 2 weeks.  I have noticed he has started to look at me more. We have stopped hanging out in groups. He is interested in meeting my friends. He hung out with me all day on my birthday and bought me lunch. We talk about what we want out of our futures and they pretty much match up. We love most of the same things. But what really made me confused is this specific situation: one day he and his friends came over for some drinks and my guy friend who he knows was over earlier and was acting really odd and like a dick. And when he left the guy I like and his friends were all like what was up with that?!? And I didn't know and his one friend said I bet he is jealous and I was confused buy that and my crush said: he probably thinks you and I have a thing so he is viewing me as competition. And his second friend began to agree. Me having a crush on him and hearing this was some what stunned so I tuned out to think/ I was buzzed. Until I tuned in again. And he and his friends were talking  about relationships and my crush said that he was looking for a unicorn and if you know me I consider myself to be a unicorn. And it's even in my bios on social media. So I was all round confused. He tried to hang out with me again the next day and then the next and we were meant to go out to lunch but there were complications but we still managed to see each other. I guess my question is could he like me? I know I really want him to but I also feel like maybe I am being to hopeful but there is just something about him that is new to me.

At that time I didnt really know what to say. We just hugged and we didnt say anything for a long time while I tried to figure out what to tell him. I couldn't come up with anything and eventually just said ""I love you."" He said it back amd we kind of just moved on from the subject. 

We are a family now. We are married and have a son and I sometimes just think back on how I could have been more supportive. I could have said something else. I'd like to think that he understood either way that knowing that didnt change anything and I still love him and still see him the same way or even better. 

I just want him to feel appreciated and loved and to know that I'm there and will always be for him. I dont want to make it worse by bringing up the memory though. It was hard for him to tell me in the first place.

.

Sorry for wall of text. My situation is a bit different and I'm just at a loss of what to do. Husband(28m) and I(27f) have been married four years, together seven.   Prior to getting married we both wanted children.  Around a year in to our marriage is when I started questioning if having kids was for me.  As the years went on I began to realize how much I loved our family just being the two of us and our pups.  

I just don't see the point in adding something to our marriage that will create so many issues in our marriage.  I have tried to explain my reasoning to my husband countless times in hopes to convince him why we would be better off without children.  Just to name a few: history of mental illness/ disease, risk of special needs, financial reasons and potential strain on our marriage. He doesn't consider all the factors that come along with a child and likes to tell me""we will make it work"".  

  Every time we have this discussion it always ends with him telling me he obviously will stay with me, but I know he is just holding out hope that I will change my mind.  I have explained that one of us WILL resent the other.  I have made made it clear that all I want is for him to be happy and if that means divorcing so he can find someone that wants children then so be it.  

I feel awful knowing he married me thinking we would one day have kids only to have me change my mind.  I I wish so badly I still wanted kids but it's just not going to happen.  I'm done having the same conversation every single week that goes nowhere.  

Looking for anyone who has gone through something similar and how you handled it. Hoping for some advice on where to go from here with pursuing divorce as the last resort.

101,"So, here is a little backstory:

Usually if someone asks for a sip of my drink, I'm brutally honest and just say ""sorry, I'm a massive germ freak"" and just laugh it off.

However, recently my friend asked for a sip of my drink and for SOME reason I said yeah. I ended up just throwing it away after because I just really don't like someone sharing my drink.

I feel like I can't drink anything around him because he may ask for a sip, lol. And since I already said he could have it the first time, I can't use my usual excuse.

103,"Hello all! 

I work at a company that has about 30 employees alltogether. My department has 4 but due to some recent growth we have added a 5th person. All five of us are female. The original four get along pretty well, there are general annoyances here and there but nothing out of the norm. 

I am being primed to take over when our manager retires this summer, so she asked I oversee the new girl's training after my manager sat with her a few days and showed her the basics. I had absolutely no problem with this and looked forward to not only trianing her, but getting experience in training for when my manager leaves. 

So we find ourselves at last Wednesday. It was the new girl's 3rd day on the job and our corporate off still hadn't sent us her email or cridentals to login to the internal system where we do all of our work. I had no choice but to put new girl at my desk and oversee what she was doing. The way our internal system works is kind of bonkers. There's probably 5 ways to do something and you'll get the same end result. Most of us like to take the least complicated ways but our manager seems to think taking the longer path yields a better result? Not true...but she's almost 70 and stuck in her ways so we dont argue. 

I try showing new girl a different, easier, way of releasing a document in our system. Something she'll do multiple times a day. She immediately pushes back. Which, I can see as she only knows the one way. So I explain like I did above that there are tons of ways to get to something and this is actually more efficient. Even a few coworkers jump in and agree. She decides to take the complicated way and tells me she doesn't trust what I'm saying. Ohhhhkay? 
There were a few more incidents such as that throughout the day. She pushed back when I tried to help her find a client account number, ""well it's right here on top of the page!"". She has even pushed back a few times when told her lunch is exactly 11:30-12:30. ""Well I go for exactly an hour so if I can't leave at 11:30...I get a few extra minutes."" That has consistently come up daily since she started. The break time is rigid as we have to have the phones covered. You coming back late cuts into someone's lunch time after you. She doesn't care. 

The real kicker came Thursday. Still no credentials or email. She's at my desk again. It gets to be 11:30 so I tell her to go to lunch. My lunch is at 12:30 (right after her) so I tell her...""When I'm at lunch do this filing and we can work on the few computer related things when I get back."" 12:30 arrives, I get up, lock my computer and leave the building. 

20 minutes later I get a text from another coworker. ""she's on your computer...did you give her the password?"" No! I hadn't! I rush back to find that she is, indeed, on my computer has been doing various things and even emailed a few of my customers. Day 4 on the job!!! Who does that!?! I was furious. I went to my manager immediately and told her. Company policy is already that nobody should share computers...let alone when you're not standing behind them! 

Since then her behavior and how she treats people has only gotten more aggressive. The owner of our branch now knows but has not taken action. 

I'm hoping you guys have some advice for me! She obviously is not okay handling even kind pointers or reminders without coming off aggressive. Sorry for the wall of text!",25Jan2017,10

108,"So I just signed up for my first class of tennis in uni ( I played tennis since I was a kid ) and I was matched with a random person to warm up with.

It turns out that random person is the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. It was very hard for me to focus on the ball instead of her.

After warm up is done, I wanted to compliment her and talk a bit, see how it goes from there and try to make things happen. But my friend got my attention and asked me to play, so I went into the tennis court again, I looked around but I didn't see the girl afterwards.

30 minutes later, we were doing matches, I go into one court and I see the girl in the court next to mine, but I didn't talk to her, I was too afraid I'd make my opponent wait and disturb her match.

I'm really hoping she comes to the tennis club next week, I know I'm just gonna compliment her on how well she plays and improvise from there.

But what if it's awkward? What if she shows sign she isn't interested? What if she just plain says no? How do I take it and not fall into tears or be super awkward?

113,"Me and my roommate have been living together for approximately 6 months. Before we moved in together, we did have a brief conversation about guests staying over. I realized that her boyfriend may sometimes be over, but as he lives in the same town I thought that they'd be more likely to spend time at his place. As it happens, they spend no time there. Her boyfriend is over 10-14 days a month, and stays over 6-8 days a month most months. My boyfriend lives hours away so is very rarely over, maybe one weekend a month at maximum. 

Several things have been bothering me, and I don't know whether I am being unreasonable and need to get over it, or whether to raise these with her. 

* Whenever the boyfriend is over, he uses an obscene amount of water. He is in the shower for at least 30 minutes, and having sometimes 4 showers while he's over. They keep waking me when they come home late by running the shower and leaving the lights on. I mentioned this twice, and there was no change. It finally came to a head when I snapped and asked them to be quiet pretty rudely at 1.30am. This noise is normally at weekends, but I'm not okay with being woken up. Additionally, our last water bill was 4 times that of comparable houses. 


* As well as the shower noises, I can hear them having sex really loudly. I don't want to embarrass her, but I also don't want to listen to it. 

 
* They keep using my furniture without permission. This is really bugging me, they take my futon upstairs, as apparently her bed is uncomfortable, then have sex on it. Not okay with me. 

 
* My food has been used, only the odd slice of bread here and there, but it's the principle of it? They aren't asking my permission and taking my things. 


* A few times now, I've gone to my boyfriend's for the weekend, and come home to my furniture in the communal areas having been rearranged. I am not comfortable with this as I feel it would be common courtesy to make that decision together, it's where both of us live and it's my furniture. 


* The front door is consistently being left unlocked, this is worrying as I am so frequently away at weekends and I feel like my possessions are not safe, anyone could walk in. 


* Her boyfriend is very inconsiderate with noise. Whenever he is over, he's constantly walking around whistling, shouting down the stairs to her when I am trying to sleep, talking and whistling in the bathroom, and there's a constant spanking noise every half hour when he's over. It's infuriating. 

I just feel that overall, they are treating the place like 'their place' and pretending I don't live there. It's having a big impact as I constantly feel worried that I am going to be woken up, or that they are going to be having loud sex. I'm always worrying about the utility bills as the dishwasher is being run extra times, the heating is always being left on, and the shower is being run excessively. 


How can I bring this up? I don't even know where to start.

He decided to leave the site, but sent a message to me giving me his email address.


I decided to send him an email asking how he was and we started exchanging messages. The messages were only about once a month.


He mainly talked about his girl problems. I offered my advice, it was on one specific girl, which he seemed to be hung up on. It started to get kind of uncomfortable for me, as he started telling the girl what I told him. The girl clearly wasn't interested in him and was playing hot and cold, and he was clearly distraught over her. 



I tried telling him it wasn't worth it if she was causing him this much grief, but of course he was hooked on her and kept trying. I never met this person in person. I don't know much about him. But for some reason he is now upset that I no longer talk to him much anymore. 


Truth is, I got sick of giving him advice, only to have him ignore my advice and continue to complain to me about this girl. Now he sent me a message saying he misses our talks. The conversations started becoming very one sided on his part, and so I stopped replying.

132,"Hi, I'm new to this subreddit so excuse me if I do anything wrong or if this is not the place I should post this... if it's not, please point me in the right direction.      
      Recently things from my past have been coming back up and really bothering me. I think the catalyst to this was my mother breaking up with her narcissistic and abusive boyfriend. Her leaving him took a huge weight off my shoulders but since then we started to talk about the things he put us through...just to get things off our chests.      
    This brought up all sorts of crazy emotions I had suppressed for close to 15 years. There is hurt, confusion, frustration and anger. I find myself thinking about these things all the time now. The way he treated my mother and I has impacted the way I see people and has given me a lot of trust issues.    
      At the same time this event provoked emotions I had been suppressing about the death of my father (in 2007). The relationship I had with my father was...interesting. We got along and I know he loved me but he was a really bad alcoholic so that brought about some bad situations. All of the hurt he caused me usually comes out when I am drinking (viscous cycle right?) and that's the only time I open up about it. It seems all these emotions (both about my father and my mothers ex) come to a head when I drink and then in the morning when I think back to what I said, I realize how many issues I have and never worked through. 
      I'm wondering if I should get help to work through these things? I'm scared to say anything to anyone. I've always put on this tough persona and I feel like I'm weak or giving in if I admit I need therapy. I feel like I'm letting my mothers ex 'win' if I get help, like it's confirming he got to me and admitting he had an impact on me.     
      It's been a struggle to even consider talking to someone in my own head, let alone tell anyone else. I'm not even sure if my problems even qualify for therapy. I don't want to be laughed out of therapists office because my problems are really just trivial (that's how I've always considered my problems).

Here's a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=femUe6bds0U showing the green and red on at the same time. What am i suppose to do? Stop? Or go because its green because i really don't want to give a cop a probable cause for giving me a ticket. I did ask this somewhere else but the responses i was getting were absurd. Such as stop driving your gonna kill someone etc Like wtf. Idk if anyone works/takes classes near GSU atlanta campus but its the light on auburn avenue by t deck garage.

136,"[No Regrets]
So, as the tittle says - I am 99% straight. Of course everyone is going to tell me I'm not, but almost all my fantasies and sexual experiences revolve around women. I am currently and only have been (and only want to be) in relationships with women.

However, I have such a strong desire to blow another guy and have him cum in my mouth - especially a guy with a larger cock (I have a small one). I don't think about this all the time, but when I do I get super horny. I love watching porn of WOMEN blowing guys, guys cumming in women's mouths/faces.

I am in a casual relationship with a women and would love to make this happen. It wouldn't be cheating. I think about what it would feel like to have a guy cum in my mouth while sucking - and get super aroused. I would love to make this fantasy a reality.

There is just one problem. I am paranoid of getting an STD from some random stranger. I would love to find a guy who is ""clean"" - but have no idea how to do this with a random/casual hookup. Unlike a lot of people, I know STDs can be transmitted through oral. Blowing a guy with a condom wouldn't be worth it - I want to feel and taste the guy finish in my mouth. I've even tried to suck myself - but am no way able to do so.

I have a pretty high libido and am also turned on by a lot of other ""oral"" / taste type things with women. Love to taste / lick a women's vag &amp; ass - even if they are a bite ""dirty""/sweaty. Also, I like when a women pees in my mouth. No desire to do the latter with a guy - just wondering if it's somehow related. 

I have no regrets that I have this one non-straight desire &amp; no desire to suppress it. I am in no way worried about being turned ""gay"" - my only regret is that I can't figure out a way to safely make this happen. I'm a professional / conservative type - and nobody knows about my desire to do this.

Anyone have any advice how to safely make this happen?",25Jan2017,1
138,"So I work at a grocery store. It's my country's national day of celebration tomorrow, so they want to bring in a BBQ and cook lamb for the customers. I'm the only guy in the deli, and for some reason, BBQ's are traditionally seen as a male thing, so they expect me to do it. 

No problems, but I've never cooked in my life. Is there much to using a BBQ? I'd rather get this over and done with as little embarrassment as possible. 

I'm a pretty competent guy, but cooking is just never something I've dabbled in remotely. I'm embarrassed to admit. And everyone seems to assume I know how to use one.

139,"Warning: Long Post Below:

I just graduated college with a Bachelor's Degree and landed a job that most people would dream about. My new position is what I went to school for so I can't really complain (even though I'm not real interested in the department I was placed in) and it pays great. I had to move to a new city so that I was closer to work but unfortunately it is far from my college friends and even farther than family. 

Most of the people at work are much older than me so it is difficult to find things in common to chat about and the office has hundreds of employees so it is somewhat hard to meet people that don't sit near me. Everyone is super nice, but it is somewhat icolating when I can't really relate to anyone. At the moment work is really dull as they only give me small and easy projects to work sense I am just starting out. The problem is that I get the projects done rather quickly so I have to spend most of the 8.5 hours sitting in my cubical trying to keep myself busy.

After work is just as dull and unexciting. I drive home and normally end up playing a game, watching Netflix, or surfing the Web. I'm single and live alone so the only living being that I can talk to is my cat. During college I went out to eat or went to the college bars at least 4 days a week with my friends. On the weekend we would have Netflix parties. When I wasn't with friends, I was doing homework or  I went from being busy all of the time to doing absolutely noting and I am going insane. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the fact that I can finally get caught up with the TV shows and games like I've been wanting to, but damn it gets old fast.

So basically what I'm getting at is I'm board as hell. Any advice on what I can do to meet people my age and have at least A LITTLE excitement in my life? The area I live at is an middle/upper-class suburbia type place so there is limited entertainment. ",25Jan2017,1

148,"Hello, I've been having a little problem. Both me and my sibling both live at home with our parents (mid20s) and both deal with depression. We both got worthless degrees (bachelors) and couldn't get a job. So we moved home. Now we are getting valuable degrees and going to the same community college. 

I feel like I'm on the right path and have a little optimism that I would get a job. While we both have depression, my sibling tends to handle it quite differently. They tend to give up easily and change their mind on what they want to do. I'm really concerned about them now because it seems like they've fallen into a depression spell. Now they want to go get a masters in their original degree. I'm really worried about this because I feel like if they give up the degree that they are working on now, they will be put back even further in getting their life going. They tend to give up easily if someone criticizes them or if a job is too 'hard'. It is frustrating because I feel if they are not keeping to something they are never going to have a stable career. 

My parents are starting to get frustrated, and I don't know what to do. I want them to have a job, friends, and live their life. They seem to be stuck in this 'fantasy' idea. They are always talking about television shows and can't really just talk. They always have to argue with someone. Think of the comic book guy on simpsons. They can never do anything on their own really (like go to the movies) and I feel like I'm always their sidekick. Or a comfort to be there. Growing up, my friends would always become their friends and when I went to university (we went to separate ones) I felt like I finally had an identity because they didn't take my friends or dominate the conversation. 

I'm trying to make sure that I tell them that we should keep our friends separate. Has anyone else had this problem? How do you help someone become independent? I don't want to be holding their hand. ",25Jan2017,1
149,"There are tons of great subs and stories I have read...but I would like if you could speak to me about your experiences.  I trust the reddit community over MANY websites because you speak the truth.  This is our story.

We have a great kid, he is clever, funny, and his teachers tell us he is one of the more intelligent kids in his class.  When he gets one on one attention he can really plow through things.  He is in Grade 1 reading at a Grade 3+ level and doing Math problems better than most of the students.  Problem is that, he requires serious one on one focus to accomplish a task and the teachers have to separate him because he would distract others.

I read to him, and he reads to me, every night either Bernstein Bear, Curious George or what have you books; he constantly fidgets and requires re-focus every sentence.  His focus is starting to put him behind.  Reading some of your stories and regarding Temperaments and Shutting down...he doesn't have those traits he is very active almost like a bull in a china shop attitude.  Once he is focused he doesn't realize his ""bad behavior"" and next thing you know he is exposing himself to half of his class or peeing on other kids.  Taking things to the extreme with no consequences.

Video games...WOW...he is demonically focused; Ipad games...he jumps apps every two minutes to different games and then back again.  Any task to him, fun or not...is ""boring"".

We went to the doctor and got my little guy assessed.  At first we tryied the Omega and Theanine acids and non-medical strategies to get him focused.  They semi-worked but the constant reminders just would not get through to him and he/we couldn't build a routine because would just constantly distract our other kids and have to be re-focused.  Its not just the one physiologist, its other doctors, teachers, co-workers, strangers, family members noticing these traits.

Today, after multiple appointments, the physiologist suggested Concerta and both me and my wife think that this is what needs to happen.

My Questions:

1. Long term effects, not from some webpage, your experiences;  Does using a methylphenidate harm you long term physically?

2.  Feeling different socially, picked on or bugged; did it help making friends?

3.  Strategies that worked for you such as charts, reading every day, video games, a reward system.

4. Did it help you in life getting it under control or did it make it worse?

150,"Hello REDDIT! 
My wife and I have a mutual acquaintance who we met while living in Los Angeles. We recently found out this person whom we’ve known for about 3/4 years is going to be co-starring in a major film alongside some very respected and successful actors. My wife and I are absolutely thrilled to the moon for this person. 

It has been a dream of mine to be in the entertainment business whether as a musician or an actor since I was 15 (32 now.) After I got out of the military my wife and I moved to LA. We both loved the city, the beach, and I loved the opportunities out there. I enrolled in acting classes immediately and started to network. Eventually I was able to land an internship on a film starring Seinfeld alumni which was exciting and an incredible learning experience. The shoot lasted 3 months and when it was over I was getting contacted for paid production work, however the work was few and far between and what I really, really wanted to do was acting. Unfortunately I wasn’t getting anywhere. 

Time went on and we eventually got tired of living check to check and considered moving back to Arizona. Eventually we did relocate back to the desert but our hearts remained in SoCal. 

This is where I need some advice… We know this actor well, but I would say they’re more of an acquaintance than a friend at this point but we are very friendly. I want to ask for help or a “break” from this person to get into acting but am having trouble going about it and am terribly anxious about the whole thing. I know that this will take hard work, dedication, and everything I have to be successful at it, but I am more than ready and willing. Being a veteran of the military I am no stranger to hard work and long hours.  

I’m not asking to be famous or to be a movie star, I’m simply asking for an opportunity to prove myself; To show someone in the industry who recognizes talent what I can offer. That’s all. 
I hate cliches but I really don’t want to be that person thinking “what if” my whole life....

So Reddit- please, any helpful advice? 
Genuinely thankful for anyone that replies let alone reads this!",25Jan2017,2
155,"A little backstory. 

The person I'm talking about let's call him Jerry. We went to high school together and graduated together. We lost contact for about 2 years and then reconnected. He needed a job and I got him one at the company I work for. His first couple of months were fine. But he came to work high on pain pills and fucked up some product that we sent off to customers. We had to issue a recall and it cost us a pretty penny. He wasn't fired because no one knew he was high when it happened but I did. I never said anything because he was my friend. After that we became better friends because he said that by me telling  him to not come to work high again he quit popping pills. I believed him. So after a year or so we started hanging out all the time and was coming over to my house about 5-6 times a week. I'm also a stoner so we were smoking weed together a lot. At this point in time I was having problems with my brother that emotionally affected me to the point I was a borderline alcoholic. My buddy said he was worried about me got me to quit. 

All that took place during the summer of 2014 and jerry was going back to college the following semester. He was gone a couple days a week and then we found out he wasn't even going to school he lied to us and his parents about going to school for months. I never really got over that. 

6 months ago he met a girl that he hit it off with. He told about her and a few red flags came up for me. She had tried to commit suicide 3 times and was going to a therapist for help. She had also been committed to a ward for 72 hours. After the first couple of weeks she started telling him she loved him and saying that she would harm herself if he broke up with her. I told him not to get involved anymore and to end it. But he didn't listen and continued seeing her. She hates me because I smoke weed and would get pissed off when he would chill with me at my house. So he would only come over 1-2 every 2 weeks. 2 months ago I quit smoking weed because I noticed that I was the only one buying weed and he would just show up to smoke mine. So I quit and I noticed he doesn't text me, invite me to movies or dinner and hasn't come over for over a month. He has also asked me to go on drug deals for him even though I don't smoke. His excuse is that he has been arrested before and doesn't want to get caught with it. Which I think is bullshit, I have to risk my freedom because he is to scared to go get it himself. He always brags about people he knows that can ship it in the mail for him and stuff but he won't buy from them he wants me to do it. 

We barely speak at work because as he said my vibe has changed. I haven't changed, I feel like I've sobered up and have seen that he was only my friend to get free weed and a guy to buy and transport for him. 

I don't know what to do. If I end it with him then it will be awkward at work. But I feel I can't continue to pretend either. Please help me. ",25Jan2017,1

I don't normally post stuff like this online but I feeling so under-motivated and down at the moment I think advice from strangers/the reddit community will help me and my current day to day life. 

So please bear with me.

*Also please direct me to the correct sub if this I not the right place to ask.*

I live just outside of London and turned 23 last month. Ever since then I have been feeling really shitty and down, maybe not depressed, but sad about my life and I have little motivation at the moment.

I’m stuck in a job that I hate and I never wanted to go into.
6 months ago I was forced to choose from unemployment or a new role within my organisation that I had no desire to get into.
Oh and to top it all off I travel over two hours to get to work of a morning and get home at night.. So it’s up at 6am and home by 7:30pm. 

A little bit of backstory: 
I was employed as a Network Analysis Apprentice and after my apprenticeship they told me HR only had space for new apprentices within the organisation and so there was no place for me in the Networking Team. (Some Government scheme I think) So it was a choice between the door or to join the Software Testing Team.

At first Software Testing was alright and I revised hard and managed to qualify as a certified software tester.
But now after almost 8 months here I hate getting up in the morning. I feel like I’m stuck in a bubble at the moment at work, I rarely talk to people and look at the clock all day.

I enjoyed working with the network team and it’s something I want to do in the future. I have even been looking into doing more networking qualifications in my spare time to try and motivate myself to leave. I am not a very confident person and the thought of going through interviews again makes me feel sick.
I haven’t even talked to my girlfriend about it.


What should I do? How can I motivate myself? Any advice for me? 

Thanks

I need some help. I've moved to a new city in the last year and have been uprooted from my typical psychologist right as things were starting to click with her. I need a psychologist in a major way. I am not a danger to myself or anything - it's not that type of thing - but I've had depression and anxiety for the majority of my cognizance. I have been diagnosed with it by about 5 different doctors, and it has never been properly addressed or treated. I have been white knuckling it for as long as I can remember.

My situation now is that I live in a new place with no medical connections. I can't just ask my mom who her mom friends would recommend in town or ask my friends who they go to. I have health insurance, but I'm only really provided a list of names. The majority of these doctors can only make appointments with you if you get a referral from a primary care physician or some other medical entity. Most of these offices don't even answer their phones. About 9 months ago, I got in with a primary care physician at the best hospital in my city and one of the best hospitals in the world for the exclusive purpose to get him to hook me up with a psychologist.

When I visited the doctor, I used phrases like ""red alert"" and ""desperately need"" and ""white knuckling it"" and ""3-5 times a week"" and he told me that the medical community and the psychological community do not communicate or play together. There was ""nothing [he] could do"" other than refer me to his son's former sports psychologist who only takes cash. He was more concerned with telling me bizarre stories about how he grew up with Mike Pence than he was with addressing my obviously serious mental issues. Don't worry, though, he assured me he ""loves mental health, cares a ton about it"" there's just nothing he can do because somehow through 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of med school, one year of general practice, and 3 years of residency specialty he's never even met a psychologist. He knows none. He's never even heard of one in town that's worth recommending.

That was 9 months ago. I couldn't get in anywhere else cuz nobody would take me without a referral and my primary care won't give me one. I've been staring at the list of names on my healthcare website for months but I don't know who's good and I don't know how to get in a room with one of them. I need help.

At first I was about to say no, but the others besides my best friend was like I'd like to watch that and laughed. In my mind I said watch is fine, so I pulled down my pants and turned around and he did me doggy style, he didn't finish my best friend was a little bothered by this so they all said he should so it, he felt pretty nice too but everyone got a turn, no one came though.

After that it was more like a giant orgy, not like a porno, I didn't give any blowjobs and everything basically looked like some people dancing around in a circle. Well, they all just started feeling on me, some groped my breast, some rubbed my ass, some fingered my pussy, some rubbed over my body, someone even tried to finger my ass. This time it wasn't awkward, I was actually feeling really good. Then we heard a knock on the door and I hurried and put my clothes back on, which wasn't hard since I didn't completely take them off. But basically my friends mom said dinner was ready. Before we were done eating my mom came and I had to go.

&gt; So what I really want is a way to convince my mom to let me stay the night. I'm thinking of using one of my female friends to make her think I'm staying the night over but she may want to talk to their mother. But then it's like will she try to pick me up in the morning or will she let me be taken home?

TL;DR I had an little fun with my friends but I couldn't stay the night with them so how would I convince my mom to let me stay the night w/o her being too questionable or suspicious about it?",25Jan2017,2
182,"So I'm gay, and one of my closest friends is straight. Over the years, people have speculated that he may be bi, gay, whatever; including myself. But nothing has ever happened to actually back this up. About a year ago, I had a big crush on him. I couldn't get him out of my head. I just loved that we were really comfortable together and I find him attractive. Thankfully, I got over it, because after awhile I could rationalize to myself, ""he's straight. It's not gonna happen. Get over it"". And I did!

Now, I've just accepted a job in Northern California, and I'm moving away. But since he and a lot of my other friends are still in SoCal, I plan on visiting often. Anyway, as part of my ""going away"", we went out to gay bars last weekend, to which he's accompanied me several times before with other friends. Halfway through the night, he's very drunk and literally grabs my arm, drags me to the other side of the club away from our group, and he kisses me. And we make out. A lot. Like this is a dream come true. Only now, all the fucking feelings come back, and I'm moving, and I have no idea where his head is at.

I text him the next day, to apologize if it was awkward, make sure we're good, let him know I'm there if he needs to talk, etc.
And he's just so casual about it. Like ""I've been wanting to do that for awhile, and I was drunk enough to do it. And it was fun""
So now I'm just here dying because I need to know if it was....""he was drunk and horny"", ""he's been wanting to make out with a guy and I was just there"", or ""he likes me"". And even if he does like me...what the fuck do i do. I'm moving, and would he be even ready to date? Is it going to happen again? If no, why not? Am I going to have to watch myself when I drink around him so I don't do anything?

I literally can't focus because we left our conversation in a really positive casual place, and  now I don't want to bring it up again, because I might rock the boat, and maybe get an answer I don't want if I confess my feelings - and ruin our friendship.",25Jan2017,24
183,"I have a friend/coworker (I helped him get the job) that is a good guy, but he's also an alpha douchebag. He'll bully anyone for a lot of things- calls our receptionist a ""f*** ot"" behind closed doors, will talk shit about random people living life happily in a way he doesn't see fit (will even go as far as to say shit like, ""this guy looks like a dumbass. Then next time I see him, I'm going to slap him""). Talks about all the people he's had jumped by his friends back in the day off his command.
 
Every time I do something to better myself, he'll shoot it down. I start studying a lot, he calls me a nerd. I work out, and he'll call my body terrible. He'll make fun of me for even the choice of foods I bring saying they're not even tasty. Stupid shit like that. No one has ever challenged this guy.
 
We both speak Spanish and our coworker doesn't, and he'll talk shit about him in Spanish to me in front of his face. Anyway...
 
We're both working this crappy job to get by while we're both applying to postgraduate schools that will give us careers around $150K+/year. I've gotten in and he hasn't. He hasn't had many interviews for these programs because ironically when I tell him about the things he needed to do back in college (internships, XYZ classes, etc.), he always said I was doing too much and that I needed to shut up.
 
Randomly he said something that irked me, and I was like, ""Alright bro. Good thing I'll be gone and you'll be in this hellhole again, so talk to the walls next year""...and he got really really really mad. He punched a wall, kicked a desk, and walked out. I immediately regret what I said, because I know he's not super competitive and this is like his 3rd year trying to get into this new career. Surprisingly he didn't hit me. Now he's ignoring me.

184,"It's my third year of college. I major in digital media design, and I am finally beginning to enter classes focusing in my major/concentration. I am so excited. Enter M. I knew M in high school, a year younger than me, I graduated a year before her. She is an extremely talented artist, amazing gesture/figure drawings/paintings, often better than me. She is friendly and energetic and genuinely nice to everyone. When she graduated a year after me she enrolled in my college and also into my major, too. And she knows EVERYONE. She is in 3 of my classes and finds at least 3 or 5 people to talk to by name, and also the professors know and love her, reference to her, etc. She isn't the selfish or fake kind of bubbly either, I know she's felt awkward etc in the past like I am. She drinks energy drinks now... Maybe that's what helps, I dunno. 

But seeing her every day and seeing her work makes me feel like less of an artist, and terrible as a socializer. I did spend time hanging out with her and all, she's great I love her. I push away my angry feelings because I know they are just my envy. I wish I could be more like her, able to talk to others more and make better work.

How do I talk more? I just never know what to say, and my voice is never as calm or smooth as others when they speak. I spend time heart-racing before it's my turn to speak, mentally processing what to say over and over and it never comes out as good. This is a life-long truth. I'm usually okay with it. I have friends, I can talk usually. But this is even worse, this is my field, people I should be IMPRESSING. And I am terrible at talking to them. Not to mention employers that look for social skills more advanced than mine...

tl;dr: Younger friend is better than me in my field, also has more social skills, I feel lesser as a friend/colleague/potential employee, feeling insecure about skills/my whole career",25Jan2017,1
190,"So, here's my dilemma. I'm currently a student at an expensive east coast University; I have a couple of scholarships that take my tuition down to a reasonable amount, but after a serious falling out with both of my parents, they're no longer willing to split my tuition cost with me, and because both our credit scores are really bad (they're in the 400s, I just broke 500), private loans are out of the question. So, this is my thinking: I want to go to a smaller, much less expensive community college in Arizona instead. I know it sounds a bit rash, but here's my reasoning: [1] I'm 23 years old and having been helping to pay to put myself through school these past couple of years (my parents and I split it 3 ways, hence why its taking so long) and I've lived in the same state my whole life. I originally was accepted to schools farther away, but it was cheaper to go in-state, so I stayed. This is an opportunity for me to have some independence and get to see a part of the country I never have before. [2] The school I could attend would have my degree I need (biology / environmental science) and would cost me roughly $700 / semester vs $3,000 / semester here. [3] I have a really toxic and unhealthy relationship with my parents, and this is a good opportunity for me to put some space between us. [4] A couple of months ago a 3 long year relationship ended, and that was really the only thing holding me back from traveling before. I plan on applying for a job in sales or banking, really any salary based job that doesn't require a degree and taking my classes at night. I'm also a server and a bartender so I figured I could get a local job and work weekends. I've tried looking for apartments online and about applying for real jobs but I'm struggling to find information. I want to have those details figured out before I move. The school is in Tsaile, Arizona, if anyone is familiar with the area and could offer any info? Any advice would be awesome, how to move somewhere far, live in your own far away, financial / school help, etc. Also, my major is wildlife conservation, so if anyone knows any wildlife refuges or shelters within a few hours drive, I would love a cool place to internship! :) Thanks!

I noticed that some PTO had been docked from my paycheck recently and when I investigated, found that the accountant had taken it out on the word of my coworker. Let me be clear - she is not my supervisor in any sense of the word. She gave the accountant the wrong amount of PTO and it was deducted without my knowledge or consent. I see this as a major violation of my rights as an employee and view it as on par with theft (I earn those hours along with my salary, so she basically took money out of my paycheck). Her role does not give her the right to alter anyone's paycheck. I work with this woman very closely and we have gotten along in the past. I don't want to burn and any bridges. However, she has been pushing the boundaries of her role for a while and this is a major step over the line. I want our direct supervisor to know - not only because she's been stepping on toes and it has gotten worse lately, but also because the accountant will only listen to him, and I'm certain that he'll agree that she should confirm changes to paychecks with the employee. How should I approach this? Should I talk with her and hope she listens? Should I go directly to our supervisor? Or should I talk to her and tell her that I also plan on discussing it with our supervisor?

I should also note that I am not good at confrontation. I tend to get worked up and overly emotional or end up not saying what I meant to say. However, I feel very strongly about this and feel that I need to stand up for myself. ",25Jan2017,3
196,"**Long read ahead, I had to ask for some help, TL;DR at the bottom for the bored ones.**

Hello guys, my sister is currently 30 y/o and, well, that's it. She just finished high school at 18, with a terrible score and got accepted to law school just because our mom had the privilege of getting her kids wherever she felt like. That was 2004, now it's 2017 and she's still on Law School.
___________________________________________
She didn't pass any subjects (a total of 41) until 2007, and at some points she just stopped caring. It was all tolerable though, until the erasmus of 2010/11. She went there, met a guy (a guy that just wanted to fuck, but she failed to see that) felt like shit because of ""post erasmus syndrome"" and finished law school. Or that's what she said at least. She wouldn't say anything about it, she wouldn't show the degree, she wouldn't talk about getting married and/or having kids, she said she didn't want any of these two. Fast forward 5 years later, it's 2016. The guy learns that she was lying all along, kicks her out, she returns home, says she was lying and expects him to get her back, which he did not do.
___________________________________________
That's the backstory I knew till lately. She got back trying to get her degree, but it's been 2 exams already (exams are for 1 month, you go for multiple subjects), and she failed, miserably. Passed 1 subject each exam period (there are 18 left, with that rate it's 6 more years), and these were the ones I helped her with.

But we never seize to hope. Or so I thought. And, i decided I should read her diaries just to know what's inside that head. We had a cat that came out of nowhere, and disappeared suddenly. Well, it was written she ""got rid of it"". My mother was missing 650$. Turns out she took them. She wants to go back to Europe, with or without a degree, at 30 without any qualifications. She wants money, infinite money to get what she wants, like 4000$ chanel bags. She hates our country (Greece) and the people in it, she hates law school and everything about it. She wants to have a home in Paris and in Crete, learn 16 languages, get a degree in Psychology, Nutritionist, Law, Translation, learn violin, piano, guitar and be rich without much effort. 
Don't these goals seem, well, a bit too hard to accomplish, when you are 30 without qualifications?
In addition, she is planning to leave on spring with or without a paper.
I know she won't get her degree, she was struggling for 2 months to learn 4 written pages. 4. for 2 months.
___________________________________________
Now, for her character:

She won't get any advice/opinion from her family

She will get extremely angry for no reason, or because you talk about her errors and/or mistakes, to the point of breaking stuff

She lies excessively for the littlest of stuff, just to get the blame out of her way. But also for major things, like a bachelor's degree.

She manipulates people, she thinks less of them, calling everyone crazy or stupid. Everyone. 

She keeps saying how smart she is, or how much she remembers stuff, or how powerful her mind is. But she's still 12 years on law school.

She doesn't seem to have any guilt or show any remorse for her lies. 

She keeps forgetting stuff, does not get what we are talking about, while it's perfectly clear, gets easily distracted for no apparent reason

Seems like she only really cares about cooking, she remembers stuff about cooking perfectly well, she often uses recipes to make a simily about something to better understand it

She hates our mother, for no apparent reason. She got to lawschool for free, she has a home waiting for her since she was 15(a totally new home, just for her).

She is parasitic. Lives off our mother or her ex bf previously. No money. no nothing. Relies on other people's money

She currently sells all her stuff to gather some money (like, 5$ a piece) and I have caught her selling stuff I own, stealing them.


I don't know what to do, I'm genuinely scared that she's a sociopath/psychopath and I really don't know what's going on. Help would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR**
*My sister is 12 years on law school, has not achieved anything in her life, yet she has unrealistic goals and acts strange. May have mental issues, but i can't tell, I need your help with the situation, read above about her character.*

197,"Okay so I saw a post on Facebook awhile ago about some famous guy he is white, wears glasses and has some kind of syndrome that prevents him from walking. He crawls around in his videos and does weird noises and uses a lot of tongue motion.",25Jan2017,0
198,"I am a 20 year old male going to college for engineering in America. I cannot attend for 1 year due to financial reasons I will explain below. I now need a job to get money for college and to support myself. Unfortunately I do not have any prior experience or skills, and have no means to get a job. I will try to explain my situation in great detail to get the best advice possible.



I graduated high school with ok grades but with AP classes. In college, I am now taking 2nd and 3rd year classes and have been attending for 1 1/2 years. The AP classes put me in high level classes, but created problem with getting enough credits. The AP classes allowed me to obtain college credit while in high school. Unfortunately, I had several scholarships that were removed because I could not register in enough classes. This was due to the AP classes that made me ineligible to take classes that would give me credits to maintain scholarships. Also, I could not take enough higher level classes because they required pre-requisites that I did not have. I have not failed any classes. Without scholarships, my only option is to obtain in state tuition. During this time I cannot take any classes from any university, I cannot get benefits (jobs, education, etc) from any other state. I must maintain residence in this state for one full year. My parents are helping me through college, but they are not rich. I have calculated my costs, and I will be easily able to afford college on in state tuition, but I need to get a job to obtain fund for college and maintain my residence. Right now I need a job.


For the job I have applied a few places, but I feel I am not applying to the right job or making a good resume. I have no job experience and no skills. I tried to get jobs in high school, but got denied every time(6). I have applied for at least 9 jobs in town, but I have been denied, usually for lack of experience. I have applied for internships (even unpaid internships), but all internships require me to be one year from graduation, so this is not an option. A few jobs require me to be 21, but I cannot wait until then. I have applied for mostly night shift jobs and physical labor jobs. I feel my greatest weakness is my resume. I have mostly blank space and filler in the resume. I do not want to lie on my resume, but I do not have any history to put on my resume. I have basic skills(math, Microsoft word, excel). I do not need a high paying job, but I need to maintain expenses, and minimum wage (even part time) will do. I do not need an easy job. I have my family to help with expenses, but I need to support myself somewhat. 


Frankly, I am very frustrated at myself. My life is in deadlock and I cannot move it. I have not had the best advice in the world given to me previously. I know my goals and my plans, but I do not know how to achieve specifically getting a job. I want to progress my life, but I cannot without getting a job or a college degree. Right now I need to focus on getting a job. Any job. I am willing and able to work, but unable to find a job. I do not believe that I have any shortfalls. I am American with no accent. I have no physical or mental disability. I do not believe myself to be an unapproachable or unpleasant person. I am not a perfect person, but I cannot keep thinking that there is something wrong with me and that is why I cannot obtain a job. 


To sum it up I really need advice on two subjects. 1) I need help to fill a resume while having no real experience or skill. 2) I need help on where to apply for a job, and which types of jobs to apply for. I really do not know who else to ask. No one in my life has been able to give the right help or advice. My only other option is to quit college. I believe that I could start a career without college, but I could only advance so far in any given career without a degree in this modern world. I am also the one in my family with the best chance of getting a college degree. I believe that I will be able to graduate college given that chance and I have the ambition. Right now though I need a job to progress my goals. Thank you for reading and any advice is welcome. If you need any more information, feel free to ask.

So basically, there is this guy that I've always been acquaintances with but, never really talked to. He's complemented me a few times and said I did well on a project but, other than that we never really talked before. 

Well a few days ago I went to a dance which was basically like a mingling type of dance with different high school's. He goes to my high school and I danced with him and he acted very nice and sincere towards me which, was different as he never really talks to me. He was saying that I would do great on my presentation the next day and that I shouldn't be nervous and he also started asking me about prom and if I was excited about it. It might just be friendly but, it just seemed a little odd to bring up those topics with somebody I never really talked to and was just acquaintances with.

Well then two days pass by and it's the day that I have to give my presentation. I walk into the class and he walks by me and kind of gives me like an awkward smile. The whole time people are doing their presentations he is looking at me, sometimes holding eye contact and sometimes looking away. He'd smile at me whenever something funny happened in the presentations and he would like raise his eyebrows at me as well. Once class was almost over I walk over to my friends and he brushed me on the shoulder and said I did a really good job on my presentation. The bell rings and I walk out the room and again, for a second time, he taps me again and before I leave to my class he says I did a good job again.

I was about to rip his head off and kick him out of my house but I didn't want to escalate the situation so I decided to just sit on my phone the rest of the night. Haven't talked to him since. And frankly, I don't think I will unless he apologizes for that. Now maybe he had a bad day at work and I get that. But to me personally that's unacceptable, am I in the right wanting an apology? I've tried just leaving it be, but that was the most childish and disrespectful thing he's done. I could go on but that pretty much covers it. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I really appreciate it.",25Jan2017,1
214,"There was another living situation on here so I figured this would be a safe place to go. Long story short my ex Fiancé and I broke up and now we are back together call him B. He broke up with me, I was blindside and wanted no part of it. We were broken up officially for about 6 months and in that time I had to find an alternative living situation so a friend and I found an apartment. She makes more than me and can afford to live on her own so I was grateful for that…When we moved in is when B and I started hanging out again. It’s been so hard, it’s like one GIANT step back from where we were to where I want to be again. The whole time we were broken up he wouldn’t stay at home and all I wanted to show him was how we can be better, and he wouldn’t.  I know part of the reason why I hate it. I am an introvert and some days I just don't want to talk to anyone. Have you ever parked outside and hated your living situations so much sitting in the driveway is better? B and I signed a lease together for March 1 and I still haven’t talked to my roommate about it. I still intend to pay rent until it’s done. But I want to move all my stuff out in March.  She made roommates more about the living “roomie connection” and I just was just going through a lot where I wasn’t really emotionally available for that. She kept saying ""your stuff is mine, ect"". She kind of treated it as we were a couple that was going to be together for a long time, and not like a yearlong wait the lease out thing. For example when we first moved in she said to her sister “we have two crockpots you can have one…”. There is also only “one” TV (mine) (she had one but it broke and she hasn’t fixed it or replaced it). I have one in my room with just Netflix. Last night all I wanted to do was come home and watch hockey but she was up watching TV. 

I haven’t felt like I have been home for a year. All I want to do is go home to B. People aren't lying when they say Home is where the heart is. 

Edit: To make this short I left a lot out re-reading it. But basically TLDR: I am just uncomfortable there... and want to be home and move in with B when we get our place. But I feel like an asshole for moving my stuff out. ",25Jan2017,1

225,"I have a problem where the jobs I've held have seemed to have a lifecycle of about 4-5 years. I am wondering if anyone else has tips for stopping the cycle.

Basically for the first 1-2 years I do my job well, am recognized by my peers as a hard worker, I enjoy taking on new responsibilities and am very ambitious. Then for the next year I start getting lazy at my job and just do what is expected of me. Then in the final years I start to really slack off, spend lots of time on the web, and call in sick lots just to take the day off; it's at this point where I either quit and move to another job or I may get fired. It's those end years that I am sliding into right now, and a new job isn't too easy to find at the moment. 

My problem is at this point in the cycle I just can't seem to make myself take my job seriously anymore. I start to resent my coworkers, and minor inconveniences are turning into major gripes, and I spend a lot of my time trying to get out of having to work. I know in my head I shouldn't be behaving like this but I just can't seem to motivate myself at all. 

Switching positions inside the company or changing or expanding my responsibilities doesn't seem to have an effect. In the past I've even gone so far as to use alcohol or weed while working to artificially boost my motivation and make the workday more tolerable, but that is not really a solution.

Does anyone else have this problem? Is this normal? Is this one of those problems everyone has?",25Jan2017,1

Lied to him or brainwashed him into believing his father sexually abused him as a child. He said he believed ber because he was told how awful his father was and his mother told him since he was toddler aged that hhe had constipation iasues because his father was molesting him along with implanting other similar things in his head.The parents are now divorced and he has never remained in contact with him. His mother caused huge rifts between him and 2 sisters yet claims she wants her family together. She has made her son completely dependant on her, enabling a drug addiction, doing things to cause huge problems then coming to the rescue if that makes sense. She falsely claimed him as a dependent and filed an old w2 and submitted a tax return that resulted him and his wife owing the IRS. She faked cancer to the point of shaving her head. He always idolized his mother believing she was a victim and defended her actions to death. This is my brother in law. He's married to my sister. The mother has always caused issues in their lives lying and doing odd things to turn him against my sister. The mother has minimal contact with her other 2 children or anyone in the family.

We didn't talk much but would text and facetime a bit in older grades. That faded quickly and we never really talked again. 5 years later, in the summer, we were introduced again. On orientation day in the summer he came over to my house with my friend and then followed us to where we were working that day. It was clear he wanted to be around me. He told my friend how he thought I was attractive and asked if she could see us dating. I never really got much attention from guys so I was pretty intrigued. He quickly started complementing me through snapchat ALL the time. I never saw a problem with it. We always talked about hanging out but it never really happened, I really liked him though. We went places with other people a few times before it ended. I was always trying to make time for him and it seemed as if he just did not care. I knew his reputation as a player but that did not take away my feelings for him. Every day in the hall he would pass me and laugh, I really don't even know why it really started to get on my nerves. About two months later, he was being obnoxious so I snapped him ""wtf"". We had a brief convo and he did not really make sense but we snapped that night. The next day, my practice was cancelled for rain and he asked me to come over I immediately said no but he somewhat talked me into it. It wasn't very hard because I still liked him and would really do whatever to spend time with him. I wanted to think we were just hanging out but I knew what was really happening. I drove over to his house in a panic talking to my friend in a different state telling me to NOT go in. I knew I was about to lose my virginity. I went in, he was excited to see me. He took me to the bathroom and we went in the shower. We had sex, we never kissed. I lost my virginity before kissing someone.  His parents came home and his dad came upstairs screaming, awkward but I was surprisingly calm. I left and went to a parking lot and he called me and we talked for a bit. We kept talking and next time was at my house, then his car several times. Dave and I stopped talking for a bit. I started talking to another boy Brendan, he was my first kiss. We went on a few dates and he was about to ask me out, we hooked up, and I quickly ended it because that is not what I wanted. A few days later I got with Dave again. Some of the stories I could tell are super messed up. Including him using his moms dildo on me. I have such strong feelings for him but I know he will never feel the same way. He is also trying to get with other girls, which hurts. I do know though, I am the only girl he has been with in the last five months, we have probably hooked up 15ish times. It is super weird because we never really talk or have conversations. I get super jealous of my friends who are friends with him because I want that. I have told him this but every time I bring something up like that he feels attacked or doesnt really say anything. It is really hard because I feel like he is the only person I will feel this way about. I go out of my way to make plans, to see him, whatever I can to get his attention. It sucks. I am always sad and I do not know what to do. I dropped him for about 3 weeks then he came back like an old habit and we have gotten together 3 times in the last week.

235,"My company gives us 5 EPTO (emergency paid time off days) to take when we want throughout the year. 

The policy states that documentation is only required if you miss Friday or Saturday and this has been the way things have worked for the last seven years since the place opened. 

In other words, if you wanted to take a day off Mon-Thursday for any reason, you were good no questions asked.

Well I take Monday off and come to work Tuesday and apply for EPTO to cover time missed, but my supervisor denies it. It then moves up to HR for them to approve the denial in which case I would get an infraction for attendance. HR is like what? 
Why are you requesting a denial? 

And my supervisor goes off on the HR guy reviewing my case, ""This is my department and  I will make the decisions. If you want to make the decisions then why am I the supervisor ?!?!?!""

So HR goes along with the denial stating ""EPTO is always subject to denial for any circumstance, sorry"" even though this has literally never happened. The other employees in my department are like why is the supervisor doing this to you? Like literally, we can't figure it out, as I'm a good worker who has never been in trouble, and most days I laugh and talk with the supervisor. For some reason though he just decided to throw me under the bus.

239,"Hi there! Quick rundown before I present the actual issue. I'm mentally ill, finishing up high school, and stressed as all get out. I've got a small group of friends, but I value what I've got. That's going to come into play here in a minute. I've got anxiety, depression, and trichotillomania. Trich is defined by the compulsive need to pull out your hair, and usually aggravated by anxiety. It wasn't all that big a deal until about a year ago. I wear hats now, because the left side of my head is increasingly sparse.  
  
On to the real issue. I'm a really impulsive person! Evidenced by the trich and all. Not good at thinking before I speak, which is probably kind of responsible for what's going down. About an hour ago, I got a text from a friend asking if we could talk. Which is, admittedly, usually not a good sign. She asked if I could tone down the insults when we're messing around, because I've been tossing them out more frequently than usual. That's a completely understandable request! I'd be happy to oblige.  
  
The only issue is that I have no idea what she's talking about.  
  
I don't make a habit of insulting my friends on a daily basis, and I definitely haven't been doing it more frequently as of late. While I was wallowing in pity and confusion, I sent my girlfriend a few screenshots to vent about it.  
  
As in turns out, she agreed. Apparently, I unconsciously insult my best friend, my girlfriend, and our third friend constantly. And I don't know, because none of them ever tell me I'm doing it. I always get caught in this cycle. Anxiety and self loathing because of the situation, pulling because of the anxiety, increased bald spots makes more anxiety, and the situation is never resolved.  
  
Obviously, something has to change. If I'm doing this near constantly, that's an issue, and I don't want to be that person that uses their mental illness as an excuse to be a manipulative jerk. ",25Jan2017,0

They broke up for the first time in September because she cheated on him a couple times during the summer. Since then, they have been off and on. Fred is always the one to break it off, and Jane always tries to win him back. Even when they're off, they still talk and hang out all the time. Fred started showing red flags during the summer. Jane told me he would go through her phone, call her names, and make her feel guilty when she wasn't in the mood to have sex. In November, he punched her arm hard enough to leave a pretty ugly bruise. When she brought it up to him later, he told her she deserved it and he would do it again. His verbal and emotional abuse continued. She struggles with depression and anxiety and he has repeatedly called her crazy, accused her of making it all up for attention, and has gaslighted her on multiple occasions. On New Year's Day, he threw her up against a wall and choked her. He later told her he was sorry but claimed that she made him act like that. Two days later, he smashed the front windshield of her car. He will claim to forgive her for the cheating, then bring it up when he's mad at her. I know cheating is wrong, and I never supported it, but it doesn't justify what Fred has done. Anyway, they are broken up right now, and Jane just texted me. She wants me to text Fred and beg him to give her another chance, and tell him I will make sure she doesn't cheat on him again. (She hasn't cheated since the first break-up, btw.)

246,"Hi all, looking for a sounding board to make a major life decision. 

I'm a 30 year old, career oriented, female. Married with a 3 year old son. Last year I had a job I loved at a company I loved, but this company is always running out of money. To prevent layoffs, I took a voluntary furlough from my high paying (intermittent) job with the promise of rehire when they got funding. That was 11 months ago. They still intend to hire me back but funding is taking a long time. 

In the meantime I have been freelancing and doing well financially. Nothing near to what I had before (when I was laid off or taking half pay) but enough to survive comfortably. But I'm unfulfilled. The work I'm doing is not the type of work I enjoy on a regular basis. 

It has been nice however, that I have been able to spend much more time with my son and improving my home (cleaning, home cooked meals, etc...). I do enjoy the quality time I spend with my son and the flexibility of my schedule. 

My father has been pushing me to remain freelancing while my son is young, at least before he starts school, because he thinks I'll regret losing this time when he's older. I feel so restless career wise though. I feel like I'm not building my resume and missing the prime time in my life. I also don't feel fulfilled. I feel like my life is in hold. 

So I reached out to a former colleague who has wanted me to come work for him for a year. The job is in another state, away from family and my support system. It also has some pretty hefty time and travel commitments. On one hand, if get to see the world. And I'd be the boss so I could take my son with me on a lot of these trips. It'd also be a big win for my resume as the company is rather well known. The only down side is the CEO doesn't think I'm a fit. The VP (my friend and department head) disagrees and feels like he can get the CEO to defer to him. Other contractors in the industry have told me they think it would be a good fit. My husbands job has also said that he can do his job from anywhere. So he has a lot of mobility. 

I just feel torn between what's best for me and what's best for my son:

Pro:
Dream career
Lots of job satisfaction (potentially)
Building towards an impressive resume
A lot more money and financial security
A better city (less crime, better schools)

Cons:
Much less time with my son
Taking son away from family (particularly my father who has him once a week)
Less time to spend on strengthening my home (cooking, extra circular activities for son) 
No support system
Maybe I'll fail, the CEO seems to think I will. And then we'll be stuck in another state. 

My parents always placed their wants over my needs growing up and my life long goal has always been to do better for my kids. I just don't know if this is too big a sacrifice to force on my son for my sake alone. 

I should also mention that there are 0 job prospects in my current city for my industry.

250,"I'm almost 20 now and in college; let's just say my views over the past few years on a lot of topics have changed drastically (as expected when achieving a higher education). My parents and I have been at odds for a long time now, they're Muslim, and I do not wish to be any longer. I've stopped performing religious activities for a long time now and my parents are not the most hardcore Muslims but they're pretty religious. They won't stop asking to go pray or go to the Mosque when I very clearly (although I haven't said it straight to them) do not wish to do either of these tasks. I tend to just say I will or give some excuse. I've tried having a rational discussion of religion in general with my mother on the topic and it always ends with her being in tears and her saying, ""If you love me, you'll do such and such."" I'm so tired of this and the added stress of school has got me tearing my hair out. The worst part is they're technically paying for my college (they both work there doing operational management and not professors or anything) so I get to go to college for free. I love my family but I think Islam has been nothing but oppressive for a lot of people (very controversial, I know, but it's just my opinion) so I don't want to just step out and never return to my home and I'm also scared to death of being entirely independent financially without having a stable job. I'd feel so bad just leaving for a while I guess, but I'd want to do it after I have already graduated and secured a job or something. I'm so frustrated yet I can understand that where they come from, **everyone** is Muslim so they cannot comprehend their own child splitting from the flock. I know I'm probably being ungrateful as hell but I have had a lot internal reflection and I just wish they would accept me as who I am, a good person who they raised who just happens to have a different opinion on what happens when we die. What should I do? Have any of you had a similar experience? Sorry for the rant.

TL;DR: I'm almost 20 and commuting from home to college. My parents are Muslim, I don't want to be. They can't seem to comprehend this fact and won't stop pursuing me. I'm scared of being 100% on my own financially and personally. What should I do? 

Thank you.",25Jan2017,2
251,"So I had sex with my roommate's girlfriend, or ex-girlfriend call it however you like it they were broken up for one day (I'm not proud of it). Now I thought this will blow over and I'll take this secret to the grave. Except it came out, she told him couple of days ago. We live in the university dorms and he is coming here in 2 days, I'll go to the manager and ask him to move me out to a different room to avoid the fight. The first day he found out he was fine with it, but now he won't reply to me, so I don't know how to act. I saw him fight two times, both times he threw the first punch without any warning and the 2nd fight he had taken a knife before hand (he hit other guy with it with the plastic part, threatened him that he'll stab him and dropped the knife afterwards). Now my problem is if the manager won't move me out and we meet he might jump with a knife again, plus I'm 80% sure that he'll punch me as soon as he sees me. So my question is do I throw the first punch as soon as I see him in order to gain advantage, or do I wait for him to make a move.",25Jan2017,0
252,"Hey guys, I suffer from moderate to severe anxiety and mild PTSD &amp; depression. My dad doesn't understand any of these and how controlling they can be, and often triggers panic attacks or just makes me explode when he goes off on me sometimes.

He's always had a big inferiority complex, and we used to be pretty wealthy, so he fed off of that for the first 10 years or so of my life. After the economy began to collapse again, my dad lost his job and we haven't been nearly as wealthy since, and now he resorts to his authoritative father figure as much as he can to feed is inferiority. He often says things like ""I can't MAKE you do anything"" in reference to him saying things that cause me to become very angry or trigger an anxiety attack. He doesn't understand that the brain has natural reactions to stimuli, especially when things that he says are borderline verbally abusive. Could you guys give me some information, studies, etc. that I could show him to prove that what he says and does affects me heavily?",25Jan2017,1

255,"**Context:**
I (20F) have known my housemate J (19M) for a little over a year. We met in halls.

He grabbed me first a year ago. He was having trouble with his gf and decided to flirt with me. He tried to get me to go back to his room with him, he was drunk so I took him back to his room and left him there.

I would have forgiven him if this has been a one-time thing and if he had apologised, but he didn't.

He stayed with his gf but kept flirting with me, being touchy, hugging me a lot, generally being too close to me. I made it more and more clear that I was uncomfortable, saying out loud to him things like 'stop' and 'don't touch me'. He continued until after a bad day he picked me up without permission and I screamed at him to put me down and not touch me.

I avoided him until our friend group decided to find a house together. Then I realised I would have to have a talk with him.

Once we moved in I explained to him carefully why what he did made me very uncomfortable, why it made me lose my trust in him, why it scared me. He apologised and said he would never do anything like that again.

A couple of weeks ago he did it again. He was having more problems with his gf and got very drunk and started invading my personal space. He got too close to my face, tried to dance with me, grabbed my ass.

I upset his girlfriend that night so when he came home from visiting her I apologised to him in detail. He gave me an offhand apology, extremely flippant. Sounded like 'oh, sorry I forgot to wash the dishes' but replacing dishes with sexual assault.

The first time I chalked up to him being ignorant and immature, now I've talked to him he should know how much acting like that hurts and disturbs me. He doesn't seem to understand or care.

I put a lot of effort into forgiving him, into building trust, and now that's lost. I don't want to waste energy doing that again when he's likely to just do what he wants with me the next time he's drunk and having gf problems. Also, he does not deserve my friendship after treating me like a piece of meat.

**My main problems:**

* My other housemates don't see him as a threat and therefore won't take this seriously. 
* I have to live with him for at least another 1.5 years
* I don't know how to balance our relationship now that I don't trust him and he doesn't trust me (because I upset his gf)

Any advice greatly appreciated.",25Jan2017,3

258,"Our education systems are going to hell.  Our school system has within the past year:
1. No longer allows us to correct grammar/spelling/punctuation/etc. on papers.  It makes the students feel bad.
2. No longer allowed to give penalties for late work (resulting in a flood of late papers two days before grades are due).
3. No longer making student-athletics who are failing classes/getting ISS or OSS sit out of games.  They can get suspended for punch another kid and be failing two classes, but they still get to play (this is not an exaggeration).  

All of this comes from parents complaining to the central office.  


In good conscience, I can't do it anymore.  I can't give students the skills they need in the real world with my hands completely tied. Teachers are getting into trouble for asking students for basic eye contact and saying their ma'ams and sirs.  This is going to cripple these kids in the future.  But here's the problem, Redditors.

I have a degree in elementary education and middle grades English and Social Studies.  I'm pretty much limited to teaching. I don't know of anything else that I could do with my degree.  I don't have the money to start over and I certainly don't have the time.   I know there are plenty of jobs that pay much better (I only make 1900 a month) but I worry about the insurance.  I have minor bipolar disorder and I pay a ridiculous amount already for medications, psychopharmacologist visits, and therapist visits (I'm 99% functional only because of all this stuff).

260,"Hi,

Let me first start off by saying I'm the male in the relationship. My fiance has been struggling to keep friends over the last four years. A couple of things to note about her. First, she is a huge grudge holder. She has a very hard time letting things go with anybody, even me. Second, she has trouble taking things as a joke, she feels that people are constantly attacking her. I try to explain to her that much of the time that no ill intentions are meant.

It first started off with her losing her best friend as a friend that she grew up with since birth. They were friends for 18 years. As they grew up, they started to have less and less in common. This sort of lead to her losing an entire group of friends in the coming year afterwards.

About a year or so later, she rekindled with an old friend from middle school. They were fine and great with each other for a while. Then they started fighting. Many of the things they fought about were minimal or just not worth it, at least in my eyes. Again, I tried to explain to her that maybe some things weren't worth fighting over, but her grudge holding mentality kind of took over.

Fast forward about another year later, and she makes friends with a group of girls at work. In the beginning, everything was great again. About 6 months went by, and she had little arguments or fights with one friend in this group. In my opinion, it wasn't completely my Fiance's fault, and it wasn't complete her friends fault. There were a few times where my Fiance told me that she was being made fun of by her or them. I tried to explain to her that they were most likely joking around. After so many arguments, she just stopped talking to the girl, which in turn led to her not talking to the group anymore.

Fast forward to now, she just rekindled with a friend at the gym that she was friends with in elementary school. Seeing her past history of friendships, I don't want to see her sad or upset and I want to give her any advice I can to help her maintain this friendship.

I love my Fiance very much, what can I do to help her in this situation, or what kind of advice can I give her?

Thanks in advance for the help!",25Jan2017,1

So here's the deal. An incredibly attractive female that I am friends/aquatinted with just sent me a saucy full length mirror selfie of her in a swimsuit. This was last night and I've since seen her, and she was kinda flirty but our interaction was brief. I want to send her something back that she would find equally enjoyable, so my question is this: what is the male equivalent of a swimsuit pic? I think the jump to shirtless is a little bold because we barely know each other, but on the other hand, I want her to know that I like her and find her attractive. Help! Knowing me I'll probably just send nothing and that's the worst option of them all! Thanks for your help random strangers!",25Jan2017,1
262,"Hello, I am a student in 10th grade and I need all the help I can get. My life is slowly falling apart in front of my very own eyes and I don't know where am I going after I graduate highschool. I guess I should tell my highschool life story from freshman year to now, sophomore. I made it to highschool, I had great grades in middle school, the lowest I would get would be the occasional C, but that was for homework. I was happy with my final average grades, they were A's. I have been enrolled in almost advanced classes and I was having fun. I would meet new friends and enjoy life like a normal teenager. I would get addicted to video games and my phone, including social media and stuff like that. But it slowly began to consume me until I lost my motivation for school work in general. I would end up procrastinating and lose my interest for studying. When I had an exam or homework, I would take so long to finish it and I would secretly cheat on myself and play games on my phone or browse the internet. And finish my homework but at such a late time of the day. I would finish my homework around midnight! Then life began to get worse, I started to fall even further. I became friends with these juniors during my freshman year and I realized they were drug addicts, and me being the retarded teenager I was, became friends with them. But in reality, I was nothing but their mule, I was used to do their bidding and in return I got drugs. I would steal from my home and give to them and get drugs. And this went on for the second half of freshman year until I was caught by my parents (thankfully they stopped me before I was at the point of no return) and transferred to a new school. I started to feel depressed because even though at my old school I was stupid, I had real friendships with real students and teachers. But that was lost now, I was heartbroken. I am currently in the new school for my sophomore year (my first year in that new school). I’m in good classes, advanced ones. But I dropped out of one and replaced it with a lower level of that class, I left an AP elective course for Computer Science. And my current classes are decent, one of them is super advanced for juniors/seniors and I am in it for my science course. My average grades for them are B’s and one C. I lately forget homework assignments or take way too long to finish them and I get low grades, or when I have an exam I procrastinate and play around on my phone instead of studying, mid-term exams happened a week ago, and I received four B’s, two C’s, and one D. These grades may be “acceptable” for some families but in my eyes it utter defeat. I am losing my motivation to study, I haven’t even thought about my life after senior year. I haven’t even planned my life, I don’t know what to do, I don’t know where to go, I don’t know anymore. Life is becoming so stressful now and I feel myself slipping again, but the effects are irreversible this time. I had many people tell me to focus on school and not to make the same mistakes they did, I try but for some reason I just can’t. Please help me, I lost my way of life, I’m dying inside, I’m lost, I have no purpose, no reason, no motivation, I have absolutely nothing now. 

Edit: I'm not suicidal, I will never take the path of a suicidal person ever! I may be struggling now but I have hope I can get myself back up on my feet again. I just need advice from you, the readers and or repliers.

Things didn't go well, they tried to divorce but remained under the same roof, I guess because my mother didn't have another place to go. I can't find anything normal in my family...but the worst thing is that I don't know who I can trust. This is killing me. One day I feel like it's my father's fault, and I direct my rage to him and another day the evidence shows it's my mother who is guilty. I'm constantly suppressing my emotions trying to not show my weak side so they cannot take advantage of me, because I can't separate the ones that love me from the ones that just act kindly to get what they want. I just don't know...the only thing I've ever wanted was the love of a family.
What can I do to know who can I trust in a situation where everyone lie and you are so damn involved? How should I act?

268,"New to Reddit, don't know if this is the right place for this post, but whatever. I have this friend, who I fell in love with, quite by accident. She only sees me as a friend, because she doesn't want a relationship right now, and has only friends for now. We are really close, and there wasn't any awkwardness between us. Problem is, I got very drunk at a party (she wasn't there, which makes it worse) and I called her and confessed everything. She rejected me, but not in a mean way, in a ""we are still friends"" way. So, a few weeks has passed since then, and there is zero awkwardness between us, like nothing has happened. So, now I don't know what to do, because she told me that the no boyfriend thing was only temporary, but I don't know what to do, if I should still try and risk or friendship, or let it go for now.  She has always dropped hints that maybe there was something there, but I don't know if it's just my imagination or if it's real. People outside of my friendships say that it's real but I doubt it.

269,"I am moving out of my rental house in a week. Since I gave my notice a month ago, my landlord has repeatedly entered my house to show it to future buyers. The only problem is, he has not given me notice before entering any of the times he has been here. He often leaves lights on and has even left my front door unlocked. He leaves a key to my front door in a box that is locked to my front door, but he never gave me the code to the box. Today, I came home and the box on my front door was hanging open with the key clearly visible. 

I have asked him to please give me notice before he comes to my home, as I am still legally living here under the contract we both signed. However, he refuses to acknowledge that he is doing anything wrong and continues to enter my house when I am not home, leaving my lights on and occasionally my door unlocked.
