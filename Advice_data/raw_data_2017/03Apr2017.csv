1,"Hi! My name is Jena and I'm currently a highschool junior, so that whole ""planning your entire future"" phase is kicking in. I really want to double major in Japanese and computer science with a minor in game design (yes two majors and a minor). My dream is to work abroad for a major Japanese gaming company, like Nintendo. I'm just not sure if I can do it due to monetary things (college is expensive as hell yall know) and the fact that the requirements to get into these companies as even an intern is extremely difficult. Should I just give up? My parents always wanted me to just be an engineer or actuary so I could find work quick. I've been so stressed lately trying to plan everything, since I want to double major and minor I have to start taking college classes my senior year. ",03Apr2017,4

9,"My hair is quite strange when it comes to texture. I have got long hair, where the top is mostly straight with a little wave occasionally, while underneath there are crazy spiral curls. When my hair dries naturally, it becomes curly, but I can easily comb out the curls out from the top, meaning I cannot classify them as real curls from what I can tell. When it is raining, my hair becomes extremely curly. Every other day when I wash my hair, it goes from curly to straight. What is up with my hair? How can I make the texture more consistent? Am I the only one who has this problem? Would you classify my hair as curly, wavy, or straight?",03Apr2017,1
10,"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a virgin, I've actually been with quite a few girls and have had several quite successful long-term relationships with beautiful ladies in the past. 
Previously I would talk to girls on Facebook, Tinder, or only when I'm fairly drunk and in a small social setting/group like a party or social gathering rather than a bar or club full of absolute strangers.

The thing is, now I'm looking for a potential spouse and I feel like meeting girls like this is too easy and not really ""real"". I want to be able to approach a beautiful girl when I see her at the library, the museum, or elsewhere and strike up a conversation and then proceed to ask her on a date but I'm so extremely shy that I feel a physical block inside of me that won't let me make eye contact let alone even try to approach any woman I see.

/r/Advice, if you have dealt with this or a similar issue in the past and have overcome it what do you recommend I should do based on your experience?
I've read plenty and plenty of guides that say things along the lines of ""just go for it"" or they give you
pickup advice that again feel fake because you're essentially just emulating confident men and not being yourself, which is a ruse that will fall and can only be sustained for a short period because you're not being yourself.

I've been working on improving myself in areas I dislike to build confidence, and I am a confident man at this point. Once the ball gets rolling it's easy for me to talk and progress with the opposite sex, but I feel a type of shame and guilt and risk of embarrassing myself when it comes to asking a girl out in public. Even if it's just her and I at the library, I'd be afraid of the rejection and prefer not to risk it.

This has gone so far that I am considering therapy because I don't want to waste my prime years to find a partner out of fear and anxiety.

What do I do?

Thank-you",03Apr2017,2
12,"Background: I am currently a freshman in my spring semester at the local community college and my top school to transfer to is The University of Southern California. 

Situation: I just got word that I got accepted into the scholars program at my school which is like honors in high school. Meaning the classes are a lot more advanced, with smarter students. The program has feeder deals to the local UC's including; UCLA, UCSB, etc.. However, my dream school in USC. I have all A's except for 2 classes. I calculated my GPA if I were to get straight A's for the rest of my 15 units needed to apply to USC and I would have a 3.7, which is the average GPA for accepted transfer students. Last week a USC admissions officer came on campus to hold a workshop about transferring to the school. When he was asked if scholars program classes are taken into consideration he said they aren't. 

Dilemma: I have such a passion to get into USC. And I believe I can do so with outside experience in internships and other factors, but I think if I were to take the scholars classes I would most likely end a few classes with a B because from what I've heard they are extremely advanced. Not saying I'm not up for the challenge, its just if the scholars classes aren't taken into consideration than why risk the chance of getting a B or lower, and possibly ruining my chances at getting accepted?

She messaged me a few days after saying that she had some questions she wanted answered so I met up with her, a mistake, when I saw her again I was in awe as to how beautiful she is. We hung out the week after again, then I told her I am developing feelings for her again. Long story short, I met up with her yesterday and decided that the best course of action would be to not talk for a couple of months, so that I could move on.

18,"from my junior year to my senior year, I had a group of friends that manipulated me to the extent that I couldn't have any new friends without their approval. there were two in specific. 1. a girl that I friend zoned. 2. a dude that was in the closet. the guy friend was the worst. whenever I would flirt or almost date a girl he would tear their self esteem by spreading rumors that the girl had herpes, or was a major slut. every girl that came into contact with me would have their reputation destroyed by him. the girl would menace and threaten any new friends I made. in one specific case. let's call the girl Mary. I've known Mary ever since we were kids, we were almost a thing we liked each other alot and because of this my guy friend planned her to be raped by some of his friends I didn't know nor cared to know. it happened on her birthday, I was tricked into leaving the party to give my friend a ride to his place because his mom didn't let him out. when I saw her an hour later, the police have been searching for Mary. I saw her in a red Honda Accord. 90s model. she was in the back surrounded by her rapists. later I found out she was given weed, cocaine and alot of alcohol. I couldn't see her the same ever since, and I felt like a coward for it. I was told she wanted it. my senior year I left the group, and they always sought me out but I would find excuses not to hangout with them, because deep down I had a bad feeling about them both. at the end of the year they hooked up and are in a sham marriage of which I'm glad they are in. 
they deserve each other. 
when I was younger I was gullible and didn't believe that people were capable of such things. I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt.

25,"Hi,
I am a 17-year old junior girl in high school. Prom is approaching soon, within the next month and a half. I had not yet made set plans for prom, but expected to go with my friends. However, I recently found out that my best friends are going in a limo to prom, and I am not invited. The person who organized the limo and sort of invited people to ride in the limo is someone who I am friendly with. That person invited my 3 best friends and other people that I am friendly with, but not me. The limo is full now so no more people can ride in it to prom. My friends have been talking about riding in the limo in front of me, so it’s really awkward because I won’t be there and I wasn’t invited. I am sort of hurt that they did not say anything to the girl who organized it, as it feels like they do not want me to be there with them at prom or they forgot about me. I remember my friend telling me that the girl who organized it said “I feel like I am forgetting someone” and asked my friend who she was forgetting. My friend said that she responded “I don’t know”. 
 I have other friends besides these ones, but I feel like I can’t go with them because they have their own set of friends, who I am not necessarily friends with, that they are going with. I know that no boys will be asking me to prom either. I don’t want to go by myself either because that would mean pictures of just me standing alone and driving to the venue myself. There would be no group pictures of me and my friends. I feel like if I go by myself, I would always remember going alone, especially when people ask me about my experience at prom. I feel really sad and unsure of what to do. I have been wanting to go to prom since I heard about it in middle school, and I already bought my dress. I feel like my friends are not really my friends because they do not care that I will not be there with them at prom. I feel really alone and that no one enjoys my company, as they have never asked me to hang out— I’m always the one asking (We have hung out before though, we spend time together everyday at school, and they’ve called me one of their best friends recently).

I sucked, so hard. I couldn't solve any riddles when I was in the room, and that really upset me. I would see arrows or locks or clues, but things wouldn't click for me.

tl;dr: My children's father made some poor choices, lost custody. Dealing with the aftermath has been frustrating and maddening. 

----------------------------------------

My ex and I have been separated for five years. Until about a month ago, we shared 50-50 physical custody of our children, who are now 8 and 10. Overall, things were about as positive and solid as they could be--the kids were happy, he and I communicated well when necessary, etc. We obviously had some hiccups occasionally, but things were largely working well with our arrangement. 

Around thanksgiving of 2015, he began seeing a new woman. Two months later, they find out that she's pregnant and he decides to propose to her. She has three children from two previous relationships, one of whom is not in the child's life at all. They moved in together this past July, and in September their baby was born bringing the total members of his household to eight: my ex, his fiancée (they did not marry until a few weeks ago), and six children aged 10, 10, 8, 7, 2, and an infant. 

This has been, understandably, a difficult transition for everyone. In addition to the regular struggles of blending families, three of the older children have some kind of special needs--one is diabetic, two are on the autism spectrum and one of those also has some physical issues--and then the toddler and the baby. They also are not in an ideal financial situation to support such a large family, which is an additional source of stress. 

Our 8 year old daughter was having significant adjustment issues as she is the only member of the new family who is neither very young nor special needs. Because of that, she was feeling very overlooked in her new family, and her father was not aiding her adjustment at all. He began applying extreme forms of punishment for minimal transgressions (largely her behaving in a way that he considered selfish) including taking away all of her toys, some items of clothing, her special blanket, and her jewelry with no clear instructions on her being able to earn  any of her things back. He also removed her bedroom door because he told her he did not trust that she was getting ready for bed or school when instructed. Over the course of a few months he also donated or destroyed some of her favorite things, as well as began restricting the amount of food she was given in her school lunch and requiring her to bring her trash home to prove she was eating what she was given. There were also several incidents where the two year old was upstairs unsupervised and ended up getting hurt, and our daughter was punished because she was not being careful with him. 

I started her in therapy in January to help her cope with all of this. I also visited my attorney to see what I should do in order to alter our custody arrangement because of the new circumstances. A few weeks later, he began hitting our children as a form of punishment. Not just spanking or light taps, but one week he punched our daughter in the shoulder blade for not coming downstairs quickly enough after the toddler had gone upstairs, and then the following week he smacked our 10 year old son in the face because the infant squirmed off his lap and fell and a couple of days later he punched our daughter in the stomach for not giving him an answer he was looking for quickly enough. 

When they returned to my home the Sunday after the last two incidents, I alerted CPS and they opened an investigation. I also filed a petition for emergency custody modification, and while CPS determined there wasn't anything they could do this time as it was the first investigation (even though he admitted to the incidents), they did refer him to a number of parenting classes as well as anger management therapy. As their investigation period just officially closed on March 28th, he has not begun any of those programs at this point. 

We did come to an agreement that was signed a couple of weeks ago, without having to go before a judge. It indicates that I will have full physical custody and his visitation will be determined two weeks at a time with the mediation of a family counselor, and giving significant weight to the children's wishes and comfort levels (as their situation at their father's home was degenerating, and especially after the physical incidents, they were vehement about not wanting to return to his home as they were scared of him), as well as points about he and I communicating directly with one another in a civil and timely fashion regarding any issues about the children. 

In the two weeks we've had our new agreement in effect, things have not been going swimmingly. Initially, when social services became involved, he was refusing to speak to me at all and was using his wife as an intermediary for matters that required us to talk. Once our new agreement took over, initially I attempted to include her in conversations regarding schedules but she continued to speak up at inappropriate times and has been hostile toward me most times she did chime in. 

He has also not followed the directed timeline to approve a family therapist to facilitate our scheduling discussions (he had until March 21st to confirm or reject the children's individual therapist for this purpose but did not do so until March 27th and has still not attended one of her sessions). 

For the first two weeks after the CPS investigation commenced, the children were spending Wednesday evening and Saturday daytime at his home, per their request. Two Saturdays ago when I arrived to pick up the children at our agreed upon time, I heard him yell at our son for several minutes because he didn't stop heading toward the door when his father requested he stop. This left our son very shaken and after that incident, he requested not to return until the following weekend (when his grandparents were going to visit), thus skipping the weekday visit. This was ultimately what occurred but not without significant hostilities from both my ex and his wife. We had similar issues regarding visitation this past week (the children were on spring break this week and only expressed a desire to go there Wednesday through Thursday midday that week, thus skipping the Saturday visit). During those discussions, I attempted to speak only to their father but he continually added his wife into our communications (everything has been in writing so far) and then she sent me a very nasty message ""telling me what [she] really thinks of me"". Ultimately, they only went there Wednesday/Thursday this past week, but then today I received communication from him about the upcoming week where he did not even attempt to mask his contempt for me, and when I let him know what the children wanted to do this week (Saturday/Sunday again, as their grandparents are visiting again), he informed me again that I am harming the children by letting them take the lead about when they visit his home and that I should encourage them to spend more time with that part of their family. 

I have been standing firm in my position that the children's feelings and wishes will be respected, and until he begins working through any of the referred programs and therapies I will not push them into spending more time there than they expressly say they want to. But I was thinking (perhaps naively) that once we had our new agreement on file with the court that things would get easier--but it's really just meant that he has carte blanche to come at me with his frustration and anger as well as manipulate the children. This has been extremely stressful for me and while the children are handling it well, things are not improving and I truly don't know how much longer I can keep doing this. 

I did loop my attorney into our communications this past week and will do the same tomorrow with the most recent batch of messages, but we will need to get to a point (hopefully soon) where we can have these discussions without involving attorneys or we will need to amend our agreement again. But in the meantime, is there anything I should be doing differently in this process? How do I handle his continued venom and his unending attempts to require me to also communicate with his wife in addition to him? Any other guidance from people who may have been here before?

Now, I know it seems that I can get helpful advice from my advisor, however, because my semester hasn't been going the way I had anticipated (tough professors, working 2 jobs, pressure from family), I'm starting to believe that dropping what I'm doing and change my career path towards something more practical.  Right now I feel as if I'm never gonna get out of school while all of my friends move on with me struggling to get a degree. I've been listening and reading things from Mike Rowe and Gary Vaynerchuk pertaining to working hard and not smart, meaning I should put my passions for literature and writing to the side and pursue an education and a career that will quickly get me started in the real world, making good money, and growing up.  

I'm open to any career that'll allow me to feel that I've contributed to society in a crucial way

I appreciate your time and well-thought out advice.  ",03Apr2017,3

I'm conflicting with myself right now. I got an instagram acct today, but I feel guilty about it. My parents do not know and they do not want me to have one. I'm in high school and almost everyone has an instagram and I don't wanna be left out from all the fun. Idk why my parents are stupid to not let me have one. Also, I don't have a smartphone in the first place (thanks mother!!) Does she want me to me made fun of at school for having a ""trap phone?"" I LITERALLY HATE MY PHONE AND JEALOUS OF OTHERS FOR HAVING ONE!!! I have the grades and all but my mom still won't budge, not even a little. I just wanna have an Instagram and a good phone to use. She says it's ""only for communication"" which is bs in my opinion because all my friends' moms let them have androids or iphones. Why won't my mom? What should I do with my Instagram acct?",03Apr2017,1

54,"I'm thinking about getting an emotional support animal. I want a smaller dog because they're affectionate and don't really fight to be let go of. But my dad insists it's a bad idea, because the office where he works is attached to the house. He's concerned that the dog will hear them through the walls or smell a stranger and bark. I'm convinced that you can teach a dog not to, but he insists on getting a cat because they're quiet. 

So my question is, are all small dogs likely to bark at unfamiliar voices and smells, even without seeing anyone? If not all, what breeds are especially quiet and good for apartment living?

Secondary question: which animal is a better emotional support animal, dog or cat?

EDIT: my disorders that require assistance are mostly depression, anxiety, and getting overwhelmed easily (which I suppose is a part of anxiety and also not a disorder on its own but it is a reason to pick up your fuzzy buddy and snuggle them)

EDIT 2: I'm mostly concerned because if the dog does bark a whole lot dad will lose his job and we will lose our home. But if i get a cat and it doesn't help my emotional state I'll be stuck with more responsibility and no actual emotional support.",03Apr2017,2

60,"Not sure where to look, who to talk to, and this is the first time i've ever posted on reddit. So anyways, I'm 21 and my fiance is 20, we just had our first kid on valentines day 2017, and we're living in the chicago nw suburbs. We were living on our own while she was pregnant, but we weren't living too comfortably. Since we've had our daughter, we've decided it might be best to move in with my parents to help save up, especially considering the fact that i'm going to be attending school full time, and pursuing a bachelors for the next four years. By no means do we have an abundance of cash, she works at sports clips making around 1k/month, and i work at a cell phone store making around the same amount. My problem is with my family, remembering how my childhood went i want nothing like that for my daughter. Constant mental, and physical abuse. My father died when i was 15, otherwise i'd probably be asking him for the advice instead of posting on reddit. After that in less than a year my mother had already found a new boyfriend. At first he seemed okay, but that's how it goes with everybody, they fake it at the start. After a few weeks he would be threatening me and my younger brother, sometimes even physically assaulting us, or friends we would have around. My mother acts in much of the same way, except much more delusional. It's apparent that she is or was addicted to all kinds of drugs for a very long time, which is probably a main cause of all of her delusions. She constantly lies about everything (yes everything, even things there should be no reason to lie about), spreading rumors, etc. To put it into perspective this morning we were woken up around 6 am, after finally being able to fall asleep with the baby around 4 am. They were out drinking all night i believe, but anyways she came into the room we were sleeping in, slammed the door into the wall, and started screaming ""Get the fuck up, you're a fucking piece of shit, retard, nobody gives a shit about you"" all kinds of petty demeaning things like this. So naturally, we both got up and just left and went to a friends house all day today. About an hour ago we decided to go back for clothes, things for the baby, and to say hi to our puppy who just turned one year old today. When we got there it was apparent that they parked in a way that my car wouldnt fit into the drive way, basically ""go fuck yourself"". We were told last month they were going to make us a key, but that never happened. As we walked up to the door we realized it was locked, and i'm sure you can guess it never is unless they're being petty. so we rang the doorbell, and my mother's boyfriend answered the door. He's always very two faced in front of anybody, but the second he catches me alone he pretty much wants to murder me for no good reason. but anyways both of us were at the door and he has the audacity to say "" oh whats going on? everything okay?"", as i replied ""yeah, we're just grabbing some clothes"" he mumbles under his breath ""it would just be easier to belt you in the mouth"" out of nowhere. I could tear this guys head off, but for my sake and my daughters i said and did nothing. and of course you can always hear them talking, as if they want to be heard saying malicious things and name calling from another room. asshole, prick, blabla bla fuck that motherfucker bla bla. all kinds of things like this. I don't think it's a good environment for anybody, and it's tortured me for most of my life until i turned 16 and left. Now especially with my daughter being here it seems like nothing has changed, and i find it completely unacceptable for anybody to treat me this way, especially in front of my daughter. I know she's not even two months old and she doesnt know anything, but i still don't think it's right. So anyways we have no money saved up, I'm trying to get grants and loans for school. My car is going to stop working any day now, we can't stay with her family... and most housing around here is too expensive for us to be able to live decently with the money we're making right now. We don't want to have our daughter around them, but at the same time we feel stuck. We need lots of financial advice. I don't know what to do, and i feel as if i'm going to commit suicide if im here for any longer. sorry for the long rant, poor grammar and punctuation and whatever else. I havent even slept 20 hours this week, and these examples are just of today, which in comparison was a pretty good day. okay this is the third time i've edited and added on to the end, but i just remembered something that will make some of you cringe. my mother's been smoking for about 35 years 1-2 packs a day, not to mention the tedious amounts of cocaine, and prescription abuse. recently she's been coughing out blood, her theory is that it's my fault, that somehow i'm stressing her out and causing her to cough up blood.",03Apr2017,1
61,"I am posting for a friend who is suspicious that their female work boss is being abused at home by her husband. The employee is a right-hand assistant to the boss. They have shared personal issues with each other before and the employee feels that the boss might be trying to reach out by mentioning, almost daily, that they've had a ""bad morning"" at home. This is often accompanied by eratic behavior, which the employee has approached the boss about, and the confronting of this behavior usually results in a subsequent breakdown explaining that the boss is going through marital problems. However, the issue is never described in detail as the employee does not want to feel like they are prying and get their professional matters entangled in any personal matters. 


The husband is known for being controlling, vindictive, and belittling but the employee suspects physical abuse. This suspicion is brought on by peculiar behavior, such as the boss coming in with several layers of clothing, popped jacket collars, etc. all of which are out of the ordinary and usually occur when the boss is late and also acting eratically. The employee is concerned, and given their close relationship, wants to reach out, find out if anything is wrong, and provide support or help without endangering their professional territory or personal matters.   

EDIT: It turns out another reason this employee is feeling terrible about this situation is that the boss does not have any close family in the state and the husband's controlling behavior has led her to essentially not have any friends.",03Apr2017,1

65,"Long story short I had a job at a grocer for about seven months, and got fired for stealing some small things. Yeah, I know. I hate me too. I don't know why I did it, I guess because I'm an idiot with a boring life. Luckily, these legends of employers don't do anything except fire me. No lawsuit or further action, just instant termination.

I've been without a job for some time now, and I really need another one. I was thinking about getting work at an electronics store because that's sort of my passion. I'm pretty sure that I should basically leave out all mention of me previous employment, but I also wonder if It's better to leave it in.

I was a good worker, even had some letters of commendation, and I have some people that I worked with who would offer a reference. I've never had a second job, but I'm pretty sure that they would ask me why I left my previous job, at which case I'm, (excuse me), fucked.

So the delusional dream I'm having now is that I could use my old job on my resume, and somehow have them not ask any questions about my leaving, or getting in contact with the store managers etc.

Anyways, I would really appreciate some help at this point in time. My choices have pretty much made my life somewhat more anxious. Any help is welcome, and I really just want to talk with some level-headed internet friends right now. Thanks for any assistance,

66,"He is 69 years old. He has been falling and called me yesterday because he couldnt get up so i called an ambulance. This has been going on for years and is getting worse. Now (as I predicted) he is calling me at midnight saying he is leaving tomorrow hes not doing this. I am literally the only person in his life and I try to do as much as I can i.e. getting him food everyday. I just cant do it anymore, he comes off as very ungrateful and often tells me to F* off, but i try and keep my frustation at a minimum because he is mentally incontenent at this point. He cant write or form sentences and he needs to be in long term care. His main problem is he cannot stop drinking. He has been diagnosed with alcohol induced hepatitis. Every time I say you feel like this or you are falling because you are drinking vodka everyday he freaks out and insists that isn't it, if I insist it is he would scream. I don't know what to do, I have to go to the hospital tomorrow and I am going to try and get him to stay but he will scream, probably stay the night, but the next day will be worse. They discharged him from the hospital last time probably because they couldn't deal with how high maintenance he is and now he is and fell twice that same day. He is going to try and do it again. You can tell by speaking to him he is not in good shape and isn't grasping reality. Is there a way to keep him from getting discharged until the dept of aging can get him into long care, even against his will if he is not able to live by himself?

69,"So, I have 2 other friends and we are all friends and enjoy hanging out with eachother. Awhile ago, me and one of the friends were thinking of not being friends with the other because he was being extremely secretive, deceptive and just kind of being mean. Basically he'd always say he was planning on playing with us but he didnt and played a game secretly by himself with other people we have a bad past with. He'd also quit playing with us completely just playing the game all day. We play on PS4 where you can appear offline when your actually online and he does that a lot. It's not that we don't want him playing without us but he was never truthful about it, and he'd always get mad at us and stuff. I know it sounds like we're just jealous but I didn't explain all of it and it's hard to explain. He just felt fake. But then we made up when deleted the game and it was good for a while. Knowing that, I need advice. He just re downloaded the game for whatever reason and now our friendship is as shaky as ever. Me and the other friend just out he'd been playing the game secretly even after saying he didn't redownload it. It's so complicated, I'm tired of him but I don't want to stop being friends because I move a lot so I've learned to value friendships a lot. I know friendships shouldn't be ruined because games and it sounds like it, but like I said that's not all it. He just changed since he got it. He started cussing, saying how he never enjoyed playing with us most of the time and I'm just sad, not depressed but kind of shocked. What should I do? Should we bother still being friends with him?

I currently have a 2.7 GPA, 2.7. Until high school it was straight A's, then I got hit with the work load. I've never gotten below a 85 on any test for any subject. Classwork I complete just fine. But I can't bring myself to study (granted, I still usually get A's on tests. Math especially. In Geometry, and it all builds of previous stuff. So I just figure it out when taking the test.) or do homework. And its the homework that kills me. I currently have a 69 in both spanish and history. Take out homework grades and I would have a 100 in history, 94 in spanish. So it's not a lack of intelligence at least in my opinion (I figure myself to be slightly above intelligence. Especially with technology. My Cisco class (skipped to Junior year level) spent 2 weeks on a trunking issue, I figured out how to use router on a stick in 30 minutes. I also have built this: http://i.imgur.com/JETnnA6.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/9gqvkI7.jpg). But rather motivation and focus.

I can't focus for shit. Ill spend 2 hours browsing the internet for every 5 minutes work. Block the internet? Well i'll stare at the swirls on my desk for 2 hours. No this is not a joke. I see the repercussions of these decisions, and I want to do the work. But its as if I can't. I use a fair bit of drugs (oxy, LSD (mainly), and cocaine a bit). So i've been able to try Concerta, Adderall, and Vyvanese. Well let me tell you. I could actually work. I could actually function and not be distracted.

No. I'm asking on how to get started working on them to internet strangers. Do you see my damage?

tl;dr I toot my horn about how I think i'm intelligent cause I'm a narcissistic bitch, I have ADD, Aspbergers, and Anxiety all diagnosed but parents don't believe mental conditions are real so no meds, I can't actually focus or do homework/studying.

She is a woman who has that ""anything you can do I can do better"" attitude toward men and does the hardest jobs to prove herself. 

For the past several months she actively avoids me. That in itself isn't that bad. She would come up to others near me and invite them to parties and just ignore that I was there. Actively, consisyently excluding me from these talks. That is not that bad to be excluded. We don't have to be friends. It's  more than that now. I can't remember the last time she spoke to me, even when she needs to communicate with me in order to do our jobs. If I go to the break room, the smoking area, the bathroom at the same time she does, she will straight up book it out of there, not looking at me, not speaking to me. I have NO IDEA WHY. 

She will call our supervisor to complain about me. If I speak to her, she will complain about it and say I spoke to her in a tone she didn't like. Now, I  am careful about what I say and how I say it. I am always nice to her and friendly. I am good at my job, but she is definitely out to sabotage me. She has literally called them in front of me to have them ask me to do something that it was clear I was right about to do already. Then later I told her that next time she could just radio me instead of going through the extra steps of having the supervisor tell me. That's how far she will go in order to not speak to me. Given the equipment I had during this incident it was impossible for her not to know I was about to do this specific task right at that moment, and she called them anyway. When I saw her on her break shortly after I approached her aonce I had to walk by her anyway with my equipment. Pure coincidence. When I asked her about the radio thing she said she would just do that next time. Maybe an hour later I get a call to the office. They said she came in to complain about me ""confronting"" her. That was in no way a confrontation. I wish they had called her up so we could talk it out in the office but I didn't. Later I saw her in the restroom and she BOOKED it out of there. 


I don't know why she is doing stuff like this to me and every time I try to talk to her she gives me short, curt answer and takes off.

I am very independent and I think I can do fine on my own but not very street smart.


I am thinking of perhaps changing my major, I have now a limited time to do that. bear with me...


My 'plan' is after finishing my BA in computer science, to then move to an ""area of more opportunity"" and start off on my own.


My concern is that CS is a field of constant learning and I see doubt in my future as to whether I can get much more than an internship after graduating. Or if I can do much with my degree at all without further study. 


Like I said before I live in the middle of nowhere and after 15 years it is feeling more and more like a box, and study is mentally hard when you feel like your in a hole.


Now that my final year is approaching I am getting more nervous as to weather or not I can handle CS. If I put my nose to the grindstone and kill myself with work I think I can do it. But I wonder yet.


I have a small inferiority complex and the idea of coming into the teck world as not the smartest cookie, and working with 19-20 year old wiz kids makes my ego hurt. But that is something I have to work on yet.


Should I think of moving sooner to give myself a mental restart.
Or slow down my study and get a some on-hand experience or a internship on the side. Can I expect to get anywhere out of the gate as a CS grad with only light office work as an other related skill?

First off, I'll say that I've had a pretty rough life, getting bullied a Lot in middle school and high school, dealing with an abusive dad during the early years, not having many friends, etc. I guess most of these things made me the person I am today which leads me to believe why I'm having such a hard time.

I met a girl on a dating app in March of 2016. We hit it off really well; texted frequently for a solid week, went on two dates, had a great time. But during that week+ of time, I grew anxious. I hadn't been in a relationship in 6 years at the time and, at age 24, still hadn't found a steady job. Here she was, 2 years younger, working on her masters degree with a steady job. I didn't feel qualified to be a boyfriend despite how well we connected. I called things off, and we haven't talked since. 

Here I am a year later, and little has changed. I have a degree in music education and am still struggling to find a steady job - I've been a substitute for two years - and am still endlessly swiping in these useless dating apps. I won't say I'm desperate for a relationship, but I live with my two best friends - who are engaged to each other. I'm lonely, and she's the only one I've connected with in any way, and I still have her number in my phone.

When Sydney and I had been dating for around 7 months, give or take some days, I started talking to Kaitlin a little on Facebook. It was purely platonic, I made sure to talk about Sydney more than a few times, nothing was ever said about my crush on Kaitlin, and nothing was ever intended to be flirty.

After a few days of this, Sydney made me block Kaitlin on Facebook, because she thought Kaitlin was prettier than her, and because she knew I used to have a crush on her.

Yes, that seems a bit ridiculous, but it made Sydney feel better, and I was ok with doing it for her. However, part of me feels like Kaitlin at least deserves to know why she was blocked.

So, assuming I have a way of contacting Kaitlin. Should I apologize for blocking her, and explain the situation? If so, do I tell Sydney about it? Or would it just be better to leave it all alone?",03Apr2017,1
91,My friend is very sad about her boyfriend not caring about her is going to break up with him. She talks to me about how she doesn't treat him right and how she hasn't been happy in a long time. What should I do? She only talks to me about this. I told her to break up with him and she is going to apparently. ,03Apr2017,2
94,"So let me tell you first. I came from Nepal when I was in the verge of turning 21. As my grandmother is American, I needed to be here before I turn 21 in order to get my green card. I was studying computer engineering back home and was good at it.  I wanted to have the ""prestigious"" US education. 

Came to Chicago,Illinois full of determination. And I don't know, maybe I could have made a mark. However, I relocated to Texas and lived there for couple of months. I could not take in the Texas habitation. So I called some people and found out there are some students(native to my country) who would like to share apartment fees some state away. So I carried my belongings scented with hope and took the next flight to Atlanta and then to a small college-town named Auburn, Alabama. I was outgoing person till i met my roommates; they were very egotistical and antisocial to other cultures(close to racist), because they came from conservative families and have been living here since they were 18. I lived with 3 students. Each of them 28, 29, 25, doing their Phd's in Mechanical eng., bio systems eng. and chemical eng. respectively. Age gap made me feel more isolated and their anti social behavior was trickling down on me like tar. Their ""conservative"" behavior was affecting me on a psychological level. Me being the son of a father who is a successful senior captain in an airlines and a mother who is a  phd doctorate teacher. I was isolated by them fairly quickly. I tried to reconcile with them but they became more aggressive by the day. Turns out they already thought of me as a ""Failure"" in life. 

I worked in Kroger, Walmart and a sports deli called Mama's Goldberg to earn my living in the unknown continent. Adapting and trying to overcome the cruelty of the days. I was physically healthy when I came here first  as I also did kick-boxing and muay thai back home. But now the pressure of isolation crept into me and it demanded something in return. I tried to sate it by eating immense  amount of unhealthy food. I was new to things beyond comprehension and tried my best to fit in. And I somewhat became successful to do it. But however the people I worked with didn't share my enthusiasm for the future. All they wanted from life was to settle for a job. They would not study any other material other that their courses. I know I am being a prick, but I read a lot of books. All my life from 16 year old to up-till now i have frequented only 3 places. Those are bars, coffee houses and libraries. I was an avid traveller too. I used to hike, play football, take my motorcycle for a cross country trips. And being here with nothing and no one has really hit me hard. The pursuit of goal for my future in  each an everyday of ""adapt and overcome"" was getting heavy. I enrolled in a community college nearby and juggled full time work and college. The college I went to had a fairly low quality education. And I really questioned my existence in the class room. The teaching material was not good. And I started to notice a pattern, I was not progressing mental or physically. My body was deteriorating and more over my mind. I was scared for the first time in my life. My heart had never felt the terror of this magnitude. I then dropped out of college and left my job. I am not every earnest spender so I had some money saved.  They were going to promote me on $15/hr wage. However  i could not see any future in living i that place. I have other plans in life. 

Homesickness filled me till just couple of inches below my throat. With the money I saved i tried to get back on track. (Here's the roughly routine of my day after that, morning till noon library, then coffee house for sometime and venture back to library and when the sun stood on the horizon I would run for 45 mins and take a shower and bar-hopped. I was not very good at english to start with and didn't knew the American etiquette. So in order to learn how to swim quickly, I dove into the pool without any instruction or lifeboat to safe for anyone who cared. I was learning very quickly and somewhat mastered my English and started with spanish. I devoured novels mostly by ""haruki murakami""(if you havent heard of him, seriously check him out), then went past murakami and couple of author's whole writing bibliography. I read tons of books about financing and investing and been learning the
Curve. I tried making friends with people. But all of them were frat boys and sorority girls(not being harsh, but those are not my crowd). Every time i made friend and had a good time together, they would ask my number and say that they would call me and have get together. I would not take their number because it was polite thing to do(you cant just call a group of people and try to hangout with them when you are not in the group). Anyway A lot of people did that, more than 20 people took my number but not a single call came through. I am mentally strong person(so I thought I was). But these barrages of insecurities had me knocked down. 

And then I contemplated suicide. There is a sweet spot in the outskirts of the Auburn university which would be perfect to kill myself. I had planned it, Monday night I would get alcohol in me and run as fast as i could and jump as far as I could from the 5 storied height and see If i could beat the new record for long jump. Although that was the plan, I had one to many alcohol in me that night and I passed out at the bar. And the next day, I was too hungover to kill my self. So then I booked a flight to Chicago where my sister lives and try to start again. I have talked with my parents about the sponsorship for the rent and living and they highly obliged(they dont know anout the alcohol and suicide). I would go there and try to learn and be a better human. I think I will work at the airport(thats where my sister works, for some airline) i would try to slip into the aviation circle. I will try save up and invest and do more as much as i could. In couple of days I would be in Chicago for a new start. However the 1 year pilgrimage has made me crave for people who I can freely and truly talk to. I am more of a eye-contact conversationalist. So i don't have any social media what so ever. I am considering to make a tinder(to meet new people). And talk to them, share experiences. I don't know any other site that could help me find people in my desired circle. 

TL;DR - Came to America with nothing. Went to some states, tried living there. Suicidal but alcoholism  saved me from killing self. Socially crippled with no friends  since I got here (1 year). Looking to move to Chicago for a fresh start. Looking for some friends to talk and hang out. Suicidal and alcoholism's crave must be rooted in my lack of friends. Friendly and social (I think I am), just there is too much state traveling has made me dizzy. Thinking of opening a tinder account for social community. If you have any other remedy, please do tell me. You will do a alien a favor.

95,"I have the most passive aggressive roommate in the world. Let's call her ""Kate.""

A little backstory....we live in a 3B2Bath and have a third roommate who just moved in a month ago and is leaving next month. Kate has gone through 6 roommates since freshman year of college, we are now juniors. Kate and I both have large dogs, but she has a dog that sheds MASSIVE amounts of fur. I'm talking tumbleweeds of fur all over the house. She never cleans it...ever!!! 

Kate is in a sorority and constantly has loud, obnoxious people over 24/7 who take up all the parking, eat all of my stuff, and keep me awake at all hours of the night. However, she pays rent so I try not to let it bother me since this is a shared space. 

Anytime I have people over she is rude to them, makes them feel obviously unwelcome and uncomfortable, and is always insulting them. It's to the point where I don't ever invite anyone over because she's such a bitch to anyone I bring through the door! And then has the audacity to ask them to leave because she needs to sleep when I have endured endless nights of her friends yelling and dancing all through my house. 

You can't talk to her about anything because she gets so defensive and makes it seem like you've done the wrong not her. 

This is only scratching the surface of what she has done in the past year I have lived with her and I honestly cannot handle it anymore without exploding. 

What do I do??? I have no other option for now but to live here. How do I get her to stop being such a bitch all the time? ",03Apr2017,0

100,"I know this is about to sound really ""nice-guy""-like, but I found that I made best friends with 4 girls that I originally pursued due to attraction over the past 2 years. I only have hooked up w/ one of them, and the other we were cuddling and she basically said she didn't want to ""do anything"" because she liked that I'm the closest guy friend she's had, and she doesn't want to ruin that. It seems like as I've spent increasing time around these girls, they grow a stronger platonic affection for me. I've never had a real relationship and mostly just have one night stands with girls I've known for a few weeks. It's like those few weeks of interaction with a girl makes me out to be attractive, but as my personality is fully realized they back away from the sexual aspect of our relationship. I think it is due to flaws in the way I act, and I was wondering if anyone has advice for how to stop steering my hook ups into ""bestfriendships"". I think it's cause I'm immature, but my friends also tell me the aspects I find immature about myself are what make me fun. Anyway any advice would be greatly appreciated.",03Apr2017,1

106,"I recently was trying to go back and find a web page I was on before and found my boyfriend had searched for cute girls in diapers.

He also clicked on that web page realized what it was and exited out quickly. 
I believed him for about 5 minutes and I couldn't help but really go into his history. I hate to invade his privacy because I'm not that kind of girlfriend but I think in this case I deserve to know the truth. Sure enough about 2 years ago (we have been dating for 1) he searched for ""cute toddler girls in diapers"" and about 7 other variations of that. I have found no videos or pictures saved and it appears that beside this time he searched for it one other time back in 2013. I don't really know where to go from here.. I want to help him because I know he hasn't hurt anyone (there IS a difference from a pedophile and a child molester) and I know he has incredible self control. I just don't know how I can help him. I'm 22 he is 25. 
Sex has been fine with us except he goes through periods of time where he either can't come or even get hard. I've thought about maybe trying to be more playful or cute in bed to satisfy these urges he has but I'm not comfortable playing that  part (basically being an adult baby) and I feel like that would make him worse down the road.

113,"Hey there kiddos!

WALL OF TEXT - TLDR AT THE BOTTOM ^^also ^^I ^^sound ^^like ^^a ^^broken ^^record ^^in ^^this ^^post ^^I ^^swear.

I'm a 14 year old kid attending middle school who happens to like girls. I'm not obnoxious about it, I don't try to turn conversations into ""by the way I'm gay"" like some students do, and I'm not one of those 'HOW DARE YOU BE STRAIGHT"" people either. I'm the same as any other student only I prefer ladies.

Luckily while my school is very 'with the times' and has clubs and groups for any LGBT students, there is still a group of students who seem to be going out of their way to try and bother me.

It's multiple people doing this, but I'm mainly gonna focus on one kid. Let's call him L. I was friends with L, didn't talk to him for a while, we started hanging out again this year.

At the start of the year he was... okay? We would hang out in the art room because nobody else would hang out in there but as the year went on he quickly got worse and worse. He would be bragging about how he ""loves to drive people to suicide"" and saying that he loved to try and drive some other students to try and kill themselves. I made it clear to him that I was uncomfortable with these things, but he continued. One day, he told me that - ""No, most gays are bad but you're fine, you're not one of the filthy ones."" Later one of his friends started joining in on these things, and when they called me a ""filthy homosexual"" I was like 'nokay'. 

After a while I had enough and talked to the school admins about him, and they're hesitant to try and deal with it due to him having some mild mental issues, but even then that doesn't change the fact that he's doing this.

Because we hung out in the art room that was normally locked at lunch, we were the only two with permission to be in there. ^^no ^^we ^^didn't ^^diddle ^^eachother. But after a while he started letting his friends in without teacher approval and was starting to steal supplies and mess with the art that was in the room. I stopped hanging out with him around this time and informed the art teacher about what was going on, and she locked the room for a few weeks.

It was at about this point that I made it clear that I wouldn't be friends with him if he continued this. He continued.

Ban was lifted on kids in the art room but they still needed permission - I was able to get permission for me and one friend, but L wasn't able to get in, which was nice because now I don't have to deal with this anymore.

Or so I thought

He now spends his lunches hanging out in the hallway outside of the art room banging on the door and window trying to get in and bother us, even after he's been told both by us and by administration to stop.

While of course the higher ups are pulling the ""If he's like this, he won't have any friends and realise everything wrong with this"" card... Only, there are more students befriending him because of this behavior.

For a whlie I tried to avoid him because every lunch he would only be in the hallway outside of the art room, so I started hanging out in the library. He then started hanging in the library. I started hanging out in the main entryway, he and his friends started hanging out in the main entryway. I started hanging out upstairs, he started hanging out upstairs.

I guess I'll thrown in a list of individual incidences now?

* A group of friends of mine often chill in the hall outside of the art room because it's a quiet hallway. L came and was telling them to kill themselves, calling them ""autistic anime retards"" and ""furry retards"". I lean out into the hallway to ask him to stop, because I can hear him from the class. He proceeds to flip me off, do the Nazi salute, and walk away.

* I'm not 100% sure what happened leading up to this, but I think he had intentionally fucked with the doors to the art room and I asked him about it, as in a ""Hey did you mess with doors?"". He yelled at me saying that I was homophobic for accusing him because he was a trans woman. (He's not, if he was this would be a different story.) I told him that ""I'm gay, why would I be homophobic?"". He told me that 
&gt;You're not a real lesbian because you don't have short hair. You should change your pathetic faggot haircut.
* More recently I was sitting in the hallway to do my math in math class because it's quieter and his locker was in that same hall. He went to his locker and I ignored him and he started saying things intended to get my attention. ""They should throw the faggots on the fire like they did in the 50's!"" He has it worded in such a way that he can claim he did nothing wrong when he's caught for it, but it is still intended to try and piss people off.

* This was both with L and some classmates. L walked by the door of my math class and leaned inside, made eye contact me, and did the Nazi salute. Multiple students responding with saluting back.

* Not to do with me but still semi-relevant. A new student came to the school and they happen to be trans. He decides to blow this whole thing out of the water. 
""He's one of those feminazi tumblr users."" 
Some other kids came by and started talking about this student with him, where he continued ""Oh, it's one of *those* . They want to be a real boy huh? I'll show them how to be a real boy!"" Mind you, this kid had been minding his own business the entire week.

* Same general time as last event. He was talking loudly with that same group about how administration was trying to suspend him. ""I'm too gay for them or something."" I decided to speak up and told him why they were trying to suspend him. He told me to kill myself.

* Once told me that he loves to annoy K (another gay student) and that he ""wants her to commit suicide"". She has talked with me about this, so it's not just him trying to stir up something to piss me off.

* Once heard him in the hall outside of the art room loudly telling a bunch of his friends how to call people ""Filthy homosexuals"" and ""Dirty lesbians"" in German.

This is just a handful of incidences.

It's been spring break for the past few weeks so I of course haven't had any incidences, but I'm still nervous to go back to school because I'll have to deal with this. And what makes it worse was a majority of my classmates know I'm gay, and there's a fair number of them who are starting to say similar things to L. I've been trying to avoid him in the halls and I've been rerouting my paths to my next class to avoid him but I still run into him.

There are other students doing this, but it's mainly L which is why I""m mainly focusing on him.

TLDR - Student and his friends go out of their way to harass me and other students because of LGBT ties, have contacted administration and he still continues, have gone out my way to avoid him and he changes his patterns to always hang out where I am.

I'm just sick and tired of dealing with this and I don't know how to make this stop. I know it's not as bad as in some other places, but that doesn't stop it from being shitty to deal with on a daily basis.
Apologies if this post is long and poorly formatted &lt;3

Edit : Holy shit I wrote this at like 2 in the morning - just woke up and this is the most rambly thing ever

Edit 2 : I just got home and holy shit these responses. Just a quick thank you to those of you who took time to reply! Some more info, the administration is trying to help fix it but they don't want to suspend him only to have him come back a week later and continue. My folks do know about this, and so do L's parents. Tomorrow I'm going to talk with administration about a potential fix because even today he was spouting similar stuff to this and he seems to have no sign of stopping unless there is punishment. I don't want punishment like this (suspension) but if it's also bothering other students like it is, I might as well try and push for more action. Thank you kiddos.",03Apr2017,20

116,"      I am an international student, and I have been admitted from five universities, but I have finalized them to only two universities. The first one is King’s College London, MA in International Management, while the second choice is George Mason University, MA in English, Linguistics. However, since I received the acceptance letters, I have encountered a difficult dilemma because choosing the university and major is a tough decision and it will determine my entire career; therefore, I am writing this letter so as to help me decide which university I should accept its offer. 


       I know they are two different majors, and many friends have criticized me that I do not have a clear plan for my future, nor can I decide my educational goals. Nevertheless, I disagree with them because I feel I have strong interests in these majors, and  I believe I have multi-talents and skills.

 
     I am going to provide quick analysis which hopefully will be helpful to you. Both of them have nearly the same tuition, so money does not have big impacts in this case. 


King’s College London: MA in International Management.
The Positive factors:

1. It is considered a prestigious university, which has been ranked 21th globally based on QS, whereas 36th according to TIMES. In the U.K., on the other hand, it has been classified 6th, behind Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, LSE, and UCL.

2. Its courses comprehends most sides of management, such as finance, marketing, and accounting, with several optional modules related to economy and human resource management.  

3. I have earned my bachelor’s degree is in business administration, so I have already previous knowledge and background about most these subjects and topics.

4. Living and studying in London is considered great and new experience.
             
The negative sides:

1. I have never lived in England, so I will face new challenges, such as adapting to new culture, people, and of course accent. 

2. Sometimes, I feel that I need to learn and study something different in what I was being taught during my undergraduate years.


George Mason University: MA in English, Linguistics. It is located in Fairfax, VA, the U.S.A.

The positive sides:

1. Since I started studying English as a second language in 2014 in the U.S., I have been fascinated by English grammar, structure, and words. Thus, I am excited to extend and enrich my background more deeply and academically, such as syntax, semantics, and morphology, especially I was good in these topics in my native language(Arabic) while studying in schools. 

2. I have been living in Washington/Northern Virginia for two years and a half in which I studied English and prepared for IELTS and GRE tests, so the city is very familiar to me. Moreover, I studied English at George Mason University in summer 2014, so I know the university, too.

The negative sides:

1. Because my English is my second language, I am thinking I would not probably have good job prospects if I decided to work as an editor, English teacher, or lexicographer because universities and companies prefer native English speakers.

2. Compared to King’s College London, GMU does not have either a well-known reputation or a high rank in the world, and even in the U.S, there are my many Americans who do not recognize it. It has been ranked 254th based on Times, while 652nd on QS. In addition, there are many students from my country studying in this university, generally international students, owing to flexible entry requirements, so graduating from it may not give me excellent credits.

117,"So, I recently added this guy on Facebook. He was cute, he smoked, and he was around my age and lived in my city. I've been single for about a year now and I'm looking to try and get back out there. I shot him a friend request, and to my surprise, he added and messaged me within 20 minutes. I was really excited. We talked, I started it out with some pretty great humour. We seemed to have a lot in common. We talked for about 4 days before we decided to meet up, which was yesterday. He said I was too good to be true and he had to know for himself. I had a bad feeling when I left the house that day, and it went justified. I had originally made plans with another friend on Sunday too, so I went to see that friend, but I ended up really late to our coffee date because buses didn't work out and got him a little upset that I pushed it until farther in the day. A communication error on my part. Then, we were trying to meet downtown and I had to walk from a really far distance so I was already late. Like REALLY late. Like blowing my phone up with ""where are you's?"" And frustrated texts. I finally got to a place called Metro and I let him know, he said let me call you a cab. I stubbornly refused, ""This is my fault, you're not paying for a cab."" And then tried to meet him at the nearest Tim Hortons. My phone ended up dying and I wasn't quite sure where I was, so I had to ask someone where the nearest Tims was and they pointed me in the opposite direction of where I'm supposed to go. My third hour of walking, I look like shit and probably smell like a dying animal and I get there only to find out it's the wrong one. No wonder it was so far. AND the Tim Hortons I got to didn't have an outlet. I had to go to a pizza store to charge my phone. When I turned it on he was flipping his lid, and told me straight up that I was making a horrible impression. That hit me a little. I tried explaining that I had no idea, and that I could come meet him. I had took the wrong turn at an intersection. He was pissed, I was embarassed. We finally meet, and I look like shit and am now not even close to confident after everything. We went back to his place and smoked, he was flirting with me, but I didn't flirt back because I didn't really feel sexy or anything. Plus I was super awkward, he was probably expecting this funny, outgoing chick, which I AM! But the whole say had made me feel gross and tired. We still talked a lot, and he bought me food and stuff. But I saw a status while I was at his place that he made that was about me being late, I brought it up. He said: ""Well, it's okay, I got food at least."" That REALLY hit. Now I just wanted to go home. So I left, he mentioned hanging out again within the first hour I got there but not closer to when I left but he did leave me with a big hug and said it was nice to meet me. I'm getting mixed signals and I don't know how to feel or what to do. Should I message him about it? I did apologize yesterday but I feel like even when I was over, I wasn't myself. I was so stiff and nervous. What do you think?",03Apr2017,2
121,"Background: I'm a 17 year old (18 this June) Singaporean with Systemic Lupus Erythromatosus. I'm currently in my final year of college, and am in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. 

Due to my medical condition, I am supposed to minimise stress levels so that my illness will not go active. Here's the issue. I have absolutely no interest in the subjects that I'm taking in school (namely, Physics/Maths/Chemistry/Economics/Literature) so naturally motivation isn't high. I'm not an exceptional performer either. The school places a lot of unnecessary stress on the students to perform well and also to go beyond what's required. The teachers also have high expectations and I feel really pressurised (not due to my performance relative to other students but because some of my teachers are really nice and I feel bad for being unable to meet their expectations). There is a work overload and constant deadlines that I have a lot of trouble meeting and keeping up with. There's hardly any free time for me to spend time resting or destressing. 

However, of course I need a certificate with somewhat decent grades so I can actually have a choice of what course and university I would like to attend in the future, especially since those are the years of education where I finally will have a chance to do what I love instead of being forced to take subjects I dislike. But sitting down and actually forcing myself to study all these things as of now seems extremely pointless and it really causes me stress and my disease is starting to flare up again. I know you can't always have your way in life, but I'm not sure what to do here. I definitely wouldn't sacrifice my health for 7 months of tedious and grueling studying because it wouldn't be worth it if I collapsed on the day of the exams. However it seems that I don't have a choice. I'm stuck in a dilemma here and I really have no clue on what to do. I don't want to ask anyone from Singapore because they're all so study-focused and prioritised that it's scary. Please help me.",03Apr2017,1
122,"Hey everyone! Thanks for stopping by. Brief rundown of events. Nov 2016 - waiting to merge onto a major freeway in my city. A car ahead of us (very typical on that ramp, sometimes 4 or 5 cars will be waiting) and we were at a dead stop for 2 min give or take a few seconds before an SUV plowed into the back of our car going 40mph. (Speed documented on the citation given to the person who hit us) I was a front seat passenger and was slightly leaning forward to pick up my phone off the floorboard when we were stuck. My seatbelt was on it because I was leaning forward the belt didn't retract and my face bounced off the dash pretty good. 

Had to go in ambulance to ER. Yadayadayada. I was wondering if anyone ever handled their own injury claim without an attorney and what the experience was like? I'm dealing with State Farm. The adjuster has been really nice and laid back about everything and I'm not trying to turn this into a lotto ticket like some people do. I came up with (in my opinion) a reasonable amount for pain and suffering plus medical bills. 

Submitted everything to her and she's been off the grid. Is this typical? Like a tactic? What would be a practical time to follow up? 30 days? Also all correspondence has been through email. 

Before I posted this I was considering sending  a certified more official demand letter, have it notarized to look cool, all that good stuff. She seemed really chill about the whole thing like with emailing everything and e planning my injuries treatments. I'm hoping that I didn't walk myself into a trap by doing that. 

Without a doubt a substantial amount of money could potentially have to be paid out by them but don't really want to mess with the courts and attorneys. I will if necessary. I just want me medical bills paid and compensation for my injuries which is about 20% lower than the averages I've been able to research on the internet. Just looking for some advice on how to navigate this. Also if I've made any mistakes or inform on mistakes people make in these processes. If any other information is needed please let me know.

125,"Hello, Redditors! I'm currently seeking some advice about a situation at my job. TL;DR at the end but i'd like it if you read the content to better understand the situation and provide reasonable solution :)

So here's the story, and I will start with a little bit of context. I have worked at Starbucks before. The Starbucks I started working at was corporate and so their training was very hands on and it taught me everything I know now about being a barista. I have had so much as a Shift Supervisor training on my last month before I was let go (for attendance...) but we had a process of doing things. From the time it takes to steam the milk for a cappuccino to filling up the ice container. So, I was just recently hired to work at a starbucks, one of many within the airport I am employed in. It was my first day last saturday and I want to start off by saying they treat their customers TERRIBLY! and the place is managed so terribly, I was cringing the minute I walked into this place. Going forward, they started training me.

They're training was so half-assed and every time the manager told me something, she would say it in air quotes as if it isn't that important. For example, she told me ""we have to make a fresh batch of Pike Place coffee every 15 minutes"" in said air quotes and in reality, we do have to do that. Apparently.... we don't do that in this store. We happily fake a smile and serve our customers 30 minute sometimes even hour old coffee. We don't actually brew more unless it's practically empty. Also, we steam the milk the same way for every drink. You want a cappuccino? You want a latte? Good luck telling the difference because we make every drink the same way! That's one of many :) like how one time somebody spilled coffee all over the ice and nobody accepted responsibility nor did they clean it up... THEY JUST SERVED IT RIGHT TO THE CUSTOMERS! 

Another great example? The ice isn't broken up. I mean AT ALL! We are LITERALLY serving people BLOCKS OF ICE in their drinks! I mean, what in the actual fuck is that!?!? In my previous starbucks, we had a metal scooper used to crush the ice and scoop it into our bucket. Instead, it was a tiny plastic scoop! It didn't crush the ice or anything, just picks up those blocks of ice that we intend to cheat our customers with... 

Finally, we had a customer come in. He looked exhausted and I can imagine he's had a long flight. My coworkers speak mostly spanish with me being the only bilingual there. So he comes to order and as I go to help him, my manager steps in to do it for me. I just think to myself, whatever I guess i'll go prepare to make his drink. As he is ordering, my manager gets a call and interrupts him mid-sentence saying ""hold one second"" and walks away to take the phone call. Meanwhile the guy looks at me and said ""Fuck this place, assholes"" and walks away clearly pissed. When my manager came back, she asked me where he went and after explaining it to her, her response was ""Eh, he'll be okay"" I mean, really?....really....

Guys, I have no idea what to do. This place is terrible and I don't want to give up and quit over this. I want to make an attempt at improving this shithole for some ACTUAL QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE! 

TL;DR Dirty Starbucks store, managers don't care, customer service sucks, but have to do things their way because job is a job.

PS: I spoke to my manager about maybe replacing the plastic scoop for a metal one (explaining to her the chunks of ice situation) and she told me to speak to the store manager. Spoke to the store manager, she told me we don't use metal scoops with no further information, just dismissing me with that answer. ",03Apr2017,7
127,"Hi reddit 
I am a 21 year old from the UK who has suffered from severe anxiety for most of my life and I have had multiple councillors but none of it has really helped with my big problem of fear of travelling and being away from home/a support network close by. Because of this anxiety I have had to move from a university 500 miles away, to one about an hour away from home. I have been living at university really successfully for the first time ever and my anxiety has been relatively chilled out for the first time in a long time. 
Anyways, in a bout of mad confidence I applied for a summer school in New York which I thought quite honestly I'd never get into. Then last week I get an email saying I've been accepted ! Here's where the need for advice begins. 
I told my mother and she says that I should go on the trip but not this year because she isn't sure that I will be ready in terms of being able to cope with 6 weeks of New York on my own (I've previously found cities and lots of people and travelling very difficult and often bail on plans). 
My Dad says that it's a waste of money and that I should focus on doing something better with my time. He also believes that I will say I'm going and then the day before, I will turn around and say that I'm not going. 
My conclusion is that I want to go and it's a dream come true that I got accepted and I want more than anything in the world to go, but I can't waste that kind of money if I do decide to turn around and say that I can't get over my anxiety. 
TL;DR  
Got accepted in to New York summer school which is a dream come true. Anxiety has limited my ability in the past to travel. Should I go or not? 

Thank you for your help. ",03Apr2017,1
128,"A little more explanation. My dad committed suicide almost about a year ago now. That means I now have a extremely high form of anxiety and on top of the hat, ADD, depression and very low self-esteem. I go to a highschool at the moment and I just turned 17.

I made a lot of very good friends in my class and I have never have a doubt about losing them, but it was hard for me to make them my friends. They started talking to me and then we became friends. I have a few (but good) friends on that highschool.

To be completely honest, I had a very easy start socializing because one of my best friend started in the same class which made me feel more safe and had mere ease talking to the other people in the class.

But since my dad died in the summerbreak up to my start on the school - i guess you could say: I had more than books in my backpack that first schoolday. I had a hard time following and catching up on school while still being diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADD and going to 2 separate psychiatrists every week.

There is now about 1 month till the exams start and I feel like I know enough to just pass, but I also know that if i end up passing next year of highschool will be a hell because I'll have to catch up and just pass that year aswell. I know that I will always be just a the start of my first lap when the others would have ran 2 laps by that time (kind of a shitty example but really hope you understand it)

So my school counselor invited me and mom to a kind of hearing and there she told me that about half of my teachers have had complaints about my assignments and in general my whole schooling time.

My thoughts on this is that I know im very anxious and has a hard time talking to completely new people - but thats really not the part i'm the most worried of.

Im worried that when I drop out (which is in about 20-25 days, because I will have to finish this month out to get my loan back and go to Spain with my Spanish class which my mom already paid for) I will end up setting alone in my room - with my thoughts, digging myself into a bigger and bigger hole.

The easy solution might (to normal people/people without anxiety in my grade) to just let it go. Drop out, enjoy my sparetime and start over next year.

But I know I'll end up sitting home all day - being too anxious to ask people to socialize with me - browsing instagram, reddit, facebook, youtube and other medias thousand times a day and completely lose my ability to make any social bonds.

Quite an important note: I have a girlfriend. She's awesome and she understand me as a person, but she lives 45 miles (71 km) away from me and goes to a boarding school which means she does not have sparetime to use on me other than a couple of hours in the night where we regularly do skype sessions to catch up. She's the love of my life and she most likely **saved my life.**

Another extremely important note: Im not going to lie. I am suicidal and I have been for the past 2,5-3 months - not because I dont want to live this beautiful life and make more friends, but because my brain is completely filled with useless crap, diagnoses, low self-esteem and non-motivational thoughts. I have tried over the past couple of months to meditate, free my mind from negative thoughts, taking advice from online motivational speakers like Koi Fresco (important guy, go check him out!) and other people but this hasn't helped anything since my biggest worry is that I will end up in the a big hole that I will never be able to free myself from when dropping out.

I'm sorry for making this so long but I don't where to go anymore. This is my last shout for help. Anxiety diagnosed or not. I have never needed a helping advice like right now in my life.

Thanks Reddit.",03Apr2017,1
130,"I used to get these exclusively on instagram, but even then, I only received requests MAYBE once a month or so. Now, not only do I get friend requests from these accounts on facebook, but they are coming in droves. I get them more like once a day on instagram, and up to 1 - 4 times a day on facebook. It's a minor nuisance, but it's still a nuisance and I would like to know if there is a way to reduce or eliminate these types of invites.

133,"My housing contract runs out on the 1st July, and I have no option of renewing it. I had intended to live with my partner, but he's now going to be living abroad next year, so I'm needing to find somewhere to live by myself again. I have two options of cities I can live in, but I'm struggling to decide where would be better for me to live.

**City 1:**

* Have lived here for four years already, and have a fairly established friendship group here (though none of them are options to live with)
* Exceptionally pretty
* Very small - can be very insular and 'bubble-like'
* Need to commute to university once/twice a week, which takes around 10-15 minutes on the train
* Extremely safe 
* Very familiar environment to me

**City 2:**

* My university city, so potentially less of a commute needed to get into the office when I need to
* Much larger, though somewhat less attractive a living environment (certainly not unpleasant, though)
* I know very few people there outside of my colleagues
* I know the city centre fairly well, but very little about the outskirts, which is likely where I'd end up living
* Much more going on in the city

Living costs in each one are about the same, and the chances are that I'd need to share with strangers wherever I ended up, which is far from ideal. I'm a PhD student, so I don't have a huge amount of disposable income, but enough to get by fairly comfortably. I rely on public transport/walking to get around. Both cities are in the North East of England.

136,"Sorry in advance for any grammar mistakes. English is not my first language. I'm an international student in the USA.

I went to this public speaking group in January by recommendation. It seemed good to learn some skill since I'm very introverted person. 

It was a great experience and I was invited to join a few members for dinner. There were 2 others girls, this old man (Let's called him Robert) and I. During the friendly conversation, I noticed that the man couldn't help, but makes lots of eye contact with me while talking. As usual, the dating scene was one of the topics and I mentioned I prefer introverted than extroverted guys, but that I always end up dating people from the second group. So Robert mentioned he was introverted and started talking about how low key he was. Later, my friend asked him to take a picture of us in her phone. He also took a picture with his phone. Dinner ends, he offered to pay the wine they shared and my dinner - I wasn't hungry, so I just ordered some fries. Different from other times, I felt umconfortable when he did that. Something on him was bothering me A LOT.

We all had to take public transportation to go home, so we all went to the train station together. I tried to avoid talking only with him, but at some point, my friend was walking a few steps in front of me, the other girl a bit behind talking on the phone, when Robert approached. He got  very close and said that ""we should get together sometime soon"". Since English is not my first language, I pretended I didn't understand and said that would be nice to hang out with the group again. My friend heard and completed: ""yes, you can join us any time."" He got even closer: ""you know what I mean - only you and I"" giving me a creepy smile. I was already umconfortable since dinner and then this was happening to make me feel way more weird about it. I politely declined saying I had broke up with my boyfriend recently (Which it was true back in January) and didn't want to go out. Apparently, he understood and we move on. 

Detail: I'm in my 30's whereas Robert is in his 60's. 

I hate the way he made feel and I never showed up again. 

A week ago, my friend who is my classmate, invited me to go again because she'd be giving a speech on Thursday. Robert was there. He also gave a speech and he did very well. 

This time I was invited to join the group as an official member and fill out a form with my info to be able to receive the material via mail and pay the membership by email. And guess what? This was Robert's role! I hesitate three times before I filled out the papers with my FULL NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL. I should have follow my gut feelings. 

We all went out again after the meeting, this time in a bigger group. I forgot to get a straw and when I came back, Robert had sat on my place and the only seat left was next to him, but I need to say he didn't know I was sitting there before. Several times, Robert tried to keep in a conversation with me. My friend was in front of me but engaged talking with the girl next to her. The only thing he mentioned from that night, it was the picture he had of my friend and I and never had the opportunity to send it to me. I said it was okay and started eating to avoid giving him the chance to ask my contact. Night ends, phew, nothing weird. BUT he still had my personal info from the membership form. That bugged the whole night. I couldn't sleep thinking he would contact me using that information. I had the feeling.

Again,  I was right. On Friday, despite of sending me the invoice by email, he asked me out ""to grab a coffee or a glass of wine"". It pissed me off. He had no right of using it in his favor. I told my friend and she said she would talk to him ""in the future"",  waiting this cool down since it was a frail subject. I don't think she got how wrong is that. She said she had hung out with him before because Robert wanted to practice his Spanish - the group is bilingual and my friend is from Venezuela. So she thinks it might be the case.  (Despite of speaking Spanish, I'm a Portuguese native speaker). Talking to her made me feel even more furious.

Later, he added on Google+ and I blocked him. Then yesterday (Sunday) he sent me a remind of the invoice where I noticed ANOTHER email of mine in CC. He also asked if that email was correct and just in case he was cc'ing the other one that my friend has. I was shocked. He got an even more personal email! I guess he asked if it was correct because I ignored the invitation to go out. Right away, I asked my friend why she gave him my other email. She said that was back in January when he asked to send the photo he took of us. 

I've decided that I will no longer join the group, even if that would be a good thing in the future. I'm afraid of him with all my information. 

Now, the invoice email has few other emails in CC from people in charge of members and different roles. At the same time I want to letting them know why I decided not to join it, I'm afraid of Robert. 

I have no idea WHY he thought I'd go out with him since he's way older than me and why he thought it was okay using an information I DID NOT GIVE TO HIM to ask me out. 

Am I overreacting? Should I let other people in charge know the reason I'll decline the membership? What should I do? ",03Apr2017,32

145,"**Sorry for the wall of text, but this is a health issue and I need to provide context.** 

Okay, so over the course of the last month I noticed some really infrequent and odd fumes appear. It turns out it was coming through my bathroom vent (didn't know that at the time). It was rare because it only happens when my neighbor is running HER vent, and only when her house is filled with the chemical fumes; which only happens after I run my dryer.

My neighbor thought it was me putting chemicals into the dryer, because she was having fume issues when I ran it. She was getting headaches and such, so she sent me a note. When I got the note, I went upstairs to her place and her ENTIRE UNIT was flooded with chemicals. I was baffled that she could only smell it near the dryer (which is directly above mine). Apparently everyone elses' sense of smell is useless. Maintenance didn't seem to catch on either and insinuated I might just be smelling bathroom odors. Which, if it was bathroom odors, would have a *bad* smell. This was a distinct smell; it was like a factory chemical mixed with a dampness ""musk.""

At this point it seemed likely to be a venting issue, or in her mind an insulation issue (insulation heating up from the dryer running). Maintenance came and ""moved some insulation away from the vents"" and said to carry on normally.

I recommended to my neighbor that we call a public agency of some sort. Not sure who I would call, but I assumed some agency out there could deal with this (if anyone knows, please mention who that might be). But now we get into political bullshit. My neighbor (the one bathed in the chemicals, about 50x worse than anything in my unit) said ""Well, if we do that it might hurt the resell value of the units.

I couldn't care less about that if my health is at stake. No clue why she would care, either, considering her health bills would be far worse than the housing value.

Anyway, she also said that dealing with the condo association and board members is a touchy subject. And that if you approach them saying anything about ""toxins"" or whatnot, they'll get all defensive and argumentative over blame shifting and stupid shit rather than just solve the problem.

I contacted my condo association to forward me the emails of the board members so I could address them. Her response? ""Since they're voluntary, we don't give out the emails. We'll forward along your inquiry though."" (Is that even legal?)

Me: ""Sure. Let them know this is MomsLinguini, and I'd like to have their emails.""

That was two days ago. Zero response so far.

So here I am dealing with idiots. I have fumes in my house when I run the dryer. I want that resolved. It should be as easy as hiring a professional to look into it, identifying the problem, and implementing a solution. SOMEHOW, it isn't. It's political, blame-shifting BS that I want nothing to do with.

My first course of action is going to be attempting to work with the board when I get their emails or end up knocking on doors to figure out who it is because the condo association sucks.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, particularly in figuring out what public agency I should be contacting about this. Thank you.",03Apr2017,2
146,"I'm a 19 year old college student, currently living at home. Originally, I wanted to go to a university after graduation, but my parents made great attempts to stop that, not helping me with entrance fees, or filling out financial aid forms. Both my parents drink, and are very belligerent. I don't think it's entirely necessary to go into detail, but police have been called to my house many times. At this point, I'm currently attending a local community college studying CE, but I don't feel passionate about it at all, and only did it to appease my dad, and get some financial help from them. My long time friend of 5 years is offering me a place to stay with him and his mom, helping a little bit with rent. The stress of living at home is dragging me down heavily, and I've been struggling with depression and anxiety, having been diagnosed when I was about 14. I feel like moving out, even if it means dropping out of college for a while and working would do a lot better for me as a person then dragging myself through college in a chaotic and unsupportive household.

I have a performance review coming up. I was given a challenging, multifaceted technical task to work solo, that I exceeded all expectations performing. I am concerned my boss will trivialize the task because of my easy success. I would like to leverage the impact of this task completion, to solidify my repuation rather than allow my boss to find a way to couch this as a simple task that was beneath me. 

There was no opportunity to delegate because the no one on the team had the skills or experience to contribute. I managed all the requirements, design, validation, and chaired the reviews.

I completed the task ahead of schedule with first pass success due to planning, and having the resources to do the job right. However, I am concerned that my careful planning an execution will not be recognized because the manager didn't witness it.

160," I recently had an altercation with my Dad's wife (or ""stepmother""). It all started with washing my hands. It may seem like a stupid reason, yes, but this was just a trigger for the underlying problems in the house. 


I'm an 18-year-old female, and I live with my Dad and his wife. They have been married for about a year now. I had major problems with my real mother during her divorce with my dad, and I ended up staying with him. My relationship with my mother is broken after the things she has done. (screwed my credit up, passive aggressiveness, overly emotional,  manipulative and in general just neglectful towards my siblings and I). The only times she will text me at is about my brother and youngest sister whenever they come over here (non-custodial shared parenting) to get something that she wants. I have three siblings; my youngest sister (5), my brother (14) and my sister (20). My two youngest siblings live with my real mother. My older sister is married and lives in an apartment temporarily. She takes distasteful advantage of the bias in the US child support system and it has caused lots of issues (psychologically, mentally and legally) with everyone involved. The issues caused by my mother most certainly tie in with the fiasco that happened yesterday.

My dad and I previously lived alone in a small rented home with plans to buy a house in the near future after he was able to clean his poor credit (caused by my real mother...). My siblings would *mostly* come over during the allowed periods of visitation as well as the his then-girlfriend (now stepmother) along with her daughter. They sought for marriage, but initially planned to wait to move in with each other until bigger house could be found. Conversely, they moved in just a few months after he rented the place. We now have a problem with space and other issues...

Fast forward a year later and things are going *relatively* smooth. However, a major problem that really impacts decisions in the house is her **personality**. She's over-controlling, volatile, rash and makes the most *trivial* things a serious situation until she achieves the results that *she* wants. It is a problem I have discussed with my dad before and he actually **acknowledges** this, but justifies it by saying ""she's just a **strong black woman**, you can't change her!"". 

I want to clarify however, that she indeed *does* pay some of the bills, and I am never really prompted to pay rent but only things like gas, car insurance, food and house items. I understand that with a quick glance this just seems like a typical 'you're 18 now, my rules or get out !!"" situation, but I want you to realize that I am the least disrespectful person you'll ever meet. If I'm told to take out the trash or wipe down the counters after I cook something and forget to clean it, I will do it. 

**Recently** though, I found one of her demands unreasonable for the *second* time ever. My dad made some food (partially using the things I bought I will tell you) and I went to grab a plate and fork. I opened the rice cooker and forked out some rice on plate, when suddenly from behind I hear ""**Are you going to wash your hands before you touch *my* food?**"". I was *genuinely* confused because I was never asked of this before and explained to her that I had only used my fork to get the food and washed my hands just prior of getting ready to eat. My hands weren't anywhere unreasonable, I explained. She previously complained of running out of soap, and I brought this to light as well. I didn't say it with an *attitude*, I noted these things in a very de facto manner as I would do to my father, a coworker or any other adult. I've never encountered this situation in like before, but any other person that I've met before would just be like ""Oh, I see where you're coming from."" Apparently she took offense to this, and started throwing ad hominems left and right like ""You're dirty, you don't wash yourself, you're a child!"". She was in general being condescending. I don't deal with these people often, and I had no clue how to handle it but refute the attacks on me. She called me disrespectful, a *bitch* and all sorts.I'm not overly sensitive, and just thought the situation was bizarre to the point that I couldn't take it very seriously, so I sat down and started eating my food. She claimed that I couldn't sit on the couch (which my dad bought) to eat, and I couldn't eat the rice that I BOUGHT. I told this to her and it went haywire.

She walked across the room into my room and started to *toss my clothes out the door*.  She cut my ethernet cable with a KNIFE. At this point, I was extremely pissed. I walked in my room and went to grab my stuff from her with no *zero* intention to fight. I have never struck a single person in my *life*, but I felt like it was going to happen at this moment. Being the adult she is, she moved closer to me and told me to back away (what??). I stood my ground and asked her to calm down and put my stuff down. I asked her to soul search the reasons for acting this way and she rebutted this. I said how I really felt, that I couldn't *respect* you if you're behaving this way. My brother witnessed all of this and tried to get between us to stop the physical quarrel. She then proceeded to grab a **knife** and told him to back away. She called the cops and victimized herself, claiming things over the phone that never happened (I swung at her, my brother cracked his knuckles, all sorts of bs.)

The cop that arrived was completely biased. I told him everything that happened, and do you know what he said about this?

 ""I get where you're coming from, but she's just a **strong black woman!**""

She reminds me of how my **birth mother** would act in a disaster like this, bringing cops into such a dumb situation and use the victim card of being an emotional black woman. She'll act this way periodically towards my younger brother, my father and even her daughter.  For example, just a day prior, we had planned to go to the beach with my sister and brother and everyone was in a good mood. We ended up not going because **she didn't get the seat she wanted in the truck**. Quite a few times my dad will sleep in the living room because of the ridiculous things like this. 

My dad wasn't there at the beginning of the fiasco, but him being the only voice of reason (of course) he had to get through to her to calm down. She apologized for acting this way and they both told me supportful things, but I don't know If it was entirely sincere and if want to deal with this again. Its daisy and rainbows for them, but I witnessed this sort of behavior between my father and my birth mother. My 100ft ethernet cable was cut, my clothes was dirtied. I'm still skeptical of the entire thing. 

Just this morning I received a text from my birth mother and older sister that I could stay with either of them.  My birth mother lives in a very shoddy apartment in which she smokes as well. I'm 100% not planning on living with her habits of forcing money out of close ones, and general manipulative nature. My sister displays some of the same traits and she lives very far away. There is a college campus for my school there and they said they could get me a job on the military base, but I'm unsure if this is just the manipulative attitude she has sometimes. This is a very drastic change for me as well. 

It's getting harder and harder to tell who's worst, honestly. I don't want to take away my dad's happiness with his wife, but it was honestly a lot better before she came into the picture. Living alone is the ultimate solution to all of this, but as an 18 year-old trying to finish college (that I'm paying for) and with a job paying minimum wage, it just seems like a shitty fix to this. I'm a freshman majoring in CompSci, and I often wonder if college is still worth it in the situation I'm in. I'm not sure what I want to do.

170,"I'm an 18 year old man, and I weigh 235 pounds at 5'5"". Until recently, I've lived an entirely sedentary lifestyle, in a house filled with smokers. I've eaten shitty foods for most of my life, but it got out of hand when I was given over $500 in Christmas and birthday money. I started going to a nearby dollar store and getting bags filled with junk food. At least two times a week, I got a new set of candy, sweets, and chips. This lasted for about three months before I realized that I had spent over $100 dollars at this place. Thankfully, it didn't seem to really affect my weight, at most going up to 10 pounds (I upgraded my scale just about two weeks ago from an old one that seemed to be inaccurate), but I knew eating junk food all the time was doing no good for my health, especially with my already abysmal lifestyle and living conditions.

So, what I've done to take steps towards improving my health are as followed:

1. Ending my addiction to junk food by going cold turkey until I can get to a point where eating some bad things won't throw me back into an addiction. I did this with soda many years ago, and I'm to the point that the amount of it I drink is AT MOST five times a year. If I can do that with pop, I can do that with junk food.
2. Walking for one hour every single day (plus 30 more minutes when I start walking my dogs each for 15 minutes). Eventually, I want to incorporate a little running, like maybe twice per week. I also at some point want to mix this up with other exercises like push ups or dumbbell exercises. I don't know how to create routine for myself just yet, so I'm just sticking with walking for now.
3. Drinking at least 50 ounces of water. Water is the only thing I regularly drink, so this isn't particularly difficult. I'm just making a note of it because I know adequate hydration is vital towards being healthy.
3. Eating 1 banana, 1-2 scrambled eggs, 1 PB&amp;J wheat bread sandwich, a half of a small bag of boiled broccoli cuts, and whatever is for dinner each night. I feel eggs, bananas, and broccoli are a good start towards eating a healthier diet. I honestly don't think PB&amp;J sandwiches are a good part of that list, but it does satisfy my sweet tooth a bit, and it's better for me than the alternative. Still, I might want to stop eating them at some point, but I'm not sure if it's necessary.

This is what I've done so far. Other things I want to do are taking steps to improve my posture and working out a good sleep schedule. Is there anything else I can do to change my lifestyle for the better. Maybe different foods to eat, or exercises to do, or what have you. Please let me know what else I can do. Thanks!",03Apr2017,1

176,"Throw away account, for obvious reasons. This might get lengthy so I'll try to be concise. 43(f) Recently I've come to realize that people just don't really like me. The only time my phone ever rings is when my mom calls me, which isn't often. I don't have any close friends. I get unfriended on Facebook often. My brother doesn't speak to me. My dad doesn't speak to me. My in-laws avoid me, except for my MIL who loves me. I've always been called ""outspoken"" but now I am realizing that just seems to be a code word for bitch. 

I'm always honest, I never lie. If someone asks me what I think, I tell the truth and I try to do it in a nice way if I think the truth might be hurtful. I feel strongly about political issues and if a topic is brought up that is important to me, I tend to not let things go and keep arguing until I feel my point has been made. I don't need for people to agree with me, but I hate it when people make uninformed statements and I try to inform them with facts, which I guess makes me come off as condescending.

So over the weekend my husband (married 3 years) and I were talking about his sister, who absolutely despises me and has done some really hateful things to me. She is a bully and everyone is afraid of her. He ended up telling me that the reason she and I don't get along is because we are just alike. It made me sick to my stomach to have him say that I am like someone who is the meanest person I have ever met. I never, ever want people to think of me that way. He then went on to say that I'm not mean, I just come off that way, and the same is true for her.  He told me I am too outspoken and it comes off badly to people. He said a lot of times he doesn't even want to talk to me because I'm too opinionated and it's not worth it. I asked him is this why none of his friends like me and never come over and he said he doesn't know but I think he just said that to try to spare my feelings.

I feel like I got kicked in the gut. I feel so misunderstood and like I can never be myself and I have to tiptoe around people now for fear that my ""outspokenness"" will make them not like me. I spent most of yesterday thinking that my husband would be happier if he were with someone who his friends and family (and he) liked, instead of me. I wondered last night if I could get the gun out of the drawer without waking him up so I could just blow my head off and be done with it. I don't intend to kill myself, but I have been thinking a lot that he would be happier without me. I think he made a huge mistake marrying me (we got married after dating 3 months). Often I feel like there's nothing wrong with me at all - I am just surrounding myself with the wrong people. My husband, his friends, his family are all staunch conservatives and I am a die hard liberal. We live in a small, conservative mid-western town and I just don't fit here. Or maybe I'm just a bitch and it would be the same anywhere. I don't know.

I'm sure everyone is going to answer ""seek therapy."" I'm sure I need to but I don't want to. My experience with therapy to date has been that it's a bit of a joke. 

I've always been the ""strong independent"" woman and now I feel like I'm crumbling. Am I a bad person? Or am I just surrounded by the wrong people?

185,"For a couple years, someone has used my email address without my permission to sign up for websites and mailing lists. This was relatively infrequent, so I just unsubscribed or refused to verify, deleted the emails, and went on with my life.

The frequency of these emails increased sharply this weekend. Whoever's using my address signed up for dozens of sites and mailing lists. I've continued to unsubscribe and refuse to verify, but it's coming at a much higher clip now.

I know that I cannot prevent someone from providing my email address as their own, just as I couldn't keep people from giving out my phone number. I've carefully monitored the activity on my email account--which is also protected by two-factor authentication--and I've seen no suspicious activity. This is a pain in my ass, but doesn't seem to be a threat to my security right now.

These signups have consistently used the same name. Until today, that name was all I had to identify my mysterious benefactor, but that just changed. They used my email address in a form, along with their full name, a street address (in a different US state from where I live), and a phone number. These were all emailed to me. I now have what is ostensibly my mysterious benefactor's contact information.

**I do not want to harass this person.** I know this seems like a great opportunity for pranks or payback, but I am 0% interested in that. I would, however, like to use this information intelligently in order to stop the usage of my email address without my permission.

On the other hand, **I don't want to make myself more vulnerable.** The information could be bogus. Alternatively, I'm concerned that if I use it to contact this person, it will confirm that they've ""got a live one"" and encourage them to pick up the pace or make more targeted attempts on my inbox.

To give you a good idea of who I am/what I do (in order for me to further explain my worries), here is a list of bullet points:

*I am 15

*I have social anxiety (whether or not I have social anxiety disorder I don't know). I get anxious talking to new people, and even nervous with friends. Fairly self-conscious

*I'm interested in art, piano, programming, CGI and animation, video game development, and gaming. These are my hobbies.

*I live in the middle of nowhere in the country. This year and a few previous years I've gone to a private school an hour or so away from where I live. I have two or three friends that I only see at school, but after this year all my classes will be online. I'm not very close to any of my friends anyway, so emotionally this isn't too big a deal. However, social interaction and friendships will be fairly limited.

*I have straight As in all my classes and I have four years experience in Spanish.

*I would like to be a professional game developer at some point in the future.


Alright, so that should give a fair idea of what I'm like. Now, here's what I'm struggling with: I've lost motivation to really do anything, and my priorities are so out of place that I am constantly anxious about schoolwork and other commitments.

I'll start by explaining the motivation part. A year or so ago, I started working on attempting to make my first indie video game. Yes, I was fourteen and fairly new to the game development scene. At this point I had already studied programming, theory, level design, 3D art, and the game engine I was using for 2 years. I had other friends my age who were doing the same (fastforward to now, two of the friends who are both 15 now and who started learning the same time I did finished multiple projects, getting several million views, attention from large YouTubers such as Markiplier and PewDiePie, and several thousand dollars in revenue). I had been saving money for about a year or so, and was able to buy a high-power computer and rougly $300 for voice acting, character design, and some props for the game (I'm not a great artist, and while I hope to be eventually, I've resorted to buying premade props online instead of attempting to make them myself). I spent months and months on the game, and what did I get finished? I made a tiny house with nothing else. Kept forcing myself to work, and a year had passed now. I had made so many things and restarted from scratch out of frustration at this point that I had nothing to show for. $2000+ spent, a year of my life, and no progress (as I said earlier, multiple friends already finished several of their projects while I spent the entire year struggling to make progress with mine). Maybe it was just that specific project, so I came up with different ideas and tried working on other projects. I went through literally over 60 projects (I still have the files for each one cluttering up my desktop), and I have yet to finish anything. You see, I'm not a very structured person. I come up with a simple idea and I try to build off of it. Here's my thought process (exaggerated a bit to help you get the idea) with one of my actual projects:

*I'm sitting down and I randomly get an idea
""Hey, I'm going to make a game where you play as a ball because I don't know!""
*I open up the editor, make a fully controlable ball. You drag the mouse around and the ball rolls in the mouse's direction
""Okay, cool! Now what? I guess I'll make this a platformer. OH! You can rotate the platforms in 3D space! That sounds cool. So you can rotate a platform to make a ramp, or to use it as a bridge, etc.""
*I program that and get it working. Now it's time for designing the first level
""Uh, I guess I'll just put a platform here... and one here... and then the player will go around in a circle like this... then they have to make a ramp and roll up it to get to this platform over here... then they go through a tube I guess... and then they're done!""
*I do that, and go on to the second level
""Okay.. uhh.. I need some new gameplay elements now, so both levels aren't 100% the same... hmm...""
*I sit down for multiple hours trying to come up with ideas
""OH GOD, I JUST STARTED THIS AND I ALREADY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO NEXT. WTF AM I DOING, WHY DO I EVEN TRY. I'M WORTHLESS.""

At this point, I shove the project aside. This process repeats for each and every one of the 60 projects. At this point, it's affected me so negatively that I've really lost motivation to do anything productive. I sat down at the piano and began trying to learn a song. Within minutes, I'm saying to myself, ""you know you can't play piano right? You can't read sheet music. You've never even taken lessons, you just went out and got a piano before even knowing how to play it. You're not good. Don't pretend like you can ACTUALLY learn this song. You can't."" The first ten times or so, I pushed on and sat down for hours a day trying to learn a single song. I got down a chord or two after a few weeks, and at that point progress was so slow that I gave up. Now, I don't even want to touch the piano, or open up my game development software. I haven't lost interest, just motivation. I don't like anything I make or do anymore - I practice drawing and I look at my artwork like it's blasphemy. I've had others look at my work - artwork and game development (even though I've never finished a game project and all others have seen is just half-baked proof of concepts, prototypes, and level design ideas) - and seem amazed, tell me I'm talented, and seem genuinely impressed. I wish I could say it actually meant something to me though. People compliment my work, I let out a sigh and a ""thanks :/"" and never think about it again. I don't get what they see in my work. In my eyes, it's garbage. It is literally garbage. It's an insult to people who actually have talent, and I will never be able to make anything like I hope to be able to make. So when someone compliments my work, I take it very lightly and just brush it off. It's not that I want to. I wish compliments meant more to me, but it's just so easy to disregard.

Now for the second and probably more serious issue: discipline and getting my priorities straight. Here's the thing: I live in the middle of nowhere. Closest friend lives an hour away, so I don't get out much. I don't care about sports or anything, so I spend almost all my time on the computer. Why wouldn't I? It's got gaming, I can communicate with friends, I've got 3D AND 2D art software, video game development software, Reddit... there's always something to do. That's the problem though. I never get bored of it because there's always something I can be doing on it. Admittedly I spend most of my time playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (in my defense, it's an eSport. Others enjoy baseball, soccer, or football. I enjoy CSGO.) - on weekdays, I usually play for anywhere from 4-7 hours a day, and literally all day on weekends. I didn't play nearly as much before I lost motivation in game development, animation, and piano, but I still spent as much time on the computer - just not gaming.
So even when I'm not gaming, I get behind in homework, piano practice, etc. because I'm browsing Reddit, or talking to friends, or watching YouTube, or messing around with software. So, for instance, I'm not playing CSGO, but I REALLY don't feel like reading those two chapters in English. Eh, I'll get to that.. at some point... I proceed to spend hours googling random crap, watching random YouTube videos, and just messing around on my computer, not even entirely sure what I'm doing. Just wasting time. I kid you not, I started taking piano classes a few months ago. Three weeks in, I just didn't like having a dedicated time I had to leave to go practice piano every week. Weeks would go by and, because of the issue I just mentioned, no practice would be done. Piano instructor would tell me I've made no progress, I get overwhelmed, and I eventually cancelled the class because of it. I also have interest in drawing, but I only ever practice at school, because every second I CAN be working/playing on the computer, I am.

Obviously, I'm sure I sound like a stereotypical gamer or computer-obsessed 2017 teenager, but this is a serious issue for me and I want to get my life back on track. I've gotten so disappointed and overwhelmed and, as much as I hate to say it, depressed these past few years and I can't bear to imagine where I'll end up if this continues.
I've had people say to cut out gaming (and even just computers in general) from my life, but that's not what I want. It's a hobby, and a passion, just like sports for some people. I've just gone too far with it and I don't know how to fix this. I feel lost.

I would love any advice I could get. I've debated whether or not I would post about this for a few months, because I don't want people to see the ""I'm 15"" part and immediately disregard me as one of those depressed angsty/nihilistic teens and be like ""it's hormones, you'll get over it."" This isn't teen angst or anything like that - I think this is just a very serious problem in my life and feeling depressed and anxious about it is reasonable and understandable. I have a tendency to ramble, and I have been writing this for over an hour at this point, so please bear that in mind lol. I'll get up in the morning when I'm less tired and read back through this and revise it to make it easier to read and less repetitive. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this mammoth of a post, I appreciate it!

tl;dr I have issues staying motivated with things and I spend WAY too much time on the computer (because all my hobbies/passions involve computers anyway, and I have no friends that live anywhere close to me, so I rarely get out of the house), which gets in the way of homework and non-computer-related hobbies. I never get bored of the computer, so I'm constantly on it, when I could (and should) be practicing piano/art/homework instead - I'm on it every chance I can be, which means I don't give myself time for anything else.",03Apr2017,0

194,"Hi all, 
So forgive me if I'm being paranoid, but I feel like something's a little strange about my experience today, and I wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar or has any advice.  So I went to my dentist today for a routine cleaning, and the assistant sees me, cleans out my teeth, and says everything's good except you need to floss a little bit better, shows me how, and so far, so good.  So before I can leave, she wants to have a dentist take a look (they always do this), so he comes in, looks, and tells me I have some serious issues and I don't floss (even though I do), when the assistant just told me differently and he leaves without telling me what I need to do to fix them.  So that's weird, but as I'm leaving, the assistant goes by the way, you have three cavities that need to be filled within the next six months, and she seemed really nervous about telling me.  

There have been some experiences in the past that have caused me to question this place, as it seems they do some shady things. 

1.)   I know a person who had a crown put on, and after the procedure, couldn't close his mouth correctly.  He went back to the place 3-4 times, and every time they told him that it was put correctly on, until another dentist at the same place offered to fix it free of charge, and was really mad about it.  It seems like they put it on wrong, and were trying to hide it.  Eventually he switched places and was basically told it was put on wrong (although the new dentist didn't explicitly say this to avoid liability).

2.)  This same person had a son who was getting some dental work done, and the dentist took him outside, so his son couldn't hear, and said he needed braces (which was already known).  He then said they could put the braces on for much cheaper than an orthodontist, which was fishy because they are not licensed to do that.  

3.)  I had another friend who needed to get his wisdom teeth out, and they were pushing for them to pull them out right there in the office.  That is strange because people normally go to an oral surgeon to do that.  

So this is all leading me to suspect that they made up the fact I have three cavities (I've never had any before), the assistant was nervous about it because she knew she was lying, and they of course want to bill me for it.  I was thinking about going to another dentist soon, not mentioning the cavities, and seeing if they notice them.  Thoughts?",03Apr2017,1
195,"TL;DR: Mechanical Engineering major who hates his classes, feels like a failure to my family for not being able to understand topics even with help. Want to switch majors and focus on hobbies to benefit my hatred for myself and current position on life, but am to afraid to speak with my family about it.

I am currently a mechanical engineer at my university at the age of 19. I am coming to the end of my second semester and feel absolutely no motivation to continue to pursue this degree. I have little time for friends, family, or hobbies to de-stress from my class work. I felt obligated to take this path since my dad got an electrical engineering degree and he pushed me to go through the STEM academy at my high school. My GPA was a 3.0 at the end of last semester and it looks like it is going to drop from my current grades.

I do everything I can to get help in most of my courses and yet I still find myself struggling on tests. My overall conceptual knowledge of the topics make sense but when it comes to the computations, I have no idea what I am doing. I go to study groups and ask help from friends who are taking the same classes and they explain everything just fine, but I fail to understand when doing the computations like stated before. 

I feel like such a failure because I have two little siblings that want to be like me (they are 11 and 9), and if I don't become an engineer I feel like a failed as an older brother. I feel like I failed as a son to my dad since I don't want to be an engineer anymore and he always made me believe I can do anything. I just hate going to class and struggling day in and day out and still learn nothing even with help.

I want to start focusing on my hobbies while doing something not as hard at my university. My back up major would be a BA in mathematics and then being able to teach that later. Mathematics has come natural and that is so much easier than my engineering classes (btw I'm in calculus 2 which is known for being one of the hardest calculus courses).

200,"Apologize in advance for the length of this post.

We've been struggling financially for right at 12 mos now. Our household consists of myself, my fiancé &amp; my 62 yr old mother.  She lost her job a year ago last month, and has been unable to find another job since. She finally resigned herself to retirement and her SS benefits are less than 20% of the monthly income she made working. We ended up being evicted in Nov, when the landlord didn't want to fix a ceiling that collapsed. We were technically homeless for about 3 wks, staying in a motel 6  until we found a place Xmas week. Fiancé lost his job Jan 31. We scraped by for Feb &amp; March, but this month, we can't swing rent. 

Fiancé got a new job offer, but it's out of state. When the hiring company initially contacted him, it was stated relocation assistance was offered. When he got his offer letter today, no relo assistance was included in his compensation package. While, of course, he is trying to get ahold of the hiring manager to see what is up, we're scrambling to come up with back up plans on how to make an interstate move happen with no current income, no savings, a housing shortage in the area we are moving to, breed specific legislation not being uncommon in the area &amp; having a ""pit bull type"" dog. (Getting rid of the pittie isn't an option; not looking for critique or anything on that, please.) Our savings have been completely depleted, as he lost his job on Jan 31, and was denied unemployment. We were also denied SNAP benefits &amp; all other assistance we've applied for. 

His anticipated start date is April 10; I tried a GoFundMe when we were homeless a few months ago and had zero success; I don't have many friends to share it on social media or anything. 

We've got a chance to get on our feet &amp; get a fresh start, but as of right now, we can't take advantage because we're too broke. Maybe it's just me, but it kills me that the chance we need maybe have to be passed up because we need it too much financially.

I'm overwhelmed with the whole situation... It's hard to look for a place to when you don't know when/if you'll be able to come up with the $$ to cover deposit, etc. If we don't find a way to swing this by Friday, the fiancé plans to rescind his acceptance and we'll all end up under an overpass. After all my mom has done for me, for my family, I can't let that happen to her.

204,"This has been an ongoing problem, but I feel like it's coming to a head, especially because it seems to just *keep happening*.

I have a friend at work that I eat lunch with.  She's very lively as long as we're talking about her, or her cat, or her video games.  If I mention something that has happened in my life, she will literally just stop talking.  She'll stare at me and maybe nod, but the conversation grinds to a halt.  We'll eat in silence for a few seconds until she talks about herself again, or until I ask about her.

I went out with a different friend on Sunday, a friend who I've been close to for literally 15 years.  She doesn't ever really ask about anyone else's life or how they're doing, she just starts talking and keeps going.  If you tell her anything about herself, she will respond with a few words (""Oh that's cool"") and then a couple of nods, but the second you stop telling her anything she will bring the conversation back to herself or a mutual interest.  She will write to me to vent about relationship issues for hours, but if I give her a basic update of something important to me, it's barely worth noting.

Then I went home to visit my family.  My conversations with my brother are literally just him letting out a litany of never-ending jokes (he's an amateur stand-up comic) to see how we react.  If I try to joke back with him, he doesn't laugh or usually react beyond a 'hm' before he lets out another joke.  If I try to tell him a story or let him know something I did, he'll often go 'hm' and pull out his phone to look at it instead of me.  He'll even interrupt conversations between me and my sister so that he can get us to listen to him joke around even more.

I just feel honestly really shitty because I feel like no one gives a shit unless I'm feeding them attention.  And I feel selfish for wanting to tell people even basic shit about my life because I know they don't want to talk about it.  But I feel like this is just basic social interaction, that I should be able to talk to my friends and family about what's happening in my life at least a *little*.  I'm pretty sure I could go an entire week without anyone I'm close to asking ""How are you doing?"" even as a nicety, and that's frustrating.

And then I come back to my apartment and my roommate will greet me with ""So!  Here's what's been going on with me..."" and will go on at length about her day.  But as soon as she's done filling me in, I can see her starting to back out of the room so she can go back to something else.

Other than making more friends (which I am trying to do), what's the way to handle this?  Should I just stop trying because I shouldn't expect anything else out of them?  I've started trying to draw their attention to it (my brother seems to at least be apologetic in the moment, but other friends don't react), but is that even worth it?",03Apr2017,1
206,"20, female, university student in my second year of my degree. I am in the process of getting a diagnosis for anxiety and depression (in touch with the team at my university and trying to get help, trying to see a doctor for an official diagnosis but haven't yet for a number of reasons). Mentioning the above because it's probably related. My mental health is in a better place now than it's been in years, for the most part.

Basically, I don't like my relationship with alcohol and I'm looking for advice on how to change it. I'm not an alcoholic by any means; I can go weeks without a drink and have done as such recently, but I do like to drink and when I drink, I find myself drinking more than intended and getting drunk fairly frequently (even when I don't intend to). The issue is that I don't know how to break this cycle and I worry that I'm beginning to use drinking as a social crutch. Also, I get very bad anxiety after I drink.

I am, as much as a drunk person can be, a responsible drunk; I don't cause trouble or start drama, I just like to dance until the clubs close and make new friends. I'm awkward but friendly when I'm sober, however when I'm drunk, I'm far more confident and I get on with pretty much everyone. This, so far, has never led me into trouble and has actually helped me make a few good friends but for a few days after a drunken night, I feel anxious and terrible. I used to have drunken blackouts (in which, my friends told me I behaved the same as I do when I'm drunk and remember) and whilst I don't believe I have them anymore, I become terrified for days after each night out that I've done something that I've forgotten about. Even little things like oh I can't remember the name of the girl who I was speaking to in the smoking area, things that you would forget even when sober because they're not important, put me into a terrible state for days after and I don't feel better, even if I do remember them. I never actually do anything that upsets people but I worry for days about the idea that I have. 

I like drinking and clubbing with my friends so I don't want to stop cold turkey but I'm looking for tips on controlling my intake to stop myself from feeling like this. I'm in the process of getting a therapist and I intend to discuss this issue with them but, for now, I'd like some help in setting realistic goals in cutting down on my alcohol intake.

214,"Hello everyone. I've been dreading posting this because I'm afraid I might be in serious hot water in my career. I'm even posting this from a throw away account because I know this person is on Reddit and might recognize me by my main user name.

In any event, here's the story and where I need some advice; long and short of things is that I work for a pretty large media company in Detroit and earn a pretty decent living. Obviously I love what I do and don't want to risk losing my job ever. However, about 5 years ago I worked for another smaller media company with a coworker named (we'll call him ""Steve"") who more or less screwed me over.

Without going into details, he hired me for a side project that he was working on and never paid me. We're talking hours and hours of work with not as much of a dollar in compensation (also found out after the fact that he pocketed the advance money to produce the piece).  Considering we were friends, I let it slide and agreed to help him with another project in the city (just as long as he paid me for the previous gig (which was $200)). That never happened. A few weeks later he got fired from the company we worked for and he then sent me a message on Facebook asking me to finish up the job and then he would get me paid out. I never finished the project because 1: I was told by my boss at the time to avoid working with him because he was a ""bad apple"" and 2: I still felt cheated from the previous project. This is where things get dicey.

It was at about this time that Steve started blowing up my phone yelling and screaming at me that I demand I finish up the project because I owed it to him.  I hung onto the footage (think I still have it too) and told him that as soon as he paid me from the previous project that I'd finish up the work on the current project and return back the footage (After all, I thought that was fair). I didn't even asked to be paid for the current project at the time.  Just wanted it to be over with. Obviously I never got paid.  So instead of doing whatever he could to make it right, he sent me a pretty scathing message on Facebook vowing that he would never forget this and he would ""shit on me"" to the furthest extent of his power. We obviously haven't spoken since. We also disconnected from each other on social media but I still have screenshots of the messages just in case. He's also friends with some friends of mine online. 

Fast forward to today; the company I work for is hosting a charity benefit coming up in a few weeks and he is a keynote speaker because of some of the great things he's done in the community.  He's also been in some commercials.  Needless to say, he's carved out a name for himself.  It's been over 5 years since we've seen or spoken to each other. Because of that, I'm fearful he'll recognize me at this event (because I have to take photos of him) and then start talking to my current employer who will be attending about things that happened in the past thus ruining my credibility.

I could send one of my subordinates to the event instead as a backup plan but I would need a really good excuse as to not tip people off why I'm not going after I agreed to.

On the converse, he could have totally forgotten about it or even willing to bury the hatchet (after all, it was 5 years ago and I would like to think people change). 

What do you guys think? Am I being naive? Should I go and hope that he buries the hatchet? Should I just ignore him and hope he does the same? Should I come up with an excuse and send my assistant instead?

Same with any other web content) and he's fucking ignoring me like he's done nothing and he's totally fucking normal. When ever he asks me to fix any thing, I say no, and he looks at me in surprise like, ""Why the fuck would you say no?"" You fucking idiot you know exactly why I said no! wtf should I do about this... I can upgrade my proxy server and keep it running probably gonna do that any way, the caching feature is so neat, but until then I am stuck with a proxy server that keeps crashing, hard, meaning i have no internet until it starts up again.

226,"Hi All,

I think i have something very strange at this moment. I'm a 25 your old guy living in the Netherlands. Everything is pretty much on track, i have a nice job, a house of my own, a great car and greats friends which i enjoy very much.
In my past (school) i was bullied for lots and lots of years. And with that i mean very intense bullying. From calling out names to getting hit by other guys in my class and being excluded from every social activity. It went on and on for years, and i never told anybody.

Until i tried to kill myself at the age of ±14. I had enough, i was done with it and it wasn't going to be solved; at least, that was what i thought. My dad came in to my room a few seconds before i wanted to jump out of my window... so he literally saved me there.

Life went on, i went to psychologists, psychiatrists and what else... and they all said i was having some issues but they would be solvable very well. So i believed them and got on with talking with them. It seemed to help, really, but at major events in life (losing my boyfriend, my grandpa dying, etc) i totally felt like i lost control of everything and it even made me consider suicide again (at least twice). On both occasions some people picked up the signal, informed the right people and i started talking again.

So, now it is today. Everything is and was going pretty smooth for the last couple of months, but i was not able to get rid of a weird feeling that said ""You're not good enough"", ""People don't like you"" and ""You are ugly as fuck"".

Last week i started watching Netflix' ""13 Reasons Why"" because i was intrigued by the story of that TV show. I watched it almost without breathing, as i was bound to my TV. I watched all 13 episodes in roughly 4 days and it made me think back of the times when everything felt like shit and the bullying that didn't stop. I was able to identify the situations in that TV show very well, and that made me shiver. The last episode was pretty graphic, pretty intense and shocking together. But then the things like ""Why didn't i do that back then?"" and ""Would it still be an option now?"" started arising in my mind... and i'm kind of freaked out by it. It's not an emergency situation, but i know that thinking about those kinds of things is really not good and it might be another start of a ""i-lose-control""-situation.

Any advice on what to do as i'm terrified to discuss this with people close to me...? ",03Apr2017,1

233,"So I am a first year(credit wise second year) University student in America. I go to an OK uni and im in the honors program. I absolutely hate everything about the town, I have tried for almost a year to make friends to no avail, and everything about the school other than the classes I have related to my major(International studies/Japanese) I hate. 
In high school I applied to some Japanese unis because I was an exchange student in high school there as well. Upon getting in my parents threatened to cut me off and did not let me go there because it is not an American degree. Now as my second year(credit wise) is coming to a close, I have found some transfer programs to Japanese unis that I would get into. My parents are still adamant about me staying here and finishing saying that I can study abroad, but if the point of me going to college is to become fluent and learn the field, why would I just not go to Japan? I'm considering applying for transfer without their consent and I'm afraid this will cause a huge rift. Is there anyway to show them that I would be better off?

241,"I've had a lot of things going on in my life these past 6 months which I won't go into too much detail about, but basically I moved away from home for the first time, ended up moving back shortly after because of a psycho (ex) boyfriend, lost a lot of friends (because of said (ex) boyfriend), and so on. About five months ago, I started smoking weed again, which I had originally only done a couple times in high school. The problem with this is that I suppose I was using it as a way to cope with everything that was happening. On a day where I had stuff do to, work, etc. I would smoke once I got up, on my lunch break, sometimes on breaks, once I got home, and a couple times before bed. (Smoking on breaks stopped once I moved back home and started at another job that requires more concentration) On days where I wasn't doing much, like the weekend, I would smoke pretty much all day, afraid of feeling 'normal' again. So basically, I would try to keep myself high all day. Well, I've been noticing that this seems to be affecting my day to day function, I forget a lot of things, more than I usually would. I feel tired all day, my mind feels cloudy, and since I'm not able to smoke on breaks at work anymore, I find myself going crazy halfway through the day. I just want to light up a joint on lunch, not so much for the high, but just to keep myself busy. So I had this idea, since I can't smoke a joint at work, I'll start smoking cigarettes. I have always absolutely hated cigarettes. As much as I hate to admit it, I'm one of those annoying people constantly asking people when they are going to stop killing themselves by smoking. But now here I am, pack of cigarettes in hand. I really don't know what to do, I don't want to quit smoking weed but I definitely know that I need to learn how to take it easy. I also really don't want to smoke cigarettes, but I just can't take it when I'm at work. Can someone please talk some sense into me? ",03Apr2017,1

251,"So i'm in a relation ship with a girl for over 3months now.

Like I can see that she DO NOT wantto lose, same for me, We really love each other and this isn't a 'fake' love type of stuff.

Anyways my parents etc know about her and is fine with it, but her mom, isn't.

Her mom doesn't know me currently but when She heard that I'm from a 'diffirent' culture as she says, She needed to break up.

She cried all day long, everyday and then she told me, she also told me that she would NEVER do that because of how much she loves me.

Now she's stressing EVERYDAY literally, and you know what she did, she told her mom that she broke up since her mom was asking about it everytime.

Fucked up part, I was outside with her and her mom, literally asked her to send a pic of her and her 'friend' (being a girl) 
Since she can't know that she was with me.

So she actually visited a friend to make a pic before going home.

Anyways this all is TOO much trouble.

I love her so much, she loves me so much but what do I do?

Like her mom just isn't changing her mind.

She is even crying, like today we talked and she send me a random voice through whatsapp, and like that hurts me.

I actually got an idea for later but I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

But should I break it up in an 'evil' way not towards her but her mother?

So send her mother a message like 

'you don't see her cry everyday do you? Well it's ALL because of YOU. And you know what? I'm not gonna bother with it anymore, You could've made her HAPPY if you let her go with the one she wanted, being me but instead, I'll just block her, ignore her JUST for you, and oh well this is going to make her EVEN more sad, good luck with that'

I can't do that tho I will never block her we talk 24/7 everyday everytime we go out together almost all the time, I really can't let her go, she literally is getting in problems because of me and she STILL fights for it, she still goes for me, she thinks about nothing but me...

I have been accepted onto a Masters program, but I realize now that for what it costs and the unlikelihood that I'll enjoy the career it leads to any more than my current jobs it probably isn't worth it. I feel like emailing my boss and asking if we can have a quick chat next week to discuss things. He is away on holiday this week.

Is it extremely uncommon to withdraw a resignation? I am obviously very embarrassed and ashamed of the position I'm in. I feel like I'm admitting that I'm a dependent, cowardly fool by essentially ""crawling back"" and asking him to allow me to resume. However I also fear that should an ideal job come up in three months time, I won't be able to apply for it because I've asked to continue working here.

My flatmate also committed suicide in her room last week (I wasn't close to her) and I barely slept since I was crashing on someone's sofa for two nights beforehand.
