0,"Okay so I just want to start off in saying that this is going to be long and confusing. As of right now in my senior season I am committed to play a D1 sport and accept a partial scholarship to play at said school. However it is a military school and in my heart idk if that's what I want with my whole heart. Some days I just want to play video games and hangout and idk If have it in me. My family also has a super long history with the school and I'm scared about being a disappointment if I don't go. I could also accept d3 offers and go play at a smaller school but probably have more fun but still get that sport. Lastly, I could just go to a normal university and not deal with any of this but then I may feel regret as I would have wasted some of my athletic potential. Part of me feels like I owe it to all my coaches and my parents because I've always been told I could play in college (not even a humblebrag lol - not trying to be douchey) but another part of me wants that traditional college experience and to meet a ton of girls and friends and party and have fun and just be a young dumb kid. Idk if the life of military and order and all that is how I want to spend being 19,20,21 and 22. What does the community of Reddit think is the best option?",20Sep2017,1
1,"Hi folks, I am trying to improve the air flow in my basement. I live in a room with no windows so the air gets awfully stale and I feel like that impacts the quality of my sleep. Generally, if I sleep in most other places with windows I wake up more refreshed. Having said that, what are some recommendations in regards to getting fresh air to my room? I have generally kept the ceiling fan on but that just circulates the air in my room only, afaik. I have started setting up a box fan in another room that has windows so that I might get better air - it seems to be helping. Are there any recommendations on better floor fans? Or perhaps some other alternatives (other than moving my bed to another room?)  
  
Here is a rough sketch of what the layout of my basement looks like: https://i.imgur.com/BlSFJkV.png

3,"Hey, I've just gotten into freshmen year of highschool and their are wayyyy more students.  I'm  a pretty average looking guy, but not very athletic.  So basically since near the end of 8th grade me and this girl I'll call Maya have been dating.  The thing is Maya is probably one of the prettiest girls I've ever met, I'm talking 9.5/10.  This has kind've been a curse because since we've both went from a smallish middle school (80-90 8th graders) to a bigger sized highschool. I've had tons of jocks try to ""beta"" male me to impress her, and do other jerkish things and they just do it more and more.

14,"I earn about 30k a year with a job I love. I've recently begun my masters degree and its very expensive. I've been saving for over a year now and can manage to pay for it just fine.

I recently ran into car problems and its going to cost me a few thousand. I explained to my mum that I'm not going to have any savings after this so I'll just need one month off from paying my rent which is 500 at home (which I have no problem paying!)

She told me I shouldn't be going out to dinner or movies or being out with friends.

I was so taken aback. I barely go out. I see cheap matinee movies, when I go out for dinner it's once or twice a month at cheap places and if I'm out with friends we do inexpensive or free activities. I think she's delusional about the money I earn and how much gas, insurance, car repair, phone bill etc costs. I guess she thinks I should not have a life other than home, school and work. Maybe I should just tell my mum I'll stay at home forever and just work for her and give all my money to her instead /s. 

My dad on the other hand understands that shit happens and doesn't care if I can't pay for rent like at all. 

Anyway I don't understand why she thinks one movie or a dinner out is so terrible. I'm already upset as it is with all my savings about to disappear. Do other parents think this same garble?",20Sep2017,6
16,"Hello, I'm in a funk. I've been in this funk for a couple of days now and just don't know what to do. I feel disconnected and feel like something's not right. 
I'm a generally happy guy and very positive but lately I don't feel the same. I have a wonderful life, like I am living with my friends who go to college with me; but, they have been getting on my nerves. They do things that I don't necessarily like but I don't want to stop them from that. I try to distance myself but sometimes am around it when it happens. Lately one of my closest girl friends has been in the same funk as me but I don't know how to describe it. I'm not getting along with things in my life and something feels out of place. 
I moved away from my home town for college and it's only been a month so I guess it could be me feeling the homesickness start to set in. I've never been away from my family this long and it's been a little difficult. My schooling is fun. I'm going to school to be an aircraft mechanic and I love the stuff we are learning and know that it will be amazing, but when I'm there it's just another thing of school. I don't like school in the first place but this one is so much better. I guess this is me asking for advice from fellow redditers for way to help get out of this funk. Please ask questions to understand my issue more. I know it's probably not the best of written material so I'll ask questions in search for advice. Thank you in advance. ",20Sep2017,1
17,"My situation while it is a very isolating feeling is something I feel many others in similar situations my age can easily relate to. I know this because I know others first hand in very similar predicaments as me and for some reason I can't find the answer or way out regardless of the large group of people I know who deal with this exact same problem.

What is my problem? I am the 21 year old living at home working minimum wage jobs because I did poorly in college and decided I didn't want to ruin my chances in school anymore so I took a break.

Most of my days consist of the same routine. Wake up, ramble around the house (parents house) trying to think of something to do, which usually amounts to a day of chain smoking, web surfing, Netflix watching and going to my part time job so I can save up money for future investments like an apartment, school in the future etc etc.

This may sound trivial and in many respects it is, because I know so many people have and are dealing with similar. And I'm not trying to make it sound like I am ready to jump off a bridge because this is just eating away at me, but I will say there is a very clear, ever present sense of sadness and envy in this age of social media. When I  see people my age and even younger living the lives I wish I could be living.

Seeing them make it through school, develop friendships, find relationships and their possibly future spouses, and some even graduating college and getting good jobs.
 
I posted this in the advice subreddit because I know plenty have been in my shoes and plenty have made it out to go on to live fulfilling lives, and that this is just a phase most likely and things will get better...   But I could definitely use some advice.

So yeah it would be much appreciated to people who have been in my shoes and made it out of this, what changed in your life and how did things get better, whether it was fast or gradual? I'm curious to hear your stories. Thanks guys.",20Sep2017,11

22,"I am a 14 year old boy and have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was young. I live with my mom, younger sister, twin sister, older half sister, and older half brother. I don't live my dad because, prior to marrying and fucking another guy then divorcing him, she fucked and divorced my dad. They both pay child support to my mom now and this is what she uses to live off of and has no job, claiming that taking care of the kids (Who she does nothing with while she plays facebook games in her room with reality tv shows blasting behind her) is a job in itself. She has primary custody over all of us so I rarely see my dad. My mom, younger sister, and twin sister have very sexist and third wave feminist views. Little sister is obese, attention whore, weeaboo that uses it for attention, lazy, and spends her time watching Youtube vlogger channels and the newest c00l kid anime on Netflix. My twin sister spends her time also watching crappy vlogger youtube channels, is a vegetarian, low key anorexic, and occasionally helps my mom do her ""job"" of cleaning the dishes every few days and pointless crap like planting flowers outside. Keep in mind, this is the ONLY stuff they do in their free time. Other than school, the only other things they all do is shop, and since no one is there to ""keep an eye on me at home"" my mom drags me along with them. They take hours to shop every time, usually stopping at multiple stores looking for specific brands and deals because my mom has barely enough money living off of child support. A shopping day (about every 2-3 days) takes around 5 hours usually, sometimes as long as 9 hours, and all I get to do is sit there waiting for it to end, bored out of my mind. My little sister being extremely lazy and spoiled also doesn't have any independence and just asks for help with everything, and my mom forces me to help her, specifically all of her homework. My sister never takes notes in class and always never understands anything she gets taught at school so I'm left with having to try and explain while they call everything I say wrong because they can't understand it and then having to end up giving them a step by step rundown of what to do. In the end it takes about 2 hours at most (And she or my mom still never understand the concept because they somehow lack the will to think). My family also gets very angry at me for ""making noises and moving"" despite having ADHD. I do these things when I'm nervous, bored, or tired where I make click noise, tap my feet, or stretch a lot. They yell at me for all of these things but then my little sister turns around and makes random noises to be funny when she is in a mood for attention and my mom eats it up and they talk and everything. My twin sister also has some friends who bullied my only friend who has depression, and two weeks later attempted to kill himself in front of me with a knife to his throat. After telling my twin sister she doesn't care and still has these friends. I feel like I'm going insane, only one friend, isolated from my family and treated like shit for no reason, barely any free time, stressed, etc.

23,"      Recently I was offered a job, and I accepted it. However, I just got a call asking for an interview from an organization I have worked at and enjoyed greatly working there in the past. The only reason I left was because they didn't have a full time job available when I graduated from college. 
      This job works better for me in a number of ways. The main way is geographically. The town this is in is right in between where my family is and my soon to be wife's. This is a huge advantage. Another reason is because it's a small town, and there just isn't a lot of opportunity there for someone like me in my field. There is maybe one or two openings a year at most, and because of that when a job presents itself I would like to pounce on it. 
     I am interested in the other job and will be fine there but I don't see it as a long term opportunity for me. However this other opportunity I do. I am wondering if I should continue pursuing this or not. Should I just wait for a couple years down the line and wait for another opportunity there to present itself? If I should still interview there how should I present this two them?

26,"Background on me: I am a22m college student in my last year. I am an economics major philosophy minor. Since 11 I have been abused by my mother with some sexual abuse and a lot of emotional abuse, ib finally ran away from my home a week ago. I have two major preoccupations that I believe came from this. Firstly I have a very strong desire to be sexy. Secondly I have a very strong desire to be normal. I usually see them as identical. I naturally think that any trait that differs from the norm is negative, which is rally bad for me because I am far from the norm. I am going to a high ranking university in a competitive program and my grades are some of the top ones (consistently within the top 5) I will be graduating with 19k in debt due to my scholarships and background i do not mean to humblebrag and honestly I think that is completely worthless a would trade it for having lost my consensual virginity at 18, someone who want sexually abused and lost their virginity at 18 and is going to a community college is going to far better places than I am.
I am very passionate about philosophy and economics and strongly wish I could redirect this passion to something normal like Game of Thrones or Pokemon Go. I gather lots of useless knowledge that could never help me have sex. I do not have enough motivation to flirt with every woman I meet either and I can't even get myself to play video games. All I do is think about the state of the world and how to improve it and I despise myself for it. I wish that my actual personality was attractive so I didn't need to be normal however I very strongly believe that only normal men are attractive and all others are repulsive.
I feel like casual sex is the best type of sex because it is indicative of sexual attraction as opposed to money so I desire it but I do believe it will be bad and unenjoyable.
There are two girls I both have known since I began university both 22F. I will call them Anastasia and Madeline. Anastasia studies biology and is unattractive and I find her unattractive. I find Madeline attractive and she studies political science with a minor in philosophy so I have many classes with her.
I believe that both of them are attracted to me to some extent. Anastasia seems really desperate so I think she would have sex with me early on, which I would like since I am desperate to lose my consensual virginity. Madeline seems to tease me in a flirtatious manner rather frequently when I interact with her. Anastasia asked me out on a date on Friday and it was not enjoyable but she asked me out on another one. Today I asked Madeline to study with me and she said that her week was full but she gave me her number and asked me to text her about the classes we share. She has a full-time job in addition to being a full-time student so I understand her not having time this week. She said she was going to go study later today and I saw her with a guy who was much better dressed than me (beard, jeans, t-shirt, I wish I had the confidence to dress like that instead of just wearing dress shirts and pants all the time) seeming to be studying. Anastasia asked me out on another date today. I want to have sex with Anastasia to lose my consensual virginity so I will be less anxious about sex and more confident and then try to leave her for Madeline who I think I would actually enjoy being with. I also think that losing my consensual virginity will make me more confident in general. Any advice?",20Sep2017,0

Apart of me thinks this is just the honeymoon stage wearing off but then apart of me really thinks there's an issue.  I'm going to bullet point some stuff:

* He shows me no respect and is so respectful of anyone else (I have to beg him to even say please and thank you to me) 
* He has minipulated me into thinking I can't do any better 
* Any issue I have, he doesn't give a shit and will continue doing as he pleases. 
* I rarely want sex with him because of his behaviour, and he even uses that against me (to the point where I feel I have to just to please him). 
* I have severe anxiety and he calls me ""crazy"" for it. 
* His idea of doing something for me is chucking money at me rather than going out of his way 

I'm really not sure if this is me venting for no reason or if these are genuine enough reasons to reconsider. The longer I stay with him, the more I'm just beginning to think he's just an asshole and resent him for everything.

46,"Let me start with the fact that I am divorced. I am no saint but I was treated terribly in my marriage by my ex-husband and his family. The extended members are incredibly racist (I am white, they are latino), always belittling my skin, my culture, my language, my 'light brown' eyes, my aspirations, my cooking, everything. Anyway, my ex has a sister (let's call her T) who has two kids, J and D. T is a notorious cheater; she cheated on her husband for five years (that I know of), getting pregnant twice by others after her husband got fixed. One of those pregnancies was from a long-term sexual relationship with a minor child who lived across the street. Yeah, it sickens me that I never said anything but I was so abused and emotionally whipped that I felt absolutely helpless.not a great excuse but those of you who have been emotionally abused for years (my ex and I were married 10 years, together 11) might understand. Her son, J, was the sweetest child I had ever met. I watched him grow up and always enjoyed spending time with him. He was one of the only family members who gave a crap about me, even in his early teens. For that alone, I hold his memory dear. I haven't seen him in five years and I finally got the guts to look him up on social media. I don't like the idea of 'stalking' online, but I was curious as to how he had turned out. Sadly, on his FB, he attacks pro-abortionists, transgender folk, and women. He turned into a hateful little jerk who doesn't even know the half of his own family history. Now my cunundrum: do I tell him about his mother and try to get him to understand that his views are exactly contradictory to those of his own mother's actions? If he forgives her, he would be a hypocrite not to forgive others for living their lives as they see fit. Is it more likely to make him more bitter or to ask questions about people's real-life situations and try to put the shoe on the other foot? I remember him as such a wonderful kid and it really saddens me that he has become this hateful person. At the same time, I don't want him to see me as a meddler. I'd like him to have good memories of me, for the most part, although his uncle probably already told many a lie to him about me. Any advice? Please actually give advice, not some bullshit opinion. Note: I am not seeking revenge for anything, in case anyone asks. He was a sweet kid thrust in a crazy situation; the evils of his family should not taint him. I really want this young man to be able to remember what it was like to just love people for who they are, mistakes and all, and to not go into adulthood with hate in his heart.

I'm really awkward and bad at starting and carrying on conversations and I'm afraid my roommate will start thinking I don't like him or something. I knew it was kinda weird that we didn't talk more and I already wanted to try to get to knowng more but I didn't realize quite how weird it must seem to him until someone else told me that it makes him uncomfortable that I don't talk to him more. I'm just really used to barely talking to people at school and not talking much more to some people I lived with and I don't know how to start talking to people more.

Just to illustrate how bad I am at this:

*I lived with my stepdad for 6 years and I've still never had an actual conversation with him

*I almost never talk to people unless they talk to me first.

*Most of the time, when someone says something to me that isn't a direct question, I have no idea how to respond so there's just an awkward silence

*I don't remember the last time I had an actual conversation with my dad (more than a few sentences at a time) even though I lived with him on the weekends. We did stuff together, but it was mostly in silence

*Most of the time I go all day only saying a few small things like ""hi"" or asking my roommate if I can turn the light off or something

52,okay this will be a long one. so last year i got bullied by my friend and started not doing homework and now i've fallen into a bad habit of not doing homework and i get in trouble all the time and it stresses me out. i often have panic attacks and have fainted or thrown up because of it. also i've had anger issues ever since i was young and i used to throw massive tantrums however now i manage to calm down a bit however often i just get really angry and don't know how to let it out so sometimes i bite myself and scratch and hit myself. i also get bullied for my looks but whatever. i get crushes really easily and often they don't even know i exist. at the moment i have a crush on the most popular girl in school and we used to be friends but now she doesn't talk to me. i also have a crush and this really hot guy on my n=bus who is 4 years older than me. my parents drive me crazy and my best friend sometimes talks about committing suicide and the only thing stopping her is i promised to kill myself if she does. i also sometimes don't eat and my friends think i have anorexia. please help me.,20Sep2017,4

We later learned that upon falling two days prior, he cracked a rib which pierced his heart. He had been sleeping in a chair since the fall so he probably didn’t realize it or something. My friend (who is probably more scarred than I am) was much braver than I was, attempting to do CPR while listening to instructions from the paramedics on the phone. I rounded up a few neighbors who I figured could help (one was part of the Air-force and the other is a police officer). I also called people like my mom who was at work, at my aunt. My friend, neighbors and eventually the paramedics weren’t able to save him. He was assumed to have been dead for at least four hours. That day I was bawling my eyes out upon realizing that my old man was dead. My friend held me close as we waited for my mom to arrive. I was an absolute mess. Eventually I calmed myself down once my mom arrived, trying to be brave for her. That’s when things got in a way more upsetting for me. That was the last I really cried or got extremely upset over it, the day it happened. I couldn’t cry at his funeral later that week, and I can’t cry now. I don’t even know if I have real emotion for it anymore. I feel horrible and upset just for the fact that I can’t let myself be upset and grieve. I loved my father very much. I don’t know if I’m still in shock or if I just don’t feel. I always kept things bottled up but I don’t want to, it just happens that way for me.

Recent grad with two liberal arts degrees and not enough professional experience on my resume. I need to be doing *something*, even if it's not an ideal job, so I've been applying around to just about anywhere that's accepting apps. A shipping company asked me in for an interview for a part-time position hauling boxes in their warehouse and scheduled me for the 6am shift. I was already hesitant about it - I can lift 60ish pounds but doing it multiple times a day for the two year minimum before a promotion seems... tough. But I've done warehouse work before, so I figured I could muscle through it.

When I get there for the tour/interview, though, they've moved me to the 3am shift (apparently there *isn't* a 6am shift at all) which is...not something I'm sure I want to commit to seeing as to how 6am already preemptively felt like would be a struggle. Then the manager proceeds to go on about how we're in luck!! They're hiring in the double digits every week because ""people get promoted so often""!! But I'm not sure I believe that, it just sounds like high turnover...

Also, it just felt really disorganized? My interview was scheduled for 7am and I didn't talk to anyone until 10:30am. They told us not to bring anything but then said they needed proof of address and a social security card so I'm supposed to come back tomorrow with that.

tl;dr,

86,"Hey guys, I'm just kinda looking for an amalgamation of the typical breakup advice. Reassuring words, post-breakup success stories, good healthy and positive thinking tips. Any support would be appreciated right now.

Cliff notes version of my situation:

- Broke up two days ago. 
- Short relationship (3 mo) but long buildup of friendship and tension (2 yrs)
- Ended relatively amicably. No fighting or feuding. We were respectful the whole way though. We had a final talk, wished each other well, said goodbye with one last embrace. Dignified breakup. 
- She left to find herself, somewhat abruptly. Our relationship was in the wake of her previous one, and unfortunately we rushed in too quickly. (5 days between the end of the previous one and the start of ours. We'd been growing closer for a long time and been emotionally basically dating but not physically involved for a good 2-3 months before that).
- No more contact in the relationship. Kept each other's numbers just in case we ever needed to reach one another or if something changes in the future but otherwise no more talking in the day to day, no social media friending and whatnot.

I'm feeling kind of lost in it all. I'm logically okay with what went wrong in the relationship and understand that it was fundamentally flawed and that it had to end, but I'm going through the emotional rounds and I still feel like a bit of a wreck.

We met the first day of college and we noticed we had a whole lot in common (she likes the same music as me, is a musician, loves movies and books etc.). She's a very beautiful girl and needless to say I was instantly attracted to her. Talking to her came pretty easy and eventually we had a friend group we would hang with. About a week after I met her we started cuddling and holding hands and now we are officially dating. 

Here's my problem: whenever we are alone now I feel like I'm kind of awkward. Sometimes I don't know what to say and I feel like I'm being quite or weird. I mean she still seems into me and all that but I get nervous with her when it is just her and I. Maybe it's because it's her first relationship? I really want this to work because I think she's great. I just wanna know if there's a way I could feel less nervous or maybe get better conversations going.

113,"One of my best friends stopped contacting me (and all friends and family) over a year ago. She quit her jobs, lost her apartment, etc. I have just found out that she is homeless and has been for months (a friend found her on the streets). She has lost about 100 pounds, lives in a car with a ""boyfriend"" but seems happy? She says she's ""living the life"". As much as we can tell she asks for money and food during the day. We think she could be bipolar as she's in her late 20s and has been completely erratic. She has no means to contact anyone- no phone, tablet, or device anymore. Possibly on drugs but we don't know for sure.

I'm absolutely distraught. We've bought her meals, clothes, hygiene products, etc. She's appreciative and never asks for anything. Should we try to convince her to get help? Should we support her the way she has chosen to live? I'm sad and scared for her. But in my own selfish ways I'm also crushed myself as I've lost one of my closest friends.",20Sep2017,14

I was foolish and thought that it was stupid, so I made a remark saying ""yeah you might fall in love with me"". I then messaged her again later saying that her boyfriend was controlling [I made a rhetorical statement that I can't remember] . Her bf found out and basically threatened me. A couple months later I messaged her to ask her about something [a simple question and no banter] and her boyfriend threatened me again so I removed her from facebook and sent him an apology message saying that it won't happen again.

I know I made a mistake and shouldn't have said those things. I don't do that anymore.

121,"First off, let me start this off by saying I need help. Any sort of help really.

I'm at the point in my life where most of my friends have abandoned me, and my family has always been distant from me that I've been spiraling down into depression for years now. I've always been a big guy all my life but it all turned for the worst when the only friends I had at the time cut me out of their life thus giving me the ""I don't care about my life attitude"" and allowing myself to let my weight balloon until very very unhealthy levels.
At the moment I'm 6'3 and around 400 pounds and I'm 24 years old. I know it's very dangerous for me to be so heavy, but I have no motivation in my life anymore, I have no friends, my family is almost non existent in my life. All I do is work, sleep, and eat. I want to try and change this, but often times when I try to take the first step I feel discouraged and distraught because I feel like nobody cares about me, thus taking away all my motivation. I want to change for the better, and I want to be healthy but it's a struggle when I try to deal with the fact that I feel so alone.

I just want to know if there's anyone out there who's ever felt the same, what they've done to change their lives. Etc.

I really hope I can get some good advice or maybe find a workout partner or maybe someone who cares out there. ",20Sep2017,1
122,"I've known her for about 3 years or so, but I stopped talking to her for almost a year up until the beginning of this July. She dated this guy who decided to break up with her. When they broke up, I was basically the only one of her friends that helped her through it, and we've been becoming closer and closer since, talking about more intimate subjects gradually. She also doesn't have very many friends and they bail on her quite a bit, and basically the same for me. So we've been hanging out a lot these past few weeks. It's become evident to me that we both like each other.

However, I'm 18 and she is still a minor until February. She is still in high school, which isn't really a problem; the problem is that I would say there is a 90%(maybe 85%) chance that she's gonna go to a college that would force somewhat of a long distance relationship; there's a 99% chance that it isn't gonna work with me. 

That's the situation, and I don't know how to deal with it. If I could I would just hang out with and talk to her less since I'm going to be busier soon with college and work, but I know I'll still be able to have time, and if not make time, to hang out with her. I always have so much fun when we hang out, which brings me to my next point, I don't really want to ruin such a great friendship for myself(I have trouble building close relationships) by moving it to the next level. I know for sure I'm not going to make a move until she's of age, but I don't know about her. Every time we hang out it seems she is getting closer to me both physically and emotionally, and I wouldn't be surprised if she did or said something soon.

Finally here are my questions:

Wut should I do if she does make a move so that I can explain to her that we definitely can't date for several months and even then explain that I still don't know if I want to date her, but also maintain the friendship without things getting awkward? Obviously things are going to get awkward and I think she's smart enough to realize to wait at least until February, but you never know. 

And I know to just talk to her and tell her how I feel, but things tend to come out wrong at times when I say them bluntly, so a little advice on that would be appreciated

Are long distance relationships as bad as they seem? I know it basically comes down to your own personal tolerance(which I don't think I could do it for that long), but some advice from your own personal experiences would be much appreciated. Also, I should mention that I would probably still be able to see her some weekends when we're both in college, and for holidays and breaks and stuff, so it's not like she's going that far.

Lastly, do you think I should just maintain the friendship and look for someone else? College just seems like the ideal place to find a SO to me. I can't help but feel a little naive since my experience is only with high school, but it seems like I could easily find someone through a club or my major who thinks similar to me and has the same interests.

But this girls is already very much like that and we click together extremely well so I'm debating whether or not to just go for it.

Please don't feel like you have to answer every question. I'd appreciate it much more if you gave me detailed advice on the things you know very well and more or less ignored the stuff you don't. Apologies if that comes off as unappreciative, I just want to avoid any ""wut if"" and ""maybe"" scenarios, and/or things of that nature. Though, feel free to ask for more details if need be.

129,"My 60 year old mom has been talking to someone she met on a dating site for a month or two now. I'm 22 going to college so I'm still living with my mom for the time being which is what I'm most worried about. Anything that affects her will surely come down to me and I don't plan to live here much longer a year from now I'm going to move out and honestly I just want things to run smooth before.

Some things to mention before hand:

 *  She isn't a native English speaker nor an experienced user of the internet

 * She been involved with romance scams before

 * I created her profiles and email that she uses. This also lets me see for some part what she is doing, etc.

* It might seem a little intrusive, but going back to the first point so someone needs aware of what she does.

The Issue:

Come now she meets another person on the same dating site his profile name is Micheal. They've been talking about a month or two, never met in person yet (of course). Reason is Micheal is in Africa because his dad supposedly died there while working, hes trying to claim the money back and all that bull. Sometime later Micheal is stuck in some country in Africa saying he can't access his bank accounts and needs a Samsung or new iPhone to contact his bank. His reason is he needs to use the face to face cam talk to have the bank verify its actually him. She tells me about it I tell her this person is just trying to scam you and you should stop talking to this person. Of course she doesn't, but she didn't buy him that phone he wanted YET.  

Sometime later Micheal has the money to fly back has bought a ticket and even emailed his ticket to my mom to let her see. I look at it it looks kinda real, I looked into flight and ticket numbers, calling the airline the answers I got was it was invalid. The ""ticket"" had an unpaid balance of $1000 of $3000 and he was asking my mom to send him 1k to help pay for it. I told her about the fake ticket and the false flight numbers in the end she didn't fork him 1k, but still she kept talking to the person. 

Now just this week the person sends an email of another ticket fully paid with all the same glaring issues there was with the older one. Just this one is fully paid for with him flying out this wed and landing Thursday.I tell her its fake, which she just brushes off and keeps going at it. Not surprisingly something comes up he tells my mom he needs 1k for ""Basic Traveler Allowance Fee"". 

Today I find out this scammer has been telling my mom to delete her messages to keep me from finding out what she has been sending him. From what I could gather from messages to her google voice she received is that she got him that  phone he wanted and actually sent it over to him, and she has been sending money to him too a definite least 100 dollars with who knows how much more. Just today she messaged saying sent the money over for his allowance fee I don't know if that was true or not, and I couldn't get a straight answer from her.

I don't know what to do anymore, I've explained to her about this over and over again. She says she understands and that I don't need to worry. Then she goes around my back and does this I don't even know how much money exactly has been sunk into this, and how much more money will go into this scam.

What should I do?

Sorry for such a long post and the formatting, first time actually writing a huge post. I cut out a bunch before hand too. Hope nothing is too confusing

130,"Hello reddit,

Some background info, i'm 20, turning 21 very soon and 2 weeks back, I was hanging out with my cousins, we were just sitting by the sea and my cousin who's 13 asked me to take him to the nearby supermarket (about a 5min drive) real quick to buy some snacks. 

On the way there, he said ""can I tell you something but promise you won't tell anyone?"" I was like yeah sure and then he told me that he smokes, and he has been for almost 2.5 years now. 

A little info about me, I absolutely hate smoking, I do not tolerate it one bit and I make it blatantly obvious, and he knew that, yet he told me for some reason as opposed to our other cousin who's also my age and he smokes too.

Also, one last thing about me, I've been volunteering at a sort club for kids, where they come in, we do activities and then take then on a trip, whether it be a football field, swimming pool, zoo, etc. and I've been doing it for around 3 years, twice a week on school days, and almost daily in the summer. The kids are elementary and middle school kids (all boys). So I have quite a bit of experience in dealing with kids. 

Anyways, after telling me that he smokes, he told me he wants to buy a vape and quit, not sure if he said it cause he knows I hate smoking or if that's what he actually wants to do. 

Also, his older brother (17) also smokes, and so does his dad. So I'm not sure you can blame him for smoking. When I tried to tell him how bad smoking is, he said his dad's been smoking for like 30 years now and he's ok, he also said that he smokes the weakest type of cigs so it's not that harmful. By the time we got back, he didnt seem very convinced in quitting smoking. Lastly, I asked him who else knows and he said no one does, not even his fraternal twin brother, or his older brother. (Although he hinted a bit that his older brother might know cause he caught him and his twin smoking once and scolded them, his brother had already told me this a while ago so I already knew about that but his brother might know that he still smokes)

So yeah, I'm not really sure what to do. My cousins and I usually hang out, but without the youngest two (one of which is the one I've been talking about) and since that happened (2 weeks ago) I've been trying to get us all together to talk to him again but haven't been successful in doing so.

One last thing, my other cousin who's the same age as me asked me if he smokes (the 13 year old) and since he can tell when I'm lying, I gave it away so now he knows as well. After that I told him that since we hang out almost weekly, we should get the twins to come with us, since they're not annoying us anyways and if they're with us they're not with other friends who might be bad influences, He agreed.

I don't think telling his parents would be a good idea, cause basically what's going to happen is they will ground him for a month or two, scold him pretty hard (he's terrified of his parents btw) then they'll let him go out again and he'll be even more determined to smoke... 

I've been thinking of telling him that if he quits I'll take him Ice skating whenever he wants to go (He loves Ice Skating and I go there every couple of days anyways since i love to skate as well so it wouldnt be a hassle for me at all). But I'm sure that wouldnt be enough to get him to stop smoking and if he's not convinced that smoking is bad for him, he'll never quit anyways.

132,"To put this bluntly: I have had a major depression and breakdown because I was unable to manage personal life and collage. I currently have 4 exams I still need to pass, but I am 100% unable to do so (I know no math, I wouldn't even say past high school, including high school. Ah and they're all math).

I theoretically can still enroll this year, but I simply can't afford it, no matter how I look at it, and even if I could, I have such stupid emotional baggage I simply can't study math, doesn't work.

I am so close it is insane, yet I can't do anything about it.

I have no idea how to proceed.

I was studying computer science, I'm fairly good, I can most definitely get a job, even if it takes me 3 months, I've already had a job (albeit a completely disappointing one), so I will survive. It's not survival I'm afraid of, but I'm not sure I'll ever ""thrive"". I've documented myself and have seen what other colleagues have been up to and it's a decent story: Even those in the same boat as me make a decent chunk of change, but the ones who've graduated either make almost double or have moved to central europe (from eastern europe).

I am afraid. I don't want to be rolling in cash (like the ones with the degree), but I don't want to be short-changed on salary / promotions my entire career. 

I have no idea what to do. Moving forward would at least help me get over my depression about the whole college thing, getting on with my life.

136,"Hey- I'm feeling a little stuck so I'll try to do my best to explain and I'm open to receiving any advice.

I'm 27 years old. Two years ago my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I slowly watched her health decline until she passed in February. I have a very supportive family and we went through this together. Towards the end of June my significant other whom I thought I was going to marry left me. He said things were too emotional for him (I was going through depression with my mom dying) and he knew he couldn't help me. This fucked me up big time- not only had I lost my mother, but months later I lost my partner. I was in deep deep depression. Doing badly at work, drinking, eating like shit.
A few months ago my dad offered me to move home rent free. The town he lives in is NOT where I want to be permanently but I decided to go because having no rent , and spending time with my father after mum passed sounded pretty good. Plus things were NOT going anywhere for me where I was living.

So here I am. I'm definitely still sad but out of that depression hole which is good. I'm working three jobs- farm, package store, restaurant. I'm reading more- trying to learn about meditation and mindfulness.

The problem for me is- I'm going through my quarterlife crisis while all this is happening. I don't feel like I'm doing enough. I have no direction in life. I don't want to work these jobs forever! I don't want to live at home forever! I haven't lived at home in 7 years!!  Why don't I have any direction? Why can't I be happier? Cooler? Better at things?  Where do I go from here?

138,"So, I'm going to try and keep this short and to the point, keeping it relevant. Also, I will preface this post by saying this is a very mundane issue, don't come here expecting anything earth-shattering.

I was dating this person for some months last year and we sort of drifted apart around the end of 2016. I stopped talking to her and she stopped talking to me and I noticed after a while she had unfriended/removed me from almost everything.

So backstory out of the way, that brings us to now. I uploaded a video last week, with the video before this one being uploaded a bit before the relationship end.  But it seems she hadn't unsubscribed from me, and soon after uploading, she commented on the video saying it's well made.

It's possible but quite unlikely that she may have just not remembered or noticed that it was my channel, it's under a pseudonym. However, I say it's unlikely because it was a pseudonym I used around her a decent amount and I even got her advice when I was making the logo for it.

This situation kind of threw me for a loop, because she cut contact a while back and I rolled with it (it made sense). But now she's initiated contact of sorts again. So I wanted to speak about this somewhere and get some thoughts about it, this seemed like the best place to do it I suppose. 

To make it clear, in the most basic form I think I am looking for advice on if I should respond in some way or just leave it alone. Any thoughts on the situation are welcome though. I know logically this is probably a silly question and I should probably just not acknowledge anything about it for the sake of simplicity.

140,"I'm a 29 year old male only child, and I am expecting my first-born child this December. Since living with my girlfriend the past couple of years, my mother (66) has been acting increasingly strange. We haven't been particularly close since I moved out at 16, but have remained in contact and on reasonably good terms. Seeing each other a couple of times a year at least, but there is a definite negative spiral going on in our relationship. She wants more contact with me, but when we are in contact she is negative, decreasing my desire to contact her, which in turn makes her even more negative.

Last fall she came to visit us, and had a bit of a break-down triggered by my girlfriend inviting our friends that are about her age to dinner one of the evenings, where they made a joke about having had adopted us. In the aftermath of which, she requested that I sign a document for her allowing her to cut me out of her will. I gave her the document in the hope that she would feel this was enough leverage over me to feel in control again, if that was her problem. 

I don't call her very much, because she will without fail reinforce anxieties and complain about things I am doing wrong, too late etc. I have tried talking to her about it, but she says she feels responsible for reminding me about things she doesn't feel I am doing well enough. 

Last week, quite late I know, I told her on her birthday that she could look forward to being a grandmother. To which she responded with negative words like ""oh no, I don't want to be a grandmother, I want to be a young woman…"", but thought I could hear some joy in her voice through it. 

Today she calls me and after letting me know she feels left out for not being told about my child earlier, she continues with a request that I sign a document granting her full access to a bank account in my name which has some of the inheritance money after my grandmother. The money in it was left to her, but transferred to me a decade ago to avoid inheritance taxes, where it has remained untouched. She apparently needs it for doing some work on her drive-way. 

I'm not sure what to do about it. On the one hand, it's her money and she can have it. On the other hand, I can't help but feel like she's trying to punish me in an unfair way, using what she sees as remaining leverage over me to let me know she's unhappy. 

The problem is that she's the kind of person there's no pleasing. She couldn't make things work with my father, who left when I was 3-4. After her mother died, she broke off relations with her only sister due to the inheritance dispute. I understand she's feeling left out, but I had what I don't consider to be a totally unreasonable expectation that she would be happy about the news.

It's become clearer to me that she's acting unhealthily seeing the relationship my girlfriend has with her parents, which is overwhelmingly positive and supportive.

142,"I work a pretty stressful day, consisting of waking up at 5 AM, working out, then going to classes from 7:30 AM to 2:30 PM. I need to hold a 3.7 GPA or my parents will jump down my throat about being lazy with school work. Then after class, I have football until 6, sometimes 7 PM. Then I get home and do school work until 12 AM. Rinse repeat. 

 On top of this, I am looking for colleges and planning a long term future, and that may involve my SO. My anxiety and stress has been fairly high, but the attacks have become frequent, and I can usualy handle the amount of work I have to do daily. 

I relapsed into cutting to help stop the attacks. I was clean for 3 years, but it feels like my only option. 

How can I make the attacks go away? How can I get back to not being a broken mess?",20Sep2017,6

So this morning I woke up and felt this extremely annoying pain in my mouth, and because I have felt this before I know for a fact that this must be my wisdom tooth. The previous time it was on the other side but that did not hurt that much.

So when you have pain in your mouth what do you do? You feel with your tongue. Mouth ouchies 101, right. So, apparently the pain was caused by a huge cyst (swollen skin thingy). So I thought: ""Wow! I should feel this with my finger!"" And it im/ex ploded in my mouth, blood everywhere. So I panicked, and woke up the whole house.

So now I'm waiting for my appointment with the dentist, but: **I FUCKING HATE DENTISTS**. I don't care about the people; I just do not like opening my mouth and let stuff enter, (this will make for such a great blowjob joke) I dont like someone saying ""wider please"" (again, sorry) and the final frustration: WHERE do you look if someone is fingering your mouth?!

At this point I have to wait for 1 hour in agonizing pain, waiting for something that makes me so terrified: the removal of a tooth

How can I calm down? Will it hurt? What do I do in the meantime?",20Sep2017,1
149,"I've suffered from depression from what seems like forever. Sometimes I feel like there is nothing I can do that will make me happy.

I used to be in a relationship with a guy I thought was the love of my life, and I was in a major that I hated (Architecture) at a sub-par, local university. This made me constantly insecure, thinking I could have done better if I hadn't been so lazy. And knowing I didn't want to spend the rest of my life doing Architecture caused me to have constant mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts, and negatively affected my performance in studio. Even my professor told me he could tell I didn't really give a shit anymore. 

It only got worse when the man I thought I was going to marry left me for another woman. After that, I didn't want to be in a relationship ever again. 

Six months later, after a lot of stress and deliberation, I decided to switch majors, and start dating someone I knew from high school.  I also decided apply to a nicer, more prestigious university three hours away from home that has a really good program for the new degree I want to pursue. It thought it was a shot in the dark. 

But by some miracle, I got in! Then, my new boyfriend told me he planned on attending that university in the fall. I panicked. I only intended for the relationship to be a summer fling, and I really just wanted to get a fresh start away from everything (I felt bad for not going away for college, my best friends were constantly bickering, my best friend from high school who also went to the local university dumped me, I had lots and lots of UST with another guy from the school who was kinda abusive towards me). 

However, new guy seemed to be on the same page about our relationship not being too serious. 

We have a really fun summer full of great memories. We see each other often, and like to spend the night together. I'm looking forward to the future. I don't think about suicide once. 

At the end of the summer, he tells me he wants to stay together in the fall, and asks me to tell him I love him. I say ok to staying together, but I'm not at 'I love you' yet. He's really happy about it. 

Then I don't see him for two weeks. He claims he's busy. We both move to our new university, but he's evasive. We barely spend time together. We spend one weekend together, where I tell him I love him. He says it back. I did it. I healed after heartbreak. I felt like everything was gonna be okay. 

But still it was so hard to make plans. I was always the one asking. I kept feeling obsessive and clingy. I never wanted to feel that way again - in love and dependent on someone else to make me happy. This was exactly what I was trying to avoid. 

I tell him how I feel. That I love him, but I feel like he's not meeting me halfway. I'm not ok seeing each other several weeks apart. The relationship is now draining me. I purpose breaking up, and he agrees. 

I'm heartbroken. I love him. He was becoming my best friend, and I still want to be together... But not if he doesn't meet my halfway. I've been crying all night. I feel like an idiot for letting my guard down, and getting my heartbroken again.

And ... I'm really just not happy here. I've known this for weeks. I haven't found a single person or group I click with here. This school is nice, but I don't like this new program, or any of my classes. I feel utterly miserable and alone in this sad, cheap student apartment. Everyday is the same. I never want to get out of bed, and I feel like I'm going crazier and crazier with every passing day. 

I hate it here. I spent a bunch of money on one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. 

The only thing that has ever not made me feel empty is my family and friends. When I'm with my family and friends, I don't worry about the future or my career. I'm in that moment. But they're not here. I miss them so much. 

I don't know what to do, reddit. 

I think deliberately leaving my friends and family behind to ""branch out"" is one of the most self-destructive decisions I've ever made.

Should I try to salvage this relationship? If we still love each other? I can't stop thinking of the amazing memories we made during summer. I knew things would change once we got to college, but he was the one who wanted to stay together. Why did he pull away? What changed? 

Even if we got back together, it won't change the fact I'm unhappy here.

I'm so embarrassed. Everyone was so proud, how do I tell them I want to come back home? That I still don't know what major I want in my third year of college? That I honestly rather die than think about the future for even a second?

Sorry, this is probably longer than it needs to be. I just really need some advice... or just anything encouraging. ",20Sep2017,1
152,"Hey everyone! I can answer any questions you all might have because I understand this is an unbelievable situation. 

I've been working my absolute hardest since I was 16 years old to start college and leave my house. I moved out when I was 16 and it's been a complete struggle since then. I've moved states several times, on my own, and because of several different, varying reasons, I haven't been able to start school. All that I want is to attend college. It's my dream. I've been trying so hard but uncontrollable circumstances keep stopping me. 

My mother passed away a little over a year ago and my father is a borderline psychopath. I moved back in with him this year after not really speaking to him since I was 16, and I'm staying with him currently but it is becoming increasingly difficult. 

I live in Florida and I was planning on moving out soon but I spent all of my savings preparing for Irma. It ended up not even causing damage. 

I do not have any other family members or friends that I can stay with. I don't know what I'm going to do. All I want is somewhere that I can stay comfortably while I prepare for and attend college. I don't mind moving states at all, but I don't have much money. Staying with my father is no longer viable for reasons that I'd rather not mention, if that's okay. I've been fighting the urge to vomit and faint all day because I'm panicking about recent life changes.

I noticed it a few minutes later I guess and the plug was getting really hot. I took all out and saw there was a lot of water coming out. I replaced it with a new one but I still had  few panic attacks that night because I thought it might catch fire.

I usually prefer some alone time in my room. Blocked away from people. 

Sometimes, when I over think about something, something else will pop up in my head? You know what I mean? 

Like, if you're thinking about ice cream but then the memories of your siblings throwing ice cream at you popped up all of a sudden. So that's what I'am going through right now. 

I kept on thinking about having a perfect family but then, the thought of my parents hitting me with a belt popped in my head all of a sudden.

But the good thing is, they stopped. They stopped around a few months ago. Which is not really a long period of time. 

But... Why do I feel so sad? I mean, I don't miss the hitting and kicking. I just feel sad. Nothing happened to me since then but why do I feel so depressed.

175,"We were together for a little over 3 years, almost two of which we pretty much lived together and nearly the last year was long distance. We broke up a year ago, and haven't spoken for 11 months. It was difficult because we loved each other and were close, but there had been a lot of things that built up over time. I was usually the one that wanted out towards the end but would stay when she would convince me to keep trying. In the end we had a fight and afterwards she said she wasn't sure if she still wanted to be in it anymore and didn't know when she would make up her mind. I gave it a couple weeks until I said I was no longer willing to wait for her to figure it out. She wanted to be friends, but I kind of got the feeling that she just wanted to keep me as an option in case she couldn't find anything better. I was also kind of a wreck at the time and needed space to start functioning normally again. I knew that would be the end of it unless I called because her pride would never let her. I know how embarrassing this is but I never completely got over her, even though I've come long way and have been in a couple of short relationships since.

I'm about to graduate from college in December and after that have an opportunity to work abroad for two years come mid-late February. I'm pretty sure I want to do it. It'll give me a chance to see some of the world, learn a new language, and experience new things while I'm still young. I spoke with people who had done it before and their advice was to consider any possible opportunities that I feel would be worth staying for before I made my final decision. After thinking for a while, I realized the only thing that would be worth staying for would be a second chance with my ex. I no longer harbor any of the negative feelings from the relationship and realized we were really good together before things started piling up in the end. 

I've been wrestling back and forth on whether I should try calling her. I would definitely try to be friends at first and see where it takes us if that's the decision I make. I don't need to make a decision on the job for a while so even if we started talking and it goes nowhere, I could still take the job. On one hand I feel like the worse case scenario would be her saying she doesn't want to try to be friends/try over again or simply not answer. On the other hand I feel afraid of being embarrassed or either one of us being sent back into the grieving process. It's like I get nervous just thinking about it, but try to rationalize it by thinking that even in the worst case scenario, at least I would know that there was nothing else I could have done before moving for this job. It's also kind of weird for me because I never really thought about calling to try for another chance until I thought about what would be worth staying for. I don't think I would have ever given real thought about trying again if it wasn't for this situation.

I feel like I'm too close to this to make a rational decision atm and would appreciate any thoughts or advice from outside perspectives.

176,"crossposting from TIFU, want as much help as possible.

This happened two days ago, and I just wanna go back in time to beat the shit out of my stupid self. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Background, I'm currently in college, sophomore year first semester, and I've posted to a subreddit that consists of posted pictures you've, well, ""finished"" to.

I discovered this subreddit back in junior year of High school and thought it was pretty hot (only when I was in play-mode), and followed it for a while before I decided to participate myself, and by participate, I mean post pictures of girls with the title describing vulgar sexual things. I NEVER posted anything there that I knew was under 18. All of the pictures I had posted were from their facebooks.

Jump forward from then to two days ago (Monday), I received a formal message from the Reddit Admin Thunderstruck1918 on Reddit saying I've had a subpoena filed against me. In my panicked stupor, I deleted the Reddit account before saving the message. I've now created this account and messaged Thunderstuck Tuesday morning requesting that he send the message regarding the subpoena again and haven't received a response as of Wednesday morning.

I'm currently on my way to class and I'm scared as hell of this stupid fucking thing I did when I was horny and didn't even go to class yesterday because I was so scared I was on the verge of vomiting all day due to stress and fear. I don't know what to do and I'm scared I'm going to ruin my life because of I'm a fucking horny idiot.

180,"I'm not sure why but this was removed from /r/relationships, so I thought this might be a good place to try.

Alright, bear with me because this story is a little long. I tried to only include things that I thought were necessary though. For the sake of privacy, I’ll call my friend “Jessica.”

It all started when we were 15 (almost 10 years ago now). I grew up as part of a tight-knit group of friends that had known each other since we were toddlers. There were about 7-10 of us depending on the year, including Jessica. She was always…strange growing up. She didn’t really understand social boundaries very well. She would take everyone’s food and drinks without asking them, make inappropriate comments, and climb all over people. She was desperate for love and attention. Jessica’s parents divorced when she was maybe 10; honestly, it’s a little hard to remember, but we were very young.

When we were 15, Jessica told us that her mom had started seeing a new guy. I’ll call him the Fucking Creep…or “Mike” for short. Mike seemed nice enough until the day that Jessica showed up and said he had kissed her goodbye on the lips when leaving her house the night before. She seemed uncomfortable about it, and we all encouraged her to tell her mom about it immediately, but she refused saying it wasn’t that big of a deal. Eventually, her mother married the guy.

Fast forward another couple of years and Jessica and I get together for dinner one night after being away at college for a few months. After talking about my relationship issues for a while, Jessica let me know that she was also seeing someone, but she refused to tell me his name. She said he was an older man whose name started with an “M.” (Some of you may already see where this is going, but it took me another few years.) She said she and M had decided to run away together at some point, but they couldn’t until “everything was right.” I told her that not only did her plan sound insane, but that her whole secret relationship seemed odd. She laughed it off as me being paranoid. 

It’s important to note that by this point, all of us in our friend group had started to take note of where Jessica was heading in life. She had changed her major 5-6 times by that point and dropped out of at least one university. (As of now, I graduated almost three years ago, and Jessica still hasn’t finished a degree course.) She didn’t seem to have a lot of friends outside of us and her immediate family, and with all of us off at college, she had become somewhat of a homebody. She didn’t do much beyond hang out with her mother and stepfather, smoking a bunch of weed. She and I were close, but eventually she started drifting. She ignored my texts and calls, and she would always come up with an excuse not to hang out with me. 

When it came time for my college graduation, another friend from the group decided we should have a dual graduation party. That was the last time I ever spoke to Jessica. At the time, we hadn’t spoken in months, but I knew she was still seeing M. At the end of the party, we’d all planned to go down to the river and smoke a few joints to celebrate. We asked Jessica to come with us and she said she couldn’t. 

*“M doesn’t like it when I do things without him. He’d be upset if I stayed here too long.”*

At that point, having had one too many drinks over the course of the day, and this not being the first comment of this kind we’d heard from Jessica over the years about M, I lost my cool a little bit. I told Jessica that her boyfriend sounded like an abusive creep. She got angry, things got heated, and she left. We haven’t spoken since. No one has spoken to her. She’s cut us all off. 

Two years later (at this point we’re about 8 years from the start of the story if you’ve gotten lost), one of our mutual friends in the group, and my best friend in the world, confessed to me that Jessica had told her years ago that “M” was actually Mike, her stepfather, in confidence. Suddenly everything clicked into place. That explained why he seemed to be the only person she hung out with regularly. It explained why she was always so secretive about her relationship. We also assume that this explains why she cut us all out of her life – we think she was afraid of everybody finding out, especially after I started really pushing the “abusive creep” point. 

My friend shared that she had been tortured for years about what to do with the information. On the one hand, she didn’t want to betray Jessica’s confidence, and she’s a legal adult, so nothing could really be done that we know of. (Please correct me if I’m wrong.) On the other hand, the “relationship” she’s been in for years is abusive and manipulative. Not only that, but Jessica’s mom was like another mom to us growing up, and it makes me sick to think about her finding out what her husband is doing with her daughter. 

Everything almost came to a head a few months ago. Jessica let me know that she wouldn’t be coming to my wedding, which broke my heart. Ever since we were little girls, we’d talked about how we’d be right there with each other in our wedding days. I got angry and told her I knew about M and assumed he was the reason she had dropped out of my life. Because of some weird phone issues though, I was never sure whether or not she got the texts. If she did, she never responded, but she did delete her Facebook page the next day. 

Please help us reddit. We ignored this for so long and the guilt is eating us up inside. Even if there’s nothing that can be done for Jessica, I hate knowing what they’re doing to her mother. We’ve considered talking to Jessica directly, but I don’t know if that’s going to work ever since those texts. We’ve also considered going to her older sister and letting her know what’s going on so she can decide the best way to handle it. Or would it be better for us to just forget her entirely? 

**TL;DR -- One of my oldest and dearest best friends has been sleeping with her stepfather for almost a decade now. We didn’t know for a long time, and once we found out, we struggled with what to do with the information. However, given her increasing isolation and the fact that she doesn’t seem to have any interest in leaving her home in her mid-twenties, we feel like we can’t hang onto this anymore. What course of action should we take?**",20Sep2017,110
181,"My ex and I broke up two and a half months ago. I went back and forth from wanting to be with him to pushing him away for a while prior to our split....for various reasons.... long story short, I loved him with my whole heart but because of my past,  I was scared to go all in.
I realized not long after I made a huge mistake but he wouldn't budge, we were done.

Fast forward to the past month. We've gone out a few times, talk and text fairly regularly.  Dates have only ended with a hug...which is fine. 
Last week, for the first time since our break up, instead of saying 'let's wait and see what happens' he admitted that yes, he wants us to get back together.
We had lunch the next day......then I get one text the next day and didnt hear from him for a day after that even though we agreed to start communicating more while we work things out.

Monday this week we went out and had a great time, I actually don't remember the last time I saw him so happy.... then Tuesday I text him that I was going to call him on my way home from work....no response. I called, no answer.

I've not said anything about it.. I don't ask why he does it. He says he loves me.
But how in the world does he say he wants to get back together and we will work on communicating more...go out with me and have a great time, then not talk to me??
I think he's conflicted, nervous or maybe even testing me to see if I backtrack again but geez.... we agreed to go slow but his mixed signals are killing me.

I guess I'm looking for advice from people who have done similar or been through similar and how to handle it.
I don't want to confront him in a way that makes me look clingy or insecure but I still want him yo know it confuses me and know why he does it.
When we were together, we talked, text and saw each other all the time.

182,"A few days ago I turned 24 but I was not excited to celebrate my birthday. In fact, I was horrified and even embarassed.

This started to happen when I was around age 22-23 but I was already feeling like I was too late in life. Like I was too late to have my shot to be able to have a good future in my life.

I know that everyone goes through tough situations in their lives and everyone makes mistakes and have to go through obstacles.

Basically, shit happens to everyone. A lot and most of them come unexpected.

But I felt like this ever since I was a teenager - even though the world is very vast and has lots of things going on with lots of things happeneing at once, it is very impatient and wants things to be done **pronto!**

There are so many things going on and to catch up with everything is a nightmare and the world is changing incredibly and it is a lot of pressure on the competitive nature of the capitalistic world we live in.

I really wished that I had a grip in my life much earlier but I was a kid before - I was an idiot with no clear goal and well ... shit happened. **A lot**

Bullies, abuse and so much more and in the end, it scarred me and it scarred me for so many years that only now I wanted to take charge and actually do something about it but every day, I keep blaming myself for allowing these things to happen to me **AND** that I allowed myself to be such a weakling and make myself into a shadow of my own self and be a pussy instead of actualyl grabbing my own nuts like other people do and keep going and move on.


But I was pushed back in a way and I felt stuck for many years.

I did manage to eventually try to push myself to keep going back on track but half of my attention is always concerning that I started to get a grip on my own life too late so I feel that I am mostly battling against my own guilt and shame and embarassed that I am too late and should already just give up *(honestly, I feel tempted to do that everyday)*

Everyday, I keep making comparisons with everyone and often see everyone better than me. Better grades, better income, better lives, better possible futures, more happiness, more confidence and so much more 

*(it's what the competitive nature makes you do. It makes you always insecure and paranoid that someone may take your place and ruin your future. It's like a game of survival like the Hunger Games or the apocolypse)*



I feel like i am stuck in both my past and my future, afraid of both sides and afraid and confused on what to do. 

Stuck because I feel like I have a lot of baggage about my past self and looking deep into myself to look into my own shattered soul is a fucking nightmare and a job that will take forever and incredibly painful.

On the other hand, I am afraid of the future. I keep making countless and countless possible calculations and preparations for the worst like what if this guy is better than me. Should I study harder? What if I will not pass this test? Should I apply for a job already?

It's extremely infuriating and scary especially when you own soul feels broken and your mind against you and criticizing your every move *(it's trying to push yourself while trying to fix yourself at the same time while trying to battle against countless waves of enemies like the demons of the entire hell are after you)(

Honestly, I am 24 and I am still at university doing my bachelor degree. There are those days where I feel very embarrassed that I haven't graduated yet while people younger than me already did. *(that comparison in age. People love to praise people who are already in an advantage when they are so young)*

And I know that I have made many mistakes in my life and the shame and the guilt is very strong and very deep everyday but the worst part is that I have a poor habit of ruminating about those mistakes and unable to forgive myself or tackle it to make sure that I have the right strategy to tackle it if I ever happen to make that mistake again or avoid doing it.

Most of the time when I make a mistake, I go into a dark spiral of shame and guilt and sheer self-criticism and I end up in a cycle of criticism and doing those mistakes again and feel even worse in the process.

Sometimes I even ruminate about my ruminating habit as well which makes the burden and guilt much worse and this habit has been happening for years and affected how I look at myself and affected how I work and how I think during my studies *(which is the worst becuase the education system have ""no mistake"" policy and have a ""pass or fail"" mentality and also the most important thing in my life for many years so it causes a lot of anxiety and fear in my life)*



How can I break this habit? What strategies I can use to help myself from going deeper into the cycle of depression, anxiety and EXTREME self-hatred and self-loathing and suicidal thoughts?

How can I really and truly stop being afraid of the future and stop criticising myself for pretty much anything because I feel like I am at the bottom of the food chain and I feel like I have no chance to survive in life?

Honestly, I often feel that I should just grab a gun and shoot myself and save all the trouble from trying to push myself when it will be all for nothing and avoid all the humiliation and embarassed. Many people have already managed to achieve a lot in life and I feel that I was left behind and I feel that maybe I should just give up. I cannot risk experiencing further humiliation than I already have *(and people LOVE humiliating others. We know already how much we love to humiliate those who failed or suffered like in history class like Hitler or right now, there is a film being made about the worst film in history because love to humiliate those who were involved. I just cannot risk making myself go down that road and risk further embarassement for years to come)*",20Sep2017,3
184,"So, this is borderline ""relationship advice"" territory but I will give it a shot here. 

Several years ago my then-gf moved into a new apartment. Due to the size of the apartment, she couldn't keep her big leather sectional sofa. So I agreed to hold onto it for her. It has been in my living room since then. 

Of course, we ended up breaking up. It was a gut-wrenching breakup, although sad, not mean-spirited and we had to go no contact. I initiated the breakup, and she was devastated. There was no cheating or dramatic problems, it just wasn't working for me. 

This was almost 3 years ago. About two years ago I started seeing someone new, and we are now engaged and will be moving in together next spring. I haven't spoken to the ex in the past two years beyond a ""happy birthday"" text I got from her this past March. 

Meanwhile the leather sofa is still in my place. I'm seriously flustered about what to do with it.

If I get rid of it now, I will need to buy a new sofa, but I don't have the money and I don't really WANT to buy a new sofa six months before I combine households with my fiancée. I don't really want to keep it, though, because I keep remembering it's HERS.

But regardless of when it happens, how do I deal with it? I'm an honest/fair person, so the idea of just getting rid of it seems really unfair and rude to me. It's an expensive piece of furniture, still in good shape, and my ex was not of means."" But the idea of reopening contact with my ex is stressful - she took the breakup super hard and I have no doubt it will open up old wounds for her - over a couch. My ex was a little volatile and struggled with anxiety/depression. I have no ill will towards her and have no desire to cause her more pain.  

So, fellow Redditors, what would you do?",20Sep2017,1

187,"I'm an 18(m) and my dads...well he's old I'll say that.  Him and I have been just strange to eachother for a very long time now. He's now slowly becoming someone I can't talk too about anything; A: because he tends to brush off what I talk about or suggest about my life (my life's changing quite abit since finishing school) B: it usually ends up with him telling me I'm overreacting and that I'm being ""too emotional"" about things. I really want to be able to have a relationship with my dad where I can talk about these sorts of things freely and feel safe being myself because right now I feel uncomfortable being myself towards my dad. 


Now I love my dad, heaps, he's done so much for me financially, giving me a great up bringing, big house, great schooling all that sort of stuff that I'm extremely grateful for!!! But I sometimes feel emotionally I never had a dad I could talk to things about and I feel like it's never to late to try and build a relationship like that with him. 


Why it's broken is mainly my fault...I'm assuming because I don't have the courage to point the finger and my dad. I went through a bad relationship and made bad choices out of emotions I still believe are justified (the girl was a bit of an emotional mess and I wanted to be there for her) I just rubbed off the wrong way with dad pretty much loosing his trust. I've never been perfect and I goof up a lot I know that about myself I'm clueless, oblivious, thoughtless, overeactive the likes whatever and yeah sometimes it really gets me down how imperfect I am at times sometimes i don't know why and it feels like I'm always doing something wrong no matter what or when. Sometimes I'll be abit defensive when dad asks a question but idk how to explain it's because I feel uncomfortable and threatened by him. 


I've always been different to the family, I think I'm just more emotional and sentimental than everybody else. I love music, like unquestionably I really want music to be the rest of my life. I get really passionate about music and my dad kinda started that for me (I really owe him so much) but he brushes me off when I talk about music or get abit passionate like I'm just running my mouth. A counsellor I mentioned this too said to me ""are you exaggerating and running your mouth or are you being passionate"". I feel like I'm being expressive now but to him I'm being over the top and exaggerating myself. I feel emotionally trapped because of this and these thoughts and ideas and aspirations in life I can't talk to my dad about. People tell me I'm just passionate and expressive whereas dad says otherwise idk who to believe.


I want to talk to him and rebuild our relationship but I'm scared I've done too much for him to really want to listen, he often doesn't really listen to my point of view or my intentions but just seems to question everything to the point where I'm just like ""I won't do it don't worry"" and idk what I do but hell follow it up with ""why do you act like I pick on you so much"" I don't feel that way I just act that way because I don't know how else to act.


It upsets me a lot that I can't be so close with my dad, most of the time it feels distant and strange like I can really talk to him.  What do you guys reckon I should do? I need to try something.

188,"I'm 21 years old and a recent college graduate. My grades were, quite frankly, pretty bad, because I went through college trapped in a weird depressive funk and never bothered to really study; I'd gotten tired of education and the education system in general (I'm from India, if that helps). 

I thought I had no chance in hell of getting accepted to grad school with my marks, so I hunted for places willing to offer me an internship or an entry-level job. Within a few weeks I'd been hired as a social media intern by a digital marketing firm for a 3-month internship period, and a chance of a job offer if I do well; I've only been here 2 weeks so I can't really tell, but my boss is hinting at giving me a proper position when my official internship period ends - whether that happens or not, I'm going to give this my best shot and I really do need the experience on my resume.

Just yesterday, a seat at grad school opened up for me after quite a few students cancelled their admissions/never bothered to show up for their interviews (results were really delayed this year, they're not the most organized of universities); I have three days to formally enroll in an MA degree program in English Lit. I don't really want to go because I'd end up wasting two years of my life, two valuable years that I could use to gain work experience in instead (the program is full-time and the university generally doesn't make concessions for working students) and I really have had enough of the Indian education system. I want to use the time to work on my own projects and build a good career in media. 

The problem, however, is my mom. She has this old-school mentality that graduates with a master's degree earn more somehow, and has been constantly guilt-tripping me into accepting the seat. She's sad that I didn't get hired by a big company right away and thinks that an MA will help me do that. 

Why do I ""need"" to get a master's in English? So I can be over-qualified for most jobs? I don't ever intend to teach, so why I need another degree is beyond me. I'm at a loss as to how to deal with her. If anyone could help me make a coherent argument that I can talk to her with, I'd be grateful. 

TLDR - I don't want a master's degree, mom does. How do I tell her to go away and let me live?",20Sep2017,1
189,"Hullo!

I'm currently doing my 5 + 1 years of (Laboratory technician/laborant/Chemistry Associate Degree)/high school diploma combined degree (officially 14 yo at start, 20 at the end.) While most of my classmates found themselves loathing physical chemistry, I found myself rather enamored in it finally answering a lot of my ""But why does it do that/why do we do it like that"" questions from elementary chemistry. 

So far my experience is:
* I interned beside a chemical engineering grad student and didn't really find it enjoyable, even accounting for intern-experience.  Simply put, the idea of focusing on machinery and optimization of existing reactions/processes with purpose of enhancing said private entity's ability to make bigger profits doesn't appeal to me.
* I also interned in a pharmaceutical company as in-production QA laboratory assistant, and while I found it more enjoyable, it still didn't feel very fulfilling (especially with the aspect of being employed by a private entity)  
However, I can imagine working as a QA-esque chemist for a non-profit or as a public worker focusing on environmental sciences or making sure a state-ran power plant doesn't blow up.

However, most listings that are in line with QA-esque chemistry are aimed at Associate Degree (laboratory tech) and Master's degree (laboratory supervisor), with PhD only coming up as director positions. I intend to get a PhD in a field of chemistry.

Most people from my school intending to get a PhD aim for pharma, but again, I run into the issue of it being mostly for private entities.

I really do not find working for private entities, with maybe the exception of non-profit corporations, to be appealing to me.

With the above in mind, what should I do if the reason I want to study and work with chemistry is to observe and try to explain how reactions/processes/interactions work, and/or the chemical composition of things.

If it matters, I live in the EU (Hungary), but plan to move to EU (Denmark) for my studies and if possible, stay there permanently.",20Sep2017,1
191,"Hello, last fall, I interviewed with a company in order to get an internship this summer.  I am fairly confident they were going to choose me, but they decided they could not bring on another intern for the summer.  My GPA was a little over 3.5 then.  This past spring semester, I failed two classes and got a D in another one.  My GPA is now 3.06, and I am interviewing with them again tomorrow for a possible spring Internship.  I sent my resume ahead of time by email, so they will already know my GPA, but how should I go about talking about what happened? I had some personal issues at the time that contributed to it, but I don't want to make excuses or necessarily bring up my personal life in an interview.

194,"About a year ago they were in a bind, saying that the current place they were staying was far too cramped with 2 other families in a 4 bedroom townhome. They've got 3 kids, 2 of them sharing one room and the other staying in the same room as them. They came to me and my spouse saying they couldnt take living there anymore, that it was tough being around one person in particular who seemed to hate their kids and the wife and it was affecting them. They were also frequently picking up the slack when the other two families didnt clean up, and cooked for them on occasion but there was still animosity between them and this one other family. We were moving, and they asked if they could move in with us for a while. We saw they were struggling and love them both and their kids, so we agreed to getting a new place and allowing them to stay with us and our kids for a couple of years.

Over the course of the last year, we've had numerous arguments between two of their kids and ours who are the same age, and when I've tried to step in and parent their kid the way i parent mine, it's gone from being ok to ""over-stepping my bounds"" in their eyes. I've since laid off and just deferred their kids to their parents, but this one in particular has a way of making them feel guilty about not getting her way, and half the time they give in. Since i've laid off she's been getting her way a lot more often, taking things without asking (though I'd asked her to ask me when going for stuff i bought, so i can keep track of what i need to buy at the very least), and complaining to her parents when she doesnt get the thing she wanted, even if they've already said no. 

I've also been stressed with going to college and working a full time job, so when im moping around the house, they call it a negative influence on their kids. I've since tried actively working on this, but only very recently. I'd be stressed out and would be more harsh with my son who's the same age as their daughter, and i've begun working on that to the point where if im feeling like im losing my temper, i dont yell at him when he makes a mistake.

Fast forward to today and apparently it's been so tough living with us that once they got the chance to move out, the day after, they tell my spouse and i that they're going to start looking to move in a few months. This puts us in a bind financially because with two families, especially with younger kids, there has been a lot of wear and tear on the house. The washer and dryer broke down, the dishwasher is almost gone, the faucet in the kitchen is leaking, there are stains on the carpets and the walls in various places throughout the house, and we were expecting that they would stay for at least two years so we could at least save up to pay down the damages, which we're not asking they pay for, save one thing, which theyre only partially paying for (and havent, yet). 

They on the other hand thought for some reason they would only stay until they could afford to leave. We didnt ask for first and last month's rent to stay with us nor a deposit. It now looks like they're going to leave as soon as possible, and though I've asked them to stay another year to help us since their absence would leave us with a LOT of damages to the house that we dont have the funds to pay for (though i've only told them that we'd have a tough time financially without them), they seem to be trying to find any way to not have to live with us any longer. Should I keep asking them to stay? Or would it be better for all of us if I just tell them to go and we'll take the losses on ourselves?

TL;DR I helped my brother and sister by letting them live in our new house which they trashed and are now trying to leave us without helping us in return.",20Sep2017,3
195,"Thank you for reading. I'm sorry it's really long.

I really don't know what to do. I've had bad chronic headaches for 3 years, neck muscle spasm pain/shoulder pain for almost a year, my face is slightly swollen, jaw pain for about 8 months ( I got braces which caused me to clench so I had to get them removed early and now I can’t stop clenching and I have TMJ), and episodes of sharp jabbing/ burning pain all over my face for about 6 months and foot pain for about 6 years. The pain just takes over my life and allows me to do so little. I can’t get out and do much. Sometimes I just start crying/screaming it gets so intense. I've been to every doctor and they don't have any answers. I've tried so many different drugs that don't work and just give me bad side effects. I've had physiotherapy, massage therapy, and chiropractors. Massage is the only thing that gives me a little bit of relief. I’ve had lots of those. My parents don’t have coverage or bad coverage and now in September they say that I’m going to have to start paying. I only have a couple thousand dollars. I'm 15 and things aren't great at home. 
My brother has always treated me very badly. I am told when I was born (he was 4 at the time) he would have dreams about trying to hurt me and would tell his parents he wanted to hurt me. Though my life he has always treated me like shit. Threaten to hurt me (punch me, kick me, throw things at me,etc.) make fun of basically everything I do and repeatedly tells me I wreck the family, am useless/worthless, that he wishes he could get rid of me, says nobody wants me/cares about me, calls me an idiot, one time said he would like to kill me (he said he would like to kill someone but it was obvious he was taking about me), ect. I haven't been well lately I can't go to school that often and he always makes fun of me about that. A couple times he has hit me. One time he was really bothering me and being rude to me so I lost it and threw a tv remote at him about chest level (he will always claim it was at his face, it never even hit him) so he charged at me and pushed me into the wall unit. I went threw the wood part and thankfully my leg was just badly bruised but u almost went threw the glass. He will often threw stuff at me (tonight it was his pants, last week it was a dirty rag). I don't feel safe. My parents don't do much about it. My mother takes his side 90% of the time and just tells me to ""stay out of his way"". The rest of my family isn't very nice to me some do the time (I have made previous posts about it) and will probably treat me worse if I call the police. My bother makes me feel very unsafe. He is 19, and 5'11. I'm 15, 5'1 and 95lbs.


My dad has been rude to me lately when I'm in pain and can't do what he wants. He has said I'm a fucking retard, that I must have an IQ of 2, that he wishes he had never had me, that I'm a moron, that I am stupid, etc. One time when I was crying/screaming because of the pain he was yelling at me to stop because it was so loud and he wanted to sleep. I couldn't stop the pain was so bad, My mascara ran and he told me to ""go wash my monkey face"". He was coming after me and I got scared that he was going to hurt me so I kicked him in the leg and then he grabbed me by my face, hard, where the pain was and he pushed me into the couch and it hurt really bad. He was also being rude to me again yesterday. I was crying because my head, jaw, and neck hurt really bad and I also have caught a bad cold now. He was going on about how stupid I was acting the other day and I lost it and therw something at the wall, which left a small mark. He just threathened to make me sleep in the back yard. My mother came down and yelled at him to treat me nicer when I was in pain. He just says that I’m making the whole thing up and that if I was really in pain I would take the drugs (I have been prescribed lots of medications that either don’t work or I can’t take them because they make me too  tired, dizzy, have blurred vision,  or give me a worse headache).  
My mother and I get along most of the time. She is quite nice to me about 60% of the time. Most of the problem is she is very anti-LGBT. I’m a closeted bisexual and I can’t tell anyone because my family is completely anti-LGBT. My mother is a strict Christian and makes me tell her that it is wrong to be gay after even watching a TV show with a gay character. LGBT kids are made fun of at school too. I’ve told my parents that I want to die. My father just tells me not to do anything stupid. My mother used to tell me how she would miss me and that that can’t happen but one time she was mad that I was crying and yelled at me to go downstairs and die. 
I feel like my family is making me go crazy. I feel like I am treated very badly and I’m doing crazy things. I tried to tell this to my mother and she just says that “I make my family feel unsafe”. She says that if I go and talk to someone they will just put me in a group home. She says that I have a pretty good home life that I should be thankful for.
I think I’m going to have to drop out of school. School just started and it's too hard for me. The chairs hurt my neck, classes are loud, sometimes the lights make my headache worse, and it's too hard for me to keep up with the work. 

I thought that I could drop history, and science which I have in the morning this semester. Those subjects are the hardest for me and I thought I could do science in the summer and history online on the morning. Then I could just go to school in the afternoon for guitar and math. 

It turns out that all the free online classes are full. The only ones available are $600. If I dropped out of school completely I could do online school for $40 a course. It also turns out that o have been wasting my time on guitar class as I don't actually need it to graduate since I got a music credit last year. 

My guidance guidance counsellor suggested I either drop out of school completely and do the online option for $40 a course . He also said he could switch my schedule so I can just come in on the afternoons and do history and math (tho I would be losing 2 credits completely. And I find it very hard to be in the classes because of the chairs, noise, lights, etc.).  

I don't know what to do. I am still waiting for a few doctors appointments in the next couple months where they might be able to help me with the pain. 
I don't want to be home all day. I have nothing to do, but school has just been making the pain worse.
I’ve started to “cut”, aka running a push pin into my skin and it leaves light marks. I have tried to commit suicide 3 times and all I think about is how to kill myself. I don’t know who to contact for help. I don’t want to be put in a group home. I don’t feel safe at home. I feel scared someone is going to hurt me. There is a nurse/physiologist I can talk to at my school but whatever I tell her will go on my permanent record. I don’t know if I should try to contact the Trevor Project or Kids Help Phone to talk to someone. I don’t know what any of these people will do if I go and contact them. I thought about checking myself into the hospital but it’s a 2 day wait for a bed. I need help. I'm from Canada if that helps.

198,"Working at a theme park I meet so many people. These places have such a high turn over rates. Anyways, about three years ago this girl in another department would not stop smiling at me. I never got enough courage to talk to her, I had just got out of a really bad relationship and my confidence was at an all time low. One time she even sprayed me with a water toy and giggled and smiled at me. She seemed like a total sweetheart and genuinely wanted me to talk to her. I did however stalk her on Facebook through friends of friends a few times and by the end of the summer she had a boyfriend. I checked up on her today and now she has now moved over 100 miles and no more boyfriend. Its been three years and I can't stop thinking about her and that smile. Even if it wasn't for dating she just seems like someone I would want to be around. Should I try and talk to her or do I let her go and hope she lives a happy life? I really don't want to be that creep on the internet anymore.
I know I am an idiot for not even trying.

199,"My absolute dream is to work with animals. Specifically a veterinarian of sorts. I would love nothing more than to go back to college &amp; start working towards my degree. 
However, I work full-time. I'm 20 years old &amp; live with my fiance; we both work full-time so that we can pay our rent, bills, etc. I HAVE to work (as well as him) otherwise we will have no where to live. We don't really have family to rely on. 

Working full-time during the day &amp; schooling at night would not be a problem for me. I fully belive I could do it. The problem is, I have been offered a part-time job at PetSmart (on the weekends &amp; some nights during the week). My full-time job is shipping/recieving secretary at a local seafood distributor (I live in a coastal town centered around seafood). I don't really ""enjoy"" it, but It's nice paying, has a great Mon-Fri schedule, &amp; keeps me financially afloat. So, I HAVE to stay. 

Working at PetSmart seems like an awesome, educational &amp; ENJOYABLE experience that I don't want to pass up. My problem is that I dont believe I could handle a full-time job, a part-time job, AND college (STUDYING). It just seems a little too much at one time, for me.

200,"I need some help because I cannot figure out what to do.

I have a cousin who has been homeless for about 2 years I think. It started with drug use in middle school. He was causing a lot of trouble and then started getting in to heavier drugs near the end of high school. I am not exactly sure about the timing but I know he was using Molly, Cocaine, and Meth. 

This has caused him to go into psychotic episodes where he would lash out at whichever family member was housing him (because his mother kicked him out because she was afraid to live in her own home). Before most of the family stopped talking to him he would get into arguments with nobody and start yelling at the air. 

I recently saw him wandering the streets again and it was painful to see him like that. I really want to help him but I have a small child at home and am not going to put him in any danger. I tried looking for inpatient care that he can be admitted to but the information is really hard to find or understand.

He really distrusts doctors for fear of being mistreated and taken advantage of. He also claims to be sober and that he is sane, so he does not need any psychiatric medication. He still talks and has arguments with nobody, claiming he has three personalities, God, The Devil, and himself.

1. How can I convince him that he needs help? That doctors are NOT going to mistreat him?
2. How should I speak to him? Are there things that I definitely should not say that would put him on the defensive?
3. IF he even wants help, what can I do to find a hospital that will take him in? Where do I even look? (He is near Portland, OR)",20Sep2017,4
202,"Backstory- 
been with him 2 years, I'm 20 he's 24. We met on a dating app. Everything goes great typically, well until recently. He works once a week if even that, never likes to do nice things for me, a lot of times i don't feel cared about, and he's terrible with realizing he needs to grow up and stop sleeping all day and get on with his life.

Basically, we had a fight yesterday afternoon because I was supposed to hangout with him at 1PM. Well, 5PM and he finally texts me that he just woke up. Obviously I was pissed. I gave him the ultimatum that if he doesn't get a job or start working more and doesn't stop leeching off his parents then I'm moving on. He got pissed and hasn't talked to me since then, except sending me a message at 3AM of a quote I never said. 

I feel like he's talking to someone else, because he never shows me his phone and I'm not even allowed to touch it. I know people are possessive of things like that, but he is open to mine whenever. I feel like I have no way to talk to him without him getting pissed or completely ignoring me. I want the best for him, but it's like he doesn't care. I'm at a point where I feel like I have no option but to leave if he doesn't change soon. When I say ""you should probably work more, don't you want to work towards living together?"" He says ""I'm young, I don't have to worry about working now and I'm just trying to enjoy life"". 

Am i being paranoid.. or...

I feel like he just doesn't care, at all. I'm so stuck and have like 300 emotions and questions and thoughts going through my mind I don't even know how to think. Would you stay and see if he picks up the slack or leave and move on? Especially if you love him but he has no ambition...",20Sep2017,1
203,"   I was living in Colorado and my stepfather died so my husband, son, and I came to Oklahoma to renovate my Mom's house for her. Well my best friend that lives here decided he was going to break it off with his asshole boyfriend of 6 years, so I offered to watch his son while he works because he is a night shift nurse.
    I told him we would do it for just a case of beer and just doing it out of love. Well a year goes by. He decides to take classes even though he is a busy nurse and a single parent. He had to drop those classes because he couldn't keep up, even though I told him he shouldn't do it in the first place. Well the whole year goes by and I tell him over and over that watching his son, and my son together is incredibly stressful, and he should look for a babysitter because we will be leaving and it is just stressful for us. 

    He never even looked for a babysitter. He brought beer maybe once a month, and besides that brought food for his son, maybe a handful of times. And bought toothpaste once. We fed, bathed, did dishes for his son overnights for a year. He never offered to compensate us once. My husband mentioned he thought I was being taken advantage of.

   Because while we were watching his son, and our son the same age of 7, I am in college classes, and remodeling a house. My friend never came over once to offer to help us renovate the house, and just ignored my pleas of please find a babysitter because it is so stressful. 

    Well he got a new boyfriend that moved into his house after a couple of months of dating. Said boyfriend started picking up his son at night after we'd watch him for a couple of hours and feed him, brush his teeth, and get him dressed. The boyfriend moved out after 2 weeks of this.

  The boyfriend got back together, helped out again for 3 weeks and then went out to the bar and started taking pictures with another guy who just hit them both up for a threesome, trying to make my friend jealous, he called the cops while I was sleeping at my friend's house and it was a bunch of drama. 

 The guy moved out, stole stuff from my friend. Well my husband and I rush over there to comfort my friend, my husband moved a heavy washer back into his house, and that night. We had a sleeping arrangement where my husband and son slept in the spare room on a small futon, and I slept in bed with my friend. Well his ex boyfriend decides to come over to ""talk things out"" and I ended up getting booted from the bed, had to sleep on the futon, and my husband has to sleep on the floor.

    That made me mad, because I felt like after all that we have helped, for free, and stressed out our lives, inconveniencing ourselves, that he should have told that guy to go home because we were staying there. We were staying there that one night, also, because my mom's hot water tank had busted and didn't have water that night. I had expressed to my friend that I thought it was pretty rude of him to put us out like that, for a person he hadn't even known for a year.
 

  So the next day I said, I can't watch your son anymore because it is too stressful with the house renovation being one disaster after the next, and since he obviously doesn't respect us enough to do anything for us, I decided I wasn't going to put myself out for him anymore. Well, I didn't say it meanly at all. I am a people pleaser and don't want to ruffle feathers. 


    2 days later was my husband's birthday. And my friend says we are his best friends. He didn't even tell my husband happy birthday until after midnight, through a text. When he knew we were all going out with close friends. I had even found him a reliable babysitter that he could use, he hasn't called her at all. But the week before he got a sitter so him and his bf could go to the movies. So I got really angry with him, and I have never been in an argument with him for 14 years. But I told him that it was fucked up that he could just make my husband sleep on the floor, after everything we've done for him. And that I expect at least for him to be a good friend and do something for my husband's birthday.




    No call, no appearance, no present, nothing. He hasn't apologized to us, and so I feel like I need to cut this person out. He has been on 2 vacations in the last year BTW, and paid for his boyfriend to go to San Diego. Never offered us any compensation, didn't follow through with the initial deal, never offered to come help us even once. My mom told me that I need to stop getting walked all over. He obviously just cared about the money we we're saving him, and didn't care that it was stressing out our lives. 



    And all i really want is an apology. Some acknowledgement. But it's been a week and he hasn't even tried. My other friend of 15 years, his girlfriend which we've never even done anything for, called my husband and asked what kind of cake he liked for his birthday. Many other acquaintances tried harder than someone whose supposed to be my ""best friend"". I feel like I've finally reached my limit. But at the same time I have always been there for this person, and he has been there emotionally for me. We have a great time together. But I don't feel like we have been treated fairly. I'd really just like some insight.",20Sep2017,1
204,"Hi all,

I hope you are all doing well today.

So I am a 33-year-old male, looking to make some drastic changes to my life-career. I am married to a wonderful woman, that is incredibly supportive, works from home and is willing to relocate to pretty much anywhere in the world; solid family relationships, I have good group of friends, multiple hobbies including archery, martial arts and woodworking, healthy, no kids (not planning on having any), and what some would call a ""good job"".

I am currently employed at a prestigious university in southern California, working as a clinical research coordinator/researcher at a lab that focuses on metabolic diseases such as diabetes and fatty liver. This job offers decent (at best) pay, good hours and good benefits. And, even though it appears that it is a good spot to be in, I am secretly dreading my career. The thought of having to spend the rest of my working life, inside an office, looking at computer monitors all day, dedicating my life to help people that are not willing to take care of their own health, or worse yet, not take care of their children's health; is terrifying. Moreover, in order for me to advance in the research ladder, I would invariably need to get a Ph.D., which of course entails 5-6 years of intense schoolwork,  loss of income, and, it would still leave me in a position that is subject to all of the negatives I listed prior.

So, I come to you fellow redditors for advice... What would you guys tell a friend, husband, or son that is in a similar situation?

Some of the things that I am looking for in a ""dream"" job are: decent pay (not asking to get rich, simply live a comfortable life), variety, excitement, camaraderie and not having to go get in deep debt to go back to school.

Thank you in advance for your help",20Sep2017,5

- Should I put off my love of animation and pursue the computer engineering degree for now or vice versa?
- Which should I focus on getting first?
- If I have the opportunity/time, should I attempt to pursue both degrees at once?

207,"My wife and I decided to get a set of security cameras for our flat. They come with a sticker you can place on your door that basically says ""this home is under surveillance."" 

We can only place it within our flat since I don't think we're allowed to place in common areas. Never bothered checking with admin. 

Anyway, we're debating whether it makes more sense to let potential intruders know that they're being observed and thus deter them from breaking in and stealing anything, or to keep it secret so we can alert police if anyone breaks in and catch them red-handed (which is something a friend has done before).

I'm partly of opinion that announcing the presence of cameras will deter all but the most determined thieves, but this would also 1) imply that we have valuables worth stealing, and 2) allow them to look for and try to avoid and/or disable the system. 

The compromise I thought of is to place the sticker somewhere intruders would see it  AFTER they've likely been recorded, although this still loses some the sticker's utility as a deterrent.

210," just a question to people out there who do labor type jobs. I hired a handyman for a job. He went to a store with me and did the job that day- helping me pick out a door. All he had to do was do a simple indoor door installation of a sliding door. He told me the job cost 400.00 and i said- well most people charged me 200 or so. He said he wasn't going to do 'drywall' and then charged me 300.00. I agreed b/c he made it sound labor intensive. He lied and said it would take eight hours..The job literally took an hour or so. I told him i didn't think 300 was a fair price for that kind of job- a literal one hour job which was very little work. He brought it down to 270.00. I said 260 and he didn't agree. He said he had 600.00 worth of tools. I'm thinking..right bullshit? I just agreed b/c he seemed like a nasty person.  A one hour simple door installation which was so easy to do and a person is charging 270- is that a ripoff...

disagree with the con-artists who think it's ok to lie about the time and then overcharge people- it's deceptive and wrong...one hour vs 8 hours- person was a total scumbag. im in sales and though other sales people suck i never screw people over or overcharge them or anything.

211,"I recently became a new homeowner and I've been hesitating to throw a housewarming party because I'm basically afraid people won't show up. 

This fear stems from the past when I had a birthday party, which i never do for myself, and invited a bunch of ppl to it. I thought I had a lot of friends from the church I went to and I invited all of them. Next thing you know, they all cancel. Which meant my bday party was going to be rather empty with only most of work ppl. In my embarrassment I started inviting ppl out of desperation and totally regret doing it. When My bday comes up it was just a handful of us there, then all the girls left and didn't even stay for my cake. It was honestly one of the worst days of my life, I just wanted that day to be over since it started. 

It did however, teach me something very valuable, and that's who my real friends were. I thought they were but that just showed me who they were really. Whenever other ppl from that group have parties, they all show up, or they don't invite me to some. But since they didn't show up for mine, I don't make an effort to even talk with them.

221,"I'm going to start with an explanation of our family situation. My husband and I have been together since 2005. When we first got together he had custody of three children - two stepchildren boy 9 and girl 7, and a son 4. He got the kids when he divorced his first wife. His ex-wife is a low-life and lives several states away. She is married. She and her husband are very poor druggies. When his stepston turned 12 he chose to go and live with his mother. When his stepdaughter turned 12, she did the same thing. The stepson never came back (it turned out his mother was telling him that we refused to take him back). Our stepdaughter did come back in less than a year. However, she became involved with drugs at 16. When we found out and grounded her, she went to go live with her mother. She did try to get us to let her move back home, but we would not let her because she was still on drugs and behaving in a shady manner. She got pregnant. We let her and her boyfriend move in with us. The baby is now 6 months. The parents are clean. My husband got the baby's father a good job. My daughter (I've done most of the raising, I get to call her mine.) has had 4 jobs in that last year. She quit working in August and started college. Last week she said she needed to change her major. This week she has not been to class. (Excuses for everything, but if she was serious she could have made it to class.) 

My husband's son from his first marriage - Chad - is a senior in high school. He is very smart but very lazy. His grades have been a constant issue. However, since the beginning of this school year his grades have shown improvement. It has always been a big question whether we should support his decision to go to college. Not support him financially, we can't afford that. But, if he goes to college and performs like he has in high school, then he will just fail out and end up with a bunch of debt from student loans. Also, I have maintained for years that I will not allow an adult child to live in my house without working/being in school and contributing to expenses. I see Chad failing out of college and expecting to live with us and play video games all day. He thinks he is too good to work at fast food or factory jobs.

My husband despises his job. Last December he went to a meeting at a site in Canada and was super impressed by how well things are managed there. He came back saying that if he ever had the opportunity to work there, he would go. Now, Canada is offering him a position. The position itself should be like a dream come true compared to his current position. 

We have a long list of the pros for moving to Canada. Here are some of them: My husband would finally get out of a job that he hates. We could leave the tiny town that we live in and live in a larger metropolitan area with all of the advantages that entails. We have a 5 year old, and schools are better in Canada - they are terrible in our small town. I feel like we are getting older and this is our last chance to make a big positive change in our lives. In my opinion this is an enormous opportunity. My husband won't be making more money in Canada. His pay will be about the same. 

The situation with our house is strange. I watched a house that was a fixer-upper for years until the old man that was selling it was desperate. We bought the house for $22,000 but had to pay cash. So, my in-laws refinanced their mortgage. So, basically, we pay our ""mortgage"" to my in-laws and it is only $200 a month. If we move to Canada we can hand the house over to our daughter. She can take over the $200 payment. Utilities are high in our town and that is a concern. However, since the ""mortgage"" is due to her grandparents, if she needed to skip a month here and there, it would be okay. She and her boyfriend are not good with money. The boyfriend especially buys things for a video game that he plays and usually gets at least one overdraft notice from the bank *per week*. However, I did say that my husband got the boyfriend a good job. It is the best paying job that you can do in town without going to college. There are plenty of people who work there and manage to pay their bills. We do require my daughter and her boyfriend to pay 1/3 of some of the bills now. I think this amounts to between $150-200 per month. We gave my daughter a car and there is an SUV sitting in the driveway waiting for her boyfriend to get his driver's license. It does need about $1000 work. 

The same day that my husband got this job offer my daughter told us that she and her boyfriend had looked at a house to rent. We talked her out of renting the house because it is in a town 30 minutes away - there is no way for her boyfriend to get to work if they live in that town. Even with this obvious point it was hard to talk her out of getting that house. I told her to stop looking for houses because if we move to Canada, she will get this house. 

Our son who is a senior will be living with his grandparents to complete his senior year, joining us in Canada for the summer, and then going to college in the US. 

My husband does not want to go to Canada because of the kids. He is worried that if we leave our daughter and her boyfriend will start having parties, using drugs and burn the house down. I pointed out to him that they want to move out of our house anyway. Even if we stay they will move out and potentially party and let themselves go downhill in another house. My husband agrees, but thinks that we need to stay here to give our daughter a place to come home to if she loses her place to live. Our daughter almost certainly has borderline personality disorder. She tends to build up a bunch of lies and mistakes and then run. My husband wants to be here to give her a place to run to. 

We are also concerned about our son who will be going to college. If he fails out of college he won't be able to live with us in Canada because he won't be able to work there. An option that was discussed in the past was for him to move in with family in another state who own a large electrician business. There he would learn to be an electrician. However, if that doesn't work out he will most likely end up living with his sister. My husband's concern is that things will get bad and our daughter and son will run off and live with their mother to escape the consequences of whatever problems they created in this town. 

If the kids are going to end up bombing out and moving in with their mother, in my opinion it will happen even if we stay in the US. It will take longer to happen if my husband and I are here, but if that is the direction things are going to take we probably won't be able to stop them. Also, I always say that I won't let our son live here as an adult without working. However, I fear that my husband will be so afraid that Chad will move in with his mother that he will let him live in our house forever without working. 

I must admit that just thinking about all of this mess to type it out has me wanting to pack my bags. In my opinion the older kids are grown. It isn't that I don't love them, but I have been put through an emotional wringer by them already. In the beginning I just wanted to go to Canada because I love change, I love moving and I love living abroad. I figured that our daughter was planning on moving out anyway and our son will be off to college. They are moving on with their lives and that frees us up to move on with ours. But now that I think about the potential upheaval of having our daughter move out, then move in again and again. Of how angry it will make me if Chad is allowed to live his adult life as an unemployed bum playing video games all day... It just kills me. I want to help my kids and be there for my kids. However, the emotional burden of all of this is on me. I am the one who has to advise and direct. I am the one who has to worry. I am the one who has to figure out how to make it work with two families living in one house. 

Well, I need to stop venting. I want to go to Canada so badly. My husband has issues with depression and his current job is killing him. His site is also being very poorly managed and there is the potential that it will be closed down. Then he will be out of a job. We'll end up having to move anyway. 

In my opinion the kids are going to have to grow up and take care of themselves. We are leaving them a house that has a very low monthly payment. *And* if they pay off the mortgage they get to keep the house. However, if we move and things go wrong with the kids, my husband is going to blame me forever. 

What in the world am I supposed to do?

I don't care to get her in trouble since it's not my place and if her works getting done who am I to care, but I'm looking for advice on how I can deal with how she's acting personally.

She constantly complains about how late she has to stay at night but doesn't come in until 11 am every day, asks for me to help with her work and then when I do she tells everyone she's done it all by herself, and overall just constantly complains and tells absolutely everyone how hard of a worker she is and they buy into it because she always seems extremely busy anytime they come over. Also, anytime I look at my phone for a minute she gives me judgey looks and then asks me to do something for her (she's not my boss, we have exactly the same title). 

For example, just today I asked her if she wanted to go get a drink of water with me and she replied with ""I would LOVE to be able to go get some water, but I can't even bring myself to leave my desk for 5 minutes"".

(I don’t have a clue how to do the actual link thing)

Today I was looking at my homework and I have an art homework. I know that it had been started in class the previous week. The problem is I don’t have the art booklet I need to do said homework

I also have rugby tonight which doesn’t help so I text my mum and say I can’t play rugby tonight have a lot of homework. She called me 20 minuites later to say in a very annoyed and angry voice that she’s stuck in traffic and has left a sick child (she works in a hospital) to leave me to rugby 

I did not ask for her to leave work early to leave me to rugby so why she’s annoyed with me is absurd. She asked if I could do the homework after rugby (at 9) but I said it could take me hours to do so I need to do it before. I started to say I’m not meant to do homework to 11 at night. She told me I already stay up to 11 which I do but I’m in bed watching a movie or something not like on my phone and playing games. 

She called my grans house phone 10 minuites later (I was at her house) to say that depending on where she was at 6 it would depend on if I go to rugby. What she doesn’t understand is that she’s stressing me and as a repercussion if that I’m going grey haired and I haven’t left school (I’ve been told it can be to do with stress)

I’ve tried talking about not doing some activities every now and then for homework and to relax because I can’t get around school without pain and a limp 

I feel like she doesn’t care about my opinion and more cares about me being really sporty (the opposite of her) 

I just need advice on what to say to her that could help calm her down rather than every time I mention it she just moans and ignores me 

Thanks for any and all replys 

PS- I do sports every day of the week but that’s been explained in that last post 👍",20Sep2017,1
229,"I had been with my GF of almost 5 years until around 2 weeks ago when she cheated with a guy she had met only once previously. She admitted it almost straight away and said she had feelings for us both and didn't know what to do. I said the decision was hers, I love her deeply but if she didn't want me it was her choice. A few days later she ended things and went out. That night she slept with him. Something she wouldn't confess to me until days later. Part of her decision to end things was based on our relationship, it wasn't great. We argued more than often and I wasn't the best BF. She wasn't perfect either but blamed her actions towards me solely on my actions. Which I know isn't true. We also have a child together. Now when I met her she was pregnant. Something which she knew but neglected to tell me she knew about straight away. When she 'feared' she was pregnant she took a test and went for a scan which revealed she was pregnant. I opted to stay with her because of my feelings for her. A couple of years later she told me she had known the entire time and we had a big argument which was resolved days later. I still stuck by her. Eventually we would move in together and be a happy family. The biological father denies any responsibility. And I raised the child as she were my own. I love them both dearly. From the begining of her act of unfaithfulness she claimed to still love me and care about me and that she wants to remain friends. But most of the time she acts almost robotic towards me. This is all difficult as we still live together until I can afford a place of my own. She sleeps on the sofa whilst I sleep in bed, at least that is when I can sleep. I barely eat or sleep anymore. I feel more than betrayed. I know she wasn't happy but if she would of ended things then went on doing whatever it wouldn't of hurt half as much. I work to provide for us as a family. She is a student. Since all this we have managed to calm down and talk and she explained how she feels about him and all that. Whilst I'm upset by the relationship being over, I care for her and glad she is able to be happy. I just feel like after this massive betrayal of trust I will never have that happiness myself. Part of our conversations were about our child and how I will still be allowed access when I do move out. But part of me feels that will slip away if the two of them end up together as she isn't sure if they will. It is all one massive head fuck for me and I simply have no idea what to do anymore.

TLDR: GF cheated with a guy she barely knew but has feelings for him and left me to pursue her feelings with him. Child involved which I fear I may lose access to. Much like the trust i have lost for others and doubt I'll ever get back",20Sep2017,2
230,"Hey, so Im not really sure what to do with myself? I have a friend who i've been friends for, for about 5 years now. He introduced me to a group of people and I became really good friends with all of them, somehow there was a divide in the group though and it wasn't because we aren't friends it just happened. 

So now my friend of 5 years is with 4 other people and I was stuck with people that are really amazing people but... I wanted to be with my 5 year friend (lets call him sam). Him and his friends who I'm also friends with barely spend time with me and so i sort of felt stuck having to be friends with my 4 friends. 

There was one of my 4 friends that I didn't really like, I thought he was weird and he is older then us and basically I didn't get a good vibe as he did things that made me feel uncomfortable and then I had a party that one of Sam's friends said that this guy had touched her up. There was a big argument and this guy started saying stuff to Sam and his friends about their appearance and other nasty things and next thing you know I was getting involved and I had a go at the guy. 

I did it because I thought Sam and that would see that I was sticking up for them and he would want that as a friend again but now i've only landed in myself having no friends as this guy is still hanging out with the ones i've been left with and sam and that still aren't asking to meet me. 

I'm going to Sam's party on Saturday, I want him to know i've lost everyone now because of doing that for them, I want him to know that when I get annoyed at them its not because Im just trying to pick at them but its because I care and I want them to care too and want to see me. I want him to know that smothering instagram posts in my face about his new best friends and how much of good time he's having without me... it all hurts...

235,"I'm a therapist and over the past year, I've noticed increasing signs of my husband having a major depressive episode. Eventually, I got him off work on 15 weeks of sick leave, found a medication that seems to be helping, and had him referred to mental health services. Where we're from, with no insurance, it's taken several months to get an intake appointment with mental health services and his first appointment isn't for another couple of weeks. In the meantime, he's been struggling so much I've had to step in and support him because he hasn't been able to function with his depression and anxiety. Because of this, he's become dependent on my support. So for months I've been in ""therapist"" mode basically 24/7, having to stay up all hours of the night having to counsel him, deescalate his anxiety attacks, book and attend all his appointments, And spend on average I'd say at least a solid 3 to 4 hours aside from his night time sessions a day intensively supporting him. 

This whole time, I've been putting my own needs aside to ensure he's being fully supported. Making sure I don't use triggering language, changing and canceling my schedule including work, I have literally not even been able to read a paparagh in a book without him interrupting me for one reason or another, the last time I tried to take a relaxing bath he sat beside the tub talking about his depression. He'll keep me up throughout the night so I'm exhausted all the time. But I have this dilemma because if I don't support him, he'll get it no where else and when I've tried stepping back he takes HUGE steps back. And that affects my life just as much in different ways. I'm also 33 weeks pregnant so I feel like I NEED to get him in a stable place before the baby gets here because I can't manage my first child and him. 

We've been having issues with his parents, where we've discovered most of his issues original stem from. Today, after he spoke to his mother about a variety of issues she keeps creating in our life surrounding the baby, he came home and subtly blamed me and said I need to support her and initiate a dialogue with her and basically take on her issues as well. 

I feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown.  I'm so exhausted. My only escape is going to work, which is counselling high conflict court mandated families. This past week while I've been trying to deescalate myself throughout the day from having anxiety attacks the thought of leaving kept creeping into my mind and that scares me.

240,"Holy shit I need advice. 

My roommate and I get along, no problem. We have some similar interests and it's never been awkward between us. 

But...she never, ever leaves our room. She leaves for class, eating, showering/using the bathroom, and she has went home a few weekends. Now, I understand that this is our room and she is paying to live here and it's her space as well as mine, I get it, but I have always been fine and have even preferred being by myself once in a while. I don't need a million friends--I have a few close ones I enjoy being around and that's more than enough for me. Even so, I do not spend the majority of my time in our room. I have a job, I do things with my friends, I hang out with my boyfriend, and I leave just to get out of the fucking suffocating heat in our room once in a while. She, on the other hand, is there 24/7. It's starting to really grind my gears. Between class and spending time with friends and work and just living on campus around thousands of other people, I have no time to myself. She's always talking to me when I do spend time in the room--if I'm watching Netflix, she'll talk about her day. If I'm playing video games, she'll ask me all about my schedule for the next two months. It's gotten so annoying that I just avoid our room as much as possible. I'll stay at my boyfriend's place just to get the fuck away for a bit, and she'll be texting and Snapchatting me constantly asking what I'm doing and when I will be back. 

The thing is, I've tried everything to get her out of the room and more involved. I bring her to hang out with my friends, I've encouraged her to join a sport she wouldn't shut up about wanting to participate in, all to no avail. I don't mind having her along to hang out with my friends, but it's gotten to the point where I feel guilty whenever I want to hang out with them but not with her. She doesn't drink or smoke or do anything that people tend to do in college, including myself, so I don't invite her to parties or anything because she would never go. When she brought up joining fencing, I kept telling her to go inquire about it, but she kept saying ""no, it's probably too late now"" and making more excuses and it's just driving me crazy that she never leaves our space ever! This has turned into a bit of a rant, so I apologize, but oh my god. She makes no effort to make friends and if Im busy or don't want to do something that she wants to do or go somewhere she wants to go, she'll just skip it and do nothing. 

She doesn't have a job but she spends more money than I do. Her parents are by no means rich. Doesn't she get bored? How can she afford all these fucking clothes she buys!?

There's a lot more, but I've already talked your ears off (typed your eyes off?) so I'll stop. 

Essentially...is it wrong of me to be annoyed with this situation? Why won't she just leave our room or try to make friends? WHAT DO I DO TO STOP MYSELF FROM GOING INSANE

245,"So I've been really struggling with my job recently.

I work on a ship, and as far as marine jobs go, it's pretty cushy. I get to go home every night and sleep in my own bed, we get free drinks and half off food from the on board restaurant all day, I run a really low risk of being injured at work, I've got benefits, just started a pension, the pay is competitive, and I'm in a union.

The first downside is the hours. The morning shift runs from either 4:30 or 5am to 3pm, and the night runs 3pm to 1am. Now I realize those are just 10 hour shifts, but I have to get up an hour early for morning shifts and it's a half hour commute, so they end up being roughly 12 hours shifts. Couple that with the ship vibrating under you all day causing me knee, ankle and back pain in my early 20s, and the day feels like an 18 hour day.

The other downside is that my shifts aren't consistent. I'm still considered ""casual"" after several years so I'm on call 24/7, no standby pay, and I'm not allowed to say no to work. My hours are inconsistent and plenty of times I've been expected to do 9 morning shifts  and then 1 night, or I flip-flop between mornings and nights, never sleeping well, and feeling exhausted and miserable constantly (I'm naturally a night owl, so mornings are hard either way) and in the last year it's affected my health, I've been sick a lot more than I've ever been. The way the system works here is after several years you're eligible for a full-time position, guaranteed hours, 5 mornings 5 off, 5 nights, 5 off, so you essentially work half the year. But that's still a long way away for me.

I'm really struggling with my sleep schedule, the feeling of exhaustion and misery constantly hanging over me like a dark cloud, and being sick constantly isn't helping my stress levels. I've had trouble with dating because no one can constantly fit around my changing schedule, and people really don't like it when you cancel on them constantly. This wasn't my original career plan, but it's the field I have the most money sunk into my education. In a perfect world I'd like to have a job where I play video games or play sports all day, but obviously that's just not realistic as an adult.

Group is supposed to last 8-12 weeks, and I did 12, and then asked for (and got) an indefinite extension for as long as my therapist will allow me to be there. So what I'm hoping to do, is wait a few weeks until she ""graduates"" and then I might do the same or I'll just start talking to her then.. but I'm afraid if I wait too long, she might meet someone else..

247,"Hello, all. Never been one to seek advice from, well, anyone before. But I'm at a loss.

I work for one of the busiest, and largest domestic car dealers in the United States. I work in online sales. My responsibilities include taking, making, and processing sales calls. New leads, old leads, e-mails, always on. Only new or my own customers.

Over the last three or so years I have gone on to become the number two in terms of bringing in customers (short by 35 or so for the YTD for the number one spot) and am number one in converting these shows into sales (ahead by almost 60 from the next closest person).

In addition to my own work, I'm usually left alone in the department since a lot of my colleagues tend to... disappear for some time throughout the day. My boss included. I run the department, basically, when he is away. I am the only one sales team, finance team, and the GM comes to when the department head is away.

I am the only one who greets anyone else's appointments, finds sales team for these customers, and passes along the notes. My colleagues routinely come to me instead of the department head for help. A lot of the sales team tells me they don't prefer anyone else's customers. A lot of the managers try to slip me extra leads to help me out. My newest three colleagues all told me the same thing -- that our boss says to ask me if they have questions since I can better help them even over his own advice. Never mind that he then yells at them for doing so.

I know that was a read, but it leads to this: We all make the same money here. All of us. I feel I could run this department, but such an option isn't in the cards. A pay increase could really, really, help. I was given one two years ago, but wages in the state went up, and now we all make the same again.

While all other employees have their own office, they've never given me one, and have insisted i work my 40 hours weekly in their lobby while they bring all of their loud, noisy children to work. Trying to enter work-state-flow in a distracting environment like this is impossible. all of the work I do for them could quickly and easily be done remotely. I was told upon being hired that remote work would come in time, however the one weekly remote day I had to fight for to receive only lasted for a few months.

My work for the week was completed, and I asked for my bosses approval multiple times through out the days. I was brushed off several times.

However, I'm now 25, and living at home is getting a bit annoying. I want my own personal space (my bedroom is even too small for a double bed, so no girlfriends can even stay over ha). I've also heard my parents talking about how they'd like to sell the house/put it up for rent, and move into a smaller home in another part of the country which they love. Also, most of my mates have already moved out/got mortgages since they've done well for themselves, so I feel a bit lazy and childish in comparison. 

I know they won't kick me out, so I have to make the first move really. I can't afford a mortgage, since my job only pays around £15k a year, but there are a few cheap flats to rent nearby which I'd be interested in. 

The only concern I have is this would be 'dead money' so to speak. My dad keeps telling me to wait until I have a career until I move out, wait until I have a well-paying job so I can get a mortgage. Honestly though, I don't mind working in the warehouse I'm at - it's a decent place to work and there is always overtime going if I need it. I told him you can spend too long planning and hoping for something to come along, all the while you're not really living your life.

265,"Ok, everyone, I'm new to posting here so please be patient with me. I guess I'll get right into it and try to make a long story as short as possible. Right now I'm 22(just to give a little insight) and when I was in 5th grade I met this girl(we'll call her Mariah) that ended up being my best friend. Once we clicked we were almost inseparable. Mariah was always at my house and got so close to my family and I that she called my Mom, ""Mom."" People always thought we were sisters since we looked alike. We were both heavyset with blue eyes and thick, brown hair. Basically, Mariah was my sister from another mister. Towards the end of our senior year in high school Mariah lost a bunch of weight and she was very happy that people now found her attractive and I was happy for her because her moods had improved(we both have depression). Well, she got new friends and started to hang out with me less and less. I would try to contact her and at least hold a conversation but she would 'read' my messages and not reply. I told her one night that I was having a very hard time and I needed someone to talk to. She ignored my message and I assumed she was busy until she posted on facebook about 15 minutes later talking about how she was bored and wanted someone to 'hit her up'. I did eventually speak with her about how this had made me feel and she admitted to being a 'bad friend' and said that she would change it. It changed for a bit but went back to ignoring me after about a week. And then she basically just dropped me. I know friends grow apart and that's what I assumed had happened. We have a mutual friend but Mariah didn't know that this girl was also my friend. One day that mutual friend was with Mariah and told her she had to get going because she was about to go her friend's house. Mariah asked who's house she was going to and when she told Mariah my name, Mariah responds with, ""Oh my God, that's my best friend! Tell her I said hey!"" I don't understand how Mariah still thinks I'm even her friend after all of this. So I'm a bit confused. The other day I got an invite to her wedding and I initially said I wasn't going to go. I discussed this with my Mom(Mom and I are very close) and we usually have the same opinions so when she said she really thought I needed to go, I knew I needed some advice from an outside source. If Mariah and I haven't even had a conversation in almost two years why would she invite me to her wedding and WHY would I even go?? I know this is probably so simple for most people but I can't give myself advice to save my life. Thanks in advance!!!",20Sep2017,1

Where should I transfer to that could make me stand out as an applicant? A school with an amazing biology program? A top-school in general, regardless of its bio status? I'm not sure where to go from here. Given that I actually make it as a pharmacist, costs won't be an issue. I have no real preference on school size, private/public, staying close to home, etc. I just need somewhere I can get a Biology major that will stand out.

269,"I graduated college a few years ago, and have been trying to get into medical school with no success. I'm now losing interest in everything, from work to entertainment, and even in pursuing any kind of a goal. I recently started a pretty low-end job just to make ends meet, and it's completely miserable.

I don't think I have the energy and drive to try to get into medical school since I've already tried so much and any additional work gives me diminishing returns that's unlikely to be impactful anyway.

I'm thinking about completely changing course, maybe something in pure academia or engineering, or programming. I was a biology major, so I will probably have to get undergrad education for physics or computer science if I want to get into those fields, but I don't know if it's actually realistic. 

Of course, there will be people who will say ""of course, it's never too late to follow your dreams!"" or something, but I don't have heaps of money to afford more school easily, probably won't be eligible for government aid since I had it for my biology degree, and the schools will probably be reluctant to give me financial aid since I already have a degree. I'm not sure if working part time (or even full time) will get me enough to get me through school, all while interrupting my studies. The worst part is that I don't even have the drive to pursue medicine anymore, which has been my dream for my entire life. I don't know if I'll be able to muster up the strength and hustle through work and studies if I have to work during school.

271,"Hi, first time poster in this sub.

Story time. I have been seeing this girl for a few weeks now, hooking up a couple times a week and talking almost every day. It was casual and we'd meet up primarily to hook up but we grabbed coffee/lunch a few times as well. So this past Saturday she texts me to come to her day party and I happily agreed. This is probably a good time to mention that it was absolutely clear we were not exclusive and both seeing other people but that wasn't something we'd throw in each other's face. As in, we both knew it was happening and were OK with it but never would mention who our other partners were or how often we saw them. We were both happy with the situation.

So I hangout with her and her roommates for awhile just drinking and partying. Nothing too crazy. I notice she has been gone for a couple minutes and decide to go into her room to see if she's still at the house. That's when I see her with another guy undressed... I was completely OK with the situation until I saw her in ""the act"" with another guy. Now I'm not sure how OK I am with it.

Advice time: what do you think is the best course of action moving forward for me? She's acting like it's not a big deal and we were clearly not exclusive, which is true, but I feel like there is a level of respect that was clearly crossed here (don't invite the two guys you're hooking up with over at the same time). Am I being over-dramatic to just cut ties with her? I'd really like to keep seeing her and we've talked about it and been talking this week but it feels forced... help.",20Sep2017,1

277,"TLDR: I acted like a drunk ass in front of big bosses in previous company saying inappropriate sexual comments during a non-work drinking event. A year later, a position has opened up at the company and I am wondering whether to apply or not. 
&amp;nbsp;
Hey everyone! 
So I'm having some trouble deciding what to do and just need someone else's perspective on this. 

&amp;nbsp;

A previous company I (f23) worked at is currently hiring for a position in my field. I am really interested in the position and it seems like the perfect opportunity for me right after graduation. 
However, I am a little hesitant because of what happened when I celebrated with the heads of the company- HOC (m late 20s) last year. At this point I no longer worked at the company since it was a temporary position. I met up with them because they are fun and nice people and I wanted to see them again. 

&amp;nbsp;

During the evening, I had many drinks and I got too drunk and when I am at that stage I behave inappropriately (talking about sex, how hot people are, orgies and such). During the celebration I had too much to drink and was fighting a little bit with my boyfriend on the phone. 
HOCs, coworkers and I decided to go to one of the HOC's house to drink more and that's where my behaviour became really inappropriate and unprofessional. I was telling my boyfriend on the phone, in front of everyone, that I will have sex with everyone present (HOCs, co-workers). Of course I would never do or say any of these things when I'm sober and I don't even remember half of that night so I found out about what I did the morning after from my boyfriend (I talked to my boyfriend and he says that I did in fact say these things and I have no reason to believe he is lying since this is the kind of stuff that I would do). 
I never did talk to my supervisors about the events of that night since I was too embarrassed. I barely had contact with any of them, aside from a couple of facebook messages, because I don't work for the company anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

It has been a year since this event and my problem is whether I should apply for the position at their company? I made an ass out of myself and I am super embarrassed but at the same time my supervisors still acknowledge me when I talk to them on facebook. This seems like a good position in my field, and something that I have experience with from the last time I worked there. I feel that I can contribute well to the company and maybe they barely remember anything from that night either since everyone drank a lot. Should I address what happened with all HOCs and apologize? Should I ignore it and just apply and pretend nothing happened? Should I accept that I behaved inappropriately and find another position? 

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice is appreciated!",20Sep2017,1
278,"I'm currently enrolled in a simulation and game dev major at my college. And I want to know if it's honestly worth pursuing. I hear a lot of ""take a major you'll get a job in, and do game dev on the side on your own time."" I am taking networking classes at the same time and I can understand and learn almost naturally the content for those classes. Programming on the other hand, not so much. I had basic java skills coming into it (in my 2nd semester, first with programming classes) and I already feel like everything I knew was irrelevant or wrong. It's an intro class and I'm not necessarily falling behind but I'm not on top of it either, even though my exam and project grades are good.

I know networking and cyber security is where the job market is and will be in the next 3 or 4 years, but it's not what I want to be doing. I've always envisioned making a game (I know I'm nowhere near being the only one). I'm just having major doubts that I'll have luck finding either a job or group of people I TRULY want to dedicated several years with developing a game. Ideally I'd work with one or two people. 

Here is where I am hopeful: I am new to this. Aside from being the IT guy in my family, you know how that goes, I have minimal coding skill. I DO know how networks work and am interested in the security aspect, but again not nearly as much as game dev. I have a hard time motivating myself, I've tried to teach myself before to no real success. But that's why I went back to school, I CAN and DO learn when people teach and rely on me, and in the few weeks i've been here this semester I've learned a huge amount and AM excited for it, I really do enjoy it. The fear of no future is what holds me back.

And I know programming isn't easy to learn. Nor is anything else related to it. And I'm willing and excited to learn. I feel like once I really get into it and have more classes dedicated to this major I'll fall into place and figure it out. And my curriculum for this and networking have a couple of semesters worth of classes that satisfy each other so I'm not wasting my time *yet*. I will be taking modeling and art classes, obviously more programming and game design. I did have an intro game design class last semester, I aced it with a 4.0 GPA as well. So I know I can do it, but I'm having that wave of discouragement seeing how far ahead everyone else is and knowing it'll be a long time until I find myself in a position to even start a project.

I should also note I occasionally take courses online from codecademy and similar sites to kind of help or reiterate what I'm currently learning here. I find it helpful and get a different viewpoint of the material.

So does anyone have any advice they can give? Have you gone through this, know anybody that has, etc. I am aware of the gaming industry right now, believe me. I have ideas for projects and feel some could actually take off, but I lack the skills at the moment. I know the best practice is to just do it.",20Sep2017,1

So I married my now-ex husband when she was 1. We had another baby together. We'd always planned for him to adopt her, but when I uncovered 2 years worth of craziness (cheating, craigslist ads, extra email accounts, phone sex lines, finding panties in our car, etc) I took back my offer for him to adopt her. If I couldn't trust him, why should I trust him with her? We got divorced last year, and due to finances and the kids' sake have still been living together. 

I was blind as shit and vulnerable when it happened, but I went along with his suggestions to split legal custody of our son, he got physical custody of him (""it doesn't mean anything, we'll still split our time with him evenly"") and my dumb ass went along with his buddy-buddy idea for me to waive child support an alimony. My daughter wasn't named because she wasn't a product of our marriage. 

Last month he sits me down and tells me there's a girl he's interested in and that I should know about her. They're not dating or anything yet, but it's just something for the record. Yeah, ok. Last week he sat me down again and said they were getting serious and he wanted to introduce the kids to her daughter. I nod along and smile through gritted teeth, because that's what adults do. 

Now, because of the kids' crazy school schedule (son is in K so he has a half-day) I only have 3 hours of me-time so a day job is impossible until our son starts 1st grade. Thus I work nights. I work weekends too so my ex takes the kids to his moms for the weekend, and more recently I guess, to his girlfriend's. 

Then this morning my daughter starts going on about my son being a ring-bearer and my daughter being a flower-girl. I stop dead in my tracks and ask her wtf she's on about. She says they're getting married in a couple of months. He's only just met this woman. That's his business, but the kids are what make it MY business. 

I feel so helpless. He has no legal standing over my daughter, but he does what he wants with her, whenever he wants to, because I have to work like a dog to keep from being homeless, and don't have time to do stuff with the kids. Sometimes he'll just take off with the kids and dodge my calls for hours (or days!) wondering where the fuck they are and if they're gonna be going to school or whatever, because fuck you, he's my son too and she's my daughter. 

I know the adult thing is to play nice, but I feel REALLY FUCKING SKETCHY about this whole thing. I can't help but feel like he's taking advantage of me and doing his best to make me irrelevant in my kids' lives.

My stepmom had been stalking me for about a year, and now plans to use that evidence against me to try and get me arrested as a pedophile. She will present this evidence to cops, I am sure of that. In the messages, it is obvious that it was consensual, and it is obvious that I am not a terrible person. However, I live in texas, so i'm worried about getting some old religious judge who's going to make me a felon for the rest of my life because he thinks its bad and its technically illegal.

More Information
I keyed a dick into my stepmoms car, and threw a table at the wall. I have video of her threatening me with a taser, but she has video of me and my dad screaming at her. Before I turned 18, I had often been sexting girls who were as far as 3 years younger than me (some with pictures, but it was all on snapchat). Once again, I was never pushy, and am clearly a nice guy. My stepmom also has all of the information saved on her phone, and I have deleted my skypes history completely, but also have the messages saved on my computer.

I cant think straight right now, so please ask if you need more information on the scenario, I desperately need help

TL;DR : If I sext a minor WITHOUT pictures(only messages) who's only 16 and im 18, can a lawyer easily defend that in court? And also, if I flee to a country where the age of consent is 16, will they give me back to america? or can I live a normal life there",20Sep2017,4

It was long distance, he lives in Sweden and I live in England and it last in my 4 months officially, though we had been talking for over a year by the time we got together and were pretty much just waiting to meet. We met and everything was good, exciting and scary. I'd never been with anyone before, never even kissed a guy and this guy was my first. My first everything. Literally.

before that, I couldn't believe that someone could love me, and when he loved me, now I don't believe that I will love another ever


the school is hard, I have to give all my energy to it, and I have a lot of catching up


though I find myself crying on the bus when I remember him, sometimes I excuse myself from class and go to the bathroom and cry a little


I don't have time for anything else but studying, I get out at 7:00 am and get home at 5:00 pm


then I have to focus and do my homework, and revise what I studied


till now i'm doing well at school, though i could do better, it's only been few days




i'm gonna change the school the next semester for personal reasons, and I really have to get high grades


I asked before ""how do you sleep after a break up? ""


and most of the answers here were, watching T.V and listening to music


well i don't have time for that


i'm so depressed, people are smiling at me and i can't smile back
it's so weird not being able to smile


anyways


my heart is broken, and i got to study. What should I do ?

301,"Right now I'm in high school, 10th grade and 15 years old. My school is an art school and doesn't do sports at all besides for lunchtime sports(which is usually soccer and basketball). I'm decently athletic and one of the fastest kids at sports. Anyways, I know for a fact that there are many other football teams in my area that play against other teams and I'm sure I could get into one if I knew the right people. That I'm not to worried about.

However, one thing I fear is my height and weight for my age. I'm 5'4 and around 90 pounds. I've always struggled to gain weight and have never been that tall obviously. I really want to make an attempt at playing football next season but first I want to get up to 120-130lb. I don't know if this sounds really stupid or not cause I'm trying to be serious. 30-40lbs in maybe 6-7 months for me sounds impossible. 

Could someone help me out and give me some tips? I don't think gaining weight and being tall is everything in football. Although, I feel like I would struggle to fit in being in such a low weight class. 
   
It would really help me if someone could give me some advice and even a little motivation. Coaches probably look for players with a lot of potential and I don't want to be the odd one out that stands no chance. 

If I could pick any position I would be a Wide Receiver, Running Back, or Corner Back. I feel like strengths lie in my speed and agility.

I am a 22-year old girl who has mainly worked in fine dining as a server. Made good money too. I have some of the best work ethic I know.

Anyways... was just wondering what routes people take or if it's even possible to make, say, $40k annual with just an AA or no degree at all.

That being said there were obvious issues later on in that relationship but that's not why I'm here.

304,"I've got a huge crush on this girl, and I'm not arrogant enough to think that she'll actually agree to giving me a shot (this girl is smoking hot), but I'm certainly going to try!
Besides there just being a physical attraction, this girl is also intelligent in a way and we do have a couple of similar interests.
So far, we have only talked to eachother 2 or 3 times in about a 15 minute interval, one-on-one, in the school bus. Today I decided to give her some space, not talk to her for a while; I don't want her to think I am desperate for her attention.
I am looking for insights. I have never asked any girl out on a date before and though it seems to be going pretty well in my head right now, I always, without fail, get super nervous when I actually start putting things into motion.
Here's what I know about the girl...
She's not just smoking hot to me, and although I've never seen guys actively flirting with her, I imagine that this is the case. A friend of mine confirmed that she was actually sexually harassed in Middle School/Early High School. This is super creepy to me, and I think it's extra important that she feels like she's being treated like a human being.
So, that's all, sorry if it was long and boring. Do you have any advice you could give me for tomorrow? Any words of encouragement to make me feel more confident (you don't have to do this but I mean you're a saint if you do). How would you handle this situation, if you had a massive crush on this girl? Feel free to write an essay if you like, I'll gobble up every word of it.

305,"When my wife and I met I was a young line cook (20) ready and willing to work 100 hours a week and grind to get to my own place. When I sleep, I dream of food, of techniques, of maltodextrin lemon butter over scallops on a bed of citrus segments topped with candied jalapeño match sticks. I loved and still do love food. Everything about working in a fine dining kitchen appeals to me. About a year after we married (22) we found out my wife was pregnant. Now at 23 I am a full time student working a kitchen I hate simply because it is close to the college I attend. I hate school. I hate every minute of being locked in a room with 18 year olds who have lived half the life I have lived and suffered half the things I have suffered. I still dream of my own kitchen. I dream of living the life I always dreamt I could but am deathly afraid of what the sacrifice needed to make it in the food world would do to my daughter.

About 2 years ago I’ve come to an understanding that I don’t have that many good friends left. And since I already live on my own, I spend most of my time alone, which is kind of boring eventually. I’ve really been trying to take new hobbies and going out by myself, but it has helped little. I have many acquaintances but not so many friends who would actually give me a call or have interest in me. Almost every time I’m the one, who has to call, text or even convince them to take me with. I can tell people usually like me and like spending time with me, but not as much as I'd want. Not to be narcissist but I see myself as an attractive human being (been told so too). Also, I’m not searching for a new boyfriend, just want to find a solution how to have engaging friendships. Guess that’s really not something you can talk to your friends about. ",20Sep2017,3

313,"I work as an app developer of sort, making all aspects of the content and conducting research with it on a large international project. I'm also the sole person working it. We're currently half way through, but due to insane expectations and _constant_ changes from my boss, I incresingly despise what I do. It's gotten to the point that I have mild panic attacks, and it is severely affecting my personal life.

While I constantly try to reign in my bosses expectations (the project is _very_ complex for one person), the issue is magnified tenfold by the fact I *share an office with him!* He is CONSTANTLY running new ideas by me, both for this and other projects, while having NO idea of the complexity of what he proposes. I would suggest that I move office, but the man also has a very short fuse and is prone to shouting. The idea of this makes me quite scared, since afterwards I would have to head back to the same small office with him! It makes me feel like I'm drowning.

I've been trying very hard to get him to realistic, but at this point I _desperately_ want to quit. Frankly, I could quite easily find another job much more suited to me. However being the sole researcher on the project would mean abandoning it, causing huge problems with everyone involved, and being very insulting to the amount of effort put into getting me the position only 6 months prior (despite the venting here, he's been very kind to me). At this stage, the work would not get completed, the awarded research funding would be pulled being bad for the company, my reputation and my boss. In this case, it would be impossible to hire someone to fill my place as the work is incredibly niche. 

My contract only runs until March, but 6 months is a simply too long to maintain these conditions.. I'm very lost as to how to proceed. How could I try and approach him? Should I put myself first and move on? I'd appreciate any general advice, and in particular to hear about anyone who's handled a similar situation.

TL/DR: My boss is making my work environment hell as we share an office, but he's very quick tempered. Quitting my job would _end_ a largely funded international project as I'm the sole researcher, with 6 months left till completion. Would appreciate general advice and anecdotes from similar situations!",20Sep2017,1
315,"This all started when I moved. My parents met these extremely high class Chinese people who live in a huge mansion that we could never afford. They don't understand English, so my parents helped them out with some stuff.

Now they keep coming everyday barging into our house without knocking and asking for help with this and that. My mom is very busy and stays up until 2 in the night to work, and it has become even worse now that her ""friend"" is abusing her for her knowledge. She's literally spent an entire day wasting herself away talking to customer service for them. Even worse, these days, my mother has gotten shoulder issues from overworking and is in pain all the time. 

Furthermore, my mom treats their kid like royalty and invites them to our house and spends at least 4 hours with her. She then blames me that she is working until 2 am for me, to pay my tuition but she is wasting all her time. She then has no time left over for me and my sister, which really hurts and has put me into a near depressive state. I feel like their kid has become part of our family, while me and my sister are being kicked out.

I'm really concerned for her health, but whenever I bring it up she says she's just helping them and I shouldn't be so selfish. But she's being used as a translator/guide to the city for these millionaire immigrants. I tried waiting the situation out, but it's even worse with them barging in with their kid everyday for a couple of hours. I tried being rude to them to scare them off, but that only made my mom call me autistic and socially stupid around strangers. Am I wrong to be concerned? What should I do?

316,"I'm a little frustrated so I really apologize if I make myself unclear or anything.

My grandmother lives with us. I am an 18 year old guy, freshman year in college. I live with my family (mom, dad, brother, dog). 

My grandmother sold us her car because she wants another one. Okay.. great. I will have my own car now! It was agreed by my grandmother and my parents that this would be the case. However, I'm kind of stuck in a limbo. It's been two months since this happened, and I still haven't touched the car. So I have to resort to my parents taking me to and from college. **

Quick sidenote. I'm grateful for what I have, okay? Even the simple things. I have a roof over my head. My stomach never goes empty. I have the leisure to read or play videogames. I have the opportunity to go to school. All of these things are privileges that not everyone has. and so I'm grateful. Even something as simple as a microwave. As stupid as it sounds, I'm glad I can eat a frozen meal if I wanted to. That could be so easily taken away. Now back to the story...

** This is extremely aggravating. I have to depend on my parents during a time of my life where I should be gradually transitioning into adulthood. Behaviorally speaking, I'm still in middle school. What if I want to stay a couple of hours at the college? What if I want to go out with friends? I can't do that. I'm literally stuck at home and it is the most asphyxiating thing. At the mercy of my parents to take me ANYWHERE I want to go, which they are most likely too lazy to do. Even my two best friends stopped asking me to hang out, because they just already knew that either my mom was going to say no to taking me, or that I wouldn't be able to go at all. I basically lost friends because of this..really? I've even had problems with my girlfriend, who hates driving us all the time and everywhere. We've almost broken up over this. And even now, I try my best to form relationships, but I feel like I'm socially retarded because I never went out throughout my life. It's like Repunzel except I'm not having such an easy transition to ""life outside."" My grandmother hasn't bought her new car yet. If it was up to me, I would have bought a car. I have money. BUT if her old car will be mine.. then why buy a car? And I can't just pressure her either.. it's basically a gift and that would be rude. So now I have to wait until my mom sits down with my grandmother and to get a car (because she can't do it herself). but.. they never do it! They never talk about it. I ask my mom from time to time and she just nods me off. I asked her after school today, I asked in a tone as quiet as a leaf falling onto a lake's water, and she just nodded me off again. My patience had run so thin at this point that I really imagined punching her in the face. NOW CALM DOWN I actually wouldn't.. but my anger was just too great. She doesn't listen. She doesn't respect me. She treats my problems like those of a 5 year old.


TL; DR 
My grandmother sold my family a car. This car was to be mine when my grandmother got a new car, but she hasn't gotten the new car. So now I'm stuck waiting for this car (I'm not going to buy a car if I can have one, right?) and it's really annoying. What do I do?",20Sep2017,1

--food: I am covered on food

What bugs me is that if I invite him somewhere at around 9 pm hell say he can’t because his mom won’t let him out late but come next week he’ll be out hanging out late at night with his other friends or when he says he has no money, I’ll see a day later where he’s out eating with friends.

So because I have to be escorted everywhere I tend to get behind on my work because I have a hard time getting someone who actually wants to be my escort. This has been my biggest problem at my current org. This is because everyone I try to ask gives me nothing but attitude and problems and if I don’t include my managers name in the email I send out asking for an escort I will just be ignored.

Hello, r/advice. To begin with, I, fifteen ( prefer not to state gender ), reside with my sister, six, my brother, thirteen, and my father, early 60's. To my misfortune, my brother, has become very abusive and destructive, after my parents got divorced. My sister did not have a grasp of memory at the time. Though, I, knew it would happen. I had always been prepared. 

Since the past few years, he has been shown to seriously injure, my sister, and I. He has thrown water at us, punched us, and kicked us. ( I have one piece of evidence ) Some days, he won't plan on hurting us, to avoid any accusations. Now, I can't stand up to him. 

Fast forward, to now, He regularly goes to the gym. I am, a few inches smaller, and barely exercise.  Every day, that I come back from school, I am so scared, that I do not go anywhere near him. My mother, before she left, had moved my room down to the basement, as a result of avoiding the family, throughout the whole phenomenon. ( the basement has no doors or anything leading to the room. Just a large, dead backyard. ) He will, go down there, put his feet up on my things, play basketball, and other things, in my room, I will politely ask him to leave, but he'll ignore. He will always remind me to kill myself, that I am weak, and that nobody likes me. It hurts so much, but I can't cry in front of him, since that fuels him. He has forced me sister to play basketball with him. She always comes back to me, panting, crying, and I can't do a thing, since I'm just as scared. 

I just can't deal with this anymore. How can I stop this? My parents don't do a thing. The police won't bother getting involved, since the station their has quite the bias against the home, considering they came a lot in the past. Just, what should I do?",20Sep2017,1
