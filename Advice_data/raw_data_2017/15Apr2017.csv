0,"Okay So a little back story I started working for this store back in Augus, The Owner of my store also owns 3 stores. Its a chain of stores under a corporate chain. Now I have good work ethic, I show up 30 minutes early. I don't ask for time off very often, I have only had one sick day in the entire 7 months I have worked there. That was over 5 months ago, now back in Februrary we had audit which is where problem number one happens.
She sent me this after I had already left for the day

Now the coil bind in question had never been moved the whole time I worked there, and she never told me that it needed to be moved to the back. 
I replied with this and she responded http://imgur.com/gLPMuKD
Now I admit that the stool was sitting with in view of the door, but when I have to work at the front end laptop I don't want to bend over the counter, I would much rather sit level with computer. 
Fast forward to about the 20th of March I paid around 219 dollars for a white water rafting trip that takes place next weekend April 21st through 23rd. I put in the request through When I Work around the 21st of March, well she didn't saying anything about and denied it without reason why. I didn't say anything I waited to the 27th about a week later and put it again, She sent me this message and you can see the interaction 
http://imgur.com/1kvKZAq 
Now up to this point I didn't work more than two or three days a week and I had never worked a friday. After she approved the request she switched me from T &amp; Th to M,W,F night shift. Also next week she has me working every day pretty much all day up till Friday. 
Now I have been nice, respectful and this is how she has treated me. I have kept my feelings in check and well after today I am just done. The Person who worked this morning did something that I had to take care of, when Freight wouldn't take the package, I called the person who worked this morning and she called my boss lady. My boss lady called me told me to put the freight driver on the phone, she then berated him, and thengot his manager's number and hung up to call him. I had a customer come through the door so I started to help him and the freight guy left, I didn't think much about it. She called back right as a customer came through the door, she told me to put the guy on the phone. The guy had already left and when I told her that she started in on my, she stopped when I told her that he left as I  had gotten a customer, and I had one right now. 
Basically I am used to love going to work, the people i see day in and day out, but now I hate it.

4,"My life has been... Less than stellar. To give some background info, I'm a 17 years old Hungarian guy with Asperger's whose father got unemployed for one and a half years after the 2008 crisis, grandfather died in 2010, and due to various family issues, had to move houses twice in a span of about one and a half years again. I've been tutored one-on-one by teachers since 6th grade, and having failed 9th grade once, I jumped ship in autumn last year. It wasn't because the subjects were too difficult, but because the time spent with my unemployed father constantly nagging me about school and homework made me subconsciously (at the time at least) hate everything to even remotely do with school. This never went away, and for years school was just a giant stress-train for me. dropping out was the single happiest moment of my life. As much as I don't like using the term, because it feels like I'm being a tumblretta, I still get ptsd from even looking at a school book.

6,"Hey guys, I've been noticing that my eyesight vision has been degrading for a couple years now, but these past two years have had a significant loss that I'm starting to be concerned. Before these two years my eyesight was bad at the level where I had to sit in the 2nd row of a classroom to view the board, so I decided to get glasses(1.5 or something around that range). Now it's at the point where I can't read the words from my laptop without my glasses anymore(I haven't went to do any recent checkups, which I should do when I get the chance). I'm studying computer science and spend a sizable amount of my day reading, practicing or gaming (like 3-12 hours) and I've installed Flux along with any blue light filter on my devices and on my glasses. I'm really concerned that I'll go blind or have really really bad eyesight by the time I finish my program and I was wondering how can I better my eyesight or slow down the degradation. How do people in this career deal with this problem? Would printing out my books to read be a better alternative(although I've heard of the same problem from some of my friends). Please give me any tips on how to deal with this. Thank you! ",15Apr2017,1

10,"Just like the title says, I spend an absurd amount of time in front of my computer. In thise past years, I must've spent over 10 000 hours gaming, and many more watching shows/movies/videos, and them some more browsing random shit. Without a doubt this has held me back from living a more fulfilling life. I thought for a long time ""this is who I am, who cares if it's socially accepted or not"", since I've always preferred to be a shut in since I was a kid, but now I'm 23 and I still feel like a fucking child in terms of maturity and responsibility. My anxiety (which I've been living with forever) has been pretty terrible during this time, and this past year I've been living through intense bouts of depression and self loathing. At this point I feel pretty disconnected with reality, I feel content with half assing everything and I don't give myself a chance to grow as a person. 

If this post seems excessively negative, it's because I'm not feeling very good about myself right now. My self esteem's been at it's lowest for the past year and I'm starting to give up way too easily on things. I can't go on living like this, i feel like I'm living the rest of my days until I don't feel like living anymore.

What tf can I do at this point? I don't want to give up gaming, it's a huge part of who I am, but It's taking up way too much space in my priorities right now. A typical day for me is spent ENTIRELY in front of my computer, except when I go to class or spend time with my buddies.

16,"I'm turning 28 in a few weeks, and I've never felt so empty and worthless in my life.

I have been working under the table my entire life. I have had several legal part time jobs, but my main work is with horses. I am paid in cash for everything. My main duties are cleaning stalls, training horses and shoeing them. I'm ready to own a boarding facility and expand but I'm finding that all of the banks and loan offices just stare me in the face and laugh behind my back. At first it was frustrating but now I have serious anxiety.

Here's the big deal; I've been working out of the same facility since I was in my early teens. I've worked for the barn owner and shadowed her all this time. She is ready to retire. She has no spouse and no children, so her decision is to sell the entire property including the barn and the business as well as her house. If it sells to someone that won't continue to employ me, or perhaps not even run an equine business at all... what am I supposed to do?

I desperately want this facility and to take over. It is something I have both the knowledge and the skills to absolutely 100% do with success... but with no paper trail, nobody else believes me. I've spoken with the owner about seller financing. Not an option for her, she just wants out and she wants to have nothing more to do with it.

I'm losing my living, and I just can't stop thinking that there has to be SOME way that I can achieve my goals of running this business myself. My anxiety and depression are so bad right now. I feel like I'm about to find out if I have everything I want or if I'm about to lose it all.

I'm losing hope every day. I want this more than anything in the world and I'm running out of time to make it real. What steps can I take to achieve my goals, and who can I talk to in order to get something rolling in the right direction?

I'm desperate. I keep seeing commercials for banks that will ""believe in you"" and loans that will ""help you achieve your goals"" but I can't find where any of that is true in reality. There has to be something out there, or am I delusional?

TL;DR I've been working under the table at the same place for 17 years and now it's for sale. How do I buy it?",15Apr2017,1
17,"So I am a CS major. I have always known since high school that I've wanted to write code for a living because it has been one of the few academic things I actually don't suck at and find interesting and fun. I however have been struggling my way through school for the last 4 years and I still have maybe 2 years left from a mixture of having to retake some classes and transferring schools and losing credits. I get A's and B's in my Computer Sci. classes but other classes such as math/physics I just struggle a lot with, even then the thing that always bogs down my grades is tests which I am terrible at taking. I know a lot of my school problems stem from the fact that I was able to skate through high school without really studying and so I never really developed the study/testing skills needed now that I am taking harder upper level classes. I think I am an decent programmer at least compared to my classmates and I don't have trouble understanding the material of other subject my main downfall is showing it on tests and such. It seems like every test I take chips away at my grade all semester. 

My current overall GPA is a 3.0 but my school GPA (used for all criteria and excludes previous classes from other schools) is a 2.4. I am not officially in my advanced program yet because the requirement is a school GPA of 2.5. I have a 3.4 in my CS pre-req classes. So this semester I have only taken other req classes to try bump up my school GPA and I think part of my unhappiness with school this semester comes from not taking any classes I actually like. The semester is almost over and it is looking like I will get all C's.  

I have about 45k in private student loan debt (didn't qualify for federal). I have hated every moment of this semester. However I have been working full time this year at a company as a technical support in their Network Operation Center (NOC). The pay is decent for my area and in the last few months they have asked me to start working on coding projects during my graveyard shifts as there is little else to do. Mainly just doing updates to our in-house ticketing/database systems as the software Dev. who manages it in the software department is being overextended by other projects and has little time to update it. I have talked with him several times and the consensus in the software department is that the NOC needs to move development of our in house software tools to a dedicated department position or IT position. I also know that several people have suggested that I move into this role both supervisors and other software devs in the software dep. My direct supervisor is supportive of this transition and I think my department manager is too.  I am pretty sure that I could turn my current position into a software position. My company has a habit of taking people from the NOC and putting them into software developer roles (half of the current software department is from the NOC). I work graveyard shifts full time at this company. Since graves are mainily babysitting our products in case something breaks I have a ton of free time which I spend the majority of doing homework but when I don't have homework I work on the coding projects for work.  My end goal from school has always been to get a job as a programmer. 

I currently make about 1800 a month. If I leave school my loan payments would be 600 a month minimum. My rent is paid for for the next year and I have 6k saved. 

So with that bit of vague background here is my dilemma:  
  
- Should I keep attending school and eventually get my CS degree? I think I can do it but it will take me at least another 2 years and during this time I will be acquiring further student debt (it will be federal loans going forward, about 10k-20k depending). I am not the best of students and I really hate school at this point but I could suck it in and eventually get the degree. The CS job market pays well and if I got the degree I would be able to find jobs easier and have no trouble paying off the debt. However I think I am over extending myself by working full time and doing school full time, so if I decided to finish my degree I would quit my job so I could focus on school.   
  
- Should I take a year off school to see where this job takes me? I am moving in favor of this option as I really like my job and the company I work for is full of advancement opportunities even if I don't have a degree. If I took time off school I could focus on getting into a full time software position. I have all the skills I need to be successful as a software dev at this company and have shown I can do it by working on these coding projects. If I don't have school I can spend all my graveyard shift working on code and further proving my worth. Once I have a few years of experience as a programmer I don't think I will have difficulty finding other jobs in the field and moving up. However I know that not having a degree may hurt me when applying at some companies even if I have experience. If this current job doesn't work out or I decide I want to finish my degree I believe college credits don't expire for 10 years so I would have plenty of time to go back if need be. The one thing I am kind of nervous with about this path the judginess of some people about anyone without a degree. I have been told my entire life that college was required to be successful and I think a lot of my family and friends will give me a hard time about dropping out because they to have bought into this college is required narrative. I am still young but from what I've seen most employers also hold this view and I am worried that going this route may hurt me.  
  
- Lastly (and jokingly) Should I drop out and quit work and become a bum and hide from my enormous debt. Possibly change my name and identity to become a criminal hacker. I have worked with technology and old people enough to know that I probably could make good money hacking old people. I went to my Grandma's retirement community a while ago and like half of the wifi's were unsecured. Most old people can't figure out how to use a printer let alone figure out that someone is stealing their data over their wifi.

TL;DR I need to choose between dropping out to pursue a full time programmer job or quit my job to focus on school to get my CS degree (I suck at school)

20,"I started learning Thai and Burmese back in 2012 with the goal to live alongside the people and help them/learn from them and in 2014 moved to Thailand/Myanmar. I kept up with movies and music and politics pretty regularly during 2014. I began to learn both languages really well and decided that I wanted to go out and do charity work and live with the people. For all of 2015-16 I lived in remote villages in both countries and had literally next to no technology besides the biannual 3-4 day trip to Bangkok or Yangon. It was an amazing experience and I returned home to Texas end of this past December. Needless to say, I knew almost nothing about music and movies and politics and everything else. I've been attending university since January and have been pretty busy. Obviously I've heard about the elections and other huge news stories. I've listened to some of the music that came out that I like (alt indie rock/pop, folk, singer songwriter) but I'm sure I've missed a lot. I've seen Star Wars 7, Jason Bourne, Zootopia and Captain America: Civil War since being back and that's it. 

I'm really open to all sorts of movies and music and would just like to hear about the happenings and music and movies and things that made 2015-16 awesome and memorable for all of y'all! 

Any suggestions would be very welcome. I'm gonna start a list with everything mentioned so I can read/research/watch/listen to it this summer!

Not sure if this is the right place to put it on Reddit bc I got an account when I got home and I'm still kind of out of the loop on social media and everything. Coming home was a huge shock in a lot of ways.

21,"To preface; I'm 13, living w/ both of my parents.

Me and my parents had a ""talk"" about divorce a week or three ago. It started with my dad saying, since my mom always says she can't live here anymore then she'll just leave, that maybe she should do good on her promise. He asked my mom and I what we wanted the living situation to be, if there was to be a divorce, and said that he didn't care who I went to (explained later by saying he couldn't live with me the way I am behaving). My mom said that she guesses me living with both my parents would be good, because I'm still young, and I chose the same option. 
My dad decided that we would live like this for now, apparently just agreeing with my mom. 

I'm not going to try to defend myself. I'm a sucky kid. I fight with my mom a lot because of dumb petty things, like not getting what I asked her on the grocery run, and annoying me while I'm doing hw/drawing. Sometimes I cry afterwards and she yells to stop crying because (I'm assuming) I don't even have a reason to cry. I'm not a straight A student- I have 3 As, 1 B, and 2 Cs. I'm impatient and I whine to be allowed to buy things the absolute moment I want them. I lie around and don't do hw and slack off when I get home from school. I may whine for material items but I think all I want is just to have my parents say they love me or that I did well on something, idk. My family isn't really a ""express-your-love-with-words"" family, or any form of expression even. Once I asked a question about my grade on some writing I did and later she said that I had improved a lot from first semester. I cried at my desk a bit afterwards and I felt like crud.

35,"First, apologies for a rather clunky thread title, and possibly for what might turn into a bit of a ramble. 

I'll start with the event itself. It was about a year ago, I had been working in Ukraine for a short period, and with the money paid from that and what savings I already had, decided to head out to Asia for an extended trip. I'm a bit of a wanderer, and happy to arrive in a place with no real plans and make my own way of it.

I pick a dirt-cheap flight and off I go, flying from Kiev to Bangkok, unfortunately there is a rather crushing 17hr layover in Dubai. Now I am not the world's greatest sleeper, and due to extreme beanpole-ness, struggle to get comfy/nap on a plane. The upshot is I didn't sleep the night before my early flight, didn't sleep on the plane, didn't sleep during my layover, and in fact not at all before I arrived in BKK. I'd probably been awake over 40hrs. This has relevance!

I get to Bangkok with gummy eyeballs and that weird trippy feeling you get from extended sleep deprivation. I still had a bit of a journey ahead of me, so I pick up my bags and head to the bottom level of the airport, where there is a rail link to the city. The first train leaves at about 6am, and I have an hour or two to kill. At this bottom floor, it's very quiet, there's a little 7/11, and some benches with no harsh airport lights. There are already a couple of people camped out there, asleep.

I didn't plan to sleep, but I lay on bench playing on my phone, and at some point I just pass out. My bag was an oversized backpack type, with a smaller backpack that could be detached from it. Due to at some point operating or needing certain items to hand, I ended up with all the following stuffed into that small backpack - my laptop, my hard drive, my wallet, a go pro, $3000 in cash, and fantastically, all my boxer shorts. My phone was in my hand as I slept, and my passport was in my pocket. My bag is so stuffed, the corner of the laptop is peeking out of it where I can't fully zip it up. Obviously this attracts a rather entrepreneurial young gentleman, who casually picks up the bag and wanders out my life forever (I watched it on CCTV later). This isn't the end of the story that night, but I feel I should cut it here and get on to the advice bit. Can tell more in the comments if anyone would like to hear about it. 

So those possessions, what of it right? It's annoying but not shattering, nothing that can't be replaced. Well, kinda. The go pro, laptop, don't care; the money, well that was a waste of 2 months work but never mind; the boxers, who needs extr layers in this heat. But the hard drive...it just had my life on it.

I am a (massively underachieving) writer of sorts. Every original thought I'd had since about 15 (32 now), every article, lyric, short story, novel, idle thought, moments of inspiration, jokes, travel writing, blogs, love letters to and from old gfs...whatever brief moment of inspiration or insight, I would bring up notepad, jot down a line or two...just thousands of files, all categorised, arranged, in various states of completion. My life's work. 

What's more, all my pictures, original artwork and music, gigs of obscure music and movies (I like ska/punk, and my collection started from the Napster days - so much stuff impossible to find now), random quotes, advice, and articles written by others that touched me somehow. What does the average Redditor have saved on their hard drive? It was probably a lot like that...going through it would be like walking through my mind.

I am not smart. I didn't back up files. I didn't have insurance. This is not the advice I need as it has been well learnt now :) I just have this huge feeling that a part of me is gone. 

I know it might sound stupid. And I've tried to rationalise most of it - music and movies can be replaced, and if I can't remember what I had then it probably wasn't super important. A lot of the content was in my Chrome bookmarks, so obviously I got those back when I logged in. A good chunk of my writing was truly shit, so I tried to get in the mindset that this was fresh start in that regard. But it's hard, and it weighs on my mind and hold me back.

I can't get back into writing, I can't start again from zero, and I can't shake the feeling that there was a lot of good stuff there that represented me, and I will never be able to express it that way again. The pictures alone piss me off - my youth, my friends and family, moments in time that I can't always hold in my memory, so really valued the picture form. 

Anyway I should cut myself short (ish) here and let you guys take over. Any similar experiences? Any thoughts on how to move on? How to motivate to start again and lose this feeling of dread?",15Apr2017,1

I get that this might sound petty to a lot of people here, but given how strongly I feel about the matter, I'm not sure there's any non-hypocritical solution other than cutting myself off from her.

40,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. So I was just shaving my pubes. I must've went too hard and accidentally nicked myself about 5 times on the area of skin that's above the wiener and the part that covers your bladder. (If someone could tell me the name of that area that would be great.)
So once I saw little bloody dots, I immediately went as fast and as careful as possible so I could clean it up. Once I finished the other side which took about another 3 minutes, I washed off all the shaving cream. I then took some old spice body wash and just washed up the wounds. 
It's still bleeding a tiny bit, but I wanted to make sure I did the right thing. I've heard horror stories about people who nicked themselves and have got STD's and shit. Hopefully someone can help!",15Apr2017,1
41,"Hi, I'm 15 years old and I've been pretty introverted with my feelings and I tend to overthink and worry a lot. I've kept a lot of things to myself, but I eventually get over it and move on. Never have I ever had a problem like this before.   
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
I don't exactly know where to start, so I'll pick a point and I'll go with it. You know the quote, ""Live life to the fullest""? Great! I'm going to live every day with as much happiness as possible because one day there won't be a tomorrow, right? Sure, but I've began to think outside the box and I honestly regret it so much.   
  
  
  
  
 
Why do we matter? In a couple of trillion years we won't matter anymore. I know it's a very large scale, but eventually there won't be an earth anymore. There won't be us anymore. I don't know about you, but I believe in God and heaven. I believe in life after death. Eternal life after death, but that's what scares me. Have you ever thought of the actual meaning of forever/eternal? When you die, you just supposedly stay in heaven (of course if you make it) forever living a good life? That does sound good, but, FOREVER? I don't know about you, but even if it's the best life ever, it gives me anxiety thinking about living eternally. I've never thought about it like this before, but forever is a really long time. Maybe it's just me, though. 


  
 
 
I know a lot of people aren't religious and I apologize to those who aren't for that portion of my post, but here's the actual problem: I've felt pretty good about my life and that I can easily enjoy it if I wanted to for as long as I can remember until my friend and I had a talk a week ago about this. It made me realize, why have fun, why try so hard if you're going to die anyway? Sure, you can make a mark on the world and maybe even make history! But what happens when the world is gone? That doesn't matter anymore then. That's where I stop thinking, and I get major anxiety. Before this, I stopped thinking at ""ahhh, I'm living a good life, some day I'll die but I'll be in heaven hopefully."" I never thought any further. Some other people might say that it's better to live happy than it is to live sad, of course it won't matter in the very end, but it's just much better to live happy. I agree, but I can't help to think I've been tricked for 15 years. Every thing I've worked for, every memory I've made, it just doesn't seem like it matters anymore and my motivation for doing anything starts to deplete as well. I don't only feel tricked, but I get lots of anxiety and I start to feel soooo sad because I wish life could be longer. I look around and notice so many people enjoying and having a good time, and then I think, ""How are they having so much fun if they're going to die anyway?"" It's like I'm constantly forcing myself to be happy now, I can still do it naturally, but then right after I get this new thought saying, ""It doesn't matter, we're gonna die anyway.""

  

 
  
 
 There's so much more going through my mind than this, I'm just trying to find ways to put it to words. I do hope for help, I really miss being happy soooo much, but how can you help this? It's just the scary truth of life, and I really don't wanna get over it. Basically, I'm just looking for another way to look at life other than this. I was fine with thinking of going to heaven and stop thinking there, I reallyyyy was but now I have this stupid theory. Thank you so much for reading this if you got this far, you're great.

Option 2: (my more favored option, if i can make it work) Me and one of my closest friends are contemplating moving into an apartment together near  community college that is local and getting jobs. 

So this is where I require the most help in, I need to find a job that will be able to bring in enough money to afford this. So essentially im just asking what are the best jobs that are available with little certification/qualifications, I need to be making more than minimum wage. I understand some sort of courses/tests might need to be taken for jobs like these. Im looking for something that can be completed over the summer
 
I as well cannot work full time as i will be attending school, and would like to bring in as much money as possible
The jobs ive thought of thus far have been

48,"Hello everyone. I've spent the past month battling the heat in my rental home. I've kind of hit a dead end here and I've been talking with my dad who is also perplexed by my current situation and has no idea what's up, so I had the idea to maybe head here to get more opinions on what could be up.

For starters, this rental home is horrendously insulated. During the winter I could feel the frigid air blowing in through the windows in rather large volume. Keeping the house heated took my heater nearly constant running, and even it sometimes couldn't keep up at night. I'd wake up in the morning to a 50F house some days. Honestly, I didn't mind though, I love that temperature range of 50-60. Otherwise, it's of no surprise than that during a spring or summer day the house is going to get hot, and it sure does. Just today my inside temperature read 85F, but what really throws me off is it was only 75F outside. This carries on into the nights. As I'm writing this my inside temperature is 78F while outside is 58F. I have two windows open, one with a fan pulling air in and another fan pushing air out the other window, yet I watch as the temperature continues to rise. (Oop, jumped to 79F as I finished that sentence). This is an oddity to me though, as this is as hot as it gets during the day, so it almost seems as if the heat from the day doesn't even have an effect. 

Now for some more specifics: My rental home is a two story duplex and I'm on the bottom floor. I have GIANT windows with terrible insulation, but I have blackout curtains on all of them to prevent the place from becoming an oven from the sun. I have a gas burner stove with pilot lights that produce heat, but certainly nothing substantial to the point I'm at. My heater is a floor furnace, but since winter is passed I have put out the pilot light, so there's no way it's accidentally kicking on. I only have one light on during any point of the day. I have a fan on that pretty well constantly blows directly on me. And finally, the only other thing that produces heat in this house (that I'm aware of) is my computer. My temperatures do appear to rise sharply when my computer is on, but I really don't feel like it (thermometer just hit 80F) is spitting out enough heat to raise the temperature this drastically, especially when I'm not stressing it with gaming and am just browsing the web. Plus my observations have been inconsistent. Some days when I don't run the computer it gets just as hot. Sometimes I get home and the house is 72F, until I turn my computer on then it rises up to 80F in half an hour. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I really hope that someone has an idea for what is going on here and hopefully even a solution. Any suggestions, ideas, or theories is welcomed, it's very frustrating to be completely incapable of cooling this house. I dealt with it past summer, but a month into spring and I'm already miserable. 

**Update** Did a minitest overnight and found that having my desktop on only speeds up the heating process it seems. I ran my AC and got the room back down to 71F, and turned off everything but a light and my Nintendo Switch. The room has climbed back up to 78F with the outside temp being 65F now. Really dunno what's causing this. ",15Apr2017,2

53,"I'm stuck between a hard place and another hard place. I'm 18, and I'm mtf transgender. My parents, particularly my dad, HATE trans people. My dad openly mocks LGBT people (he's also a racist, by the way), and especially hates trans people. I'm not a Christian.  
If my dad found out, I'm almost 100% convinced that he would disown me, or even physically hurt me. Knowing my mom, she would be upset and angry, probably creeped out, but I think she'd eventually learn to ""tolerate"" it. So I'm stuck. My dad is far worse. A direct quote by him:  
""You see all of these movies where some liberal parents are all accepting when their son comes out as gay or trans. That would never be me. I'd disown my son in a heartbeat. Promise me you'll never be gay.""  

If I choose to transition, I'll be risking my relationship with my mom, certainly giving up my relationship on my dad, and possibly getting seriously hurt. I've got friends that care about me. Friends that are like family. But it would be so hard to leave my parents. My moms a good person. Even though she doesn't get it, it's out of ignorance, not hatred. She agreed with me that the trans girl on Orange is the new Black is one of the best characters. That's a start.  
But if I choose not to transition, I'll be stuck in this disgusting shell called a ""male"". I'll suffer from the dysphoria and self hatred I've had for so long. But my parents will still love me.  
I don't know how to decide. If I could be a cis male, I would be in a heartbeat. I'm not risking my life and happiness because I'm some ""pervert"" that gets off by dressing in drag (not that there's anything wrong with that!). If that were the case, I'd keep it to myself. If that were the case, I wouldn't be looking into going $75,000 in debt just so I could have my cock turned inside out. The signs have been there since I started puberty. I've been denying it for years, and I was robbed of my childhood as a result.

54,"So basically I'm in deep shit. I recently got arrested for some stupid stuff and am at the moment I'm trying to get my life straight by not doing any more illegal shit and just focusing on school etc.. but these mother fuckers who I used to call friends appear to have fucked me dry. It all started when I gave one of them my old phone to test out to see if he wanted to buy it (I had lost this phone but it was returned to me so I just had it laying around), let's call this person Greg. So since Greg and I were friends at the time I had no problem lending him my phone to try out after this whole arresting thing happened the police ended up taking my phone and this other person who was involved, let's call this person James' phone but not Greg's. So at this point in time i lack a phone so I went to Greg during school and asked him for my phone which he replied with ""I gave it to James"" so me completely annoyed at this point try to keep my shit together and said ok I'll talk to him tomorrow. ok so the next day i talk to James and he completely denies ever having the phone. Shortly after this conversation, this girl who is an actual crackhead comes down the stairs and talks to all of us, she then pulls out her phone, MY PHONE!!!! by chance this crackhead just so happened to have my phone. I talked to both Greg and James and none of them admit selling my phone. They are acting as fake friends to me at the moment and I'm doing the same, just because i want my phone back and no trouble.

I'm also not supposed to be talking to these guys cuz they are co-accused and by Canadian law I'm not allowed to talk to them.

The reason I am leaving home is because I got fed up of living with my mother. Unpredictable, controlling and narcissistic. 

But when I spend time with my siblings, particularly my youngest brother my heartbreaks. He is 18 and I will miss him with everything in me!

I know I will be home often but it almost feels like my parents are cutting me off as they are not happy with my decision. However, the reality is it gets good one day and then it's bad for 2-3 weeks. 

When some days are going good I feel like I've made the wrong decision. However, it would be unfair to pull out from my flat share because 2 girls are now involved. If I go through with this, this will be the first time in my life I've stood up to my parents, and actually stuck to a decision. Last year I didn't go through with my move because my mom said she would disown me, kill herself and tried to fight me. What was it over? I accidental made a small unnoticeable hole in her dress and as a result she hit me. She's was physically abusive until 23! 

Anyway, what should I do?

60,"I turn 24 this month and I've been married for nearly three years. I absolutely love my wife, but some days I can't help but think of what it would be like to be single again. I enjoy the thought, but the thought of the act of divorce and the fact that she would literally have nowhere to go or anyone to take care of her is terrifying to me. She can't hold a job because of health reasons and she has no family to stay with if we weren't together. 

I believe I've pretty much trapped myself and I totally understand that it's my fault. My grandparents pressured me into getting married (whole southern US thing about getting married early blah blah blah church). 

Due to her health problems she has a very bad memory and mood swings  (bipolar disorder affects people differently I guess) and most days it's like raising a child. Not her mentality, but the fact that I constantly have to remind her to do every little thing and that she doesn't use common sense for anything at all.

We were looking for a movie to watch and I saw A Clockwork Orange and asked if he'd seen it, he said he skipped around on it. I told him that I'd heard it was pretty messed up, and he said that he was into that sort of thing. When I asked what he meant, he directly told me about how he is into the rape stuff in it and things like that. I was taken aback, because early in the day he was making some joke about how I should just say yes to whatever he wants to do (in bed), and not say no. When I asked what would happen if I said no, he said that I should change it by saying yes. While I knew he was joking, because he has kind of an odd sense of humor sometimes, it rubbed me the wrong way as have past jokes he's made. I can't help but feel like he was getting a feel for how I respond to that sort of thing. I won't go into total back story, but I've had things happen to me in the past and he knows it.

He told me that he avoided telling me what he was into because of how I react to certain things he says, or talking about rape situations like in movies and such, and he knows that I don't like it. I had no idea though. We do rough things in the bedroom sometimes because I enjoy it, but now the thought makes me feel weird. I started acting less upbeat and alive, just more reserved and focused on the movie we watched (Logan) and he noticed.

I think he knew what I was upset about, but I didn't tell him why. I just told him I wasn't feeling good because we ate a bunch of junk food earlier.

Back Story:
Family life hasn't always been good. My dad has had only about 3% of his liver, was on a transplant list anx was later found with colon cancer (that they successfully removed) and was taken off the transplant list. Stuck on medications to control it but nothing to cure it. In January, my dad left staying at my grandmothers (mothers side) house for whatever reason, we dont know. Something was said and he was tired of staying there so he packed a bag and went to stay with a friend..... Or so we thought. Turns out he went to stay in a homeless shelter downtown and ended up somehow hitting his head and getting into a coma. (This may be due to his advanced liver disease that caused his ammonia levels to be high. A common side effect of not taking medication is coma).
Fast forward to middle of February, I get a phone call from him saying he was in a coma and admitted into a hospital. This whole time I did not know where he was and nobody heard from him. I finally went to visit him and turns out they were ready to release him but he told them he had no family and nowhere to go. Due to his condition, they offered him to enter hospice. He accepted. 
Fast forward now to two weeks ago. He was walking around, seeming capable and fine and told them to only reveal information to me and that he had no other family. My mom and I visited him one week ago and he was fine and walking around, we even went out to the court yard and he was saying how nice it was to get sun since he hadn't left his bed since he went there. During this time, he haf trouble even holding a cup of water on his own. The next day? Apparently he removed a whole tank off the back of the toilet, flooded the bathroom and was found with blood and who knows what else everywhere. I was not contacted. The reason why is that they claim they have to respect his wishes and that he said he would call me to let me know. The problem is, my mom visited him on Sunday, within 24 he's of the incident.... He didnt even know who she was and was so out of it, he couldn't even make it to the bathroom to pee. She had to hand feed him. I went that night to take photos and after apeaking with a nurse, found out he hasnt been taking his medication which would cause ammonia levels to be high again. cayse confusion and could lead to coma again. He seemed out of it still and when I visited Monday, he was too depressed to even talk to me. Tuesday, he seemed better and was communicating and even asked for donuts. By Wednesday though.... He couldn't even talk anymore, can't close his eyes and is seeming aggitated. They put an adult diaper on him and have had him medicated on morphine and ""anti anxiety"" meds. He can no longer swallow and is just laying there with no fever and good blood pressure. The nurses kept insisting I make final arrangements and that he won't last the night.... 3 days later, I'm not sure what to think. 
My question:
Hospice won't reveal much info to me and informed me he signed a DNR and he has willingly accepted hospice care. I feel the sudden decline of his condition may be from medications. The facility he is at has NO medical devices, heart monitors, ANYTHING. Do I have the ability to move him to a different facility or even a hospital to assess his condition? The hospice had no idea he was even in the VA and kinda just took his word on all his medical conditions as they clearly didnt pull actual medical records. I dont know what I can do or if there is anything I can do. Is this where power of attorney would come into play? 

Thanks in advance for the replies. Serious ones only please. 

TLDR: 
Dad admitted himself into hospice who had no medical records. I'm wondering if their just medicating him till he dies because they haven't ran any medical tests. He is at the stage where he is bed bound and cannot communicate. He signed a DNR (allegedly).  Do I have the ability to move him out of hospice and into a hospital? Would there be any point at this stage?

83,"I know most people don't think rural areas are bad but this is fucking killing me. I go months without seeing anyone so it's hard to stay motivated just to stay in shape shower and do all that 

On top of that the weather is fucking insane for more than half the year it's -30 snowing dark as fuck. I have no car and I live miles and miles from everything and every time I get in a car something bad happens so I hate driving anyway. My family is poor as fuck and we live in a shambled down shit hole house with mold and other toxins everywhere so I feel like I need fresh air. 

There's fucking nothing to do. There's no one my age in town everyone's crazy it's cold as fuck the weather is always shit. They don't even the money here to do redneck shit like hiking there's not a single trail. I can't even find the motivation to live let alone work 8 hour days every single day and come home and do nothing but sleep. 

On top of that I've been abused by my family every way possible so I hate every second of life. I just want to fucking go. I just want to go somewhere in a big city where people aren't closed off from the world and living in poverty. Somewhere warm where I can actually go outside and some place where there's actually shit to do and I don't have to see the same people over and over again. ",15Apr2017,1
84,"This has been going on for a couple of months, I dont have any friends here apart from her and her group, I say here because I'm on my last year of studying abroad.

Now, this girl is reeeally into me, or so it would seem. Recently, at a party we had in her house she got kind of drunk, and I did too, but unlike her I don't do stupid shit when I'm drunk. She kept staring at me all of the time, asking me to dance with her, etc. It seems, good for you guy, right? No.

I noticed her flirting long ago and I asked her out on a date twice before. She denied she ever felt anything for me both times, and so did her best friend, followed by a week of pretending I'm the weird one, after which she came apologising and asking if we can hang out, all the while already flopping her eyelashes like she's just experienced head trauma and making way too much unnecessary physical contact with me.

Tbh, I dont even want this to go anywhere. I'm leaving her country in less than three months, I thought since she was into me so much it would be nice to be nice. I'm just really annoyed by whatever game she's playing.",15Apr2017,20
85,"Hello everyone. I’d like to share to you what I am feeling right now. I feel like I am stuck in a rut, and I have no control over the entire situation. I am depressed and I really do not know what else to do. Talking to friends about it will not help because I am sure they would not understand the situation I am in. 

I’m moving to a different town, around 10 kilometers away from the metropolitan city. The reason for me moving is that my father is forced to move my family to this city because we are just renting a place at the metro. He’s bankrupt, old and living on his pension, and has no other option but to do this. I don’t blame him for the situation, but I do blame his life decisions. As any father would do, his responsibility is to secure the lifestyle of his family. I don’t even get much attention from him. My younger brother, on the other hand, who happened to study in the main city, will now be moving to a different school extremely far from the main city. In my country, it’s the type of school that would affect him socially because it is not one of the many known schools. Meaning, his classmates would probably be shady. I graduated from a very known school. Him, on the other hand, did not go in the same direction and will be studying at a ""lower-tier"" school. I am very worried for him. I get it. Education is key. Socially though, this would affect him because of how he will be treated. From where I graduated, my classmates were rich as fuck kids, who of course I could use for potential business partners in the future, and that is the purpose of studying in a good private school: for personal connections and future businesses with them. We don’t have a choice but to comply because no one else will be providing for education. I think we are really at a financial rut right now. Just to let you know, we are coming from a broken family. Parents are technically divorced. They never talk. Father has a different family. I never had a father figure growing up, and that fucking affected my social skills and definitely my self-esteem. I try to compensate this by having different forms of escapism (weed, gym, reading books, etc.). Obviously, these are things that cannot surpass the power of communication with family. There never was an intervention. Mother’s upbringing was never given any parental advice from grandparents. 

As for me, I am about to lose my job by the end of the month, and will now be forced to look for a new one. The problem here is that most jobs being offered are located at the prime city, where I will be staying is far from the commercial area. I don’t have a car and commuting will definitely be an issue, because no public transportation passes that place. My mother, younger brother and I will be moving there by the end of next month and I am forced to think that this is my judgment day when all hope is lost. I swear, the neighborhood there is shady. There is nothing there. No neighborhood, no commercial area, nothing. My lifestyle is affected. :( This means my subscription at the gym will stop. Meeting with friends will become an issue because I am now 10 kilometers away from them. I consider my friends as the guys I always hang out, and is also a form of escapism from my sadness. I can’t even talk to them about it, because they would not understand the situation I am in. This definitely affected my personal relationships with them. I don’t blame them for not understanding the situation, because they were never put in that hopelessness before. I'm starting to even have a hard time hanging with them due to the growing ""lifestyle difference"" that we have. It's hard to be around them lately because I can't express my current situation to them. Partly because I am embarrassed of it. Don't get me wrong, they are good friends. I'm just sure that they wouldn't appreciate and sympathize with my situation simply because they would not understand it. I couldn't even have the nerve to tell them that I am moving out of my place and will be forced to move 6 miles away. This, for me, is very hard to accept. 

Being stuck in a corporate job will not solve the issue as this would not even allow me to earn a big amount in the short term. Heck, this is not what I’ve been wanting to do professionally. I always wanted to practice medicine, but given my financial status, this cannot be done for now. Take note, student loans are not really a thing here, so monetary issues are really piling up. Again, leading my life to judgment day and hopelessness. 

I am so scared because I’m only 23 but I feel like my life’s purpose is to suffer. I can’t think of anything to bounce back. Thinking about it further, there’s nothing else I can do that is in my control. There is nothing I can do, but to “work hard” and earn a decent amount to invest in something, probably business related, and move on from that. 

I wish I could blame everything on my father, but this is life and shit happens. I really don’t want to hate him, but this sadness is irresistibly unavoidable. :( It’s hard to keep a positive attitude when these kinds of things are over my head. ",15Apr2017,1

I usually see her now in the bar at night and we make eye contact awkwardly a lot, like you do when two people like each other I guess haha, she's my sisters age but looks older not gonna lie.

89,"I got this job at a PC shop and I'm loving it so far.

Getting along with the team, getting good feedback from them as well including my boss. Literally all signs are showing that I could get this job.

But I can't fucking see the boss saying ""Congratulations"", I just feel like I'm making screw up after screw up but the only thing that's happened is I've forgotten to scan a serial number twice.

I really want this job, I'm loving it so far and would hate to lose it but I feel like as hard as I try, I'm not going to get it for some reason when logically there's no reason as to why I wouldn't get one other than it being kinda hard to tell what my boss is thinking.

He does this thing where when he gives me advice or talks to me at all, he looks to the side of me kinda like a blind person does and I think that's making me feel uneasy. 

I don't know what my problem is, I just get super embarrassed when I do something wrong and it feels like I really fucked up when to me it seems like a kinda small problem.

93,"This may be a long one but it's been going on for about 8 months. I am in college and live in a house with 3 other girls and I'm in hell. The way the house is, my room is downstairs near the kitchen and living rooms, and there are three rooms upstairs. Walls are thin and I try to be aware of that but this is just insane. A few things they've done:

We have a door with a deadbolt that doesn't connect to a key so if I piss them off they will just lock me out of my own house for days on end. I never know if I'm going to be able to get into my house or access my stuff. 

They come in wasted and screaming at 2am pretty much every Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and it's a crap shoot as to whether it's going to happen the rest of the week. If I text them asking for them to be quieter it is met with verbal hostility (screaming about me right outside my room) and hostile replies over text. I get called ""that fucker"" and ""faggot"" a lot. I'm gay. 

Two dogs that bark incessantly and only ever poop and pee inside, I wasn't told about them before I moved in and I don't think the housing complex knows about them. 

Massive parties they don't tell me about that go on until 4 or 5 am. Lots of damage to the house. At least one of them isn't old enough to drink, they are all very young. I'm a few years older. 

The kitchen is always filthy and full of rotting food so I don't cook or eat there. I have never been able to spend time outside my room in this house. Anything I leave outside my locked room goes missing or I find in the trash can. A lot of time I come home and find what little food I had in the fridge has been thrown away  I've lost a lot of weight, but not in a good way, because I don't eat anything but cold soup in a can here. 

They are always ALWAYS smoking weed which is against the lease and my stuff always reeks of it. 

There's so much more, but this is the big stuff. 

Overall hostile and loud environment. I am a really tidy, fairly chill roommate, I don't make messes and have never left a dirty dish in the sink. I try not to nag and try to remember that they deserve to make noise in the house as much as I deserve to have quiet, I think I'm a genuinely good roommate. 

Management is apathetic at best and I'm unable to break lease or find a subletter. Lease ends late June. I may have a place to stay rent free in exchange for housesitting a month earlier, but also maybe not. I don't really have anywhere else to go for more than a night here and there. 

I'm getting so depressed here and am superbly uncomfortable all the time. What can I do? They gang up on me if I say anything and then make sure they do more of whatever I'm asking them to not do. Any advice at all on how to handle these next few months gracefully?

Tldr: roommates from hell. Lock me out for days at a time, screaming at 2am, slurs directed at me. Rotting food. Dogs shit and pee inside, lots of house damage. Throw away my stuff and overall hostile and not good people. Management apathetic. I'm stuck here for a few more months and I'm losing my mind.

96,"Writing from the UK I have an odd problem (Name changed in case someone I know sees this)

Hello,

I am writing to ask for some advice on a tricky situation. I am currently a first-year UG on a shit course. I do not enjoy my degree nor do I enjoy BF (Uni name) so much. Unfortunately, I also suffer from a mental health illness and being away from home in a new surrounding, doing something I hate has completely shredded my confidence and such.

As it stands, I have an unconditional place at a London-based university for DC (New course). However, I have been thinking hard about this and I realise that going to this university may not be the best idea as certain persons attend that university and they are the ones partly responsible for my health issues. I understand that my degree is all that matters, but I don't think it is a good idea to go somewhere that will see me surrounded by people who are simply not going to make my experience any better. I wish for a fresh start and I realise that going to this place will not give me that.

In January I sent off a UCAS application for DC and was not accepted by SL as I only achieved ABC whereas they want AAA. I understand why, of course, but I have decided to challenge and appeal this. Between February-April I have been getting medical health and it has been concluded that I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, with the occasional suicidal thoughts. I was told that these are potential reasons behind my less-than-stellar A-Level performance, and I was urged to contact SL with these reasonings to see if any reconsideration can be taken place. I personally hate to have to use my health as a factor but I agreed to do so and have contacted the institution through their messaging service. I am greatly nervous about this, for so many reasons;

It is extremely likely that they will just say no
I think that going to the other university could be a bad idea
I am uncertain of my future

I ask today for some advice. Is there any way in which I can strengthen my case with SL? I have offered to provide proof of illness and I also have extensive outside experience that directly relates to the course I have chosen such as working in parliament, campaigning and writing theoretical pieces. I am anxious that they will just look at it, see the grades and say no. If it helps my case, I am also a minority from a single-mother household, was on free school meals and I live in a deprived London borough. I wish to somehow show them why I am good for the course, but I know the limitations of this. As it stands, SL is the dream choice for me and I did hold an offer with them in 2015/2016 for Classical Studies. I know that you cannot offer too much advice, but I would appreciate anything.",15Apr2017,0
97,"It's all started way back when I was a kid maybe when I was like 5 years old. From the beginning I'm not the type who talk a lot in public nor even a socialize type of kid who play with other kids and having fun like tht. My parents told me tht. Way back there I love to play alone with a paper doll which were left behind by my cousin during her visit to our house tht time. I have a photo of me play with it. Other than that, when I was like 12 years old, my class kinda having a dance performance which only require the girl to dance while the boy make the hard work things like background and etc. During tht time, I kinda sneak peek the girl rehearsal while doing the background and as I return home I kinda try the dance myself. Back then I don't have that feeling ow I wanna be a girl. It's just maybe a phase. That year also is the year where I need to take my national exams after 6 years of preliminary school. That year also was the harshest year in my life as my mom died tht year and my dad kinda sad af. 
.
Despite all of that, my national exams marks were among the best in my school as I achieved straight A for the test. As I entering high school, I kinda develop a habit. I tend to visit cyber cafe Everytime school ends. That was the beginning of my gaming career. For 2 years of high school, every year my exam result was among the top 5 and it kinda surprise me  as I rarely study nor finishing my homework. I also prefer playing online game rather than study. And each game I play I usually using a female characters and introduce myself as a female. 
.
In my country after 3 years of high school, we need to take another national exam. And again I passed the exam with flying colours. Easy word my result was straight A for each subject. For some reason, my dad kinda not happy with it but it's fine. 
.
That year also my dad married a women which later on be my step mother till now. She kind and we sibling do like her.
.
In my fourth year of high school, we need to pick a main subject. Which eventually I pick pure science and it lead to my own demise as I follow my friend that time. And it's my worst decision. My result went from excellent to worst. Easy word, my high school life just ruined. Ow side note, during my last day of high school. I kinda borrow a female uniform which is in a locker behind our class. No one know about it though. 
.
Then my parents decide to married me with a girl of their choice during my age 19. And it went horrible as we divorce after 6 months marriage. And I did went to college but it went bad as my the college kinda pissed me off with their scholarship system. 
.
As I grow up I develop this envy feeling which Everytime I watch a women I kinda hate about it for not being in that spot. To make it short. I don't know it it's my past problem or its just something I felt. I kinda wanna be a women. I know it's kinda a normal shit u read in the forum. Ow it's another man who want to be a women. But well it is true. But, just wanna say I'm 22 years old and I start taking hormone without my family knowing it. But they do notice my chest kinda big. But they just ignore it just because they didn't know the transgender community as we live in Malaysia. Malaysia also known for their strict law regarding trans people. If u did Google it, trans people did got caught and sent to prison. Just because of it. Right now I only become a female when no one home. Wear some dresses and all of that. While keeping my posture as a man. I did shave and keep my hair long. My family might notice it but they kinda keep eyes on me.

I just wanna people know about it. Got lazy typing maybe that Im crying remembering all that stuff. Kinda felt alone right now as my friends is nowhere to be found. Only those I met in online game with me. I'm a mtf 4 months hrt, a Malaysian transgender. And that's my story.",15Apr2017,9

I feel as if my whole existence is null and void.Recently  everything I do feels pointless.My thoughts are pessimistic and I feel worthless all the time.It has reached a point where I am having anxiety attacks.I tried to confide this to my folks taking the indirect approach,they termed it as laziness and dismissed it(well to be fair I am a lazy person).My life's a blank and I want to do something about it.Is it just laziness or a common phase which will pass or something more than that??

I recently moved to a new city about two months ago and got a new job in retail. Since then I've had a lot of people at work look me up on Facebook without my consent [I've ignored all of their reuests]. 

More recently, this girl at my workplace has confessed feelings for me. But she has an ex who also works at the store who now thinks I'm dating her [I'm not]. Apparently, he's really jealous and doesn't like me... 

Anyway, I barely know the guy, and I barely know his friends. But one of his friends randomly added me from work [we have no mutual friends] so I don't think Facebook would suggest me to him. I feel like it's suspicious since we work in separate departments and I barely know him and we have no mutual friends, so I ignored his request. 

It's been two weeks and now I've received another friend request from some random cam girl who only has two friends. It says her profile was created on the fourth of April.

I need help. So here's the background story for you. Well, I have been in the Marine Corps reserves for about 3 years now. I just came back from a recent deployment that ended late last year. I'm home now and I'm doing everything that I thought would make me happy. Well I was wrong. I'm come to realize that I'm doing everything I love and yet I'm completely miserable. Why is that? 

So I play a lot of music. I love it very much. Writing, singing, learning. It is a stress reliever for me. I perform with a buddy of mine. We go to local bars and restaurants and play live music! It's a lot of fun. I hang out with my friend a lot. Actually so often I'm barely ever home. I stay over there a lot. My parents think it's very odd how much I stay over there and spend time with my friend. They don't think I can be alone with my thoughts. They're probably right. 

I've also been struggling with my weight. Im not a fat guy on any level. I just put weight on easier and it's hard to get off. Obviously that isn't good since I'm in the Marine Corps reserves. I am slightly overweight though. But I was doing the insanity program and I got through a month of it and I was feeling great and losing weight. I don't know what happened but I slowly stopped and then now I haven't worked out in over a month.. 

I only have a year of college under my belt and I'm concerned for my future. What am I gunna do after the Marine Corps. I'm lost and not going anywhere. Miserable and depressed.

I was a new intern so I was a little slow. But I wasnt bad at my work. My direct senior actually liked my work. Also, none of the other employees stayed there for more than a few months. 

Boss turned really petty as days passed. She would literally make it a point to ignore me everytime I greeted her. But she would talk to everyone else. 

 I started getting really anxious everytime she used to call me to her office. Had a huge panic attack on the last day and that was my final straw. Left the job right then. 

Everyone I talk to say all the bosses are like that and that I should've adjusted. Was I too weak? Are all bosses like that? Sorry for the long post. Please advice.

115,"I play on a neighborhood tennis team and a woman joined recently who clearly has mental issues. She's in her 40s and her mother is always around, because she can't drive and she talks to herself and sometimes has violent fits. When we have matches, she always puts food in her purse and tells people (under her breath) that her mother won't let her eat. 

I don't know if that counts as neglect or abuse, but it's obvious she doesn't get any medication or therapy and now the hiding of food has me worried.

117,"So, my GF just got a new tattoo 2 days ago (18). Her first tattoo was a little heart on her arm. I had problems to accept this small tattoo at the beginning but after like 2 months i was okay with it. She absolutly loves tattoos (because of her mother and her stepfather) so i tried to be interested in tattoos by myself. Now 2 days ago, she got her new tattoo, but this time a huge flower on her shoulder. i hate it and everytime i see her, i will see this tattoo because of the sice. the days went by and i had problems accepting it. last night i couldnt hold back and talked to her. i do love her and it is her dicision what to do with her body, so at the beginning i just wanted to keep it by myself, because i fear the end of the relationship. but im an idiot and she noticed that im not okay. i told her that i dont like it, but i want to accept it as a part of her. it was horribly. at the end the relationship is kinda fine but i need help or advices so that i can accept her tattoos. at least i dont think that she will get more tattoos, but anyways the tattoo is on her shoulder. i dont know if the tattoo still bothers me in like 2 months but i think so because of the sice. We both want to keep our relationship, but i fear, that my hatred for tattoos will kill it.
So in my 2 sleepless nights i had a lot of time thinking about what to do and the best solution i could think of is, getting my own tattoo. i hope ,if i get at tattoo for myseld, it will be easier for me to accept hers aswell. so i just want to ask 2 more thinks. what would you do in my situation? and to the usesers with good drawing skills: could you try to creat a dragon drawing in a trash pola or/and sketch style without colours and send me these pictures?

* I put a listing on a lgbt friendly facebook group to find an apartment. No responses, which is unusual for the group.
* I also responded to tons of housing offers. Despite being first to respond, I'm ignored and the other responses aren't.
* I am constantly ghosted in dating (online or otherwise). Almost 30 encounters ended in ghosting.
* No one asks me to hang out at work. I make the initiative, they are always busy.

I'm constantly being told that I'm a nice person, but I feel like that's a cover. It can't be just coincidence. Part of me wants to go to /r/roastme to get a clue, but my self-esteem couldn't take the hit.

141,"(This is kind of a long post, so I included a TL;DR at the end, and bolded topic sentences.)

**I *need* your help Reddit.** I'm facing a big decision concerning which path to take in my life, and I don't have a lot of time, and I have no idea what to do.

I'm currently studying 3D modeling for film. I love my studies, and I'm passionate about the subject deeply. I could stay up all night working on an assignment and at the end feel like ""OK, playtime's over, I should get started on the real work."" I've been doing 3D modeling (as a hobby) for the latter half of my life (I'm 18, still young), and I've never gotten tired of it - just more invested in it. **I feel like I'd be happy doing this forever.**

Until the start of last year, I had been studying to eventually transfer to a university like UCI, UCLA, that sort of place. I went to college at a very young age (I was accepted to CSUN at age 10), I have A's in all my community college math courses and coding courses, and my SATs are high. **My plan was originally to transfer and major in some field of Computer Science.**

I wasn't quite as passionate about that however, so last year I switched my focus and started taking art courses. I developed my skillset, and found out about a specialized digital art school called **Gnomon.** I love the atmosphere, the people, the courses... it's my dream. I spoke with the counselor, and I'm a shoe-in for their three-year program. **I have three weeks to make one last model and submit my application; then, I'm pretty much in.**

My family has saved up enough to cover a little over a third of the total tuition cost. Art school is expensive - for my family at least, and while my 3D modeling is good, I can't draw for strawpennies, so I likely won't be able to get a scholarship or get into Gnomon's cheaper faster program. **I'd accumulate enough student debt to last over ten years, and I'd burn through my only inheritance immediately.**

My mother is insisting that I not apply to Gnomon, and wait until next year to apply to Stanford instead. She's an alumni of that university herself, and if I get in (which she thinks I can), I could apply for a full-ride scholarship, live in the dorms, and use my inheritance money to start my career instead of fund my education. **Financially speaking, Stanford is certainly a better option.**

**I'm not sure if I can get in though.** While my mother is an alumni, I was homeschooled (homeschooled straight to college), so I don't have a record of any clubs, volunteering, or activities. Although I aced a lot of advanced courses at a young age, that would mean I'd have to apply as a transfer student, for which the Stanford admissions rate is under 2%. Also, for those saying to just apply to Stanford and study my passion, Stanford does not offer specialized majors in my favored field (the closest would be joint majoring in Art Practice+CS, which is more along the lines of social digital art than film CGI).

The Stanford application is March of next year, meaning I would have until then to retake any courses I didn't get an A in, learn a language (I'm not bilingual, though I'm a high level beginner at French), get volunteer experience, etc. **I would need to cancel my Gnomon application, even though the staff there all really want me to attend.**

As for employment, 3D modelers tend to bounce around due to the instability of the entertainment job market, from what I've heard. I'm not after a fortune, or even comfort - but I highly value financial stability, given the lack of such I had growing up. On the other hand, I know the CS job market is highly saturated - even for Stanford graduates.

**TL;DR:** So that's that. I can either apply to Gnomon, get in, spend all my money, and gain debt doing something I love, or I can cancel and wait a year, apply to Stanford, ***maybe*** get in (it's a very questionable maybe), and try to get and be happy with a job in the saturated Computer Science field.

It's the 'ol passion vs. reason conundrum I guess.

143,"Alright, so I'm in a bit of a predicament.  My prom is in two weeks, I'm a junior at an all-boys high school.  I asked this girl a week and a half ago if she would go with me.  

This is a girl I've liked for a while but have been friends with for a while, and this past fall, there was a time when things got a bit awkward between us, I told my mom that we weren't talking as much before and she assumed that we're just not friends anymore or something(even though we still are).  I took this girl to a concert earlier in the year and we have been to some school dances before together(she goes to an all girls school).  

I had been talking to my mom before debating whether I should go to prom or not because its kinda expensive af, etc, and she was saying I should, but said she doesn't think I should ask the girl I ended up asking.  For that reason, I didn't actually tell my parents I was asking her...

Fast forward to yesterday.  My parents were saying that there's this other girl, who I BARELY KNOW(yet they claim I've talked to her a bunch before, I have absolutely zero recollection of doing so.  like actually the extent of me knowing her is following her on instagram and knowing her name.  that's literally it) and I should take her.  I've been insisting for the past 12 hours that I really don't want to because it'll be super awkward.  I was *going* to tell them I already asked this other girl, but right about then, my mom started talking about how I'm too ""hung up on her(the other girl)"" and how she only ""uses me, like when I have a concert ticket or something,"" so I decided that probably wasn't the *best* time to tell her I maybe sorta already was going with her.  

So now I have two problems.  One, my mom is kinda pissed at me and is upset because she thinks every time she tries to do something for me, I just say she's ""not doing anything right.""  Two, what the fuck am I suppose to do about the actual date situation.  I've figured out I basically have 3 options.  1) Tell my parents I already am going with the girl they apparently hate now or something, 2) Tell the girl I asked that something came up or that I'm grounded or something and can't go, or 3) Tell the girl I asked what the situation is and see what the hell she thinks we should do.  The problem with solution 2 is that my parents really want me to go, and if by some chance either a picture gets posted on instagram or wherever and she sees that I was there, I look like a huge asshole and I really don't want to do that.  Also, I just really *don't want to go* with this other girl I don't even know.    ",15Apr2017,2

154,"**EDIT**: [Here is the elevator form I was sent](http://imgur.com/a/qLpvE)

So I moved into a new place, a condo I am renting from the owner. During the administrative process, I was charged $100 for a move-in fee. This was supposed to include an elevator reservation, so that I can move in without having to block elevators from the other residents.

I asked 3-4 days before the move, and the owner confirmed he had set up the elevator. Also sent me a form to review about the fee, and how the elevator would be set up. I show up, and nothing had been done. Long story short, it added a fair bit more difficulty to the move and added about 45 minutes more that I had to pay the movers.

The owner now claims that the fee was administrative only, and that the elevator wasn't part of it. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, and am thinking it's some kind of misunderstanding.

I'm 18 years old and I graduated from college in 2016 with a major in Finance. I come from an overachieving Asian-American household with parents who were absent for most of my school life up until my last few months in college. During my time in college, I never had a job and I was stupid. Now that I've graduated, I have been completely lost. In the first month, I was convinced I would go to graduate school for my masters in Finance. I took the GRE (164 verbal, 165 quant, 4 writing) and I thought I had things somewhat sorted out.
But I quickly became deterred from applying to grad school when I realized two things: 1. my empty, experience-less resume with an incredibly underwhelming GPA of 2.6 2. that I had only even considered graduate school because i thought it was my only option and I did not know (and still dont know) anything about adult life and having a career.
My friends and family are very generous with their advice and most of them suggest trying to find a job. For the past 10 months since my graduation, I have been unemployed and not in school. I have taken up volunteering positions at a Down Syndrome home as well as a volunteer tutoring 'job' at an orphanage. I haven't completed any applications to any of my graduate schools because of my insecurity and fear of being rejected. On top of that, I have lied to my parents about completing those applications.
I am very stupid and don't know much about being a grown up. I don't really have any parental figures in my life right now, so I'm hoping a smarter stranger will be able to offer some insight.

A prospective employer flew me across the country to interview with a bunch of folks for a job last week. They said yesterday it went well and they asked if I'm still interested and for other specifics from me about timing a move down there etc. and I'm thinking they might be getting close to making an offer (I hope!).

The problem is that I haven't yet disclosed an old DWI I got in college ~9 years ago (beginning of 2008), and want to bring it up before getting to a potential offer (again just hoping here).

The process has moved pretty quickly and I never had to fill out a formal job application where I've normally disclosed the DWI to employers in the past and haven't brought it up.

I have a final conversation on Monday with another team member and was thinking about emailing the hiring manager tomorrow to ask for 5 minutes on the phone with her to disclose the old DWI and give an opportunity for her to ask questions, but wanted to get some impartial input before doing that.

Honestly I'm still pretty embarrassed about what was a stupid college mistake -- but I feel strongly that it's necessary to disclose before talking offers.

Both my sisters have boyfriends, all my friends are in relationships, and the men that I do happen to connect with tend to run away once they find out I'm not going to have sex with them unless I'm in a relationship with them.. it seems all anyone ever wants from me is sex, and I know it's ridiculous because I am only 19, but it makes me feel as if I'm going to be single forever ....

167,"I'm 22, living in the northwest US, and trying to figure out how to approach my goals in a long-term way. Right now, I'm working for a distributor that is part of a larger corporate network and they also offer tuition reimbursement, as long as it pertains to what I am doing within the company as something that will help develop my skillset further.

Because I work in the purchasing and import logistics area, I feel like my degree has to be centered around business in some way. The only way that I can see that in a positive way is thinking about an Economics degree, because I love learning about the supply chain and each step from beginning to end, and how each process affects one another. 

Truthfully, my heart is not in business and I'm not the biggest fan of capitalism. If it were up to me, I'd run a business doing what I love, but within myself I know that I'd never want to charge anyone for helping them out in some fashion. I am a HUGE animal lover and I connect so deeply with all animals in addition to leaning more towards the creative side of life, than the scientific. Not to say I don't love science, but I'm just not cut out for all of the precursory knowledge that you have to develop to make it successfully in a specialized field. I'm very heavily visually and kinesthetically oriented, and have also always had an enormous passion for architectural design, construction, and interior planning. 

My question is: does anyone know of a way that I could combine these aspects that I enjoy in life in a way to maximize my potential in life? I want to be successful within society, but I also want to live to fulfill myself, which seems to be a balance I can't figure out.

177,"He and I are both 17. 
At first, his parents seemed nice - welcoming, even. They soon called me part of the family and said I was always welcome. 

However, things went downhill fast when things didn't go their way. 

It started when my boyfriend admit to them he had problems with anxiety and frequent panic attacks that only i'd seen/knew of. They sent him to a doctor (who suggested they'd get a psychologist immediately, which 4 months later they still havent done.)
They started making up why he felt that way- be it due to me, my parents, school etc. 
I soon learned they are extremely strict and his dad is a bossy cunt. Monitoring his bank account 24/7, demanding he spends time with them whenever it suits them, putting our time together in a retarded 2/2/2/1 schedule (he gets to go to my place 2 days, i spend 2 days at his, and then we have ""2 days alone and one day to spend together online"", the day online being a bullshit excuse.) and getting angry with him and punishing him when he steps out of line, which is like playing russian roulette. When he does step out of line, they sit him down and put words in his mouth as to why hes like that without listening, or in worst case scenario: his dad pulls him in his bedroom, locks the door and interrogates him even while he's sobbing. 

After he got to know my family and our laid-back easygoing lifestyle, he started to despise his family more and more, and the more he got to express his opinions without being interrogated about them, he got a little more independent and self-thinking. Which pisses his parents off. 

They've started to despise me because I ONCE spoke my opinion towards their behavior, politely and nonthreateningly. I simply asked when he got to visit me again (seeing as they make shitty excuses as to why he cant see me). They said ""it's because he needs to spend time with his brother"" to which I (stupidly) commented ""Isn't it his decision where he spends his free time and not his parents?"" 
This obviously didnt sit well with them. 

Since, they've made more excuses and i barely get to see him anymore unless his dad is out of their home. Their excuse is always ""he needs to spend time with his family"" and they've started treating him worse because ""he doesn't care enough about his family,"" which started when he told them he likes being with my family more because they don't fucking oppress him. 
I don't know what to do- our relationship isn't suffering, but it is miserable going days without seeing him and not knowing if he's okay or crying in his room after being interrogated behind locked doors after stating his opinion against them.

181,"in 2012 my father left me to go back to his home country of Brazil because he  needed to help his own father due to a operation, he stayed longer than he had promised and when he came back he appeared somewhat different, it was only a few weeks until my mother called the police to have him removed from the house. My parents were always in a extremely rocky relationship, they were almost constantly arguing, there was never any violence but never any real affection between them either. I did not learn about the reason why he removed until I overheard my mother on the phone talking about how she discovered that he had been communicating with other women in Brazil. The exact reasons for my father's removal from the household have been quite blurry to me, was from what I could process was that my parents had an argument that, according to my mother, was because she was trying to convince him to go back to work, (My father had been unemployed for many years) and stop talking with the other women he had previously been contacting, he refused and apparently became agitated, fearing the possibility of violence she called the police and he was removed.
Ever since it has been a constant string of ""convince him to pay child support"" as if I was merely a conduit between my parents. My view of my father has completely changed, I see him as a lazy slob, but my feeling for him as my father are in constant painful conflict, he complains that he suffers from a ""genetic"" or ""inherited"" depression, whilst my mother claims that he has a childlike mentality, making up such claims as an excuse for his laziness, my mother has, and still is the breadwinner of the household. 

I just feel like there's nothing I can emulate from him, even though my stepfather has been kind and helpful, I just cannot feel any genuine connection, I feel like something is severely lacking within me and the only genuine source, that being my father, is completely and utterly devoid of any honorable manhood that I can be inspired by. it has just been a constant barrage of opinions from my mother's side, and my father's, each contradicting each other. I feel empty, weak, and filthy, I try to look for my father, but when I see this person, there is absolutely nothing I can feel within him, I feel like I've been lied to my entire life by him, or maybe my mother has been lying, please, I just want some help, thank you.

The thing is that I'm really cold, I don't know how to deal with emotions or express them the right way. I also suffer from anxiety which makes me super uncomfortable when I think of telling her something so romantic.
I understand where she's coming from, but it's also unfair that she judged it all and forgot every beautifully warm memory just for the sake of those false claims she has in her head. I tried to change them, she believes me and it all gets cool, then after a day or two, the nasty thoughts pop in her mind once again. This tired me. To give someone your full dedication and time and heart, yet they tell you you gave them nothing. She made me feel vulnerable, and worthless, as if everything I had for her and has done for her was never enough. And I now fear getting in a relationship.

187,"So I have this sister that is diagnosed with autism but undiagnosed with schizophrenia and OCD. Both seem to have appeared around 3 or 4 years ago (and they may just be the same condition), but it took my mother a while to finally accept her conditions and move on.

So we tried taking her to an income-based clinic that offered her a session with a psychologist for $35. We went in, my sister ranted about gangstalking and the lizards, and the professional thought we just wanted ritalin for her (this clinic is often used for ADHD prescriptions). That's not we want.

I want my sister to be properly evaluated by a psychologist(or maybe a psychiatrist) and to begin the process of diagnosis. That means building a psychological profile, having a variety of tests, and what other means necessary to finally reach a point of proper anti-psychotic prescription and psychological treatment.

What do I ask for this? Where do I go to? How can we get this done? My mother literally cannot study with my sister having these breakdowns and I fear a lot for my sister's well being and happiness. A big issue is that we just don't have the money, my mother has no job, I'm studying for graduate school, and the little money we do get is from our deceased father's social security. My sister, being 20 now, needs help, but we can't figure out the low-cost or free services to go to for said help.
What do we do?

EDIT: While the government in rural Virginia doesn't provide much info concerning help, at least the local police department knows how to deal with my sister. Every minute of every day she has the phone in her hand, repeatedly dialing 911 and then cancelling out the number selection, and will threaten, several times a day, to call the police if I do something as simple as knock on her door. She calls them on a semi-regular basis and vents on them (i.e. saying I'm an abuser and that I hit her and other bizarre claims such as that the birds are colluding against her) but they never institutionalize her or take anyone away. They seem to understand her situation by this point.

But my big fear is that one day the emergency response may be more extreme. Maybe she freaks out in a violent fashion or maybe a situation escalates into something that the police should not ignore. We'd prefer not to have her dragged away into a group home before we can at least try to have her psychologically with my mother maintaining custody.",15Apr2017,1
188,"*before I start I want to make clear that I'm not a pretentious person, neither do I seek appraisal, or recognition*

Ok so I'm 17, and I've no clue regarding what to do with my life.
The thing is, I feel I have potential. By potential I mean that I'm under the impression that whatever I set my mind to, I can achieve.
I've always been ""diagnosed"" as a smart child, then smart teen and later ""wise"" person. I love to talk philosophy and regularly talk about my own theories and impress people by how original and helpful they are. I also write poetry and bits of stories that people find gripping and on a par with good and known writers. I also have a big sense of humour and love to do stand-up monologues in my head while waiting for a bus or at the dentist. I play the drums and guitar and have created pretty cool riffs and beats which remind me of good 60s-70s songs. I'm a pretty good student and I may go to a top uni if nothing goes wrong. I feel I can be good at anything except maths and science which I was always mediocre at...I've started writing scripts, took photographs, went to a model United Nations, worked in a student newspaper etc...at all these things I've excelled, without much work.


Everything I've tried people have said I had potential and that it was extremely good for a beginner...but there's a flip side

I've always been praised (which I don't really like tbh or I at least I don't really seek that) but never really accomplished anything truly worthwhile. I've done and tried all sorts of things, excelled at most (as a beginner of course) but never did anything in depth. I've no idea what to study, or become. It's not about me trying to find a way to have money, or fame - sometimes I feel as though there's so much I want to express and give but I don't know where and how to start. I feel stuck. It's an oppressing feeling, I would like to have a calling, something where I can develop my craft and thrive and be happy.

Do you have any recommendations for me, thank you :)

190,"I'm worried that I for the past few weeks have been a bit of a prick.

I'm very lonely at this point. I don't have many friends to hang out with as they're either unavailable or don't really feel like going out.

Because of this, I've been talking to a few female friends on Facebook. Not extremely close, but definitely friends. I haven't been explicit and inappopriate in that way, but I've wanted to date (I even did the dreaded jokingly ask a girl out again despite being rejected once. We've hung out and are still friends, but I haven't been careful and I regret doing it. I apologised and we're fine, but I'm afraid I'll lose her as a friend).

I'm a 21 year old virgin, so I think I've just wanted to lose my virginity, but that's not even really it. I don't want a one night stand, I want to be in a normal relationship like everyone else.

I've been feeling anxious pretty much the whole day for the past few days, because I'm worried that I've been an asshole to some friends. I'm also worried that I'll come off as desperate and lose friends that way, because I've been wanting to talk to them a lot about girls I've had feelings for. I don't want to seem creepy, and I don't think I am. I am just in a state of mind where I try to not flirt with them, but still really want to.

I don't know if this is just venting, I apologize, but I'm trying to figure out what it is I need help with.

I've been feeling anxious when talking to some girls because I'm worried I've been an asshole. If I have, I try to figure out how and then not do that anymore. I realise what is and isn't wrong, and I try my best not to do something stupid.

I used to go on dating sites, but I don't want to do that anymore. I was sometimes rude to girls and regretted it deeply afterwards. Eventually, I didn't want to be there because I didn't feel I was mature enough to handle it.

So I'm aware of what I'm doing wrong, but I'm so anxious and worried that this will always be a part of me, even if it didn't start a long time ago at all.

Only last year I was extremely normal. I had a crush on a close friend, she rejected me and I became depressed for an extremely long time. I'm wondering if that has made me care less about who I'm approaching. I've always apologised afterwards and have felt really bad, but I've also always been worried that they'll remember what I did and somehow make that affect me later.

I don't want to approach anyone, which is why I don't really want to use Tinder. At the same time, maybe what I'm doing isn't awful and my anxiety just makes me feel like I've been acting worse than I have... I can use Tinder as a way to learn how to talk to girls, but I really am worried that I'll creep them out. I don't want to be that way, and I don't want other people to see me as a weird guy. I don't want to lose friends because I'm acting like a dumbass, and I think my acting is causing a vicious circle with my anxiety.

What do I do to stop feeling anxious over things?

In any other circumstance I feel just fine, and I'm as much of a feminist as is probably possible. I don't know why I'm acting this way, I just really want and need it to stop. I hope that realising I have a problem can make it go away, I'm worried that people won't forgive and forget. Obviously they don't have to, but I know I can change.

Edit:

**TL;DR: I'm lonely. I have friends, but no one that I can hang out with. This makes me want to talk to girls, and I might end up saying something to them that I regret (or just talk to them too much). These actions make me anxious because they're so far from who I am and/or want to be as a person, which makes me talk to friends. Now, I usually talk to friends about girls, that's literally the only topic I can think about. I feel like this annoys them, so I'm worried that they'll be annoyed and not want to talk to me. How do I get over this anxiety?**",15Apr2017,1

And my bf isn't too great at offering support and that's never truly bothered me I just thought it's who he was

The first several times it happened, I got up and walked to where my iPod dock is in my house to check that it wasn't left on. I only realised then that the music had no source, and in that second, the music stopped. I turned around to go back to bed again, and the music started again. I think I was about 16 at this time.



My mum died about 4 months ago, and she was sick in hospital for a month before that. I stayed with her every day to take care for her, and slept on the floor next to her at night. Around that time, I started to hear the music at times other than when I was in bed. I heard one particular song when I was in hospital with her, which I later heard also when I was with my friend a couple of months ago. I started to hear it in the gym a few days ago, as a guy was playing his music aloud, but as I went closer to him, I realised he was listening to a rap song, and not my one - but still the music carried on and got louder.




When I got into the car with the person I went to the gym with, the song came on in their car on the CD. I had no idea they even knew it and it is an uncommon song. I looked up the artist and it turns out he was born in the same small town as me, with less than 10,000 people, and the odds are just so incredibly low it feels terrifying - I'm sure this is some way for my mum to try and communicate with me and I'm just not sure how, I've tried looking in the lyrics to understand more deeply but I can't - I get panicky when I put on the song now and hear it every single night when I'm in bed, I'm hearing it now

206,"Im a bit confused about this.

See, I was under the impression that friends invite EACH OTHER to do stuff. Not a just one way thing where only one guy does the inviting.

I constantly find that people seem surprised when I expect to get invited though, especially when I'm the one doing the inviting nearly all the time. Like, if I have been hanging out with this group for a couple of months, and they seem happy whenever I invite them to do stuff, they never seem to keep me in mind for anything. On the occasions when someone else organizes something, nobody seems to say ""Hey, let's invite Anon20055 too!"" or let me know about it. Then when I ask about it, everyone just goes ""Oh you should have asked us to go"" (how? You guys didnt even tell me?) or ""Talk to the organizer, not me.""

When I try to ask directly if they could invite me next time, the most common reaction I get is surprise. Here's an example :

Him : You can't expect to get invited dude, you have to ask.

Me : Uh...but I invite you guys to do stuff all the time? And nobody told me before hand so I couldn't ask...

Him : So, we have to return the favor? *He just stares dumbfounded at me at this point, like it's some alien concept*

Am I in the twilight zone or something? I mean, I'm always keeping my friends in mind for stuff, if I know that a friend of mine is looking to get a new laptop for example, I will let him know if I happen to see any good deals. Or, if I know that a friend wants to watch a particular movie and the same goes for me, I will ask him to go with me. This is perfectly normal, right?

But when I expect the same from others, most people seem to react like I'm asking for a huge favor or something, even though I have helped them out tons in the past.

It especially irks me when I make plans to watch a movie with some people, and then on the day itself they go ""Oh yea, we actually decided to watch it the day before, sorry man"". And i'm thinking ""Uh, hello? Some advance notice would have been nice?"".",15Apr2017,2
207,"My dad (60) has been a negative Nancy for as long as I remember. Nothing anyone does for him ever seems up to his standards, he's a know-it-all type, and it seems like his number one joy in life is to complain. Half of his side of the family can barely stand him. It feels like he still regards me as child for him to bitch and moan at (maybe because he never really had to actually raise me like my mom has for the past 18 years). Well you get the point. I just feel like being around him drains the happiness out of me... I know it could be worse, and I am grateful that he has supported me financially all these years. But I'm tired of his attitude towards life and the fact that he thinks he can take out all his bottled up anger on me. How do I proceed with this? I just want him to ACTUALLY change, but it seems like me just expressing my feelings to him has never worked, since he never sees himself in the wrong and never feels the need to apologize...

209,"**more like ways that can help me down this path**

I'm a college freshman right now and I really have to find out what I want to be, what I want to major. I see job type listings on websites but I don't know if I'd really like that job because I need hands on experience. The pressure/deadline to choose my intended job is soon so I can't take different college classes and see which I like best. 

Volunteer work usually is the lowest level of the job (obviously a hospital won't let a volunteer take part in some surgery without any medical experience but would just give me paperwork or something) so I wouldn't know how the job is like &amp; whether it fits me. Online quizzes on what job is best for you don't help bc they're not the jobs that fit my personality/style. 

For me, I prefer a creative job (maybe artistic?) that allows me to go around the world every now and then. But I don't want it to be completely artistic (I was in a performing arts school, and making art 6 hours a day felt like I wasn't doing anything with my brain). I'd like to have some mentally challenging opportunities (problem solving type. Maybe sciencey? I don't like math). Overall, I don't want a behind the desk job all the time. I don't mind sitting/data input, but just not all the time. I don't have good leadership skills so teaching is out of the question, but I like moderate communication with people. ",15Apr2017,2
210,"Hey guys !

I've never posted here before but something's happened recently and I need some advice (haha, probably guessed already since I'm posting this in this subreddit). 

So, my best friend has recently crossed a line, I think. 

Recently, a few of my friends and the person I am dating were chilling out. We were talking about some meaningless and funny stuff probably, but the topic evolved to these two people we used to know last year. (We're all in high school which probably wouldn't be relevant except for what they said relates to this)

These two were dating, one was a senior and the other was a sophomore. For the record, I am a sophomore, and the person I'm dating is a senior (I'm 16 and they are 17).

So one of my friends (who I had considered my best friend for a while but I'm now questioning whether I should be friends with them or not) says (paraphrased except the last two sentences because it was uhh pretty fucked up in my opinion):
""Seniors who date freshman or sophomores are stupid/creepy. What's the point? It's not like they're ever going to see each other again anyway.""

So, yeah, I get that it's their opinion. The thing is that they have a boyfriend ??? In another state ? And I feel like they don't have any room to talk about this. 

Also, they worded it so unnecessarily cruelly and made the person I'm dating actually start crying, and I was on the verge of tears.

Also, why would they even say that at all, knowing that we were dating ?? It just seemed like a stab at us for no reason. 

Maybe if this was the first time, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. But they always pull stuff like this. They casually insult me about things they know I'm insecure about (I'm gay and they keep calling me gay as a nickname even though I've told them four times to stop because it makes me anxious that they keep outing me and making my sexuality a scene. They outed me publically on instagram also and tagged a bunch of people from our school. I was only passively mentioned in the post so they probably assumed it was okay but they still did it. They also assume that it's okay because they're ""gay"" but they are actually bisexual and dating someone of the opposite sex right now so while they aren't straight, it looks really, really homophobic too). They've talked about me behind my back for a long time, as I was informed yesterday, which I'm pissed about. 

Anyways, I was rightfully angry at them for saying something so cruel. I told them I was angry and what they said wasn't okay. I ignored them for the rest of the day, after telling them that they needed to give me a little time for me to be angry before I could forgive them. I reassured them many, many times that I just needed to cool off. 

but then they started to guilt trip me. They talked about how ""awful"" they were and sent me very cryptic messages implying that they would kill or cut themself. They talked about how they ""couldn't control what they said and they didn't think about it"" but then also said ""I thought about all possible reactions you guys would have before I said it and this wasn't one of them"". They contradicted themself a few times and straight up lied once or twice. I knew they were depressed before I got upset at them (we've been friends for four years and they told me they were depressed about a year ago)

Then they made a public post on instagram, where they have more than 1000 followers, saying how they felt theyd been ""torn apart"" and how they threatened to kill themself with this being ""the last straw"". This made me feel sick, and their guilt tripping worked. I messaged them back and they made an apology but I did not feel it was sincere. They said stuff like ""I just had absolutely no idea you guys would be upset"" which really struck me the wrong way ?

They did something wrong and I feel that they won't own up to it, and they are blaming us by being offended by their insults. 

To counter myself:

Objectively, what they said is not that bad. They may have said it in a callous way but I do not know/think that it was target towards us. On it's own, I don't think it was that big of a deal. I was angry at them for hurting us, and I think I was rightfully angry but I think that all they see is what happened in there, and not what happened before or afterward. 

My question: Am I a bad friend for ignoring them when I knew they were depressed ? 

Thanks for any answers ! ",15Apr2017,2

 I need to confront her about this but am not really sure how to do so. Any ideas or any details I need to provide?

218,"I graduated with a computer science degree last year and have had no luck landing a relevant job. Part of me thinks it's because I live out in the middle of nowhere so why would they hire me and wait for me to relocate when they could hire someone local.

The job hunt is really getting to me and I just want it to be over, I've been plagued by anxiety and depression the whole time. My family constantly bring it up like it's my fault I don't have a job yet and I hate it. 

The last couple days I've been considering finding a roommate online, moving in and getting a local retail job. That should be possible right? I have money saved up for a deposit and the first couple months, and I've heard retail jobs are easy to get no matter what. Once I'm settled in and less stressed I could start looking for relevant jobs again, but this time from the same city.

I swore the day I graduated I'd never deal with roommates again, but I guess I'm going back on that. Is this a good idea? Keeping in mind there are literally no jobs in the local area.",15Apr2017,3
219,"My situation is complicated. Out of the blue, my boyfriend cried and told me one day that he lost feelings and he does not know why. I talked to him and was able to make him realize that we don't have any problems, and I will love him through the tough time he's going through- because I believe him ""losing feelings"" is depression. Later that week, I found out that a girl that likes him was excessively snapchatting him, and asked him for a ride to school when usually her sister gives her one. My boyfriend claimed to do it just to be nice, but when I asked him to stop communicating with her and leave her alone, he wouldn't. This girl is known to talk to boys that already have relationships, and openly likes my boyfriend. My boyfriend is a bit naive, and likes to see the good in everyone, so he of course believes that they're just friends. The part where im confused is, he has lied to me when I ask questions about her, and when I confronted him, he said he doesn't know why he is lying. They are not romantic and they just casually talk, but I dont know whether or not to believe that he likes her? A few days before prom, we broke up because of her and him not feeling anything, but we still remain friends and I hope we get back together soon. I love him dearly but should I be worried about this girl? I have felt so insecure and jealous due to him lying and talking to her when he says he has lost feelings for me. I just want to know what to do incase he tries to get back together, which seems likely. We have had no problems up until now, and he usually does not lie, and I would hope he would never cheat on me. Please help?",15Apr2017,3

So I got into Harvard for grad school and I'll be starting in the fall (august 30th). After I'm done with grad school (a one year program), I want to work in the entertainment industry out in LA.  

I'm currently in DC and I was thinking about moving out to LA,  getting a Layout out of the land,  confirming if it's where I want to be before starting grad school. ..honestly if I land across a life changing opportunity,  I would not attend grad school. The program is pretty cool for media. ... you produce own show as a thesis, etc but a job is better than that lol. 

Anyway,  I would leave job in DC,  move out to LA at end of may and then be back on the east coast in august. Is this smart?  And yea I'll be making an income out in LA

All my life I've had overweight, but i took the determination to change that and i want to lose as much weight as possible. Right now my weight is about 127.5kg (about 221.2 pounds), my height is about 1.82m (about 6 feet). I decided this about 15 days ago and i'm determined to do it. I started a diet, that i designed by myself, since my scholarship allowance is not that much, i can't afford a really expensive diet right now, but i think it has helped a little bit since i started, i'm doing this:

Everyday, around 30mins of Cardio and walking everywhere, walking as much as i can (It's, for now, all that my body allows me to do, but I've been pushing myself, more and more)

Breakfast, 2 loaf of bread with a slice of cheese, a slice of ham and peanut butter.

after 2 hours, i eat a fruit (mostly bananas, they're the cheapest)

Lunch, generally is rice, eggs and vegetables

after 2 hours, i eat another fruit

after 2 hours, i eat a a protein bar

and i'm not getting dinner or just some soda cookies if i feel too hungry.

Am i doing good? What do you guys recommend?

Thanks a lot in advance, for each advice you can give me!",15Apr2017,3
227,"Recently my mother came to me and told me about my father's relationship with her. They're divorced now, and all of the things that my mother told me are directly related to emotional abuse and mental terrorism. I need to know if what she's saying is true, because if it is, I need to seriously reevaluate my relationship with my father. The problem is that both of them speak in these fucking riddles, I don't know if what either of them are saying it's true half the time because they always have different stories, any second opinion they bring in is biased to their story, there's no neutral pair of eyes that can tell me if what the fuck I'm hearing is true, ever, and, judging by my language, it's just pissing me off. I'm just so fucking tired of being lied to. Hell, for all I know, my mother isn't even lying.

229,"dear reddit, 
 i need some help providing the proper support to a friend who recently told me about their heroin addiction. i am very close with this person and have known them for years. they have kept the addiction a secret for at least 9 months. they only recently told me about it. 
when we last spoke, the conversation started out with a serious tone. but upon my asking questions, and vehemently explaining that i will not normalize this or say that it is ok, this person recoiled and shirked away from providing me with much detail about the abuse. after some pressure they finally told me that they have been using pretty frequently, which i assume means at least once a day. 
this person is far away from me, and i cannot know what is going on in their life aside from what they tell me. i know that they are using with friends, and obviously these ""friends"" don't care about their wellbeing or safety. 
i want to be a good friend. i want to show this person that i care about them, that i love them, and that i cherish their life. i am willing to do whatever it takes to get the help they need. i have already tried reaching out to one of their family members. i am waiting on a response. 
i don't know what else to do. is this the right decision? is getting others involved the right thing to do?
how can i break the news to their family member? who else should i tell? 
if you have any experience breaking this kind of news to the family members of someone you care about, please share your experiences with me. i have already accepted that my friend may be very very angry with me once they find out that i'm reaching out to others. i have already accepted that i may sacrifice this friendship in order to do whatever i can to help this person.
i know that, ultimately, it is on them to make the decision to get help. they told me that they don't think they need to get into a rehabilitation program, but i definitely think they do. speaking with other heroin addicts has confirmed in my mind that the only way for them to kick this habit is to get some kind of professional help.
every day that passes by i grow more and more concerned. i cannot sit back and watch this happen to someone i love without taking every possible step that i think i can... 

ultimately, i am asking for support and guidance through this process. if you're someone who has struggled with addiction, would you want your friends to intervene? what would you have wanted them to do? what would you have needed to hear?
i appreciate all of the help.
thank you.",15Apr2017,2
