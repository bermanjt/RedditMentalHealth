here is everything that ive tried telling them: 

they signed up for me and i didnt sign up for them. im not their property that they can do what they want with

love = acceptance. you need to love your kid for who they are. not the person you are trying to force them to be

discriminating by the way someone looks is oppression. why dont you go to the middle east where people are oppressed for not looking a certain way?

He was very loud and aggressive the entire time, at one point she asked if she cared about her and he said ""I want to fucking punch you right now"" and he kept drilling her with questions about the guy and didn't like her answers so he just called her a fucking liar and arguing with her nonstop. And now she just got off work and picked me up to go home and he is already drilling her with questions, looking over her shoulder to see  what she's doing on her phone (like getting right up behind her and starring  directly at her phone) and I went down stairs to see what was going on and he had her phone in his hand so she couldn't use it.

5,"Once upon a time, I lived abroad and thought I was on the track to become an academic and lead a life of the mind traveling the world. I also had a social circle I really liked.

Now, through a confluence of events, I had to move home. For two years I’ve done nothing but work in the dullest industry on the planet. I find everyone I meet to either be completely worthless, or extremely arrogant.

I can’t get along with anyone and all I have to show for myself is an online dating career wherein my only reward is to meet people sadder and more damaged than myself.

It seems to me that life among “adult” “American” “professionals” revolves primarily around sitting in traffic and talking about your dogs and divorces while pretending to be smarter than you are and scheming to get more money from an office where your only real contribution is stroking the egos of the people above you in the corporate hierarchy. 

Where am I supposed to find happiness? Where am I to meet new friends or anything worth doing? 

Making money - supporting myself - it's meaningless. My expenses abroad were so minimal, I could support myself working one day a week and I had a life that was one million times better than my current life, because I could maximize the amount of time I spent hanging out or studying. 

I can't move back for secret personal reasons.

Anyway - what is the point to making money? You're just moving digital sand from one pile into another. IT is overpaid for some reason and I would say *usually* does not provide proportionate value to the organization. It's just like conning people out of money for a worthless widget.

I respect Reddit and I know it's irresponsible to treat this place as a livejournal for negativity. I'd just like to know - how do the rest of you deal with the fact that all you've got to live for is being an office drone who occasionally gets to pet his dog? It all seems so pointless to me.",18Mar2017,3
7,"Good evening.
I am (un)fortunately quite a fragile and sensitive person when it comes to matters like this, and I am currently experiencing frequent anxiety due to the situation. 

Our school is very known outside for its warm and including student body. This was also the case when we started. Now however, there has been a change. I suspect this is mainly due to the appearance of certain archetypes that were not represented as much before. Because most of our students are very nice and non-confronting, the few viscious and honestly mean students are thriving and becoming more popular due to their manipulative behavior (nobody is calling them out, and insecure teenagers don't want to be on their bad side etc.). My skill/sociability with people is not good enough for me to have any real impact on the student mentality either (have never been the type to chase popularity and maintain tons of close friends). For example, whenever there is an overly nervous classmate having a presentation I can see them sniggering, laughing, and generally disrespecting the one having a presentation. In addition they are always extremely negative whenever anything is brought up and judge everyone. The worst part is that they influence other students to do the same. 

Whenever I see this, I am faced with a big dilemma. On one hand, I want to remain calm and be the bigger person. The reason they are mean are probably because of some underlying complex they might have themselves. On the other hand however, I sometimes genuinely feel like raining a little unproportional lecturing on them. There is a right to free speech and all and I do not have any wish to seem like I am overreacting. The reason I do not socialise with a lot of my class, is because their gang and they all share the same habits (I never liked the type). An old friend of mine, one of the more modest guys, have lately become very cocky and I feel like he looks down on me whenever we hang out. He never listens to what I say anymore, only give any attention when he himself wants to say something, and then continues working while ignoring whatever reply I have (also been more irritable and dishing out hypocritical criticism). My only regret is having let these individuals foster both in my class and at school, not having called them out sooner. I have however been quite busy with school and other activities until this semester, so I did not notice nor did I have energy / time to handle the situation sooner. 

I am certain this might also all be an overreaction on my part and me being way too sensitive. However, I am feeling very anxious at home and at school due to this. I just don't know what to do about these feelings. I don't have anyone at class to talk properly to about this, which both sounds and is sad when I think about it. Should I tell a teacher? I recognise that most teenagers feel insecure and need to vent, but I don't feel like they are doing it the right way by creating an atmosphere of negativity. ",18Mar2017,3

10,"I made a new friend in December, let's call them X. X is a super chill and nice individual. We always would talk after school, we'd take walks together, and they used to even get sad at the idea of me graduating in a few months, since X is a grade under me and we'd see eachother less. I'd walk them to class and stay up late talking to them almost daily (I never had romantic feelings for them, I have a girlfriend), gave them relationship advice (which unfortunately didn't work out), as well as provided a shoulder to cry on.

Now, just a few months after we named eachother friends, literally out of nowhere they just stopped opening my messages completely, stopped waiting for me after class, etc., but they still talk to everyone else they know. They'll even view my Instagram or Snapchat stories sometimes without opening my messages on those apps. It's as if they had made a full 180 on me, or just got tired of talking to me. My attitude and stuff hasn't changed at all in these past months, and their life is going very well right now, no hiccups or reasons to stop communication with people, so I don't see what the problem is. I just feel like they take me for granted or even find me annoying. After all I've done for them, I don't see where this came from. I'm afraid to ask them if they really want to be my friend anymore to be perfectly honest. (Not that they'd even open my message anyway haha lol xd fuck)

I know I shouldn't be this worried, everyone loses friends, but X means so much to me and I just feel so torn.

17,"Hello,

I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. A bit of background - I am 25 years old, I work from home, and I have a wife and a six year old son, and right now I hate myself for what happened yesterday.  In normal day to day life I am not anxious or shy, but for as long as I can remember I have been extremely non-confrontational - any hint of conflict or trouble and I am overcome with anxiety. 

So basically what happened is that yesterday I took my son with me into town. We went into the market, which has rows and rows of market stalls and quite a narrow walkway in between, and it is always really busy and crowded, sometimes to the point where you can hardly walk from one end of it to the other. I stopped at a fruit stall while my son was looking at the adjacent stall that sold toys and trading cards etc. After buying the fruit, I turn round and I can't see my son. I walk down a little and then I spot him. Somewhat shielded from view of the crowd because he is in a corner, and is pinned to the back of the stalls by some sick fuck kissing him. My son looked visibly distressed while this guy - he looked like he was in his early 20s, maybe a little younger than me -  had his tongue in his mouth, and because he was standing in front of him my son couldn't move. I immediately walked over and put my hand on his shoulder and said ""Hey"", and the guy didn't even stop, he just put his arm out and lightly shoved my chest. 

What happened next makes me want to crawl into a hole and die. I heard ""sorry"" come out of my mouth. I apologized to the guy molesting my son in front of me. It was like an automatic response, and I am so ashamed of myself. This sick twsited fucker started to put his hands down my sons shorts and it's like I was frozen. My mind went completely blank, and I didn't do a fucking thing. Thankfully, a woman from an adjacent stall noticed what was happening, and she came over and started shouting at the guy in chinese and hitting him. The guy stopped and it's as if he came to his senses and realized where he was, and he just bolted into the crowd and disappeared. My son immediately burst into tears and started really sobbing, he was understandably terrified &amp; upset. I took him home and then went straight to the police station to report what happened. 

I just can't get over the fact that I didn't do ANYTHING. I fucking APOLOGIZED to the guy who was molesting my son in front of me. I am quite a big guy and was at least a foot taller than this guy who was scrawny and short. If it came to it, I imagine I could have taken this guy, but I just froze. My son is clearly shaken by the whole incident - he is normally a really happy, talkative kid but he has hardly spoken since it happened, and he won't leave his mothers side. 

Why am I such a fucking coward? Am I a terrible father? How can I change this?

21,"Alright guys. I'm hoping Reddit can help me out with this one, because I'm completely at the end of my rope. I work a typical office job, and my cube neighbor is driving me bonkers. Basic, I know, but she's driving me absolutely wild. She never stops making noise. (spoiler-tried noise cancelling headphones) Not your every day kind of noises. Every audible glug of water is followed by a loud, satisfied sigh. Every time she repositions in her chair or stands up, it's followed by a loud, long groan. 10+ times a day, she'll get annoyed, sigh loudly, and announce ""This is ridiculous!"". If no one responds by asking her what the problem is, she'll continue the sigh-and-exclaim routine, gradually increasing her volume until someone caves and gives her an opportunity to complain. Generally for 10+ minutes at a time, once she gets going.  (Hence 'click-baitey'. She also says things like ""oh, I just can't believe this!"". Designed to make you want to follow up.) 

Dear lord, dear sweet 6 pound 8 ounce baby jesus, the worst is the chewing. I've never heard anyone chew so loudly in my life. She eats celery every day. Slowly. With her mouth wide open. If it's not celery, it's gum. She always chews 5-10 pieces (the little square kind) at a time. She opens her jaw to the absolute fullest with every bite. Then she cracks it, then she sucks on it for a while, then she kind of mushes it around with her tongue. I have no idea how the noises she's making illustrate so clearly exactly what she's doing. All of this is audible from my cube, in a loud office, with noise-cancelling headphones and a brown noise app turned all the way up. I tried louder apps, but if I make them any louder I can't hear my phone ring or hear my manager stopping by to ask me a question. The coworker in question also has the tendency to come into my office and grab my by the shoulders if she comes by to chat and I don't respond.

Today was my breaking point. Today, she stopped by to complain. She chewed her massive wad of waxy, off-white gum, mouth opening wide with each bite, as she talked. The wet, slimy wad of gum slid out of her mouth and landed on her chin and stuck there. She grabbed a paper towel and peeled it off her face in front of me, and continued her tirade like nothing had happened.

When she isn't being obnoxious, she's honestly a very nice person who has gone out of her way in a lot of situations to help people she didn't have to. She's not bad, just annoying. She's also the type that is completely convinced she's right about everything, so a discussion w/ HR or a manager would be a declaration of war. I really don't want to go there unless I absolutely have to. She's my manager's cousin, and my manager has kind of a big mouth, so anything I said to her would get back to this coworker eventually. Moving cubes isn't an option- its done by seniority, or by team assignment. 

I've tried responding to her complaints passive aggressively. ""wow, *insert generic middle-aged white female office worker name here*, you sound SO UPSET right now!"". Acknowledging it just gives her an opening to start complaining.  I've tried screaming and knocking things off my desk because I was so 'startled' when she marched in unannounced and grabbed me. I've tried ""Hey, an awful lot of noise coming from over there, are you okay?"". Intro to complain. 

And seriously, how do you tell a woman old enough to be your mother to chew with her mouth closed? 

Its seriously effecting me. Her chewing is so nauseating I've lost 15 pounds in the last 3 months. I can't eat at work at all, and I can rarely get away from my desk long enough to eat somewhere else. I could potentially say something to her about the talking and the grabbing, but how on earth do you tell someone to stop chewing so loudly without offending them? Does reddit have any advice for me?",18Mar2017,32
22,"Tonight I walked past a homeless guy twice while coming in and out of a supermarket.

As I was walking in, he asked me for change, I ignored him, I had no loose change on my person and even if I was going to give him something, it would be something from the store, But I only had enough for what I wanted to get.

When I came out with my stuff, he asked again, I ignored him again.

He told me that I shouldn't ignore him.

Why?.

Things are working out pretty fine, but it all involves a lot of going out with them at night and drinking.

My department at work is toxic, and has only a little chance of advancement. Several years ago, I took on a ton more responsibilities after I was told a position would be opening up. When it opened, my manager gave the job to her friend from the outside. 

A few months back, I went on loan to another department. So far, I like it better, but it has trouble of its own. I was lead to believe that this was basically an audition for a high level promotion, so again, I took on a lot of extra responsibilities. 

I found out today that the position I will be offered is completely lateral in pay and rank, but my responsibilities will likely be what I've been doing the past several months. So basically, same pay for more work. 

Asking for advice here. The trade off that I'd be out of my toxic former Dept is great, but after being lead around again, just not sure I can keep up doing this extra work knowing this new Dept doesn't value it any more than to just offer me the same salary.

37,"tl;dr- broke up with girlfriend of year and a half due to distance, it kills me to have left and I'm freaking out and want her back

I'm a first year college student and my (now ex) girlfriend is a senior in high school. We've been (were) dating for about a year and four months but we were seriously talking for about two years. The first eight months or so we're pretty blissful between us, I couldn't get her off my mind if I tried and I would see her every opportunity I could. Unfortunately, I spent so much time on her that my friends started resenting me for it and attacked me for spending so much time on the phone with her or prioritizing her over them. Our relationship, however, was still happy but I was stressed about my friends (who were basically my family for eight years) cutting me off and so I guess I put all of my energy into making her feel good and helping her solve her problems.

 The summer before my first year in college I went on a month long trip to Europe and the distance was pretty rocky between us but I loved her and was willing to work for it and when we were reunited we were happier than ever. Now that I'm in college and finishing up my last semester, we've been in distance for a long time. I've flown to visit her on my November break but couldn't in January or spring because of family trips. She flew to see me twice, both times for the weekend for about three days. At most, the least we'd seen each other was 64 days apart.

 I work hard in school and what little free time I have I spend with my new friends, trying to build up a social life in my new college world. My girlfriend is still in her high school world and doesn't really understand what college is like, at least for me, and on some days where I couldn't pick up the phone because I had to write a paper or a project or even was hanging out with people, she would get upset because she missed me and it felt like I couldn't spend time on her and that she wasn't a priority anymore. I began to find that the calls I used to love receiving from her actually started annoying me because most of her calls were about people I no longer knew, people in high school, or her needing me to help her through a difficulty, regardless of the fact she was little help to me when I was stressed or worried about college or life. I stopped snap chatting her because any time she noticed I was in my room or not doing work she would call me and get mad if I didn't pick up because I needed personal time when I could get it. Even the breadth of our conversations in texts were about how much we loved each other or complimenting each other or the occasional little fight.

Anyways, a few days ago I talked to my dad and I found out that I was both going skiing out west instead of going home as I had planned and spending two months of my summer studying abroad. I want to do both these things but at the same time feel terrible that I can't see my girlfriend. The two months abroad was especially rough because, for her first semester of college starting right about when I would return from my study abroad, my girlfriend would be studying abroad as well for about four months. In total that would be six months in different countries with a time difference, more than a third of how long we've been in our relationship. After that she would attend college in Boston while I would be in school in North Carolina and distance would be even harder. 

While we had always expressed that we both wanted to stay together throughout or college years, the problems created by distance (the pure loneliness, fear of getting close to women because it felt dishonest), and the pressures of college both socially and academically constantly hurt me. Finding out that we would be away from each other for six months then in college for five or so years in different states surrounded by new people really freaked me out  and for two days I was especially distant from her and when she told me she was in love with me I wanted to say it back but it didn't feel right anymore when I did. 

So, last night, I called and broke up with her. She asked me five times if I was sure and I painfully said yes every time. I cited distance as the reason, telling her I wasn't strong enough to do it. She was confused at first then angry and said she didn't respect me as much anymore because we had always talked about our lives together and thinking about a future and that the fact I didn't share those with her was heartbreaking. I didn't know what to say so I just listened and cried and finally we said ""goodbye"" for the last time which really destroyed both of us. 

Today we snap chatted back and forth a bit without saying anything. Then she said we should stop talking because she would always fall for me and that I didn't feel the same way and that her telling me that she loved me and wanted our relationship to last was embarrassing because she could ""never make me want her."" She then said goodbye and we haven't spoken since. This really upset me because of course I want her, it's just so painful to be together long distance and it feels like it's draining me physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want her more than anything but I think the relationship was killing me. 

Now I'm sitting here on a plane to Utah alone, freaking out because she was the one I went to whenever I freaked out but now I can't go to her and I miss her like crazy and just want to take it all back because I love her so much and it feels like I'm never going to get her back and that terrified me because I love her so much and it feels terrible that I broke her heart and that we'll never be together again. 

Writing this calmed me down some and I'm sorry it's so long, I just needed to focus my mind on something so I don't have a panic attack on this plane. 

I just want to know what to do, do I try to win her back, should I cut myself off from her and stay broken up and move on, how do I stop myself freaking out, how do I calm down? I feel awful because it feels like she thinks I don't love her anymore and don't want her but I do, I really do, distance just sucks and I need to live my own life sometimes.

If you read all this, thank you. I'm sorry it's so long, I feel like a Reddit Tom Wolfe minus the beautiful descriptions. Anything you can do to help, any sign at all that you empathize would go miles and I can't thank you enough. ",18Mar2017,2

Apart from my height, I am just decent looking, having just overcome some really bad acne and having worked out for a while, but still not fully able to overcome a naturally unattractive face and a ghostly white skin tone. As I said, I get to the gym when I have time, so I know the basics. However, throughout my life, not a SINGLE girl has been attracted to me and told me/shown it (I am good at seeing these signs, I'm usually the one that points out to a friend that a girl is into them).

43,"So today I had to deal with the Starbucks customer service. It's not important why and I feel justified in going to them because of my issue. I initially contacted them on Twitter, but after they didn't reply for an hour or so I contacted customer service on their website as well (admittedly I was impatient). A little after that I got a Tweet back from Starbucks and they ended up giving me $10 because of my issue (which again, I feel completely justified with accepting).

My problem is that I got an email several hours later from customer service on their website who also credited my account with $10 (I guess they can't see if others have already dealt with the problem/put money in the account). Long story short, I'm feeling insanely guilty right now because I feel like I've essentially stolen an extra $10 from the company. 

I know Starbucks isn't being set back from this or anything and it's not as though I had any malicious intentions in doing it, but I'm not entirely sure what to do. Is it worth it to go through the trouble of contacting them back and explaining the situation to them? Please let me know. Thanks.",18Mar2017,1
46,"About three years ago, I met a guy while playing a game on Steam.  I was immediately infatuated with him, and not long after, our friendship became romantic.  Even though we never met in person, he has become the greatest love of my life.

However, our relationship was pretty bad most of the time.  He was frequently angry with me over the smallest things, emotionally abusive, and every couple months, he would leave, only to want me back a week or two later.

I know I should not have kept him in my life, but I was trapped by my love, and it hurt so much to be away from him.

Around July of last year, he left for a month.  I thought he was gone for good, as he had become part of a ""popular"" Instagram group.  When he came back, he told me he finally understood how he had been treating me, because a friend from that group had been treating him badly.  

I was skeptical at first, but over the weeks, he was sweeter, more supportive, more attentive, calmer, and that anger/cruelty was gone.  I finally started to feel secure in our relationship, like I could plan to meet him and think about a future. 

But come January, he told me he met a girl nearby that he wanted to be with.  After some long conversation, he admitted that was a lie.  In reality, that person that had abused him, that he claimed had changed him, had contacted him, and he decided he wanted to be romantic with her.

The thing is, I think he's using her.  He said to me about her, ""We say we love each other, but I don't know...""  And then he said if the girl found out about me, ""...he would lose his place in the [Instgram] community.""  

So it feels like he discarded me to use another girl to get back into this popular Instagram group he was with briefly.  

My question is, should I tell this girl I think she's being used?

I try to live my life as a good person, but much of my motivation in telling her is to hurt him, and purposely hurting another person is something I try not to do.  On the other hand, if I don't tell her, I'm allowing something bad to happen to someone.  

So if I'm trying to be a good person, what is the right thing to do?",18Mar2017,0

You didn't think to call even once during the 8 hour drive? What if nobody was home? You don't even have our cell numbers.

Last time and this time I clearly explained to them that they have to tell us in advance if they want to show up. I was just so dumbfounded by the phone call that I didn't have time to react. They were here for 6 fucking hours and most of that time was spent making dinner for them.

I was clearly annoyed by their presence, but my parents were being very accommodating. I know my mom was annoyed (she was going out to buy some things) and she said a few things, but overall she played the ""good host"" role. My mom explained what happened, but my dad hasn't said anything so far...just kinda listening.

How am I supposed to stop them from coming over unannounced? Why don't they have the common decency to call in advance? People have things to do in the morning. We can't be sitting around pretending to be good hosts when we have things to do.",18Mar2017,1

77,"I really messed up my relationship and I'm not sure how to fix it or if it's even possible at this point. So I've been in a long distance relationship this past year while at university.  My girlfriend graduated last year and we had a great summer together. We lived in the same city and were basically inseparable. Once the school year started we decided to ""not date"" anymore, which is always vague.  We kept talking but got in a few arguments, especially dealing with what we were. 

Then I had a personal tragedy occur, by far the most difficult thing in my life and I really lost sight of myself and the relationship.  I didn't deal with my emotions well and basically just shut them out.  I pushed her away which led her to not be happy with me, we argued a lot and I took it that she didn't care about me or want to be there for me. I started talking to other girls, mostly for support but I did have sex with them. Looking back I know how incredibly stupid this is but at the time I really didn't care about anything. I just used the fact that we ""weren't dating"" as an excuse and I never told her. 

So then the semester ended and I was on winter break. We hung out a lot, traveled together and things were getting back on track in my mind and in the relationship. Recently, I realized how much she meant to me and how much I cared about her. I felt love and happiness for the first time in a while and wanted to focus on our relationship.  Then things got bad. She heard a rumor that I was hooking up with girls and I denied it. I lied and regret that, but it just felt so distant and I did not want to let go of her.  She found out the truth and ended it the next day. We have not been talking very much but every once in a while I'll get a text back. I feel terrible and I feel like I ruined the best thing in my life. I felt nothing for a while, then I felt love again and now I feel like everything is crashing down.

81,"Some background: I've been to college and almost finished the first two years before getting bored. I didn't find anything career-related in the catalog that appealed to me. I went to the work force because I needed money so I could move out. Every day was a bit of a struggle between the me and the management over my general attitude. I always performed up to my best ability when it came to the labor but I never once cared about what I was doing - and when I wasn't able to reach expectations I simply tried harder the next time and explained why I couldn't meet expectation. This has been me in every job I've held before getting bored and resigning or getting laid off due to the work I chose to partake in. This has persisted for the last five years. The constant confrontations over my lack of a caring attitude get annoying very quickly. I'll admit that the only reason employers hire me at all is because I worked for a temp agency that had me start working without interviews. The temp agency didn't care and neither did I, but the companies they were staffing did.

To this day I still do not enjoy anything. Companies that I choose to sell my time and labor to don't interest me at all, but the paychecks they provide do. None have swayed my heart to care about their goals and visions and at one point I had to make it clear to an employer who confronted me about my attitude that I only see them as an income generator and nothing more. I don't enjoy working, I never have enjoyed it, and while I hold hope that one day I will find some joy in my life's work I don't see it ever happening. All I want to do is bring home a paycheck and have money to eat and a place to stay in while I search for something that does make me happy.

I don't want to post a resume here but I will say that my strongest work trait is data entry. I've always been very fast on typing and accurate on spread sheets that I had to fill out with the last job I worked (inventory management). I got bored of that one and left it as well.

What sort of jobs are there where employees aren't expected to care about the company they're working for? I mostly just want to be left alone while I work.",18Mar2017,8
83,"I have an alarm app that can sound out even when my phone is on silent or vibrate. I also keep my phone on vibrate 24/7 because it's less intrusive to others, but I can feel or hear it from just as far away as any ringtone.

I used to have to wake up to my phone buzzing for a couple reasons:

It usually meant my significant other was messaging me, and I'd want to wake up for that. If it was the middle of the night, they were usually recovering from a bad nightmare and might need me. We were in a LDR for a long time.

My phone vibrates when I get a phone call, and with my previous job the only people who called me were my supervisors, trying to get me to cover a shift. I needed money, and I liked my supervisors and wanted to impress them, so I had plenty of reason to wake up to this.

Now I get messages all the time from various people. I'm not part of any group chats I can mute, but my friends around the world feel comfortable messaging me about anything and at any time. I really don't mind, but it wakes me up when it's in the middle of the night. Usually one message won't do it (for example, my phone telling me I need to update some apps is a vibrating message, but it only does this once a day and it's never woken me up), but the people who talk to me tend to spam me 5 or 6 messages at once. Once again, I don't mind, and I won't be asking them to stop. Spam messages are like a phone call or my partner describing a nightmare or having a panic attack, because both are several vibrations over a short period of time. I assume that's why one message at a time won't wake me up.

She is very mature and smart, and otherwise a great roommate, but I have to find a way to confront her on this issue and convince her to stop. I don't, however, want to embarrass, anger, or otherwise upset her in any way. I have to have the perfect approach.

If you're eating, you might want to finish before reading.
Okay, so, here goes: she does not want to flush her used toilet paper, but rather put it in the open garbage container that sits in front of the toilet. Sometimes you can tell that it's used tp because it will shift in the trash and unfold. It's so disgusting and I don't know what to say to her or how to make it stop. I've never lived with anyone who does this, and it's disrespectful in my opinion. There might be differences in our upbringing or overall hygienic standards, so I need to tread lightly with my attempts to  fix this problem.

I've tried taking the trash out, and not putting the can back in at all, but she gets a new one or finds it and continues to fill it. Am I missing something? Is it normal to put used tp (from all toilet activities) in the bin where all can see it and it's at risk for exposure? Is there any benefit to this??

I'm taking to the internet because I don't think Dear Abby will help me. I need strategic verbiage that will get the point across without hurting her, or also a possible creative way to circumvent the issue in it's entirety (like when I hid the bin, but successful this time).

108,"So I'm gonna start with a copy paste from the post I made last year on another subreddit. (Edited some parts)

So I had a crush on this girl since last year. Never talked to her cause never had a chance back then and thought I'll never see her again anyway. Fast forward start of uni this year. Found out she's still doing the same papers as me and we even had the same classes. 

After much thought and encouragement, I gather up my courage and talk to her after almost two months into the semester. First few times we talked, she's always smiling and actually keeping the conversation going. She even waited for me to pack my things before going out the room. On the last couple of weeks before the exam, I kinda noticed that she's kinda avoiding me like taking the longer way to class instead of the shorter way I take. On the last day I decided to sit next to her in the lecture and tried to talk before lecture starts. Kinda got the feeling that she doesn't wanna talk. Lecture finished and I tried to start a convo again but same thing happened and I'm the only one trying to keep it going. It was getting awkward so in my mind I'm just looking for an excuse to get out of the situation. One of my friends called and asked me if I'm still good to hang out. I took the call and stood up and she's left on the bench alone. After a bit she stood up and walked off and that was the last time we talked. 

Exams ended and the break started. I messaged her on FB but she ended up ignoring it for a week just to open and seen it after. Also got the feeling that she probably mentioned me to her friends (I'm fucked I know lol). New semester starts and I tried my best to ignore her cause it's awkward after what happened last time we talked and the FB thing. Few weeks in I kinda noticed that waits where I usually wait and I just try to avoid that. Even though this is the case she still avoids walking where me and my friends can see her when we're just eating lunch and hanging out in between class (they always go quiet when she does). Even noticed her looking at me once and I just pretended to be on my phone to avoid eye contact. 

End of copy paste.

So Back to the present.

I'm gonna add that one of her friends started tagging her on my posts whenever the situation presents itself and is kinda relevant to our current situation between us. She just ignores that but liked the comment sometimes.

Anyways now with a new sem starting again. She's not in my classes anymore. I thought this is perfect and I can finally move on and forget about her. She still has papers with some of my friends and I always get snaps or messages whenever they see her. 

What do you guys think? Should I still go for her when I get the chance? Should I just move on ASAP? Any good way to do this? (Going for her/moving on). Is it worth it?

Tldr: had a crush on a girl for the last two years. Went great first time we talked then it went downhill. Now I don't see her anymore. Still can't move on. Still don't know whether it's worth it taking another chance when I can. 

Thanks guys!

 Recently the college festival this committee organizes ended and they announced the H.O.Ds for my department for the next academic year. There are generally 2 heads per department,I was okay with the 1st nomination but the 2nd nominated head was totally unfair to me and a friend of mine from the same department.

We had worked our ass off to save the department from collapsing itself along with our now ex-Head. This head of mine,one day before the festival called me and told me that she gave my name for Heads of Admin department,but after the fest the ex-General Secretaries(there are 2 of them) and one of the newly appointed GS overruled her decision and decided to not make me the Head. And frankly,I was pissed. There's already a lot of internal politics (influences and such),my department wasn't the only one affected. 

I really want to have a talk with one of the GS about this issue and ask her about the reasoning behind the heads appointment without making it seem like I know I was going to be a head but later the decision was changed( My ex-Head wasn't supposed to tell me this,but wanted to so I can improve my abilities regarding leadership). 

But I want to know should I go through it or not? If I mess it up,my next year in the committee would be very very bad and would end me not being the Head in the future(after the next academic year).

This strikes me as extremely unethical/possibly fraudulent. Coworkers that found out said they refuse (understandably) to sell the shirts if that is the case. To add to this, the shirts will be sold at various sister hospitals in the area but Marketing expects a cut of that too!

I'd had enough of it and so did my friends. He reached for a knife so I began attacking him, my 2 friends jumped in. It got out of hand and I began kicking and stomping him.

We're very close and have a great relationship but it's getting very hard to keep our friendship going cause everytime we want to hang out (which is not often because of college.) it's very hard to pick a place to go to mainly because we live in a city with little to no entertainment, that's why we all love to game I guess.

Usually what happens when we want to hang out together is that I'd ask them if they're free to get together and if they say yes, one of us would ask the question that usually shuts down the conversation ""Where are we going?"". True, i'm also guilty of asking that question but so far i'm the only one that tries to make an effort to find somewhere to go. If I suggest somewhere new like a car dealership (We all play a decent amount of racing games and have a slight interest in cars.) there's always that one person that is hesitant and gives excuses or straight up doesn't want to go, and if I suggest somewhere that we're comfortable with like just hanging out at a cafe or someone's house, they'd say that they're bored of it.

129,"I’m currently a grad student, 23-going-on-24, and financially dependent on my parents, as I headed to grad school two months after graduating from college, with no money saved up. Now in my last semester of my master’s program, I’m facing a dilemma: My parents want me to move back in with them. 

Actually, my desired job would relocate me to the other side of the country, and my parents are willing to drop everything to follow me there to cook and clean for me because they’re concerned I would be too stressed out from my new job to take care of housework on my own. This would be a continuation of their old routine – when I was in college, my mom would prep weeks’ worth of meals and drive up to my place on campus every month to deliver the food, and she and my dad would also clean my apartment whenever they came. Ever since I started grad school, my parents have been coming to my place every weekend (grad school is closer to home than college), especially because I live alone without a roommate now, to cook and clean. My mom also buys all my clothes. 

I have been allowing them to do this primarily for the following reasons: 

1) Mom was a stay-at-home mom and “devoted [her] life” to raising us (she reminds me of this on a daily basis), but my rebellious brother left home and started getting into trouble, an act Mom calls “betrayal.” I thought that coddling me instead would prevent her from feeling like a failed mother, so I reluctantly let her continue.

2) Because she was a homemaker, Mom's sole career was taking care of the house and raising us kids. She is also an immigrant, so linguistic and cultural barriers make it difficult for her to blend into the general community, isolating her for days on end. There are other women her age who are from our country and speak our language, but Mom is disdainful of what she considers their poor choices in life and chooses not to associate with them. If she didn't spend her time doing things for me, she would have absolutely nothing to do, and I didn't want her to feel useless. 

3) Mom gets stressed easily, has a heart condition, and takes medication for high blood pressure. Every time I try to reason with her about my independence, she gets upset and sick for a few days. I don't want to be the reason for her bad health.  

I had planned on living on my own and becoming financially independent after getting my master's, but the reality is that I have student loans to pay off, and jobs in my field don't pay much. My parents claim that if I live on my own, I would not be able to save any money, if I can even afford to do so in the first place. 

OK, I get it. But then I would have to follow their rules and way of life, i.e. never go out and/or report everything I do while I'm out.

I have never had a boyfriend despite my age and plan to start dating after I graduate, but I can't see that happening as long as I live under my parents' roof. Once in college, I was speaking to a male friend on the phone late at night, and Mom eavesdropped on the whole conversation and demanded to know if he was my boyfriend, yelling loudly. Dad demanded his first and last name and age. All this, even though there was nothing even remotely romantic about our relationship. Dates? Traveling/stargazing/talking for hours (i.e. anything that builds love) with boyfriend? Impossible. 

I can't imagine hanging out with friends either, or doing anything that I imagined I'd do in my 20s. 

Any advice on how to handle this situation? I want to deal with post-grad poverty and move out if that's what it takes, but I don't want to stress my parents out and make them ill (this has happened quite a few times). ",18Mar2017,3

Lately, my beloved mother has been acting differently. She doesn't respond well to jokes, she's been clinging to her computer, and has been more stressed overall.  
I'm really worried about her health. Even little things have started to change, such as backing out of the garage slightly to one side, being more sarcastic and aggressive about little things, and caring less about the family's state of mind.  
We (me and my dad alike) are worried because for one: I have to go off to college soon, and my family doesn't know how much time we have left.  
She's always been a smoker, ever since her parents died. I am worried this might be a form of cancer, but I am not sure. She claims she has arthritis in her fingers and she hurt her toe about a year ago and it still hurts.  
She watches CNN almost nonstop on some days because she's scared about the president taking away her job. She overanalyzes things and skips joking altogether. Also, my mom skips meals. I try to get her to eat, but sometimes she just turns the other shoulder.

About one month accrued 8 hours of PTO to spend how I choose.  Though in 2017, my company ditched this and went for an unlimited policy.  On paper, someone could be on paid leave for a long time within reason.  Which puts me in a tough spot.

I've been interviewing with another company for about a month through Skype.  My buddy, who works for them, came to SF for a visit and got me pumped for the opportunity.  They're based in Europe and the position/industry has been on my mind for years.  Problem is:  the next round of interviews will be on site.

136,"Basically as per title. I rent my own place. Due to a serious of fuck ups I have a shit job which means I make just enough to make it through. Sometimes not even that.


This stuff has been going on my whole life. Even living in different cities if he didn't hear from me he would call the police and make shit up. He manages to paint me as a giant fuck up who he is just looking after and manages to get told stuff from hospital staff (last time I was in for a suicide attempt and told them not to, I was next to the nurses station and he would phone and they would tell him).



He changed the lock on my flat and kept a copy. He refused to give it back. He reads my mail through light and asks me questions about the contents. 



Today has been the final straw. I have had an exceedingly stressful 2 weeks. Absolutely no time to myself due to working tons of overtime and going on an important trip.




I also do school outside of work to try in apparent vain to get out of the situation. This morning, after having not slept more than a couple hours each of the last 2 nights and spending a lot of time travelling I settle down to finish my assignment which is already overdue and I promised would be sent today.



While doing this he walks in my locked house and asks what I'm doing and can he watch tv. I say no I'm doing this assignment I don't have time to talk.



He then says he picked up my mail while I was away. Thanks, it would have been so hard to pick up the two days myself. Anyway he then asks about the contents of one of the letters.



I have had my suspicions he has been doing this a long time, letting himself in while I am at work etc. I my when I'm at work as I don't go out at other times as I am too scared to a leave my flat unnattended to let him root through, and b whenever I do do something I get demands of where have I been as ""he just happened to drive past my house and my car wasn't there"". I made stuff up for a while as otherwise he starts investigating my friends, possible romantic relations etc to find out why they aren't good enough for me. I also have an addiction problem and was finding support groups for this really helpful. In fact they kept me sober. I had to stop going as he found my car, despite the fact I'd parked it far away from the group meeting location, and then hunted around until he saw me coming out a building and then went online to see what I would have been doing there and voila. Now I get told off for going to recovery meetings as ""they just keep me in touch withyhe wrong kind of people and keep making me think I'm ill"". Yeah no. Also I've relapsed again which I'm sure he knows but is just waiting to use as an excuse for the next time I tell him he needs to back off and give me space. ""I can't do that, I need to help, you can't be trusted"".



That went on to a tangent. Anyway back to the letter. I said please don't do that, it is completely inappropriate. He insists it isn't and he is just worried about me and wants to help and got really angry and shouted at me and stormed off.






I have an event tonight. I know I said I don't have any friends but some do try and they persuaded me to go to this very important one. This is a major life event of a friend from high school, one who has absolutely no issues at all which could be of concern.




Anyway I told him I was going as otherwise I would be bombarded with questions after.




I gave up finishing my assignment as I was too angry to think so finished my laundry I needed and hung it to dry so it will be ready for tonight. Then as I have had so little sleep I went for a nap. 30 mins. after which I could maybe try and think about the assignment as it would still give me 90 mins then I could get ready for tonight. 




He unlocks my door as I lay down to nap. Starts saying some stuff to me from downstairs. I was dropping off so I just responded to his queries hoping he would go. No such luck he starts doing something so I ignore it a few minutes getting more stressed and wakeful by the second. He then asks what is wrong with me. I say I am tired and having a 30 minute nap. He answers with oh okay. I think that he has taken the hint but then start to hear banging and crashing from downstairs. I storm down and tell him I'm no longer going out tonight as I have too much else on and can't nap when he is making a noise.





""Sorry I was just doing the dishes so I don't havryo do them tomorrow"".




They are my fucking dishes. I tell him he never needs to do them, I don't want him to do them, I want to nap but it's too late and angrily (unfortunately) explain again why what he doing is not on.



He then gets offended and says he is just trying to help, why I am all so rude all the time and not to blame him for not going out tonight.




This was an hour ago. Since then I have been researching what to do. I am so stressed and this is so far from normal I cannot find any resources.


It's not domestic violence. He's not my partner and doesn't live in the same property as me. It's not child abuse. I am in my 30s.


I live very remote. I cannot job hunt anywhere else from where I stay. It would cost too much and take too long to get to any interview and I have no damn skills so it will take a few jobs.

144,"I'm 24 years old and I've had a job since I was a sophomore in high school. I've always taken care of my own insurance, gas, car payments, rent, etc.

My friends on the other hand have never had real jobs, always relied on me for rides and most of the time I pay more to throw down on what ever it may be when we hang out.

It's gotten to a point where I'm tired of hanging out with people that aren't living life at the same frequency as me and I'm feeling like I need to cut them off and make new friends.

Most of my friends chose to be homeschooled because they didn't like the high school atmosphere. Because of that, I feel like they aren't very good members of society, like they don't have a strong drive and have social issues. I'm also a little bitter because they left me in high school to have to make new friends while they chose the easy way out of school. 

One of my friends in particular has epilepsy. He is probably one of my best friends out of my group, but he cannot drive for medical reasons. He also can't work. His mom is always texting me saying how he is lonely and needs to get out of the house and do something.

I work 40+ hours a week and I am in school part-time. My free time is very valuable to me and a lot of the time, I like to spend the very little free time I do have at home taking care of the things that I need to take care of.

148,So one year and ten months ago my brother was murdered and I my mom wants to visit my brother's grave on his birthday. I'm really worried because I don't really know how to act when we go to his grave. My family and I haven't really allowed her to visit his grave much because the last time she went she had an intense panic attack and started digging his grave with her hands. Her fingernails were all red underneath from the intensity of the digging. She also started yelling into the flower pot hole in his grave expecting him to reply. Talking about this makes me really sad because I'm so lost. What can I do to make her feel better? Please help. Thank you.,18Mar2017,1

I asked if he's the little bitch that suffers from small p**is syndrome :D . In addition to all this he decided to enforce the law by the letter. I got ticketed for illegal window tint, had a gun confiscated because it was being ""transferred illegally"", and the jackass confiscated my bourbon. It was worth it all in all.

152,"To give some context, there's this guy in one of my college classes who is constantly staring/glancing at me. At first, I start to believe that he has some sort of crush on me and I kinda do too because he's pretty cute not gonna lie. However, I noticed a couple weeks in the semester that he might be married. He wears some kind of green ring on his left finger so yeah.

So now I'm getting annoyed because if he's not flirting, then I dont want him stealing glances every chance he gets. I've confirmed my suspicions of his staring by changing my seating to a position that should make it harder for him to do it. He still stares, but not as much because I've caught him a few times in the act and he would shy away after that.

We are not complete strangers however. He holds study sessions for the class that students can attend and this class was worrying me so I've been going every week to study hard. He's more friendlier to me here where the interaction is closer because not many people go to the sessions. We crack a smile sometimes when we exchange eye contact and have small talk here and there. Doesnt help the fact that we share the same name as well so we are a little closer than the average student relationship. He's bonded with a few others in the sessions however.

He does seem to have a more friendly/flirtatious personality, however he usually acts odd and kind of shy around me which is not normal for the kind of guy he is. He acts this way only outside of the sessions for some reason (so before and during actual class). You can see him having conversations with other students that he's bonded with from his sessions yet it's like he struggles to make small talk with me.

I'm really debating on whether I should confront him about this staring problem of his because it's confusing the hell out of me. Is this a good idea? I'll try my best not to be rude about it, but I really dont like when people stare at me for no reason and this happens every time we have class. I mean if you're married, you shouldn't be flirting with other people...",18Mar2017,1

175,"Recently moved. During the final inspection with the landlord (after we'd moved out all of our things and thoroughly cleaned everything) we pointed out a slit in the kitchen linoleum that looks like the start of two larger pieces coming apart, which the landlord said would probably be a quick fix and nothing to worry about. A couple days later, the landlord says there is a stain in the carpet that they didn't notice before hand because they were colorblind. And fair enough. We could have missed it. But, the carpet goes between multiple rooms and they said they will have to replace the whole thing. Is that normal wear and tear? It's not a big stain, could be covered by one hand. But that's not the main thing. The landlord just now (two more weeks later) has said that the washing machine is leaking, and has damaged the baseboards and drywall behind it. They said we must have moved the machine (it's in a closet type thing) and caused the pipes to become loose and leak. But the washing machine was never an issue while we were there. We never moved, never had a reason to, and also never noticed any leaking water (and if we had, we would have let them know, as I assume the landlord is responsible for fixing broken appliances). We've told the landlord this, but they're still pushing. What can we do? What do we have the right to do?

Update: It turns out in BC the landlord has 15 days to either return your deposit or send you, in writing, the reasons why they want to keep some or all of it. It had been more than 15 days, and the mention of us submitting a complaint through the RTB changed their tune. They did ask to keep some of the deposit to have the carpets cleaned (which they are apparently not replacing anyway), and we were all good with that.

184,"I am currently a freshman in college. Back in senior year of high school, just over a year ago, I was still making decisions over what college I would like to attend. At the same time, I had developed a crush over a boy who was already a college freshman; we were good friends in my junior year, his senior year. 

He attends a college that I was originally planning on going to even before the crush developed, but having the crush just influenced my decision further, and I know that it's not good to follow a crush and have it influence my college decision, but my brain was in constant denial that that was what I was doing at the time. I started texting him asking about his school and just talking about it a lot. It was a lot of texting on my part, but he humored me and answered my questions. I never once stated my crush to him.

Eventually, I became self aware of what I was doing and sent a panic text to him apologizing in the vaguest way ever in order to still conceal the crush I had on him. Then, I did something even more stupid and deleted him from everything, meaning his number and facebook. I didn't block him, just deleted him because I didn't want my crush on him to influence my decision that would change my whole life. 

At some point, I had a tour at his school after the deleting, and I tried to recontact him using facebook messaging. I apologized and explained why I did what I did, but he never said anything back and eventually blocked me on facebook. 

It's been over a year now, I decided to go to a different university, and I have no way to contact him about the situation. Because I deleted his number, I cannot text him, and I am still blocked on FB. No closure was ever reached, and there was no resolution, so now that it's been over a year, I figure it's time to tie up loose ends and regrets from high school.

I do not blame him for blocking me; I was an idiot who didn't know how to handle a crush situation. I also have no real way of contacting him if I decide to, but if I did find a way, I don't know if I would just make things worse by talking to him again.

We hadn't lived in the same house since I was 11 so I thought it would be good to catch up and, for the most part, it has. But there have been several things that, over the course of the school year, have become very irksome. He now regularly:

Never leaves my room until I ask to go to sleep. Sometimes we game together, which is fine, but otherwise he will jack my tv and not allow me to control it in my limited free time. 

Sleeps in my bed. It started this winter when his room would get freezing and he didn't get a whole lot of sleep. He would come in and take naps on it. Now, he has morphed his sleep schedule to sleep on my bed while I'm at school and leaves it a mess for when I get home. It doesn't sound that bad but it gets old fast. Plus, it's creepy. He's also very flatulent, which is a problem because he sleeps backwards and will fart on my pillows. 

Is wearing my clothes and shoes. He's lost quite a few pounds lately. Don't get me wrong, I couldn't be happier for him. But he has taken my shirts, jeans, and shoes and is now wearing them more than his own clothes. I bought a pair of shoes that I asked him specifically not to wear (the one time I asked him to not do any of these listed problems) and he now wears them regularly. I've since hidden them from him and have been asked several times ""where [his] shoes were.""

Makes passive aggressive comments about my flaws. It's something that I'm sure is very common for most people but it's new in this relationship. Comments about my weight, my time/money management, my laziness (which really gets me), and others are what I can expect in my time with him.



I'm sure some of it is frustration. I moved in with him and have since because involved in many career oriented extra curricular activities that are very time consuming. And I'm sure some of it is him trying to be as involved with me as he thinks possible. Some of this behavior is just offputting to me and frustrating to try to deal with as it has become somewhat childish.

He then went into air conditioning/heating and refregiratoing and constructiong business. Ofc he starts to drag me into with him. We only ever made enough money to just pay the bills. Not even on time. We ended up moving alot because he couldnt keep up with the bills. By the time I got into middle school it was practically school then work and work almost every weekend with maybe 1 day off every other week. It stayed like that for like 4-5 years. I hated it but he would get mad if I didnt go with him and complain about not being able to aford the bills and noone helping out. With the schedule he had me keep up I was falling behind in school. Alot. Barely passing. Like 64.7 rounded up by the teachers who didnt want to fail me. I have gotten some burn marks on my arm from work and I super rarely got paid for anything I did with him. And i hated asking him for money for something because he would get mad. My friends where at home going out having fun while I was at work and when I did get home I would leave for an hour and come back before it got dark if it wasnt already.

He wanted me to maintain a 95+ grade in my fucking classes while working with him one time holding me at the door of the apartment threating to kick me out of the house in hs when I was 15-16 because I was failing like 1 or 2 classes and he got a letter in the mail. When I was 16-17 he went in on a gas station in Texas with my uncle and a couple other guys. He had went out there for a year to manage it and the rest of the family stayed in NY. They only had a year lease. That one year I didnt have to work I wasnt working in basements and stores getting dirty for no pay. My grades went up I had 90 average and improving. I had free time to hang out with friends more often and was enjoying myself and taking care of my body. He would vist for a week and then leave like 2 or 3 times in this one year. Worst time of the year if you ask me. Then summer came and his lease was ending in september he wanted to bring over the family. I knew it was stupid because my uncle was saying something about them not getting their lease not going to be renewed for some reason but my dad was persisting. I told him I would come over taking one for my family because I knew they would be going for no reason. Holiday was coming up in 1 week and I asked him if I could stay till then and what do you know he gets mad and start yelling at me about the how the other 2 workers are leaving before the holiday was coming up. I was like whatever Ill go just to stop him. So for my entire summer I went and worked 12 hour shifts for him. He said hed pay me 700 a week but chabged it to 600 because even though I already knew how to work in a store from the pass summers he would make me work with others he claimed it was because I was in trainning. So 7 days a week for 12 hours a day I was working at the store and then going back to this house they rented to my ps4 that I brought with me and my uncles 10 year old laptop but couldnt use either because I had no screen to play on and the internet was super bad + a super slow laptop. So end of summer is coming up and they dont get the lease renewed. Company refused to extend it. We end up packing all the stuff in the store in one day in a truck and hauling it to michigan detroit where my 3 older sisters brought my parents a house that they rented out. My dad moves the family once again to the house so I go back to ny for one week to say my good byes which wasnt enough. I leave with the car and trailer back to detroit. So again I drive the entire trip to MI like I did fron TX. He had a store set up and some money aside from the gas station but then something happens and they dont buy it. We have all this product and no where to put it. I missed the first 1 1/2 months of school because we needed proof of address and Id to apply. My Dad starts to fix the attic and ends up spending most of the moeny that was for the new store or business he was suppose to get on it. Then him and my mom brought a one family house because the first one was to big for us as its only 6 of us and my 3 older sisters are married and dont live with us anymore. He also buys a store off of this guy just the business and invetory. So now he has to pay over $2000-4000 to pay off the house and store that he brought. Great more bills is what we needed. So now Im in my senior year of hs and I start the money that I made to buy games and computer parts and stuff for my room. Oh and he didnt pay me the last week of work either. My dad had this other job fixing this guys basement and gets paid 200 a day. He hired a worker for the store. I have been trying to avoid work at all cost. Im done. Im burnt out with this. I hate it and even though I can do an amazing job i dont even try. I feel so dead inside. I got depressed trying to find out what I want to do for a living and what I want to do in college because I realized that I am not me That there was no me. Ive been ready to kill myself since I was a kid. Watching my cousins having fun playing or like one working and he got paid choosing when he went and how long. And them being able to ask for something and get it without being yelled at. Family would be going to water parks and stuff like that and my siiblings and I scared to ask if we could go in fear of being yelled at. It got to the point where i just told them that I didnt want to go and had my sisters (I was the only boy for a while with 4 sisters. My brother wasnt born yet) go ask him with out me going. This way they would get such an earfull because I would still be at work with him.
Im getting off topic. I am done with him and work. Im going to college next year. I am planning to move for college because either way I have to pay out of state tution for my first year as I dont meet the one year requirement. But now he wants me to start working with him at the store during the weekends from 8 to 8. And sometimes after school. So he can cut down on expenses like the worker. Hes not going to be paying me. My depression has already throwen my grades for this year off and if I bring in a job then Id be failing this year for sure. I have been lieing to my mom about my grades already. Ive told her its 90s to 80s and she already knows that its bad. But then again she did see my report card from 2 years ago when it was all 60s to 68s and the 90+ when my dad left. She knows that hes the issue of my grades and has been trying to put me out of his mind for work but its not working. I just want to get out what ever state they are in and lose contact with them for a while. Only thing is my mom doesnt want me to go because she doesnt know how he will react. I also dont want him to start taking my little brother whos the same age as when I started to work with him either. I was suppose to go with him to work today but I wasnt home when he came to pick me up randomly and called my phone yelling. ""WHERE ARE YOU? You idiot. WHY DIDNT YOU GO TO WORK? I told you the weekends you have to go work!! Where did you go to eat shit?(to do nothing) Playing around?! This is what fathers favorite is suppose to do?! Wjere are you eating shit? WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME WHEN I DIE? FUCKING Idiotic moron."" His words roughly translated. I didnt say anything back to him just let him yell like always. I feel that if he comes home and starts yelling that something WILL happen. If he starts yelling im just going to take his car and just drive till he goes to sleep. Then comeback home.


Tldr and the question:
How do I tell my Dad that even though he just brought the store and does need help that I dont want to help him with it and I am moving away for college because of him? Without starting any issues or having him backlash at my family? [18m]

216,"I've been inactive on  social media for over 5 years. I was unpopular in high school, and slowly lost touch with the few friends I had while in college, while not really making any deep connections with any anyone new. Like most people, my life has changed a lot post-high school, and even in the couple years that I've been out of college; I look and dress much better, have a great job in an exciting new city, and can at least pretend to not be so cringe-worthy now. 

I see other girls posting pictures and accomplishments and getting tons of likes, and (I'm embarrassed to admit this) feel jealous of all of the validation they get and wish I could do the same thing. It's petty, but I'd really like the people who used to bully and ostracize me, and even just the people who watched, to see how I've changed. 

Here's my problem though: I still have no friends. I've tried (believe me, this has been a life long struggle), but no one ever wants to go out do anything with me. It also sucks because I'd like to go out and explore the new city I'm in and actually feel alive for once, but it would be too uncomfortable to go alone.    

Anyone have any advice?",18Mar2017,1
217,"I will keep It short. I am 19 years from eastern-europe, now studying in UK. I have one of the best jobs a student can have, I live in a nice town and go to a good uni (for my course).
BUT I HATE IT, it has nothing to do with what I love, I feel my passion and motivation diminishing and I am depressed.

Alternative?

Since I was 11 years old I was doing everything aiming for a military carrer, I was in civillian-defence organisations, volunteering with police, doing all kinds of cool stuff. In para-military organisation I achieved a platoon leader responsibity, I loved it. I was and still am passionate patriot of my country and I'd rather sleep on a rock and wear the uniform than live this comfy life with no values. 

So what's the problem? My parents, I do not want to let them down and my dad would be very upset about me stopping my studies and going to military (he sees nothing important or inspiring about it)

Should I just man up, save some money, buy myself a ticket and move back to join military? ",18Mar2017,1

221,"This is a very long story, so I will sum it up as shortly as possible...

I'm a sophomore in high school. Girl went out of her way to talk with me several times in lunch earlier this year but I was too shy. For several months I tried and failed to get the courage to talk to her and it sent me into a deep depression and unimaginable self loathing. Recently I have sat with her again but don't say much or smile and probably come off as unfriendly. This week I had a couple short convos with her on snapchat. On Friday I decided I was done being too scared to approach her every day and told her via snap to find me during lunch. She asked why and I told her b/c meeting and talking to people was really difficult for me. She never responded.

**Most would tell me to drop it, but I am tired of screwing myself over. I want to be able to talk to her and have a good time. But I don't know how to get there. How do I let her know that I'm not unfriendly and have a sense of humor, and am not just trying to hit on her. Does it require me being honest about my situation? Is there way I can start a convo on snap chat to clear things up?**

222,"Hi everyone. First, I want to preface this essay by saying that I am extremely thankful that I am employed and I do not want to sound like an ungrateful brat. However, I am absolutely miserable at this job.

To give a bit of a background, I live in an area where call centers flourish. Some people, who work in call centers make more money than people with a college degree. I am a good example of this. 

I graduated with a degree in criminal justice/international affairs. I did have some job interviews, but the pay in my field is very low. The maximum offer that I have found was 32k. Here at the call center I make 40k per year.
The reason why I am so miserable at this job is because I have totally and completely burned out. I work in an escalations part of the company. My shifts are about 11 hours per day, but throughout the entire shift I am getting yelled at and belittled. People are absolutely awful to call center agents. 

Here, there is no opportunity to move up except to a manager. The managers are rarely hired within the department and are typically hired from the outside. We have two managers currently, who worked at Taco Bell and Starbucks respectively.  There are other departments that you can go to. However, the pay is the same. It's just considered a lateral move. Honestly, I feel like I am wasting away here. I am not doing anything productive. I sit in a chair all day and I have gained about 20 pounds since I have started working here. Everything here is also heavily monitored. We are monitored by how much time we spend on the phone, how much time we spend in after call working on cases, how much time we are taking to use the restroom. I have been written up before because I had to poo and it took longer than the 5 minutes allowed. Sorry for being graphic. I am literally doing absolutely no good or helping anyone. 

I used to be a top performer when I came here, but after doing the same thing every single day, I have become tired and no longer have any desire to be here.

The problem is that the company has nice medical benefits and they are offering me to go back to school and get my master's in public health. Although it's a great offer, I don't know if I want to accept it. They won't pay entirely for the program. They will pay about 85%, but that's still better than nothing. When I think about being here 3 more years, I get all sad and down about my life. Honestly, the only thing that I have wanted to do since I was a child is to join the Peace Corps and I plan to apply in December, but now that the master's offer is on the table, I am having second thoughts about applying.

What should I do?",18Mar2017,1
224,"I am friends with this girl, but one day while cruising grindr (I'm not gay, just sometimes I like to look at grindr. I don't use it or meet anybody) I saw her boyfriend was on there, looking for casual sex and putting his stuff as ""discrete"" meaning he is doing it behind her back. I feel like it is something she needs to know that her boyfriend is cheating on her with gay strangers. But I don't want to tell people I was using grindr. I am also friends with the guy (not as close as I am with the girl), so I don't want him to know I am ""telling"" on him. Is there a way I can anonymously contact my friend to tell her without her finding out what is going on, without my IP getting tracked, etc? He has his instagram account linked to his grindr account, so that can be used as a ""oh I'm a stranger and went to his instagram when saw him on grindr and saw he had a girlfriend that is why I'm contacting you"" type thing.",18Mar2017,0
225,"This happened yesterday morning. I was on the bus, getting ready to go on a field trip (For context, I'm in the tenth grade). One of the two teachers on the bus began moving people to the front of the bus, because there weren't enough seats in the back. I said, ""They're moving them up front with the rest of the white people!"" and chuckled. A couple people laughed. Then, the teacher, let's call her Mrs. R, turned around. She yelled at me for saying something so disgusting and ignorant. She couldn't even repeat what I said. To make matters worse, that morning, there was an assembly for IB students that her and I attended about equality and perspective. She threw me off and I immediately went to the disciplinary office and confessed.

I was panicking and they made me lay down. In my panic, I told them that I heard someone else say it before me, and I was just repeating it. They demanded the identity of the person. I said I didn't know. The comforted me and called Mrs. R. She told them her side of the story, which didn't include the part I made up. My dad was called, who is a coach at a majority African American school. He was furious. They told me I was suspended for three days. At that point I was in tears. I had never done anything that bad before in my life. I never got in trouble. When I arrived home, I emailed a huge apology letter to both teachers. They still haven't replied.

I'm freaking out. I know for a fact that the students didn't care at all, but I don't want the teachers, that I have admired, to think I am a racist. I don't know what to do. I am going to try and apologize to them when I get back. I don't know how this will affect my future, college, everything. I'm not a racist. I feel terrible. I don't know how to prove that or what to say. I'm screwed. What do I do? How do I clear my name?

229,"So today my friend and I were at the train station, then a woman runs in yelling ""someone call 911!"" And she's being chased by a man. So then the man is yelling at her about something and the woman is absolutely horrified. So I decided to call 911 because she seemed really scared and so was I. So then before I finished the call I had no idea where the man ran off to so I see the woman is still there. So I go up to her and I told her I called and she said she was ok. As she was saying this she was still hyperventilating and was very shaken up still. I told her she shouldn't feel scared of anyone like that, bc I think calling was the right thing to do. I stayed where I was, like 5ish yards away from her to make sure she was ok and the man wasn't coming back. Then the woman had went off to get her train so then we left and went to our train to go home. Did me and my friend do the right thing?",18Mar2017,2
