2,"5 years ago I was diagnosed with a growth deficiency and started taking growth hormones. I had been short all my life and was really excited to start growing. 

Throughout the years of taking it, I was called a textbook kid. I'm taller than they expected me to be, and said that as far as they can tell, there are no side effects. I'm 6'1"" now, and I love my height and I'm probably gonna grow another inch or two as my bone age is about 1.5 years younger than my actual age.

I started taking growth hormone at the beginning of 7th grade. Throughout elementary school, 6th grade, and half of 7th grade I was a straight A 4.0 student. I got my first B during the 2nd half of my 7th grade year and my first C during my 8th grade year. I am now a junior in highschool and my weighted GPA is 2.5.

What is hurting my grades the most is my lack of motivation. In my English class, I have a 30% in the homework category and a 97% in the testing category. I literally have no motivation at all. Most nights I just procrastinate until the last second, then tell myself it's not worth it and it won't hurt my grades that much since I have so many zeroes anyways. I can't even motivate myself to do the simplest of things. I've put off this post for far too long now. 

I'm angry. I'm angry at myself for this and I take it out on my friends and family. I constantly argue with my parents and I've shut off most of my friends, and I barely talk to them now. 

In my head I've come to the conclusion that growth hormone is what started my problems, since I started them in 7th grade and half a year later I started fall apart and crumble.

Being tall is the only thing that makes me happy now. I was bullied when I was younger for being smaller, shorter, and weaker than everyone else and now that I am taller and stronger than those kids that once bullied me gives me joy. Pure joy. I love it. I also love having good grades, friends, and I really want a strong relationship with my parents. 

I'm afraid that growth hormones aren't the problem. I'm afraid that if I stop taking them I will stop growing and continue to have the problems I am having right now, rather than me getting happier, making new friends, rebuilding my relationship with my parents and salvaging my grades. 

Writing this post has brought me to tears. I honestly have no idea what to do now and I'm lost. 

What do I do? Do I stop taking them and hope I magically start to feel better, or do I keep taking them and try to save the only thing that makes me happy now?

10,"Excuse my mothers rude language but she did use this exact word which I have heard is pretty offensive. I have had relationships in the past but I am not so comfortable discussing them with my family and for that they assume I'm gay. Ever since I was little my mother, sister, and brother have publicly asked if I was a lesbian/gay/dyke, have pretty much used every word there is. They have made fun of me and have called me hurtful names but I just laugh it off and deny it. It's happening more often now, even in public my mother tells her friends I don't bring anyone over and she isn't sure if I even like guys so her friends ask if I'm ""a lesbo."" I hate that just because I don't talk to my family about guys I must not like them and don't get me wrong I have nothing wrong with gay people I just hate this whole stereotype thing. I dress a certain conservative way to work and by me doing so my mother asked me if I was a dyke. I think I am such a private person because I have seen so many relationships crumble around me.

Lease says a/c unit, stove and fridge.

 We have not had a working stove in 35 days since the lease was signed OR a clean fridge to store food. (But the fridge has worked but includes roaches and larve) and now Landlord says he's going to evict us for not paying rent. 

We have also brought up the fact that there are multiple roaches and atleast one mouse under our kitchen sink.

We have not been able to come to an agreement on a rent reduction or breaking the lease so he says he will evict us immediately and wants to take me to court.

17,"My boyfriend currently rents a pretty sizable 3-bedroom house with 3 of his friends. Two of them are an engaged couple and they have two dogs together, a German Sheppard and a border collie. These guys are great and I have no problem with them. The third roommate has his own dog and this is the guy I take issue with. Let's call him M. 

So the way this house is set up, there's a basement, a main floor and a second floor. I've never been in the basement and don't think it's used much. The main floor has a spacious living room, a kitchen, and a lounging area, plus the master bedroom (where the couple sleeps) and 1.5 baths. Upstairs is a small hallway, a full bathroom, my boyfriend's room and M's room. 

M's dog is a Newfoundland mix, so he is a pretty big dog. He's about a year old now and M has had him for probably about 9 months. As long as M is home the dog has to stay by his side, and M is almost always shut up alone in his room playing video games. He gets let out a few times a day to go to the bathroom and maybe play a little bit, but otherwise he is shut up in M's room and isn't allowed to leave. As I'm writing this, I've been here for 5 hours and he's only let his dog out once for a very short period of time. When M goes to work, the dog has to stay alone in the tiny hallway and isn't allowed to go downstairs at all. When I spend the night at my boyfriend's, we can hear the dog standing at the top of the stairs crying because he hears the other dogs and wants to go down and play with them. The hallway is so small that the dog is probably only about 1/2 or 1/3 the size of it, so he has like no space to move around for all 8 hours or so that M is away at work. He has his food and water bowls up there with him, but nothing else, not even a toy. 

On top of that, he doesn't clean up after his dog very well at all. He will give the dog baths in the bathroom upstairs, which he shares with my boyfriend, but then never cleans the dog hair out of the bathtub. If my boyfriend wants to shower, he either has to clean the dog hair out himself or do it at my place. There are huge clumps of fur sitting on the edge of the bathtub all the time because he never cleans it up. 

A few times my boyfriend has gotten upset because the dog forced his way into his room (none of the dogs are allowed in there) when M wasn't home and messed some stuff up, ate a bunch of chocolate, tore up some unimportant papers, peed on his bed etc. But I'm very insistent that it isn't the dog's fault. He's too big to be cooped up all day like he is, and I don't think it's fair of M to do that to his dog. As far as I know he doesn't hit his dog or anything and for the most part the dog is very well behaved, is very friendly and obeys commands really well. He just has a lot of pent up energy and no way to expend it which results in him misbehaving sometimes. 

I hate the way he treats his dog, but I don't know what to do about it. I've never actually had a conversation with this guy because he stays in his room all day and doesn't talk to anyone besides the engaged couple he lives with. Even when my boyfriend and his roommates all play video games together with other friends, M always has everyone else muted on mic and won't talk to anyone else. Plus I have no real interest in trying to get close to him, because apparently he's kinda racist and misogynistic and based on that and the minimal interactions I've had with him I doubt he would have any interest in talking to me anyway. If I did somehow manage to reach out and confront him about this, I feel like he wouldn't take anything I say seriously. I feel like it's not bad enough to report animal abuse to any authority (plus I just feel like that's kind of a shitty thing to do), but I don't know how else to help the dog without upsetting my boyfriend or his other roommates. They've all been friends for years and I've only been around for a few months, I don't want to be the person who drives them all apart but at the same time it really bothers me that he mistreats his dog like this. I just have no idea what to do. ",20Mar2017,2

23,"I am feeling hopeless for the next two years of my college experience.  I am a junior and I go to a small public college (5,000) that I have never been too fond of.  I overlooked all the issues I had with the college my freshman year, because I had a solid friend group.  Well, that friend group disappeared as greek life made people split off into separate groups.  In the beginning of my sophomore year, I joined a frat too, but we got kicked off at the beginning of last semester.  This semester I noticed that all the brothers were either graduating/forming subgroups/doing their own thing.

From losing this friend outlet, I now have lost the main aspect that made me tolerate going to this school.  The town is very lame and there is nothing to really do.  I am fine alone during the summer, because I like my hometown and I do get to see my old friends when I feel lonely.  But, now I have a very low amount of true friends at college and don't really know what to do.

I have two more years (possibly only an extra semester), because I changed my major late.  I am contemplating on transferring to a college where I feel like the town and people are more of a fit for me, but I'm fairly certain it'll make me have to take more semester to transfer in.

I think I'll just have to push my way through the last two years, but I wish my college experience didn't end up like this.  I know I could join clubs, but that's generally more for underclassman at my college.  Does anyone have any advice on going from always having a friend group to having to go lone wolf?  Has anyone had an experience like this in college or something similar?  Thanks, I'll take any advice.",20Mar2017,1
24,"recently my GF has been going through stress and I hasn't been telling me why she's upset, but she also says I am not the reason for her sadness.


This morning she hit me with the I need a break phrase, and I was straight forward and said breaks basically mean you want to break up, and if you want to break up it's completely fine not going force or anything . She ended up saying she needed space to collect her thoughts I told her that's fine and that I wouldn't bother her, but she said that scares her and that she loves me and her feelings for me haven't changed at all


I was too upset to say anything back so I just ignored for a few hours before msging back but I was at work so I'm in the clear. But does this basically mean the relationship is over?


I'm more offended that she doesn't feel the need to tell me why she's upset and leaves me in the dark and tells me not to worry about it. I'm extremely open with her and pretty straightforward about my feelings and my life in general. Also this is long distance but we live in the same time zone.


The part that gets me the most is that she tells me she's upset but she won't tell me why and leaves me in the dark while she's all depressed and stuff. And when I ask her what's up she says ""dw about it"". I'm open and I tell her everything and she can't tell me why she's upset and it makes me feel like I'm an awful boyfriend who can't even make their girlfriend cheer up.


If you guys need any other info let me know, if you gals could tell me what I could do to fix it and or if this is just a slippery slope

28,"All my friends are graduating college, buying houses, starting their careers, and getting married. 

I attended a prestigious parochial high school and from the small group I still communicate with, they're all taking the best steps to more stable, conservative lifestyles. Although, they all have been financially supported by their parents residentially and tuition wise. 

I was kicked out of my parents' home at 18 and moved to another state to take advantage of an athletic scholarship. 

I worked two jobs to try to make enough to buy food, basic attire, and school supplies and books. 

Under immense stress, I made bad decisions in college, dropped out, never graduated, and relocated back to my home state. 

I feel like I started behind but now I've taken ten steps backwards as well. 

I didn't complete my BA and I had been working in food service ever since. I understand it is not a race and comparing yourself to others is a waste of energy and focus. 

It's absolutely my fault, the choices I made and didn't make. But I'm not sure how I can change my mindset to a positive and energized one that I had at the beginning of my college career. 

Can anyone, anyone, give me any advice or a different perspectives on my situation? It's difficult to find the confidence I need to come back and be better and make my family proud. 

I want to travel and put school off for now. I don't doubt I need professional help; but I know I'm not the first twenty something year old to feel unaccomplished or unappreciated.

29,"Hello all. So, recently I was asked to play a gig with my friends for St. Paddy's day. We are college students, I'm a drummer, the other guy is a guitarist / singer and the girl is a violin player / singer. Well since we spent a lot of time together rehearsing I developed an infatuation for the violin player. Anyway, after the gig we have been emailing back and forth. I've kept it pretty lowkey, and I suspect she may have interest because she's been writing well thought out responses and such. Also even before the gig she would give me little compliments like saying something I did was cute or charming. On one hand, I don't want to make things uncomfortable being that we are in a sort of little band together. On the other hand, I don't want to lose out on any sort of opportunity with this wonderful lady, especially if the feeling is mutual. Any advice on how this should progress would be much appreciated.

40,"So.. I've just been driving up the wall with my relationship to my Fiancée. We're about to hit the one-year anniversary mark of our relationship and I just.. I've realized I feel happier when she is not around, when I'm by myself enjoying things on my own.

I started seeing her after a bad break-up with somebody, I was sort of just wanting to be with somebody for the sake of being with somebody, since beforehand I honestly haven't been in too many relationships I thought the cure for my loneliness and sadness would be for me to have a partner. I.. really regret that.

Things started great with this girl, we had a lot of the same interests in things, hung out a lot, started dating almost immediately but.. even back then I think that's where I/we made our mistake. We met and like.. in under two weeks started going out and proposed our love to each other, and then a month or two later got engaged.

At the time I thought she was perfect and the one for me, because well.. now that I'm being honest with myself, anybody that actually liked me was good enough for me to settle with.

The issues I have with her now is.. she hasn't done anything inherently wrong, or could be thought of as wrong. For all I know, I could be the bad guy here that isn't right for her. I say that because, she has been abused and has a lot of disabilities, disorders, depression, cuts herself, is manic, the whole nine yards. It's just.. she needs a lot of comfort and (in my own words) coddling.. which.. I just don't like. She gets too clingy, always wanting to be with me, sad if I'm not around, easily gets upset and sad in general.. It just annoys me, I hate it. I want to be my own person, not be tied down and feel the need that I have to tell her what I'm doing or where I'm at, having to comfort her almost every day because she has episodes. And none of this is *her* fault, as she told me. She can't help that, I don't blame her. She isn't doing anything wrong or should be sorry for anything, it's just that I personally can't handle it, it's too much for me.

All it is nowadays is we argue, make up, things are well for about one week, repeat.The honeymoon phase is over, and I realized I made a mistake a long time ago - and she told me what she has and stuff, it's not like I didn't know what I was walking into. I knew, I was just.. wanting to have somebody so bad, now I don't want it anymore.

But I just don't know what to do, as I've said before, this girl has a lot of disabilities and disorders, and I don't want to throw her off the deep end with a break-up but.. I'm just not happy with her. She didn't do anything wrong or harmful to me, but.. it's her issues that I personally can't handle or feel like dealing with. It's selfish, and I know I'm awful for being that way, but I don't want to deal with that the rest of my life. I want out, but I feel tied down... in her own words she said ""You're the most important person to me, you're my favorite"" and we bought each other so many gifts.. I just don't know. I need help with this relationship.

Like.. almost every other couple months, I have the feeling to make this topic, and I type out my honest thoughts and feelings about the relationship, back I stop mid-way though and decide not to create a thread; in hopes that something will work out this time and things get better. I just don't know anymore though.",20Mar2017,1

42,"Me and My older brother never had a good sibling bond and it's not because I didn't want one but because my older brother pretty much never cared enough. My whole childhood was just me sucking up to him and waiting for a reward. Whether it was letting him have my TV time or risking punishment for helping him with his schemes. It was all in hopes my own brother would ""like"" me. Teenage years aren't relevant being we spent it apart due to parent's old fashioned ""Mom takes the girl"" and ""Dad takes the boy"" type thing going on but he did live with us a for total of a year and half though during that time though. Anyways I went to visit our Dad for the summer since my parents wanted us to spend time together before he left for the Army so I did. We didn't have NOT 1 conversation. I know you're like...cmon at least one? Nope. He wouldn't even respond when I called his name. I tried multiples times over and over but nothing. I expressed this with my Dad who only met me with ""That's your brother"" and ""Maybe you did something to him"" or even ""Maybe that's how he is"" yet he saw how my brother treated me. Like a stranger. I basically just resolved this letting him go and accepting he may be my brother but he's never wanted to be. Yet my parents don't understand it. It's the same ""He's your brother"" and ""Stop acting like this"" whenever I express how I don't care what he's doing in life. Don't get me wrong. I love and care about my brother A LOT and always will. It's unconditional but I deserve way more than to be treated like some stranger he never met. My mom and Dad even ask ""Has ____ messaged you? I can't believe he's in ____ right now!"" IT'S AS IF EVERYTHING I TOLD THEM WENT OVER THEIR HEADS. If he wouldn't even talk to me in person why in the hell would he text me? I basically told my mom an hour ago to stop updating me on how he is and stuff and she got upset. Basically said why are me and my brother so evil as if I'm the reason our relationship is trash and said so what if he ignores me and that shouldn't mean I stop caring about what he's doing.
I thought for a second maybe she's right. Maybe I should keep trying but I feel like I shouldn't have to BEG my own brother to give a shit about me. Am I wrong, Redditt? Should I keep trying? I'm just so tired of having to walk miles for people to stay in my life. Why can't people be here because they want to be. Why can't my brother just love and care about me without me having to beg for it. Why does it always have to be me... Anyone with situations similar that can help me out will be greatly appreciated.

46,"So about 7 years ago, I was walking to my Starbucks job from the bus station.  It was raining pretty hard, and I was getting soaked.

A Porsche pulled up beside me on a road with no sidewalks and inside was a sixty-something man, who offered to give me a lift to wherever I was going.  I hesitated (popular advice is not to get into a strange man's car, but I was soaked and wanted to get out of the rain.  As a man I didn't feel too threatened.)  

On the drive he asked me what I wanted to do with my life, and I told him my ambitions of being a self-employed engineer at some point in my life.  The conversation was short, but felt somehow meaningful.  

We pulled up to Starbucks and I thanked him profusely for the ride.  I offered for him to come inside so I could make him a hot drink, on-the-house.  He kindly refused, then gave me his business card.  He told me to call him if ever I needed anything.

I was about 18 at the time, and I never really felt the need to call him for mentorship or anything of the sort.  I am 25 now, and I feel that I may have missed a huge opportunity to have a mentor.  I still have his business card.  Whenever I find it in my box-o'-random stuff, I feel regret that I never gave him a call. 

Would it be stupid to give him a call and see if he might have remembered me? What could have come from that opportunity?  Was that encounter some sort of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? Perhaps he wishes to share his wisdom with someone he once felt had potential.  But I suppose I will never know.

TL;DR: Long ago, a successful man gave me his business card and told me to give him a call if I ever needed anything.  I don't know if it would be unreasonable to call him, 7 years later.  I feel as though it might be too late, although I feel regret that I never took the opportunity.",20Mar2017,1

But I still feel like I don't have a real purpose - something that makes me want to keep going.

&amp;nbsp;

I can deal with the breakup, and I may have another job opportunity, but I won't know for another 2 weeks.  In these next 2 weeks I could keep working towards finding a job, but I feel like my time would be better spent on improving my outlook on life... I just don't know where to start.

I currently live between LA and Orange County.  I have very few friends, and none are local.  I don't have any hobbies - in my free time I just browse Reddit and YouTube.

50,"Reddit Readers,
Recently, I noticed that I have been gaining weight. Not a whole lot, but a couple of pounds. I don't really know why, and was wondering if any health experts or whatever have a solution. For my lifestyle, I eat fairly healthily (I think). Usually for breakfast I have some fruit and some oatmeal or a granola bar. For lunch, a salmon sandwich. And for dinner, I eat whatever my dad makes (I'm a teenager no I don't live in my parent's basement). As for exercise, I admit I kinda lack in that department. I walk a lot around town and play tennis once a week but that's about it. I'm trying to sign myself up back up for dance and self defense though. Apologies for my vague description.
Any thoughts?

52,"I don't know what to do. 

I came over to my dad's house today for the first time since Christmas. I made a comment about wishing I could just quit my job and walk off into thin air, and was entreated to a long lecture about personality responsibility. While I do appreciate the sentiment, I work three jobs, am a full-time student, and had no intention of actually leaving one without providing notice. I tried to clear this up but got a response of, ""What, you don't like being challenged? Now you're just kidding?"" 

I kind of lost my cool and said I was going to go back home early. 

My step-mom said she ""still doesn't completely trust"" me, and that tossed me over the edge emotionally. 

I'm 24 years old now. Nine years ago, just after my 15th birthday, I broke into several houses and stole things that didn't belong to me. I was the victim of severe bullying at school and was very angry at that point in my life. Taking things from strangers was my way of feeling powerful and back ""in control."" 

I got into legal trouble, which distressed my family a lot. I had a minor falling out with my dad, with whom I had previously been very close. 

Since then, I've never re-offended or gotten into any kind of trouble. I haven't gotten so much as a parking or traffic ticket in four years. I'm almost finished with my first BSc and want to do the Peace Corps and get an MA or MSc. I recognize there are some things I'm quite good at and others I'm bad at. 

However, it seems like I can never visit my dad's house without my past popping up in some way or another. Traveling, for instance, is a big part of my life. I like talking about the places I've gone, because I don't have much excitement in my ordinary routine. Apparently my step-mom considers that ""boasting"" or ""bragging,"" even though I don't think going broke to another country is particularly impressive; it's just what I do, much as my dad ""does"" hunting and fishing. 

I guess I'm just feeling devastated. I made mistakes in my life but have worked hard to move past them. School has had its up and downs, but I'm almost done. I'm not a narcissistic and self-absorbed kid any more, but feel like I can't even talk about what I am proud of for fear of getting called ""arrogant"" or ""think [I'm] better than everyone else."" 

My family has definitely given me a lot of love and support over the years, but sometimes I just wish I'd hear, ""We're proud of you."" 

I don't know. I've just lost so much confidence over the past year. My ex-girlfriend broke up with me because I'm graduating two years late, and I feel intensely ashamed of working a minimum-wage job and doing freelance writing while she's halfway done with an MBA. Both my dad and my step-mom mock the fact that I travel as much as I can; they don't do it maliciously, but I'm sick of hearing jokes about how ""worldly"" I must think I am. 

I'm not 15 years old any more, but I don't know how to show it. I guess my dad and step-mom just don't see enough of me any more. I mean, I used to have an awful time getting along with my step-dad, but even he seems alright now. He jokes with me, trusts what I say, and doesn't get angry over all the little things he used to. 

I don't think I'm doing terribly for a young guy, but sometimes it's hard to keep my head up when all my friends have moved away and there's never anyone to say a good word. ",20Mar2017,1
53,"As the title states my mother is 52 years old. She has always been sort of ""out there"". She was a single mom and we've never had much money. I have been out of the house for 8 years now I am currently 30 years old. She lives with her 66 year old boyfriend who is retired. As far as I know between them they only have a little over a couple thousand in the bank. 

Tonight is the first time I have approached the subject of the next 20 years which in my opinion will hinge on the decisions she makes right now. She will not listen to me though. She keeps insisting that because she had to raise a child alone now is her time to ""have fun"" by going on vacations and basically allowing the income she gets from social security and what she makes working 60+ hrs a week at her job in the kitchen of a private school to almost go entirely toward rent and bills. She has no assets. She has a 401k which she was insistent that she could rely on as long as she stays with the company that employs her. So far she thinks but is not positive that she has around 2000 in that. 

I was asking her what she thought she would do or how she saw the future and her responses were vague. She said she could rent a room in someones house or rent a 500 dollar a month place with everything included. That is her plan. With only 900 a month from SSI. Her initial plan was to keep working until she dies and I told her thats not at all feasible. So effectively she is leaving herself completely unprepared for the next 20+ years. 

It frustrates me because she will frequently go off topic and try to lose me in another conversation simply because of her mental illnesses which wont get any better with age she is unable to make a plan.

I can see where this is going and I know its going to rely on me to take care of her. I'm not putting her in a nursing home but shes not taking care of her financial security. What do I do? ",20Mar2017,1
56,"Sometimes when I am falling asleep I pretend everything is OK, I tell myself that I am a good person, that this is all a bad dream.  I fall asleep and then the dreams take over, sometimes they remind me of what is really going on. Sometimes they show me a fantasy where I didn’t lie, I never hurt my Wife and everything is the way I wish it was. I wake up and for roughly 5 seconds I feel good, then that cold feeling comes back, the fear, anxiety, failure, and pain.  It very quickly throws me back into reality. You did mess all of this up, your lies have cost you your Wife and your best and only friend. All those years of thinking “I will just tell her this and fix the problem myself” caught up with you. Your laziness has cost you a Woman that you loved, she has moved on and you have little to no hope to ever bring her back.   I am lucky to be able to be with my kids every day, this agreement that we have to live together for the sake of the kids is what is keeping me going at this point. They are all perfect, they deserve to be raised right and not let my own personal demons harm them.  This is my goal, they are what matters now, I must fix what is wrong inside of me to make sure they do not suffer from it.  

The paranoia that is running my life is the main reason I began to write this.  All I do all day is worry about them and worry about what my Wife is going to do. I know that she is moving on and living her life now the way she feels she should, it’s just so hard to not be a part of it. I feel sick when I think about her being with someone else, telling people all the things I did wrong, moving on. Moving on is the last thing on my mind right now, when my mind has a clear moment and escapes the paranoia, fear and sick feelings I remind myself of what she said to me after the counseling appointment “Whatever happens we are going to be ok, we are still a family, we can still do things as a family”   I know she meant well with those words but they actually stung me for the simple reason that this is all my fault.  The hardest part about this right now is not being able to direct my anger or depression towards an outside force, I am to blame.  I am depriving myself of things that I love for the simple reason that I feel that I need to experience pain, depression, anxiety and fear to help teach me what I put her through.  People will say that this is not the best of ideas and it will have an adverse effect on what I am trying to accomplish.  That may or may not be true but all I know is without her nothing I used to enjoy doing seems to have a point anymore.  She never liked wrestling and didn’t seem to care that I watched it religiously but I can’t bring myself to sit and watch the one thing that has been there in my life since I can remember having conscious thoughts.  My fear is that she will think “well he must not care because he is watching that damn show again.”  I am not eating for the simple reason that I love food and that I am very overweight.  Food brings happiness so I don’t eat food, it’s’ that simple.  

I have spent many hours recently trying to get to the root of the cause of my lying.  This will be what my counseling is going to focus on obviously, but that is only once a week.  I have never been patient and I want answers now.  I lied as a child, but many kids lie to get out of trouble.  I think the fact that my Mom would so easily believe the lies didn’t help either.  I keep coming back to “fear” I lie because I am afraid to tell the truth, afraid to be in trouble and have people I love mad at me.  I hate letting people down so lying was a way to make it seem that I wasn’t.  It’s like we are trying to teach the kids though, lie now and when we find out it makes it much worse later.  My big issue was living “day to day” meaning: if she is happy today then that’s good, I will worry about tomorrow then.  This obviously did not work out well for us.  I would fall into a deep pit of laziness when she was happy, when we were not fighting and when she was not questioning me about things.  At the end of the day I feel sick because I love her so much but causing her all that pain makes me question if I really know what love is.  Why would I put someone through all that when I am so deeply in love with them?  I know that I would die for her and I support her in everything she wants to do but we have hit a point where that is not my job anymore.  All I think about all day are random fears and thoughts like “is she going to take a trip to Cali to see him?” “Is she going on a date anytime soon?” “Will I ever be able to get the images out of my head of her fucking another man?”  It is almost too much to bare and it’s all my fault!  It’s easy to hate myself at this point and that doesn’t help what I am trying to accomplish either.  

So, what is the point of lying? Well the obvious answer is to hide the truth from someone.  Why do I hide the truth? Again, obviously, I don’t want someone to hate me or feel let down or disappointed.  The end result is that now everyone feels that way about me because I lied.  This brings me to my kids.  They are the only things that matter now.  The counselor said to me “we have to fix you and then your kids get the benefits of that.”  She is most likely correct but I don’t care about me right now, I care about them.  When they are old enough then we will explain why we are doing what we are doing.  At that point my biggest hope is simply that they will understand and see 2 parents who loved them all so much that they both wanted to be with them every day and night.  She needs to live how she wants to now, that kills me inside to say and honestly, I don’t even think I mean it right now.  I need to sacrifice and show the kids a good life and a good Father that is both there for them whenever they need me and also provides for them so they never feel like they go without.   Mine was not that Man, he was there when convenient for him, he did not provide for me in any way and I resent him every day for that.  This is what I must never let happen, I can never be him and if that means that I have to live the rest of my life completely for them and not myself then so be it. I can do that, I have to do that and I will do that.  

There is so much to make up for that I cannot ever take back.  So much unrepairable damage that my lies and laziness has cost me and my Wife, how do I live with that? How can I just forgive myself for doing that to someone? I can’t, I will never fully be myself again and maybe that’s not a bad thing.  The sad part is that there is a part of me that always believed that I lied to her because I loved her, because I was protecting her from a painful truth.  This also did not work out to well. It’s very disappointing to say that and think that I thought it was ok to do for those reasons.  Another sickening thought is the fact that I would get so deep into my lies that I think I began to believe some of them.

This past Thursday I was supposed to have my first one on one appointment and the counselor took a “sick day”, are you fucking kidding me!?  Of all the days, I need this, and when I told my Wife and I could see her head thinking “is he lying about this?  I bet he doesn’t want to go” I know I brought those thoughts upon myself but it still hurts to know she will always second guess what I say from now on.  Or maybe she just doesn’t care anymore, the way it seems to be going makes that the most likely answer. This past Friday I got home from work and she told me she was going out with a friend for a while. This is the same friend that she is posting on Facebook about having inappropriate conversations with while drinking a bottle of wine. This is the same one who also told her to have the affair if she wanted too. When she told me it was like a punch to the gut, at the same time it was just her going out with a fiend for a few drinks, shouldn’t be a big deal.  Here is the real issue, I have no say in this anymore. She is emotionally distanced from me and living her life as such.  Therefor she can do what she wants, and she is.  I have this constant fear that she is still going to try to take full custody of the kids and try to make me leave the house. She has repeatedly told me that this will not be the case but I just can’t get over the paranoia.   

People at work can tell that something is not right with me, they keep offering to talk or help in any way they can. I just keep telling them that it’s “home stuff” and say thank you.  Why should I bring these people down? We are just getting to know each other and I am just going to unload to them about how much I have fucked up and lied and messed up my entire life? They don’t need or deserve that. Why would some big fat loser telling them how much is wrong with him be something that people would want to be around on a daily basis?  They all seem like such good and nice people, I am not going to attempt to ruin that.  So I still spend my days upset and paranoid, feeling sick and cold.  It goes away temporarily when I get home and see them, my 3 reasons for living. I still need to be a Father and tell them when they are being bad and yell at them and all that but I just love being able to be here with them so much it doesn’t bring me down like it used too.  SO I am going to attempt to reschedule my appointment so I don’t have to wait all the way until Thursday to meet with the counselor again. 

I watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 the other night, greatest TV show ever btw. I actually laughed a few times for the first time in about a month.  I immediately felt like shit afterwards, I should not have allowed that, I cant feel positive things right now. When I start to feel like that it leads to my laziness. Pain and anxiety are the feelings that make me accomplish things.

Tonight, my Wife asked me if I could get a few days off in a row so she could go on a “business trip” with her friend. All the details were sketchy but she said it was around Binghamton which is very close to the PA border. I also know that her guy who she has feelings for travels to PA to visit his family. She told me it had to be a specific week and I know in my guy that it’s to see him, not a trip with her friend. He must be in PA that week and will drive up to meet her. I know my lies have cost me her and she is moved on but this hurts so bad. She is ready to go and be with him, and yes, I know they will have sex and that makes me sick to my stomach but what am I supposed to do about it? I want her to be happy, I truly so but this just hurts so bad.   She also lied to my face about it but with my history I guess that just makes us even.  Maybe she is trying to protect me by not telling me the truth, or more likely she knows that If she did tell me the truth I wouldn’t try to switch the shifts to make this work.  I honestly don’t know what to do, I can’t lie anymore so I will ask work but there is a huge part of me that hopes they tell me “no” they can’t do it.

60,"I've worked at the same place for about four years, and there has always been some tension between me and some of my coworkers about religious views, politics, racism, homophobia, etc. I'm as introverted as they come, and I know better than to bring up these topics in a work setting. Yet, almost every day I have to get these questions/rants regarding my personal views on these topics.

I consider myself a very nice person, probably too nice, and I'm definitely not known to be blunt or insulting. How do I address this situation without coming off as rude/petty or putting my job at risk by starting drama?

Here are some kickers: The company is pretty open about their religious views and try their best to incorporate it into our work environment and even some of our products, so going to the boss wouldn't be easy for me, and would make for an awkward conversation. More importantly, however, I cannot afford to get a different job because I get paid well over minimum wage here, and as a college student with debt, can't sacrifice a pay cut right now.

It's gotten to a point where I've been leaving work an hour early because I just cannot stand being around these people any longer, and I'm afraid I'll crack one day and quit on the spot, leaving me in a bad financial situation.

* My bro goes to a prestigious/preppy party uni, for which he's paid a bit of himself and got some minor scholarships but our parents have paid for the bulk of it + lodging and his car. Bro works part-time on campus, earns enough that he could rent a very cheap apartment with roommates if he didn't come home when he's off school-- which he's planned on doing for some time, as Bro's relationship with our parents has gotten too high over small things like emasculation and lack of freedom. 

* Parents still care deeply and continue providing for Bro despite tension, are confident they've raised him ""right"" with classic deep-South family morals and a good head on his shoulders. Bro can't wait to get away from them. 

* To be fair, I've always sided with him in regards to wanting to become independent and not rely on them for everything-- but Bro only seems to want the freedom.

* He's still a couple years off before he can graduate and truly start an independent life, otherwise he's still stuck relying on them for phone/car/insurance/student loans/etc.

* Bro's love life is a broken record: faux-Christian (not for or against religion personally, but a poser's a poser) girls tormented with family baggage that need him to be their white knight, they have him wrapped around their finger and driving a wedge between him and our parents until he catches them cheating and finally leaves. One guess for what this one's like. 

* We'll call her JoAnna.

* She's a bit younger than Bro, similarly reliant on family and halfway through college. Lots of emotional baggage, apparently abuse by a family member, but at the same time her family is a total traditional moral compass? And they're totally not wealthy or anything, but off the bat JoAnna buys him a PS4 and a freaking labradoodle puppy (which he can't bring home since our mom is allergic) while all he's done for her is cook a couple times. Hmm.

* JoAnna claims she has a condition with one of her ovaries that means JoAnna can't get pregnant -&gt; ""traditional moral paragon + infertile"" girl is pregnant within 3 weeks of their relationship. Hmm.

** /context. Now the real drama.**

* Bro drops the news bomb over phone 2 months into pregnancy, ""oh and btw my gf's pregnant."" Parents are distraught.

* Setting aside parents' shock at unmarried sex with less-than-a-month relationship, Bro adamantly defends decision to not use protection, despite STD-filled campus and questionability of JoAnna's claims.

* Parents give 3 options: abort, adopt, or grow up and move out. JoAnna says it's a miracle and the only chance she'll ever have at a baby, feels attacked because everyone else is like so happy for her. Bro sides with JoAnna, wants parents' full support since JoAnna's parents also pledged support.

* Parents don't want to throw relationship w/ Bro away, agree to give JoAnna and baby a chance on the condition that they keep the news private and especially don't announce on social media. Bro &amp; JoAnna agree.

* Fast-forward a couple months, JoAnna posts sonogram pics to Instagram. Parents' church friends' kids who follow them find out about pregnancy. Parents are emotional wrecks, they didn't want news to get out before they were ready to deal with it in their community.

* Bro defends JoAnna's right to share excitement with Insta friends, claims it's in fact the followers' faults for getting nosy... on Instagram. Says parents don't have any right to tell JoAnna what she can/can't post and accuse them of being selfish and making everything revolve around them. Asks why they can't focus on the good, or understand how hard it is for him and JoAnna.

* Parents are one step away from cutting Bro off completely, challenging him to come out with news to entire extended family, including me, while they prepare to face church of judgmental old people.

** /drama. Whoo boy.**

Bro apparently didn't want me to know about any of this until he tells me himself, but several family members already blabbed all this to me behind his back.

**Advice please:**

Bro will be opening up to me about the scandal soon, and I have no idea what I'll say to him. Before this we had always been very close (or so I thought before he told everyone in our family but me), but if I tell him what I think about this fiasco and he decides I'm against JoAnna (even when we first met I greatly disliked her, and she's done nothing to improve that impression) then I'm frightened that he'll choose her over me. I don't want to throw away our relationship like he did with our parents.

But if roll over and play nice kissing up to JoAnna, then I'm failing him as his big brother by not giving him the wake-up slap and guidance he needs now-- and even then, what advice could I possibly give him that he would accept?

**TL;DR Bro got brand new girlfriend pregnant and she's turning him against family, hasn't told me himself yet. When he opens up to me about it, how can I guide him without her turning him against me too?**

And I want to make it very clear that this is not a situation to be taken lightly by making fun of stereotypes about conservative Christian ideology or vice-versa, since that is a controversial subject especially in a political climate that's more polarized than usual. The core of the issue here is not extramarital sex or abortion, but the relationships at stake and how I can help salvage the stability of my little brother's future.",20Mar2017,2

74,"Hey Guys!

So heres my story right now in life. I quit my job for medical reasons back in September of last year. Ended up moving in with my Aunt and Uncle right after Thanksgiving when I couldn't afford to stay at my place any longer from not having a car or a job yet. 

After a couple of weeks there, my cousins helped me get a cheap $1200 car that surprisingly runs great. I got a job a couple weeks after that and things have been going great. 

My family doesn't charge me rent but have asked me to move out soon because of a variety of different reasons including but not limited to their Grandkids can't come stay the night as long as I am here. I've been here 3 months now so I understand. I also work nights so I am up at all times of the night and they are evidently light sleepers. Just found this out. 

Anyways in the time I have been here I have paid off 75% of my debt including my car and the remainder of the debts will be paid within the month. I really like how much money I am able to save without having to pay rent so I started looking at living in a car about a month ago. I have since found hundreds or thousands of others who already do this. With all the information out there about it, I have made a very concise plan of what i will need and how I will need to do it. 

Im very set in my mind to do this and will probably look into getting a van and becoming a vandweller sometime in the future. As well as save money I would like to start earning a living online and start traveling and living in different cities for a while. 

Also there are tons of things I have neglected health wise and other things because I did not have the money. This will allow me to do just that and accomplish quite a many goals that I have set for myself.

Ok the real reason I posted:

So early today I dropped the bomb to my Aunt and Uncle that I wanted to move into my car or maybe even get a tent for occasional stays(my car is a small 1990 toyota corralla sedan and I am 6'3"", Im ok with that and have some plans of modifying my car for better sleep arrangments plus storage and whatnot). They obviously want me to get a roommate and an apartment. They think I should get a second job and save with that, which I most likely will do anyways regardless plus try my hand at so freelance writing and web programming. They are very outraged about me choosing to want to live in my car because they were there to help me out for the last 3 months by staying with them. They said doing this will make them feel very small and like shit  because they have asked me to find another place. I have told them I have done thorough research into this and I have a very specific plan but they will not see reason. They are pissed at me because I would choose such a thing. Basically that I am being selfish and not willing to take their feelings i to account. I guess they feel responsible for my well being after helping me.

They will no likely tell the rest of my family, my cousins and Grandmother, and im sure they will most likely feel the same way.(I'm 26 and both of my parents passed away years ago so they are some of the only family I have left.)

I care alot about my family. Im not sure how to respond to this but I honestly will likely choose to live in my car anyways but they will most likely disown me, I feel. 

I am so tired of living in poverty and I want to get a nice nest egg going and take care of things Ive never taken care of before because of lack of money. I spent 3 years without a car and do not want to go back to that place again. Its hard to maintain your sanity when you can barely even go anywhere and have to rely on others all the time. In the long run I am bettering myself in so many ways including doing things I have always wanted to do such as travel and have more adventures. 

They do not see it that way at all though. They see me as basically becoming homeless and living in a dangerous and unruly situation. They have even gone as far to ask me what my mother would think of what I am doing if she were still here. She was like my best friend. I would like to think she wouldn't be thrilled about it but would encourage me to follow my heart. I will never know though so it ultimately doesn't really matter. 

Anyways having a difficult time with their reaction and would be great full​ for any advice or opinions that you might have. 

Thank you so much in advanced. I really love this community and I have learned so much from everyone on Reddit! Yall are awesome!",20Mar2017,6

77,"He says he doesn't think it's important and that he doesn't want people to know his personal information. I mean, I get if he didn't use social networking but the fact that he does and shares his name, location, former work history and high school history, etc makes me feel insecure. I feel like he doesn't want it to show us in a relationship because he may have other prospects, not because he doesn't like social networking (otherwise he wouldn't have it, right?) but he says I'm trying to take him out of his comfort zone and it doesn't matter if it says we're together or not. Am I crazy for putting too much stock into it or is he shady and trying to deflect? ",20Mar2017,5

83,"Okay so let me start off with a little back story. Me and..let's call him Calvin, dated for a short period of time. He helped me out of a situation I was in and I moved in with him. Things became a little rocky then we discovered I was pregnant. Hormones made it worse and we split up and I ended up moving out after a few months. Fast forward a little bit, I started dating someone else, let's call him David. Calvin was clearly pissed off and said some things so I cut most contact. He calls me drunk after a while and says he is now seeing a new girl, Violet. Not much longer after, we became civil again. We talked a lot. Decided that staying apart would be the best thing since we both kept arguing. 

Me and David moved in together. Calvin and Violet lived seperate and basically saw each other on the weekends. Our daughter was born, things were good between Calvin and I. Violet decided she didn't like that. She has two kids of her own from someone else. Several complicatons with her arose, starting from in the hospital. Our baby was admitted in the ICU and she was pissed that I wouldn't let her back to see my baby. Then more issues started when she wanted to bring her kids to my house when my daughter was barely 2 months old and I said I didn't want them around her yet since she was having health issues. It all escalated from there and she managed to completely manipulate Calvin into staying away from me and his child as much as possible so he could further cater to her.

Now keep in mind, when he was home, he would call me. We would talk about our daughter, talk about life, cut up, etc. Besides her, our relationship was fine. He drunkenly stated to me numerous times how all he wanted was a family. Out of anger sometimes he would get pissed off about David and say things about how he wishes he spent as much time with our daughter as he did, etc. Basically it was constantly made clear to me that he wanted us to be together which I know he did, I broke up with him and he never wanted that. 

Well when our daughter was only 4 months old, Calvin was killed. At this point, him and Violet had only been together approximately six months. Well in his obituary HER kids were added which kind of pissed me off. Now, only 4 months later she is going around like she doesn't even care. Making it very clear she is in a new relationship with someone else. Hasn't talked to me since new years to ask about her boyfriends daughter that she loved oh so much. And she gets all this pity from people. Everyone feeling sooo bad for her when I am the one stuck with having to raise my child with a dead biological father. Her and her mom even went to the extent of telling Calvins mom before the funeral even happened that they were going to try to get SSI for her kids and sue the guy who killed him to get them money. That isn't for them, it's for HIS daughter!! Also she sent me a screenshot from his phone with my name something like ""cunt face bitch whore"" or something and I know him WAY better than she does and I know damn well he wouldn't talk like that, ever. Especially not about me.

I don't know the whole situation just hurts me and pisses me off and I really can't stand her and the way she acts. It is obvious she never really loved him, she was just using him. I guess what I'm asking is, do I have a reason to feel this way? I'm grieving over the loss of him still. Of course I love my now fiance David, but Calvin is still the father of my only child. Feelings will always be there and I feel deep down in my heart that he loved me, despite what Violet has tried to tell me after the fact.


tldr; daughters dad died. 4 months later his girlfriend no longer cares and basically is a bitch. she gets pity and she doesn't even give a damn. do I have a right to feel anger towards this?",20Mar2017,1

Without failure there is no bar set for success, and with more failure comes more data gathered to ensure the potential success of the following experiment. Embrace your failings and your mistakes, let them guide you as you journey through this existence. Don't burden yourself with hindsight or the weight of ""what if""'s and ""could have been""'s, as they remove you from the ""whats next"". Look at the past not with envy or with anger, but with gratefulness for having experienced something if even only briefly.

89,"My best friend came to visit me over the weekend, and I'm not sure why but i go through periods where i can't be around anyone and it happened to be that time while she was here. i found myself judging her in ways i knew that i normally wouldn't and i just needed to be alone. sometimes it really does feel like I'm alone, i just hate talking about deep things and i hate sharing personal things about myself. Being around her this weekend made me hate her and myself. Im 18 with little to no sexual experience and it usually doesn't bother me but being around her deeply made me feel like shit about myself because she's so experienced. she's going through a breakup with her long term boyfriend and everything about it confuses me, i can't tell if its because my opinion is valid or my judgment is being clouded by the overwhelming feelings i can't name that follows me. she had been with him for four years and ended things in order to experience new things, which i understand and support, she even has been flirting and may have a crush on another guy. yet she and her ex are in constant communication and it feels like she's using him emotionally whenever she needs a crutch. and lately i just can't take talking to her or anyone else because it feels like something is pressing on my chest. i just need something in my life that i can't seem to be able to name. what the hell is going on with me?

He didn't even kiss my lips he like ate my face, I felt teeth, it was wet, there was tongue. I honestly did not know if he knew what he was doing and he has kissed people before. He like used his mouth instead of his lips and it was so aggressive. I wanted to pull away real quick but I gave him time because I did not know if he had like a problem or something during the start of the kiss. Like what do I do?

94,"So my boyfriend of 1.5 years was who I thought was the best guy kinda raped me a couple weeks ago. He's really sweet and has never been controlling, or rude or bad in general. Obviously he has flaws like any person, but no warning sign kind of things. Then one night we were both drunk (and he smoked weed too). He had wanted to have sex and I said no. He respected my choice, but then got mad and left to smoke with his friends. He never reacted like that before, but we were both drunk and I wanted to go to bed. He came back over later because I invited him over and said just to sleep because I was tired. My memory is a little fuzzy but I remember saying that no I didn't want to have sex, but he flipped me over and did it anyways. I said no and stop a few times but mostly I was just so drunk and sleepy that I did physically fight back.  I just laid there. After he finished I thought to myself, was I just raped? And almost asked him to leave but didn't. When I woke up next to him the next morning I couldn't even comprehend how my sweet boyfriend had done this and how our relationship would proceed. I told him what happened and he said he didn't remember but was mortified and has been supportive of whatever I need right now. I feel like I should break up with him, but I also still love him and we were both really drunk when it happened. We tried to have sex again and I was into it at first but during the middle I just couldn't do it anymore and was just frozen and he stopped right away. IDK what to do. I love him and we had such a great thing, but now I don't know if we can ever go back to that. I just feel so confused and I guess it was technically rape, but it's just not what I imagine rape being. I feel sad and alone in dealing with this because I don't want anyone to know what happened as I feel like they would judge me if I decide to stay with him, which I honestly think I want to stay with him. I just want to talk to someone about this but I feel like I can't. I told one friend but I don't want to go into all this detail with her. It's embarrassing that I have to make this choice and I feel as though I am disempowering myself if I stay with him. I don't understand why he did this. What should I do? ",20Mar2017,5
95,"A little bit of backstory:
I'm 17 years old and all of my past relationships have been awful. I wasted 3 years on and off on a white trash drug addict who used me for money, car rides etc. I consider my senior year to be my first year actually 'dating' considering the white trash girl wasted my time.

Here's the deal though. I never kissed a girl and hugged them maybe 5 times in my life. White trash girl never let me get close and never really seemed to care and I actually just let her do it.

The only 2 other relationships were just about as bad. The first girl never seemed like she wanted to have anything to do with me and never let me get close. The second broke it off before I could have any chance to make a move.

Them not letting me get close is only half the problem. The other problem is I get so nervous. I had all the interest in kissing them and being physically but I couldn't find myself to do it because I've always lacked the confidence. I'd try to be physical but I could never find myself able to do it and I would just completely freeze. 

I'm tired of being a pushover. It seems they all used me for one thing or another and were never really interested in the start.

Prom is coming up and I don't think I have the confidence to actually go and ask a girl. 

My 2 priorities are as follows
1. How do I gain enough confidence to be able to ask a girl out and be physical with her
2. How do I stop being a pushover",20Mar2017,1

98,"Background: I'm 17, almost 18 years old and my parents are from India, I was born &amp; raised in the USA and I am Hindu. I'm pretty American but also speak my language &amp; I'm relatively religious.

The thing about Hinduism is that there's nothing against pre-marital sex &amp; it isn't seen as a sin, rather the scriptures kinda say ""If you and your husband save it for each other, it improves the bonds you have with one another &amp; the relationship is taken to a different level"" or something along those lines.

Anyways I personally have no hangups about it, I wouldn't hate myself for doing it or anything. The only reason that I am concerned is bc I do want to marry a Red Pill kinda guy, the alpha male. And Red Pill states that the girls who are virgins are better for it, because they can delay the gratification. Call me an anti-feminist but I like the philosophy of Red Pill and how the roles of men &amp; women allow for the maximum benefits in a relationship. I want to be a doctor but if my husband didn't want that, then I would listen to him.

I want to get married by 22-25, and my parents (and me) want me to marry an Indian guy. If I'm not dating someone by that age, they would introduce me to some eligible guys they know, and we would go from there. The thing is that I'm scared that having sex with this guy that I'm kinda into at the moment might make me less eligible for the guys I want to marry in the future. What if they judge me for it? Especially being an Indian girl, it is a little difficult when you generally see Indian guys fucking around &amp; then judging girls who do the same.

Everybody says that I shouldn't go for men who would judge but what if all of the Indian alpha male guys do? Idk if I should save it or not, this one guy wants to be fwb and I reallyyy wanna do it with him :/",20Mar2017,4

107,"Bit of background. After graduating from university (I'm in the U.K.), I had some trouble finding a job in London. I was at home with my parents, getting super depressed about it all, and it sucked. Fast forward about 6 months and I finally land a job at a big company but it's in another quieter rural town... so I move out and start renting. Things go well, and before long, with some advice from my folks, I bought my own apartment two minutes away from work. 

Life was good; I was developing myself, I made loads of friends, and the people were incredible. I did this for two years, living alone. However, I felt like I'd stagnated a little and wanted a fresh challenge, so I started thinking about other opportunities. After all, the best employees have worked at loads of different companies, right?

Well... I got a job in London again. Moved back in with my folks and thought I'd wing it. I wanted to really forge a life for myself - go out and start dating, make some friends, really start making the most of living in a big city. 

Turns out, this is tougher than I thought. I've got an hour and a half commute into my workplace which means putting in any extra effort is tricky. I can't really work an extra half an hour or whatever because I'd be home super late. I've made no friends yet (though it's only been a week)... but there's a guy I know who works at the same place I do, who's looking for a roommate. 20 minutes walk away from work. 

The flat is near work but isn't near any sort of ""lively"" place.

109,"I'm not sure where to post this so I'll just put it here. Sorry if it's a long post but I really need to get this off my chest.

I'm starting to have a hard time growing up and really miss being  a child. I am currently in the last year of my study and following a 40-hour internship. If all goes well I will be done in a few months and 'ready' to start working. But the more I start transitioning into the adult life, the more I miss being a kid. It sounds sad but I really miss not having any big responsibilities, being able to hang out with friends at and after school, being ignorant about all the terrible things going on in the world and not having to spend my entire week working and being tired. 

When I started studying and living on my own I really enjoyed it. no parents complaining about gaming and watching tv too much or coming home too late. Deciding what to eat and what to spend my money on. Only having to go to school like half the hours of my middle school. It was awesome. But now the good days of studying are over.. I've grown lazy and unhappy.. Looking forward to getting a fulltime job and living in a world where ignorance and cruelty against animals and humans are common and accepted by many is just really depressing. It's just really hard to imagine becoming a happy person and I'm already looking forward to retirement. I'm currently in a relationship that has been struggling for over half a year and I feel really guilty because my girlfriend wants to be with me more then anything while I'm having a lot of doubt and losing the 'in love feeling'.

I can go on about what makes makes me unhappy but don't think that necessary. The things I still enjoy are nature (especially animals), gaming and hanging out with friends (though i'm seeing them less and less and I feel like I'm having a harder time acting social and happy when I'm around). As I mentioned earlier I really became lazy and tired. I try to exercise more and become more socially active but at the end of every day I come home, have to make and eat dinner and just feel like not doing anything so I usually watch (nature) documentaries, play league of legends or watch a movie and go to bed early.

Again, sorry for the long post.. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

So the situation is this, I have a crush on this girl who we will call Amy. Amy has told me she likes this other kid who we will call Jeff and amy also said that Jeff likes her back.

There is of course the possibility that she was not telling the truth, but since im not going to change what I plan on doing based on who she likes, im just going to assume she does like Jeff and jeff does like he back. 

So I want to tell her that I like her, but im happy with just being friends. I want to communicate to her that I like her but im not going to and neither do I want to get into the way of the relationship she is having with Jeff. 


This of course brings up the question of why I want to tell. Well its complicated, but personally I think I want to tell her because if she does like me (unlikely) then it would be awesome. If she doesn’t like me (the more likely scenario) then ill know and be able to (hopefully) move on.

112,"Hi, um, this is my first time posting here.
I have a friend who suffers from mental breakdowns and depression. A big fear of hers is disappointing people she cares about and them stopping all communication with her.

Now, for a few days, she's been having problems with her studies (we have college finals coming up in a few days), and has been unable to concentrate. Her family is dysfunctional to say the least- her father doesn't work anymore, her grandmother... the less said of her, the better and her mother supports the entire family.

Now, a few days ago, she decided to ask for her own room- she was hoping the privacy would help. The room is a small one where her father keeps his old documents and sleeps in sometimes. Her mother agreed, but her father flipped out, said a lot of hurtful comments and has stopped talking to her for the past four days, even with her mom and my prodding. 
She's hurting with anxiety and I'm terribly scared of what she might do. She's already sleep-deprived and I'm... I'm just scared for her that's all. She has a tendency to cut herself and I don't want to see her hurt. Her father is being consistently hard-headed and refuses to listen to reason.

115,"So I'm 20, going to University, and having some troubles in my relationship and life. Trying to decide who I want to be. I;m not sure how much advice I'm looking for here, I feel like a lot of this is just something I want to get off of my chest and get some reassurance on.

I was raised by my mom, her and her whole family are strong Pentecostal Christians, so, naturally, I've always tried to believe. For as long as I can imagine, however, I have never really been able to fully convince myself to believe, I have always doubted and if a stranger had asked me at any point, I would have probably just said I am an Atheist or Agnostic. Anyway, in grade 11 of highschool I met another Pentecostal girl in my grade that I liked and sure enough, we started dating. She was the first girl I ever asked out, and coming close to 4 years later, we are still together. Our relationship made my mom and family happy and kept me motivated to keep trying. We get along pretty well, though we don't share very many interests and I certainly love her, but I don't know if I would want to marry her, with or without the problems in beliefs.

Anyway, as a 20 year old, I have been spending a lot of time looking at my future and who I want to be. I have tried to be a christian for long enough that I am frustrated and very ready to give up. But at the same time, I am having some issues. I support my girlfriend in her faith, and don't want to do anything to pull her away, so I would have to break up with her, and we have discussed this. She knows my troubles and agrees that she wouldn't want to be with me if I was not a Christian. But yeah, as my first girlfriend, my girlfriend of 4 years, and someone I love, it would really hurt to let her go.

And our only problems aren't solely faith-based. As stated earlier, we share very little in common, I feel like we spend very little time doing things we can both enjoy. And perhaps this is because for much of the time we have spent together, she was unemployed and I was in University and working two jobs, but she would often feel ignored as I was caught up in school and work, and I still wanted time to myself to play games with my friends. She came across as needy a lot because of this, and because she has few good friends and her family situation isn't fantastic. Much of the time we would talk about stuff, she would be talking negative about her situations and I noticed myself starting to avoid opening her messages at times.

Despite all of this, I still worry about staying with her because, as she is my first and only girlfriend, I don't really know what else is out there, I'm scared that what I have with her is actually really hard to come by. I also really love and care about her, because she doesn't have many friends, her family situation isn't very good, and there have been suicide attempts in her family, I'm really worried about how she will get along without me. I am also worried about disapproval from my mom's side of the family. And I know that at least part of her is going to feel like a failure as her only child gives up on the faith she so firmly believes in. 

---

That's about it though, I just feel like I'm on the cusp of a big choice for what my future will be like. Sorry if that was super rant-y or anything, even just typing that out helped to calm my nerves about everything a bit. So yeah, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for as advice in this, just some reassurance or ways to make this go a bit easier would be much appreciated though. 


Thanks",20Mar2017,2

My parents barely lived togheter because after my dad went to prison for the 3rd time when I was 5, my mom separated with him and left him on his own. They were fighting literally every week from when I was 6 to 14 years old, at 14 my dad overdosed and went into coma. 
I was in depression for about 2years or something, maybe longe. I honestly dont know, but I've heard that I was in depression at least, didn't know I was really but I can see why they said it now.

I met my gf when I was 16 and she made my life much better, but now I see that it honestly doesnt look bright. At least not my future, I failed so many subjects in school. I wont graduate with a real degree and it jsut feels shit now.

125,"I am 20 years old student at university. My parents are divorced. 

I live with my mother and 2 siblings, one of whom is obsessed with buying and the other is obsessed with going out and spending money in anyway possible.

Last year I was in army doing my mandatory service. My mother received a govemental grant(?) Not sure if its right word. Because I had been in the army. Total 4200 euros during my service. I had become suicidal and barely made it through. Throughout my service I wanted to just call it quits but my mother begged me to stay and said that we needed the grant and part of it would become my laptop for university. 

University comes no laptop no financial help to buy one. IPhone 7 gets released and everyone helps my sister find 200 euros to buy it upfront while I literally begged for help to buy myself a laptop.

In the meantime my brother bought over 5 games for ps4 resulting in over 300 euros.

Both of them don't fair well at school, are irresponsible and act like brats wanting more and more.

Now I can get a government grant for my studies and I can also get the money for the laptop back. But my mother will be getting it in her account.

I can already see what will happen 700 of that will go to my sister's trip to Greece. All that while she barely gets C in school.

Yes I understand that there might be needs and I am more than glad to help but in all honesty taking the grant in her bank account is not right and there are simply to excuses for this behavior.

126,"Okay, so this I going to be somewhat hard to explain, please excuse my explanation.

To start off, I have a friend that I've known for a good 6-7 years, and for those amount of years, it was a solid friendship. But as most of us know, sometimes friendships eventually fade.
For the last two years of the 'friendship', he has been very annoying, the first of which is him just always wanting to hang out, and I'm not talking 1-2 times a week...I'm talking at the least 4 times a week.

Then when I do say ""Not today bro"" or something like that he complains like a big baby, when I do bring the topic up he uses the excuse ""But you're the only friend I have, I can't go anywhere else unless it's hanging with you"".

About a couple of months ago he did something really f**king stupid, not going to say what he did specifically... but I will say that it involve telling me a very important secret that he should not have said.
It involves the passing away of someone, this really pissed off the person that told him to keep the secret, and when I found out he should have shut his trap it pissed me off too.

So after some thought, i told him that I had enough of his s**t and stop being friends, but it seems people who didn't really know him think I was being dumb and should be friends with him... so after much peer pressure, i started being friends with him.
Now I'm starting to regret it, what is the best advice you can give about this situation?

I am a female, 33 but I look 25, fairly attractive (7.5/8), skilled in various fields (visual arts, fitness/personal training, coding, starting and running small businesses). I take a good care of myself: hair, make up, stylish clothes and I'm fit. I've traveled the world and moved to my dream place in California. I have awesome, interesting, talented friends who run successful businesses and fulfilling careers. The money game does nothing for me. I'm not interested in getting 4 mansions and a yacht. I've started a couple of businesses that now basically run on their own but I don't feel like expanding. I've only started them as an experiment to get passive income so my basic needs are covered.
I have various hobbies (playing music, video games, studying subcultures, fashion...) but nothing makes me want to wake up in the morning. I also have no interest in charity work. I don't have a significant other and I don't think this is the right time to find one. As the saying goes, if you're bored then you're boring. I also don't want kids.
I've read a lot of motivation/find your purpose books but I still feel nothing. I've tried spirituality too, studied a bunch of religions just for fun, hoping to find some meaning. I've also tried to remember my hobbies as a child but I got what I wanted from it a long time ago already.

135,"I've always been a loner.. Other people's company is like a drug fix. I need it every now and then, but not in between. And while I'm alone, I usually stick to my computer and some food to go with it while I'm watching some show or browsing online. This keeps me content, mostly. I occasionally smoke and drink, which is pretty fun too. Again, mostly alone.

A couple of weeks ago, I got diagnosed with pancreatitis. This means I can pretty much never touch most of the foods I like the most (need to avoid fat and fried food) like burgers, pizzas, or even regular outside food like fried rice, soft drinks, biscuits, cakes. Even most home foods which I like are now off limits. Pretty much everything nice in today's world of food is either fried or contains fat. I never overate, I'm 6 feet, 170 pounds, pretty agile and energetic.

Because of this, the past couple of weeks has gotten increasingly duller and more depressing every time I have to ask the vendor for foods which have only been boiled, or every time I pop a pill with the pancreatic enzymes. I used to love saving money so I can blow it at once in a fancy restaurant, or travel somewhere and survive on whatever's available.

This disease has anchored me severely and stops me from enjoying myself the way I want to. And I can't seem to find other ways to have fun. The no-booze-or-cigarettes condition sucks too, but not as much as the no-good-food part. **What do I do?**

141,"My wife and I bought our first house about a year ago, it's duplex, so there's a shared wall.  For about the first six months, the neighbors were fine, as far as noise goes.  Then, abruptly, the woman started yelling at her husband almost every other day.  I can't call them fights because they sound extremely one-sided, and they're over seemingly petty things.  I'm pretty sure she was yelling at him about the color of socks at one point.  They're spectacularly loud and hostile fights.  They're loud enough to have woken me up on multiple occasions.  And some times they happen two to three times a day, throughout the day.  He works overnight, so she must deliberately wake him up just to yell at him.

She's blind, doesn't work, they're older, and my assessment is that she is deliberately trying to run him out of the house, or antagonize him to the point where he'll haul off and hit her, so she can have the police take him away.  I'm honestly very surprised this hasn't happened considering the amount of verbal abuse he puts up with without hardly ever raising his voice, and while working full time, and doing a reasonably good job of supporting the two of them.  She calls him a punk, bully, child, mother fucker, bitch, faggot, questions his manhood... just really nasty stuff that no one should have to put up with.

I don't want to get involved, but I'm unemployed, so I'm always around, and I suffer from severe chronic depression, so it affects me, and makes getting better, feeling better, and functioning more difficult.  I don't really have the means to just go to a cafe to get away from it, nor should I have to do that.

It gets loud, but I don't believe it's ever constituted a domestic disturbance.  There hasn't been anything physical or destructive, no verbal threats of violence, just the woman trying to instigate a physical fight.

And smoking drastically increases the chances of getting cancer whereas the other two do not enough have evidence to prove the claim.

After this break up, he also looked her up during a national party event, stood in front of her with disgusting dominant eyes, saying ""Who's the boss here now"". She just walked away.

It's been about 5 weeks, and now he started texting her foul questions, such as ""Are you over me yet?"" ""Did you keep all our pictures together?""
I told her to tell him he's got some nerve, texting her. But she said she just can't be a bitch to him and just had a 'fun' conversation with him, asking how he is doing, etc.

I got so fucking furious... During their relationship I warned her, and still now she won't listen nor realize it. So I told her this. ""If you go back to him, our friendship will be over.""

158,"I need some advice and insight. Apologies in advance for the fractured writing / grammar. Here's some background:

I've had a relatively privileged upbringing. I had parents who were willing to support my education at any cost. I worked hard throughout high school, and ended up being admitted to a top private school. Despite all this, I took many things for granted. I encountered some personal issues going into my freshman year and ended up becoming a stoner for a short period. In hindsight, I was depressed, lost my motivation, and changed drastically. I became a little more introverted, ""gave up"" in school despite maintaining decent grades. 

I essentially entered a state of mind that left me apathetic for much of college. I had positive influences and my friends were all hard workers but the problem was that, despite knowing the right thing to do (working hard, recruiting for top level jobs, socializing, exploring new passions) I spent a lot of my time doing nothing. I KNEW what was right but I couldn't get myself to do any of it and it made me more depressed at the time. I think I dealt it relatively well because I still managed to form and maintain many friendships (was quite popular), and took care of my body with diet and exercise. I was aware of the imbalances in my brain and was also aware the extent that my diet and lifestyle had on my emotions. Still, I abused xanax for a brief period, had a very abnormal sleep cycle for most of college, and just made generally poor decisions. This all weighed pretty heavily on my conscience.

Despite all of that, I managed to attain an internship my junior year of college, and secured a full-time job that I wasn't even satisfied with. The pay was decent but not the best (top finance / engineering, etc) and not close to what all of my friends were all getting at least. This was also huge source of stress for me. I had no confidence in myself and couldn't even bother interviewing at these places and knew that I had only deserved a mediocre job (relative to those) at the time. In hindsight, I was totally capable of doing so but I convinced myself otherwise...

Fast forward to now, i'm working that same job that I received an offer for in college and I couldn't be more miserable. My pay is great for most millenials, I don't have any HUGE student loans (scholarships, some support from parents, etc). Since graduating, I've eradicated most of my poor habits. Aside from a few nights out every once in awhile, I sleep and wake up early, I meditate, I eat very healthily, and I spend most of my free time with my family and close friends. I'm aware of what's important at this point in my life but I can't help but feel that my time here is being wasted. I've saved up enough to live jobless for a few months and am looking to devote that time to search for something either more lucrative or interesting. 

The thing is, my dissatisfaction with this job has less to do with the job itself and more to do with the fact that I'm not reaching my full potential. I'm neither amazing nor bad at my job but it's something that I have no interest in. I keep convincing myself that if I were to quit and make unemployment my full time job, I could be learning so much more. I want to seize this opportunity before I have to face ""real"" adult obligations. I want to find what I'm actually good at now that I've dug myself out of my previous, college-lifestyle-induced, state. 

However, I remind myself of how privileged I am and am disappointed in myself for feeling entitled enough to even consider quitting. There are people out there who would kill for my job and comfortable lifestyle. Everytime I reach a breaking point in this job, I end up convincing myself that I'm just being a pussy (which I know I am). After all, 99% of the people out there have it worse than I do; bound to their careers and lifestyles by their financial, familial obligations. I'm very aware of this and i'm grateful for my life. I'm also aware that the world owes me nothing and that I have to work for it but I eventually want to end up in a career where I feel like i'm genuinely creating value for something. Am i to blame for wanting to quit and seize the chance that I have to enter this new lifestyle? 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to make the most of what's been given to me. I fear complacency and don't want to grow old with regrets. Please point out any flaws or inconsistences in my thinking. I need to know where I'm wrong.",20Mar2017,1
159,"So I have always been a good kid. I never drank, smoked drugs or came home late. Now that I am in college I want my freedom but my dad refuses to let go. The biggest offense is my car. I was not allowed to bring my car to college as much as I tried and he kept telling me ""if you do well we will think about it"" long story short it is the end of the year and he is still thinking about it. I talked to my Godparents about it and apparently he is planning to ""surprise me"" with my car like 4 weeks before the end of the year, which means he will be paying 300$ for parking for 4 weeks when it could of been the entire semester. The even larger outlying problem is he won't allow me to work on my own car because he thinks I don't know how, but the reason he thinks I don't know how is because he never let me work on my car! 

So here we are, at the end of the semester, I don't have my car, and even when I do, my dad won't let me do with it what I want, so here is my idea, I want your advice on it: 

    I am planning to buy a project car and keep it at my moms house for the rest of the school year and part of the summer (without telling my dad). It costs me 1000$, and the only reason my dad doesn't want me to buy one is because he thinks I won't know how to get it running (I do). So if I can fix it up, then drive it to his house (where I stay over the summer), I don't think he will be too mad, permitted I pay insurance and registration, which I can. 

My biggest fear is that he won't allow me to have my regular car at college next year because he will be pissed that I bought the project car. I'm afraid he will say ""oh you have a new car now, you don't need this one"".  I don't want the project car to be a daily driver and I was planning to just un-insure it and keep it garage kept when starting school next year, so I can save money to work on it. 


Is it really too much to ask? I would be paying for it every penny.

160,"So my ex just ended our 5 year relationship the other day. On the surface we were happy and spent a lot of time together but we had underlying issues (communication, trust, getting along with family and friends) that weren't getting resolved and we were unwilling or unable to address. These issues came to a head and she initiated the break up and after giving it some thought I realized it was for the best and agreed to separate. I asked her if she would be open to being friends after some time and she said she would be willing to try it and that she hoped that I wouldn't be furious with her and never talk to her again. Part of me has thought that maybe we would have been better off as friends rather than a couple but from what most people have said staying friends with an ex is a poor idea.

Last week, I left a room to go to the bathroom and walked in him asking her for a hug and she accepted. I don't know why he asked her for one. To me, it always seems like he's making excuses to touch her whether it be her hand, leg, or hair. 

I'm afraid to bring it up because I feel like I'd look like a crazy girlfriend, but I can't help it. Since I'm his girlfriend I feel like I should be the only one he touches that way. E and S are friends but he never does anything like that to his other female friends. He liked S before we started dating so that only worsens what I'm feeling.

173,"Hi there,

In the last year or so, there's been a large influx of spam phone calls to my cell phone.  They're always from different locations in the US, and occasionally long numbers that I presume are international numbers.  On the occasion that I answer, there are a few possibilities: a hang up, a robot congratulating me on some manner of win, or a robot informing me that my small business has been approved for some manner of loan (I do not own a small business).

I've long ago put my number on the Do Not Call registry, but that's clearly not working anymore.  Blocking numbers does nothing since the numbers change every time.  Of course I can screen calls for numbers that I *do* know, and all others can leave a message, but that's not always a good solution when anticipating a call from an unknown number, or just because random calls come in at inconvenient times.

Is there something that I can do?  Is my phone number compromised in some way and I need to change it?  Do I just have to deal with this bullshit?",20Mar2017,2

178,"This whole thing started about five years ago when my dad was traveling to Mexico for his job at the time. He ended up dating some waitress down there for a time, and eventually he admitted it to all of us (me, my mom, and my sister). We were pissed, upset, and we worked through it. My parents did marriage counseling.

Shortly after the marriage counseling ended and I thought things would get better, I started to notice my parents buying beer quite frequently. I asked if we were having a party the first time I noticed it, and my mom said nope. I knew something was up.

Within the next year, I noticed a sharp decline. My dad would go to work, come home with beer, usually a 24-pack. At first, this would take them two days to go through. But eventually, my mom started drinking while my dad was AT work, and by the time he got home, they would be out, and he would go right back up to the corner store for another case. 

Fast forward to more recently. Before the new year started, my sister revealed that she was pregnant. Her and my brother-in-law told me first at a family reunion, and then made a public announcement. This was great news, obviously, as I've always wanted to be an uncle, and my parents wanted a grandchild. At our New Year's Eve party, my mom said that she was done drinking after the New Year started, claimed the grandchild is her inspiration for this (that's great but it should be your health that motivates you). Well this non-drinking lasted for about a month. Today (it's 12:55 PM as of posting this) she is already at least tipsy, and my sister is coming over to do  laundry. I woke up around 11:30, come out to the kitchen to see her like this. My sister has already stated that she doesn't want her daughter to have alcoholic grandparents and has made this very clear. I know she is going to be upset that there is an obvious lack of progress on that front, and it bothers me too, having to live with this. 

Please, help me. I don't know what to do. My niece will be here in May and I want her to have a stable family she can rely on. My family used to be so easy-going, so happy and full of life. I don't know what happened. We need to fix this somehow. :(",20Mar2017,2

When we first moved into our new home, everything was great. We have our own place, our own privacy. She then wanted to get a dog. Which I am on board with because I love dogs. Brought the idea up to my father and he just simply asked that we wait until after our wedding. He said he's waiting until after our wedding to get a dog of his own so if we could just please wait.

Saturday comes around and he sent me a text saying heads up a dog might be coming home with him. I wasn't happy about it but I had to explain it to my fiancée. Now she's saying I am on my side with my father because he got a dog first and it's like a kick to the face because she's being told to wait. 

My father recently found out he is a diabetic,  within the past 2 months. Determined to loose weight and his diabetes, he got the dog to keep him motivated to go on walks and do some exercising. 

Our wedding is in 6 months and after the wedding we can go adopt a dog. My father never said we cant have a dog, just worry about the finances that come along with the wedding. And I can agree with that. Now my future wife is saying I dont have her back or support her. I've been with her since 2009 and always had her back even if she was truly wrong.  

I understand shes upset and feels like shes been betrayed, but at the same point, I understand why my father got a dog earlier then expected. Like I told my fiancée, 6 months is not a long time! 

We've had numerous talks about this and they turn into arguments. Its like she's become self centered and I cant figure out why. This is the basic run down, and any advice would be great. Thanks and it is much appreciated!

There's lot that I truly love in my job, but there's more and more that I'm finding getting in the way. It's starting to feel more and more unfulfilling where the cons are overriding the pros.

I’ve (F 32) been working a menial job as a favor to my boss for over a year (someone quit unexpectedly and I was the only person who had been previously cross-trained for this role. She asked if I would do it so that she could forego the hiring/training process on such short notice and I agreed).

 I went from being in a challenging, (albeit, a temporary, four year assignment) comprised of writing technical documentation to copying and pasting generic email responses to displeased customers. I’ve discussed it with my boss on multiple occasions; she knows how unhappy I am, but there “isn’t anything she can do about it” right now. She always apologizes and promises that I’ll be offered another more challenging position “soon”. Aside from this, the original plan was to be given a promotion to database maintenance after the completion of this software project, which finally happened in January.

Despite this, I’m still staring at customer service emails. I should also mention that I was performing both jobs up until January (prepping technical documentation and answering consumer complaints). It has been a highly stressful and unhappy situation.

I’ve been here for almost 10 years and have worked myself up to a good wage and gained a lot of experience in the realm of customer service. All of my advancements beyond customer service have been based solely on the fact that people notice the work that I do and what I am capable of.

Staying in this position is seriously affecting my mental health. I’ve been having panic attacks in the office. I had to start taking Prozac back in September to deal with the depression and anxiety. I seriously consider giving my notice without having something else lined up, however I make significantly more than my husband and carry the health insurance which is important to keep because our daughter has medical issues. It would be selfish to leave, but it is killing me to stay. I need to get out. I just want to slip out the back door, get in my car and never look back. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of and that my only option is to resign myself to this situation.

I’ll be graduating with my B.S. in Communications in May – another stressor. I’ve been applying to other companies relentlessly to get out of my situation without avail. Everyone wants the degree in hand first. Jobs that don’t require a degree do not pay close to what I make now. I’ve been networking the crap out of myself. I’ve created an online portfolio (I’m also a photographer &amp; graphic designer) – I’ve been cold-calling businesses and organizations…and the well is currently dry. No one has anything appropriate for my skill set.

Ultimately, I’d like to be able to create revenue from freelancing (writing, photography, graphic design) as well as from a website I’m going to be launching in the next few weeks which will be for local artists to network, have exhibits reviewed, have their work featured, and find new calls for art. This makes me think that I should just take the plunge and figure this out instead of finding new employment. The only thing standing in the way is money.

Anyway…has anyone found themselves in this position? Did you leave? If you did, how did you survive without a steady income? Were you able to turn your hobbies or passions into a steady income in a reasonable amount of time? I just don’t know which direction to take.

Tl;dr – I need to get out of my current employment situation ASAP but have had difficulty finding something comparable. I don’t just want to HAVE to leave, but the anxiety and depression are becoming too much.",20Mar2017,1

214,"Me and my girlfriend recently moved into an apartment together. This isn't the first time I've lived on my own, but I've always moved in with people after they had already been there. So this is technically my first time managing a huge chunk of the moving process. I feel comfortable with money and bills, and living with my girlfriend, but for some reason I feel anxious about our apartment being unsafe. I grew up in the town our apartment is located in, but I left for a few years because the town was just going to shit. So moving back after these years, I can only think of the increasing drug problem, and crime in general. My apartment is located on the second floor, and the door has a dead bolt, but that's it. I've had no reason to suspect it's unsafe, although I've yet to really meet my neighbors. I think we live in a safer part of town, and my father has lived (and currently lives) in this complex for a few years, although he keeps guns in his apartment so I feel like his opinion of ""safe"" and mine, might be different. I'm also nervous about my girlfriend being home alone, and both of us have had trouble falling asleep. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've never felt this way when moving into a new place before. Is this something a lot of people go through? Will it pass? Any advice is appreciated.

tl;dr Me and my gf moved into a new apartment. Not my first time living along but I feel anxious and worried about safety even though I've been given no reason to feel unsafe yet, other than the fact the town has been increasingly getting worse when it comes to crime. Is this normal? What should I do? ",20Mar2017,1
215,"I am a medical provider (specialist) in a smallish town. When I moved here several years back I went to a primary care doctor for these issues but chickened out about discussing it at the last minute, so I just told him I wanted a check up. I did briefly mention the anxiety I was having. But since I'd just moved by myself and started a new job he told me to join some groups, make friends, join a gym, get some exercise, that kind of thing. I didn't take it as dismissive, he said if we needed to discuss it further we could but I think he chalked it up to me going through a lot of change.

I knew at the time that it wasn't going to get better, I've been going through this for a while now. I have trust issues, plus I'm a very private person so I just didn't feel right at the time about telling him more since it was our first meeting. I've been wanting to go back but since then I've become afraid that this will be damaging for my career or professional relationship. We see a lot of the same patients, he refers his patients to me sometimes. I know he is a professional too and sees this quite a bit but it still makes me feel uneasy. I'm having a lot of bad feelings of people finding out about it, him not referring patients to me anymore, and also just what he'll recommend to me as treatment. 

I know I'm being paranoid but I guess I'm just asking for guidance from anyone who has gone through this before. What to expect, that kind of thing... I feel like the more I know or the better I feel about it the more likely I'll be to go. ",20Mar2017,3
216,"The ending of this thread title should be enough but unfortunately it's not so I am reaching out for advice to help me stop drinking. I am currently at a point in my lift where the consumption of alcohol is hurting me and I know it but I still have this desire everyday to drink even as I sit here writing this having discomfort in my abdomen. I have been drinking pretty heavily for the past 3-4 years I am currently drinking around 6-9 IPA's a day and those normally are in the 8-9% abv range. Starting around November last year I started to notice I was having really bad anxiety, panic attacks and found my hands really shaky after drinking a lot the night before. I then started to develop a discomfort in my abdomen I dealt with it for a while and kept on drinking but finally on New Years day the pain was really bad so I decided to go to the ER. After several test they came back and told me pretty much what I feared that I was damaging my liver and was turning into fatty liver. They they told me my live enzymes where pretty high and to stop drinking and follow up with my family DR. Normal range for ALT is 1-41 and AST 1-40 mine at that time was ALT 187 AST 163 which scared crap out of me and that fear helped me stop that night.

Since the ER also told me I had a slight kidney infection but did not give me an antibiotic I followed up with my family DR who retested me a week later and the ALT and AST was still high and my Bilirubin levels had went up which is what was making my urine look like I had a kidney infection. Because of this he tested me from Hepatitis which came back negative so he then sent to me a liver DR for further testing. By the time I got in there I had stuck to it and still was not drinking so the first labs he pulled from me I was at ALT 111 / AST 74 and Bililrubin 1.8 so he told me to come back in 3 weeks and we would test them again. My last labs came back great ALT 34 / AST 30 and Bilirubin 0.8 so the DR told me everything was normal and he did not need to do any additional test but to stay away from alcohol unless it was 1 drink. A few pass and for some reason I decided I really wanted to get some Bells Hopslam and swore to myself I would only get one six pack but here we are now 4 weeks later and I have been back to my normal ways drinking 6 - 9 beers a day. I am an idiot I had these beat I was lucky and never had any withdrawl symptoms my body was feeling great and the anxiety and panic attacks I had been having went away but for some reason I just had to drink. Starting early last week I started to notice the pain coming back as well as the shakiness and its gotten worse everyday.

So here I am today asking for advice from anyone who has gone through this on what you did to overcome it. I can already say AA is not an option I have tried it before and it was not for me I have thought about going to a medical detox but I am afraid if I do I will get fired from my job which I cannot afford to do. Everyday I wake up and tell me self I am going to quit and slowly as the day goes on I get that thought in my head that I can have 1 more 6 pack and I will stop tomorrow. I am the king of excuses and I constantly lie to myself I know I am killing my liver and I don't want to die from this but I feel I don't know what to do.

Presentations. I avoid at all costs. I have anxiety disorder and I am seeing a therapist. It is a real thing, has been my whole life. I skip classes. Absences hurt my grade.

226,"Hi all, I shall try to keep this as short as possible.

- I am 20, living with parents, studying STEM sciences

- after years of planning I have recently rescued a horse

- I am a beginner/intermediate rider

- normally older rider, younger horse, and younger rider older horse but I was naive and got a younger horse with hopes to grow *with* him... big mistake

- horse was very underweight, lovely, calm and manageable at the time

- now horse is healthy again he has become too much of a horse for me with his new found strength and energy 

- he is too dangerous for my level of skill and I am having trouble admitting that to my parents, he bucks and bolts and tears, characteristics I have never encountered before, 

- I paid for the horse initially (upwards of 1k), but my mother and I share the horse's rent (450£/month) and my mother paid for the exportation costs (also upwards of 1k), she has never ridden him as he was too much for her from the get go (ex race horse) but has done groundwork with him and likes his companionship but she is a bit scared of him

- my dream was a project horse for the summer but I got too much of a project, now I regret which horse I chose

I have no idea what the right thing to do now is. I made a big mistake for a hobby that involves another animals life. I care for this horse greatly but I feel like I need a more forgiving and older animal so that I don't ruin this one. He needs a few years of training to bring him to the level I thought I could over the summer. 

Do I sell him and try again? Do I sell him and not try again? Do I keep him and keep on trying and risk injury to him and me?

What should I do?

230,"(Long but necessary story alert, TL;DR at the end if you're more into that)

So, I'll start with a little bit of backstory. A and I are ""co-workers"", and we have been for around 6 months. I put it in speech marks because it's hard to explain and a very specific situation that would give too much away. We work together full time, and every day we have a different third ""co-worker"". Before I started work with him, I met a lot of mutual friends and his previous full time ""co-worker"", all of whom informed me that he is engaged to be wed (and they are all going to the wedding), so I knew that before I met him. Obviously I didn't have any reason at this point to envy them - I didn't know him or his fiancée! Anyway, so, he is lovely, we are both outgoing and have similar personalities so became close friends very quickly. Especially with sharing an environment together more than we see our own families, we tell each other anything and everything about our lives and I've helped him with relationship advice. We also chill out of work, have been on nights out and things like that (and no, nothing sinister, his fiancée has always come with us and I've gotten close with her too, especially while drunk!) and we are constantly planning more. About 4 months into the friendship I was feeling a bit miffed that I wasn't going to his wedding, especially as he talks about it to me and mutual friends all day every day, more so the closer it gets. But, I thought, its understandable - they didn't know me when they sent out the invites, they will probably only have invited close friends and family, there might be number limits. However I also at this point found out through my own different conversations that he has invited all of the people in our company building - yes, all, even the cleaners, and a hell of a lot of people who work at the sister companies that we work with some days. A lot of these mutual friends barely know the couple, perhaps they were a third co-worker a few times, and are feeling obliged to go because ""everyone else is"". This made me sad but I got on with it, but the absolute icing on the cake was when I found out he had invited his previous co-worker, who he tells me neither of them can stand, he wouldn't be seen dead with outside of work even then, is relieved to be rid of and never wants to see again. I also learned the couple invited several people last week - last week! - that again neither of them can stand nor are close to or have known a long time but felt they had to for some reason. This is when it reached awkward point, but it seems for me only. Everyone knows we are close friends, some mutual friends have even assumed I am also going and have started asking me which hotel I am staying at - only to have the awkward as hell topic change when I say I am not invited, and I have to pretend like it doesn't bother me. He is still talking about it to me. He discusses plans for the day with our third co workers, while I am involved in the conversation, for hours and doesn't even stop for a minute to think how awkward it might be for me sitting there (even a mid-flow ""what's up with you?"" ""nothing"" ""something clearly is"" ""no it's nothing"" cycle). Even after I've dropped hint after hint. I talked to a mutual friend and third co worker who is very close to both of us as she works with us often and she has known him a similar time to me. She didn't even know I wasn't going! She said ""maybe there were limitations on numbers"", but clearly not if he can invite any Tom, Dick and Harry off the street (hundreds of people work at our company alone, not to mention the sister ones). Should I get her to casually pretend in a conversation with him that she assumes I'm going, so he will correct her and give her an answer she can relay back to me? I wouldn't be so upset if he said ""I would have invited you but I didn't know you when the invites were sent out (hasn't stopped him sending recent ones)/there are number limitations/no blondes are allowed"" or something like that so he would have at least acknowledged me as a potential guest. 



TL;DR: not invited to close friend &amp; co-workers wedding, people he hates and barely knows are, still feels free to discuss his wedding plans with me, mutual friends are confused I'm not invited.

My siblings have all witnessed divorce, but for as long as I've been alive my parents have been together. I don't care if they get divorced if that's what they want. My problem is this:

I visited my parents last weekend and my mom asked me to take a pic of her for her FB profile. Apparently I had her phone for too long taking pictures because she said ""what are you doing? I have stuff on there I don't want you to see."" I said aloud ""welllll that's weird but okay"" thinking she'd say something like oh it's your birthday present or whatever. Nope. She just looked super guilty. Immediately that felt wrong because my mom never acts like that. This is what started it. So I text a family member I'm close with and tell them what happened. They say that my mom has been acting very weird and paranoid. We kind of jokingly hypothesize a scenario with her cheating with all kind of people. I choose the worst scenario because I always think the worst. 

My mom has been planning to come back with my SO and I, which is a long drive. The entire time I'm texting my family member and telling her how my mom is acting. My mom has her font on her phone set to billboard size because she's farsighted so I can easily read her texts over her shoulder. Lo and behold she's texting the guy I said in the scenario. 

My parents are best friends with a couple, but a couple months ago the wife passed to cancer. They do everything together. The dead wife's name is even still in the text title. My dad is best friends with the husband. The texts I was reading between my mom and this guy were just weird. Saying they love each other and such. The worst part is that every time they text my mom would immediately delete them. She never deleted anything. She probably still has texts on her phone from when she first got it. This is very very unlike her. Not only that but she slept with her phone in her hand and when it got dark she started hiding her phone under her jacket to text. Super shady. The worst part is they were talking about my dad. Saying about how the guy should invite him out with friends and such. Like what the fuck? Three of my family members know now and they think I'm right. One wants me to confront her and one doesn't. They think she used me to come here and get away from my dad so she could have privacy to screw around. But it's my dad!  I've never had to deal with this. I have no idea what to do. Confront her? Tell my dad? I'm afraid if I tell my dad and he kicks her out she'll try to live with me and I do not want that. I have no idea how to deal with this so please give me advice and perhaps some experiences. Just FYI though my mom is like clinically crazy so she may react unexpectedly. I'm sorry this is written so poorly but I'm kind of freaking out.

241,"I met a girl online around September of 2016. We've known each for over a year now and we've been getting closer and closer over the months we've been talking. I was mainly interested in her as I felt like I could open up to her at the start. I suffered with paranoid schizophrenia and she seemed to be there for me. I felt like she cared. She'd never leave me alone, even when I insisted. Just having someone like that in my life, whether it be online or real life, made me feel a sense of importance. It made me feel like I mattered for once. Anyways, we began talking a lot more from around December of 2016 so it's been around 4 months of talking a lot now. We have had our fair share of arguments but I've tried my best to keep the relationship despite the struggles we go through. Lately however, I've changed a lot. I stopped smoking like I used to, my schizophrenia is much more controlled and I am generally not the same person I once was. After a few weeks of her noticing my change in personality, she began to like me more. She began to think of me in a similar light to that of which I thought of her. We sort of fell in love I guess. We always said and say we love each other, we try to talk and FaceTime as much as possible. We have rly been putting in more effort.
However, things kind of went downhill recently. I don't feel the same with her anymore. The plans we always talked about when we meet are slowly starting to turn into things that will 'never happen' as she says. For example, we always mentioned how we would be very cute and romantic and now she says she doesn't feel ready to take it 'that far'. However, I am one who isn't simply interested a girl for the romantic side. I love just being able to be with a person and spend quality time with them. Although it sounds strange coming from a 16 yr old, its true. The girl is 19 which also may seem like a concern to most people but I really have fallen in love with her. Yesterday night I took a sleeping pill as I was very tired after spending hours working on an investigating I needed to get done today. My goal was to talk to her for a bit and then go back to sleep. As I've been sick for the past few days, we haven't really been talking much at night compared to normal days where we can spend hours chatting and facetiming. Anyways, I took my pill and texted her telling her that I loved her and that I was gonna sleep so she could text me but if I didn't reply she'd know I wasn't Ignoring. She then takes around 20 minutes to reply to me and just says 'oh'. After this, I try to sleep as I could already feel the pills effect. Around 11-12 at night, I don't really remember much but I remember that I saw a text from her. I never really liked ignoring her and I had forgotten about my pill so I went to text her. I apparently stated saying things like 'I feel weird' etc. this was all due to my pill and was probably just me hallucinating. Anyways, what I woke up to really left me in shock. I woke up this morning and she had replied to me saying 'hey fin, I don't think we can continue like we were, I think we'd be better off as friends'. Reading this instantly put me in a bad mood. It reminded me of all the times I cried because I thought I'd lose her. I worked so hard to make this more than just a friendship. Anyways, I reply to her telling her it was simply my pill and she says she doesn't deserve me since she just left me when I said I felt weird. she then went on to explaining how she feels more like a mom to me than a gf. Its rly strange cause we aren't even dating..yet. Idk what to do anymore. I'm so tired of forcing her to love me all the time. She doesn't even reply to me when she's mad most of the time.

I'm a teenager who is at the age where I should have a Driver's License, but I don't. I think one of the biggest things holding me back is the lack of confidence I have in myself in learning how to drive. 

There seems to be so many rules and customs while driving--turns on a red light, where to stop before an intersection, etc--and I don't feel confident in my ability to drive with a good grasp of those rules. Sure, I could always learn just the basics, but I would rather not hurtle down the freeway in a massive metal object without knowing traffic rules. 

I'm a good student so memorizing/learning shouldn't be hard, but I'm just worried about learning. I've recently tried to be more aware of how my friends/family drive, and there seems to be so many things that you have to keep track of while you are driving. I just don't know if I can do that. I want to have perfect mastery over the traffic rules. I know you can pass with getting mistakes and stuff on the driver's test, but it is my opinion that driving, which is dangerous in itself, should require near-perfection. 

Obviously, living in America, I need to learn how to drive. I'm going far away to college, so if I want to learn how to drive from my parents, I'll need to start real soon. Any advice?

247,"For context, I work downtown in a major US city and my company pays hundreds of dollars a month so I am able to drive and park my car in a garage near my place of work. 

The garage is valet only, so there is no self-park option.  I could not afford to park my car there were it not for my company paying for it.  If I were to tip just $1 each time I went to work, I'd be spending about $240 a year on just tips.  Considering a tip would generally be more than $1, you can see how that might add up.  

I thought that since I was a monthly customer it was sort of different from a situation where someone is only parking there sometimes, and I didn't think it was frowned upon to not tip every day.  I couldn't really find (google) a straight answer about it either when I started parking there.  Meaning it's not like going out to eat where everyone (with a soul) can unanimously agree you have to tip.  

Today when one of the valets brought my car he said no one wanted to get my car for me because I don't tip.  He said only he and one other person were willing to retrieve it, and that I wait so long for my vehicle because no one wants to get it. He said that's the only way they're making money and I need to tip.  He said this in front of all the other customers that were waiting too.  I'm not entirely certain he was trying to be a dick, because I guess how would you tell someone they need to tip other than telling them? But I do feel that the situation was awkward, inappropriate, and generally poor customer service for something that costs so much to begin with.

I'm not sure how to react to this.  I feel it was incredibly inappropriate to essentially demand a tip.  I don't know if I'm being a complete jerk about the tip etiquette here, so I don't want to make a big deal if I am completely wrong, but I do think I need to say something to the manager of the garage.  But then I am worried about retaliation.  Additionally, every day when I go to work and have to deal with these people I will now feel weird because they've apparently been talking about me.  

TLDR: company pays big bucks for parking spot, I can't afford to tip.  Valet called me out on it and essentially demanded I start tipping since apparently no one wants to service me.  ",20Mar2017,38

250,"So this last Saturday night (3/18) I got a massage saying ""Your boyfriend is cheating on you...just so you know"". I didn't see it until this morning (3/20) because it was in the ""other"" folder in messenger. 

Here's the thing, my bf and I have only been together for a few months. We spend most of our time together. We are very happy and have very few conflicts. We constantly communicate when we're not with each other. He's very mature for his age which is why I'm with him and we both want the same things in life. He's very open and honest about his feelings. I don't even believe for a second that he would be cheating. What pisses me off is I feel targeted. Who is this person and what's their problem? We both went on ""her"" page and there's no info, just the city she lives in. One profile photo. No cover photos or posts. No mutual friends. No info at all. Still just so strange to me. I honestly feel a little violated. 

Could it be one of his friends that maybe had feelings for him and made a fake profile? Or vice versa, someone who likes me and is jealous? I responded back saying ""Is that so? Who's my boyfriend?"" It shows that ""she"" saw the message but hasn't responded. So I sent another message saying, ""You obviously have no life and get some kind of kick out of trying (trying being the key word) to ruin someone's day. Well you lose. Just so YOU know, karma is a bitch. ✌🏼"" Haha. And no response. Could it be completely random? But how and why me? Has anyone else experienced this? Any insight or outlooks would be appreciated!

251,"First of all, let me paint the picture that is my family. I'm 19 and work voluntarily, I have one 17 year old brother with learning difficulties, two much younger brothers by a different dad who are 4 and 7 or so I think, my mum and her partner. My mum's partner is a massive prick, he talks shit about me behind my back when he thinks I can't hear him, treats my learning difficulties brother like crap, has no respect for either of us, flirts with other women even after being told by my mum multiple times not to, complains to my mum about me but never says anything to my face and is in general just a massive prick. My dad lives elsewhere and I see him every so often, but living with the prick partner is hard.

Anyway, the current situation is this; I think they're planning on going on holiday without me. They did this once last year, everyone except me went and they left me on my own, which is pretty ironic considering my mum is worried I don't feel like a part of the family. I've seen multiple Facebook posts by my mum and her mum, who the holiday is about visiting, talking about booking tickets and stuff and I've even heard snippets of my littler brothers talking about it, but no one has said a word to me. She's said she wants to pay for a holiday for me and my friend for my birthday and I worry that she thinks that'll make up for me not going with them to Greece, but I don't think so at all. She wonders why I don't feel like a part of the family, then does something like that, which makes me feel even more so like a separate individual to the rest of the household. 

Anyway, any advice on what I should do? If they do go on holiday without me I'll be pissed.",20Mar2017,2

Before anyone asks, I am do think this is ""creepy"" because my husband and I have a very diverse sexual history. I am just not sure if this a step that I want to take.

Beginning in about 2004, me and my husband, who I will call ""Bob"" began dating after we met in his sister's wedding. I did not know his sister back then, but a mutual friend of ours (of his sister and I) took me to the wedding. Long story short, our group friends gathered together, me and Bob met, we danced, and we made love that very same night.

The reason I mention that, is because I feel that we personally ""advanced"" our relationship ""very quickly"", to say the least, but feel that we did *not* take things ""too quick;y"". I think that we were just lucky enough to ""match"" each other, and although rather very sexually active, managed to stay ""in love"" and enamored with each other 13 years, which I think is a testament to our love.

But the issue is that keeping our sexual life ""interesting"" has not been difficult, but also hasn't been easy. We have played with roleplay, bondage, we have watched porn together and we even invited a couple over to have sex with (not ""swinging"", but together as separate partners/couples), and formed a rhythm of keeping things ""interesting"" while keeping things changing and diverse. And I think that it worked well for us. We have never really had to say ""no"" to each other, because we are always on the same ball-park or ""on the same page"". Although we don't plan on inviting people into our sex life again, we didn't really need to convince or persuade the other of or against it. We just agreed that we both didn't want that to happen again. So we haven't had much of a disagreement over the last 13 years; which is why I am worried about having our ""first disagreement"" (regarding sex, because we have disagreed in other areas of our life, we just haven't ever said ""no"" to each other regarding sex).

The issues is, that we have always agreed on where to ""take our sex life next"". There hasn't been really been resistance regarding that on either end of our relationship, until recently. ""Bob"" just told me last week, that he wanted us to have our own area where we could set up cameras, keep our sex-tapes, and maybe buy and install a swing. Things like that. And I actually want to. I feel that it would nice and exciting for us to have that area and privacy for ourselves. But, I am just not sure if ""we are taking things too far"". It worries me to think of inviting friends over, and thinking of them accidentally opening what they think is a closet door (although ""Bob"" wants a secret-bookshelf-type entry), but still. And it's just not that, I am just wondering if we are taking things ""too far"". But at the same time, I really want to because for the most part, we have had nothing but fun up to this point. So I am also afraid of saying ""no"" and being the one to put an end to our fun; to 13 years of love and sexual fun. So although it might seem like ""funny"" or trivial situation to some people, this is a rather serious situation for me because it implies the disruption a 13 year long relationship and 5 years of marriage if I am the one to ""mess things up"". So there really is a lot of pressure on me to make this decision, and to do it honestly and openly, because ""Bob"" and I have always been honest with each other, and have never really lied. We haven't had a reason to lie. I am just not sure, of how to feel. Mostly because of a ""what would other people think if they found out"" type of thing. But also, because I do not want to dissapoint my husband and be the one to ruin our relationship. Heeelp???? Pleeease. Thank you in advance :D

253,"Hey all!

I wanted to get some opinions from other people, just because I'm not really used to this stuff. 

To keep a very long story short, it was my 21st birthday on last weekend, and some of my closest friends came to visit me for one of the best nights of my life. Of course, videos and pictures were taken and of course I posted most on FB just to remember the night. These pictures were just the classic 21st birthday pictures, nothing bad or inappropriate. 

The next day, when I actually posted the pictures and videos, my friend asked me to remove one of the pictures of just me and because, ""...my mom would kill me if she saw that picture."" Now, this came as a complete shock to me because literally the picture is of me sitting on a stool and she is behind me smiling...that's literally it. 

Now, she's dating another one of my good friends and I know he can sometimes be a little over-protective and nosy, but she would definitely tell me he was the reason why she wanted me to take it down...so my question is: am I thinking about this too much, or does anyone think there might be a different story about why she wanted me to take it down? I've been feeling really sad about it because it was a nice picture and for her to say that to me kind of makes me wonder if she's embarrassed to be around me or something else...",20Mar2017,3
254,"My parents are getting on me to apply to college. My GPA is sitting at a 2.5 right now, which is better than last year but since I'm a senior, it doesn't really matter. I have never taken an advanced math course, any math course I take, I end up failing unless its remedial. Most colleges I want to go to won't accept my low GPA, and even if they did, I'm concerned about debt and not failing most of my classes because I'm so fucking stupid. I know there's ways of getting into the colleges I want, getting into the careers I want, but I just can't find the energy to want to do it because I know I will fuck it up or still fall flat. I have a car that I don't drive because I know the more I drive it the higher my chances are of crashing the thing. Its like every part of my life is affected by this hopelessness and worry.

257,"I've never posted here before but I have a huge dilemma. I moved out from my mom's house, just her and my 3 younger brothers, when I was 18. I'm now 25. My brothers are 20, 20, and 21. One of the 20-year-olds is blind and also autistic. The 21-year-old is an asshole who has diagnosed depression but refuses to take meds or help or see a counsellor. My mom has absolutely coddled them all and all of them live with her. She also has 3 dogs (labs) and 4 cats. 

The problem is she can no longer afford the mortgage (apparently, I don't actually know that for certain). My brothers contribute very little. I have my own mortgage, my own pets, my own spouse. I've told her so many times to charge them all rent or kick them out. The problem is, if she kicks them out, suddenly she's stuck with 7 pets and a mortgage she can't afford, so she can't go rent a place because she'll have to get rid of all these pets, some which have been around since I was like 15. The oldest lab, Maya, is 13 and on her way out. The 2 other labs are 6. The cats are 14, 12, 3 and 3. They don't all get along. I feel obligated to take some of the pets, but my boyfriend won't let me. My brothers are useless and don't help with housework, they don't help care for the pets, they don't pay a significant or even fair amount of the mortgage. I don't have a lot of excess cash as I'm also type 1 diabetic and struggle to make ends meet medically every month.

I just need advice :( ",20Mar2017,1
258,"So, I am a female in high school, and once upon a time, I was friends with this one girl. We got pretty close, as we had a common interest in guys and we confided in each other about our guy problems and talked about sex and what not. But, eventually I realized that she was starting to be really mean and abusive towards me. I felt like she was being abusive because I've had a ""friend"" abuse me before, so I know what abuse looks like. 

Anyway, certain things happened that made me realize that she is barely even my friend and it feels like she is using me. So, after this one particular instance where she lost some homework that I let her borrow, I was really upset. Mainly because, I would always be giving her my homework, but whenever I would ask for the favor to be returned, particularly for math homework, she would come up with some excuse like ""um no, I *always* have to go to other people for math hw and you never help me out so I'm not giving it to you."" Meanwhile, she constantly is asking me for my homework :/ After that, I stopped hanging around her as much and tried to stay away from her as much as possible. But, I don't take pleasure in treating people badly, even if it is something as simple as ignoring her. So, I went on instagram and told her I was sorry for how I acted that day, but went on to tell her how I felt I was being used and abused. I deleted the message after about 15 minutes or so but she still saw it. So she wasn't in school the day after I sent that message. But, today she was in school. She was like ""Ok since you think I'm *abusing* you, I guess we can just be friends for physics class."" I was shocked because I thought the message was deleted and she didn't see it. 

Class was ok, and I told her about some of the problems going on in my life while in the class. But, eventually I brought up the message again. She said she was angry at what I said, I don't remember why, but I repeated to her how I felt like she never returns the favor of me giving her HW and she got mad again and was like ""*sigh*...ok."" 

This is not the only thing she has done wrong, she mostly verbally abuses me, and she is very critical of herself and always compares me to herself. She'll be like, ""you're so skinny, ugh look at me."" or ""you dress so nice but I always look like a bum."" And I guess that also pisses her off because whenever I say she looks fine she is like ""you *always* say I look fine."" I don't see a problem with it. I've complimented when she's looked nice in the past, and she kind of just shrugged it off. Anyways, now I just feel really sad. We were pretty good friends before, but now it seems like she is going to hold that message against me.

 Another thing that really bothers me is that I am always saying sorry to people. I don't like to hurt others and not say sorry. So yes, I say sorry. But, it seems like she doesn't even think she has hurt me in any way, or even cares about me. I only have one friend other than her, and that friend is in a different grade than me, so I don't see her a lot, but she is nicer to me than this girl. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to feel bad about letting this ""friendship"" go, but It is hard, especially since I am kind of forced to work with her in physics class(neither of us have friends in that class, and we became friends by being the two loners in that class), and because we had good times in the past. I would really appreciate some advice on how I could handle this situation, and how to stop feeling bad about it. Thank you in advance. 

*Edited to add: I'm sure making some more new friends would help me get my mind off of the lost of this ""friendship"", but I'm very shy and afraid to make friends. During my free period at school, I see some guys that I think may be new or just loners that sit alone. I was thinking of trying to talk to them. But, I'm afraid that I may annoy them and or that they may not want me as an acquaintance or friend or whatever. I barely talk in school, and I am always very depressed, negative, and jealous of others in school. So I'm sure I don't give off a very friendly vibe. The only time when I feel somewhat happy is when I dress nice. But, anyways, very few people talk to me, and when they do, it is obvious they are intimidated by me. I am also intimidated by them, so I'm not sure how I would go about making friends. I am also very  intimidated by and jealous of pretty/beautiful girls that are confident and lead lives that are obviously much more happy and fruitful than mind. I guess that should probably be a separate post, but the point is, it is very hard for me to make new friends. There are also other things that hold me back, but I won't go into detail about them.",20Mar2017,1
