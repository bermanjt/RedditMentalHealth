Lately she’s been acting weird around me, she’ll start whispering my name and then when I turn to see what she wants she’s giving me the stink eye, or I try to ask her something and she just looks away or acts like she didn’t hear me, and it’s pissing me off you know? This girl isn’t a bad person but I’m second guessing why I ever became her friend if she’s gonna treat me like this :/ I’m being nice to her as much as I can but she’s not treating me the same way - if I act like an asshole once she treats me like that for a whole fucking week. She’s trying to get over a breakup and I feel like she’s exhorting all her anger towards that my way. Opinions/advice on what I should do?",26Oct2017,1
1,"As stupid as this sounds, I typed in my credit card number wrong too many times on accident as I was trying to buy a concert ticket on livenation. Once I finally got it right and placed the order, I was taken to an error screen because I had tried using the card too many times, so I didn't get to order my tickets. Am I permanently banned from buying concert tickets or will I be able to try again sometime tomorrow? Has anyone else had this happen to them? Please help, I'm really freaking out. I don't want to be banned forever and I want to get tickets as soon as I can.

10,"There's a lot of things I already discarded here.
I'm 20.
I've known my girl for over 2 years. We are in a long distance relationship that actually works. I love her to death and she's all I care about. However, whenever she comes to visit a couple of problems arise.

Masturbation is absolutely fine, although I've recently noticed that I ejaculate without a fully erect dick.
Herein lie the main problems:
Handjobs are pretty painful unless she uses the foreskin to rub against the head.
Blowjobs are even worse. I can barely feel what's going on in my dick's head, and when I do, I only get the sensation of sandpaper.
The main problem, however, is getting hard enough to penetrate her. We do a LOT of good foreplay, so that's not an issue. She is tight, whenever I try to stick it in, I can see my dick bend, and it is so fucking frustrating. I really know there's something wrong with me. She has amazing libido and always wants to do something with me. I am so frustrated with myself. Any sexual interaction with a woman feels more painful than it does feel pleasureful.
Don't know if it's a testosterone issue, since I also have mood problems.
Erectile dysfunction.
Or something else.
These things happen even after I stop masturbating for WEEKS.
And I highly doubt it is coital anxiety, because, again, I've known her for so long.
Anything to help, please. This is really getting to me.
I also have epididymitis if that also helps.",26Oct2017,3
11,"I am not the best writer, and I tend to rant or ramble around on wild tangents sometimes, so I will try my best to keep this short, clear, and concise. Though, I am sure I will fail at all three, and apologize in advance.

I work for an ""organization"" that has multiple ""locations."" 

Last spring I was working at a location that is not the location I currently work at. 

Very recently I was told by a current co-worker that someone from my former location is spreading a vicious rumor about me, basically alleging sexual harassment (in the form of constantly ""hitting on"" every woman there, including a girl who is married and was pregnant at the time, and making every woman there uncomfortable). 

The hilarious thing is basically said 8 words to all the women at that location, and almost completely ignored or blew off every female at the site for the last 2-3 months I was there. I couldn't stand the backtalk and gossip that would always go on there and distanced myself from it and them (the females) very obviously. 

There is a person at that location who is infamous for spreading harshly un-verified rumors about her former co-workers (of course it always happens after that person leaves). In my time at that location I personally witnessed said person telling stories about former co-workers alleging drug addiction and stealing drugs from the student supply cabinets, sex addictions, wild flirtations, and numerous other smaller gossips. 

My first reaction was to go directly to HR. Like, right that second. I thought about just grabbing my keys and driving straight to the HR building. 

This kind of talk isn't harmless. That kind of allegation, or reputation, can end a career, especially in my field. It's potentially insanely harmful.

The problem is, this is all hearsay, it is literally a ""she said, she said"" situation. It is also something somewhat awkward and difficult to address directly without implicating others.

What should I do?  ",26Oct2017,0
16,"I've worked a lot of jobs for all different amounts of time but one thing is consistent no matter which job I work or what the job is and that is, to put it bluntly-

Women are bitches. 

To explain myself a little more. Every **single** time I have a female boss it's the same shit. I'm kind and nice to everyone, I do what I'm told and I do my best to be the best employee I can be. 

Then one day you're just dead to them. They'll do everything they can to fuck you over in the most passive aggressive way they know how. If there are no problems that day they will make problems. If you didn't have anything to do with the problems they will make all the problems your fault. If you try to tell them they're wrong about anything they'll lose their shit. If anything happens to them or anything/one they rank higher than you then they'll take out their anger on you. Not up front though, behind your back. And they ALWAYS have this shit eating grin on their face when they tell you ""YOU are wrong and I am right!"" or if it's your job to do a specific thing they swing by and'll be like ""You better be doing that thing right now!"" even though you're in the middle of it and they always say it with the piece of shit face on. I was going to do it if they said to or not I don't need them getting their power kicks 24/7 at my expense.  

Every **single** female boss I've had are passive aggressive control freaks that are fucking insane. I can't read minds and they think I can sprint through the mine field that is their views on the world and work space and somehow do everything perfectly and only tell me way after the fact that I messed up somewhere. But they'll wait just long enough so that they can use the phrase ""I just can't take it anymore! YOU NEED TO DO THIIIISSSS THIIIISS WAAAAY AHHHHH"" 

It's fucking insane nonsense. 

Now all my male bosses weren't perfect either but the key difference is that weren't fucking bitches about **everything.**

If something was on their mind they fucking say it.

If there is a problem in the work space they fucking talk about it while it's happening and deal with it, they don't wait 8 months and then flip out on everyone or one person in particular in front of everyone so they can wave their tits around because they know the person they're yelling at can't say anything to them because then they'll get fired, just adult bullies. As if we're not all just people doing jobs to make some cash and then grow old and die.

Male bosses don't get overly emotional over everything and lose their shit on the regular. 

I've been punched in the face by a past boss and even though that was an uncalled for move on his part he apologized and we talked about it, he was going through some shit and we went out for drinks after. Case closed in under an hour. 

But you mess one thing up under a female boss and they'll wait and fester on it for god knows how long then when even the slightest thing happens they start throwing shit at you like an ape in heat. It's fucking disgusting honestly and if you call them out on anything you get canned. 

My last 2 jobs have had some insanely high employee resignation rates and the bosses were both women and they'll up there on their thrown like ""Hmm, I wonder why I've lost 40 employees in a month and a half. It can't be because I'm an insane bitch that doesn't know how to run a business or actually respect my workers. Nah, it has to be them. Everyone else is the problem."" And whenever someone brings up anything about how these bosses need to stop being insane and actually run a business they always do this psycho laugh with that same shit eating grin and tell them to pack their bags.

These past few bosses have actually made me consider becoming a homosexual because there is no way in hell I can deal with another psycho bitch boss and then come home to another one. Anyway, I had to get that off my chest. As you can probably tell by this, I quit my job so now I'm looking for a new one. Here's hoping it's a male boss this time.  ",26Oct2017,0
17,"I am sixteen.
For over a year now I have been disgusted by eating often.  If a plate isn’t rinsed or cleaned properly I won’t eat from it, the same goes for forks and spoons, bowls and everything else one eats from.  Each have a certain way to be rinsed and I always have to inspect them.  Sometimes a meal won't be prepared right, I'll suspect for a second a bug was near it, it was left in the fridge or touched the counter.  Or my mind will just decide to deem it unclean and I won't eat it.

Because of this I've gone without eating for more than a day before.
I refuse to eat meals from my house and until recently I would always buy something to microwave or from a store premade, but due to income that can't happen anymore.
I've gone to my mom and even scheduled a doctor's appointment about this, believing it could possibly be OCD or something else.
The doctor said that she believes me and that it could very possibly be OCD but she cannot diagnose me and that I should go to a psychiatrist.
My mom believes full heartedly that the doctor denounced my claims and that I am just picky and with some quirks.  But now I don't eat after 11 due to how school lunches are scheduled and I really want to be normal and have a home meal for once but I cannot bring myself to it.


TLDR;. I think I have OCD tendencies but mother thinks that I am just quirky.  I may as well be starving myself due to these thoughts and behaviors.",26Oct2017,1
18,"I'm a sophomore in highschool, male, and done with this shit. My life has always felt empty and devoid of meaning but I was always able to get through shit somehow, now I just don't know. I moved to a new school this year(from small private to a large public school) and knew almost nobody. For a while I remained hopeful of meeting people. I socialized, met lots of people, yet nobody wants to hang out with me. In the last week I haven't gotten a single message from somebody unless I initiated the conversation, and even then rarely. I've had a girlfriend once in my life, and was hoping that the girl I met this weekend would be interested in seeing me again, but after her friend told her that I'm a virgin she's ignored me. Nobody texts me, nobody talks to me and i honestly don't see the point in living anymore. The one thing I enjoy in life is lifting, that's it. I've been lifting for a few years now and am very proud of my progress, if people ever talk to me it's normally about lifting or to complement how I look, but it just feels so empty. I've put all this work into sculpting my body, and for what? My life is just as shit as when I was a scrawny anemic looking creep. I can't keep going like this anymore, without social interaction. I can't keep going home after school and browsing 4chan and reddit and playing fucking world of tanks knowing that everybody else in high school is having the time of their lives, that so many other people just get a happy life handed to them while I struggle to try and improve mine with no success. All of the progress from lifting i would trade in an instant to be happy like everybody else. Recently it's gotten so bad I can't even do my homework, study for tests or quizzes anything. From this shit writing quality you probably think I'm average intellectually, but believe me I'm not. I scored a 33 on the ACT on my first try and have won a decent amount of academic awards. I don't even know what I'm ranting about right now, but to sum up my life sucks because I have no friends, am socially isolated, no girlfriend and it all leads to a lack of drive to do anything, dropping my grades and making everything even worse.

19,"I'm writing this for my parents. They don't speak English very well. 

I'm 19, my mom is 47, and my dad is 49. My older brother is 22. 

He's been arrested twice, and my parents had to bond him out. The first arrest is the one my parents have been getting on him about. 
He was arrested the first time for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. 
My parents constantly tell him, ""We don't want you selling and keeping marijuana while you're living with us."" 
My brother flips out and says, ""THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH SMOKING! I NEED IT! I'M AN ADULT I CAN DO MY OWN THINGS!""

He goes on saying how he's the smartest in the family, and without him, the family would fall apart and some other stuff. 
My parents and my brother argue about every day, and I'm tired of my brother disrespecting them, calling them stupid and other names and failing to follow my parent's rules. 
He says after he no longer has to go to court and do drug tests, he will continue to smoke and have weed. 

What I am asking for is advice. Since I am tired of hearing these arguments, I am sort of conspiring with my parents to have him move out. Since he wants to be so independent and not follow rules, we will have him live on his own where he can do those things. 
Is this a good plan to follow? I love my brother, but this has been causing him to behave ugly. 
If it's not a good plan, what should my parents and I do? He may be addicted to weed since he says he needs it. Rehab might not be good, for we don't have the money to have him admitted to one.

You should know that my roommates aren’t the most neat people and they like to leave a sink full of dishes for days on end and they like to leave food out on the counters/stove frequently. Also the trash fills up fast and no one takes it out as soon as it gets full. 

When one of my roommates discovered the droppings in and under the coffee table, she proceeded to tell me that the coffee table was put outside and said that it wouldn’t be going back into the apartment. When I said that she would be paying for any damage caused she replied “hahahaha I’m not paying for an old broken coffee table” and then pointed out that she spent $20 on supplies to clean up the mouse droppings. I told her that I would be happy to pay her back because I can take responsibility for something that probably wasn’t my fault. She then told me I was being petty for saying she would pay for damage and that she would be petty back even though she didn’t need the money.

I am not as smart as people think I am. I am struggling to manage my money, time, hobbies, self worth and it just feels also overwhelming. I am not sure I'll ever catch up or get through this shit.

57,"Hello reddit, I really need your help on what I could do to resolve this loud upstairs neighbor issue. Sorry but this backstory may be somewhat long.

So I live with my wife in an apartment. A lady moved upstairs with a dog and a child, and they make awful alot of noises. I understand that a kid's a kid, but it's not as simple as a kid just running around. Kid will jump, stomp, throw objects on the floor, drag objects on the floor etc. Now if this was once a while it'd be understandable, but this happens every single day, beginning from 6PM to as late as 12PM and it will happen almost non-stop throughout those hours. 

Now I've read up online that I may want to ask the neighbor first before taking it to the management, so I did. I asked politely as I could and came back down to my apartment, and I was retaliated with barrage of stomps and objects thrown on the ground for rest of the day. So the next day I went to the management and turns out my upstairs neighbor reported me for harassment. After explaining my situation to the management, I even showed them the recording of the night (not the conversation, just the noises). All I received from the management is that:

1. I can't do anything before 10PM (which is the quiet hour)
2. It's a kid, what do you want us to do tell the kid to sit and not move?
3. I can come to your house and listen to the sound, if it's excessive I can consult them to stop. 
4. Unless it's happening all day, we can't do anything. (was told that 3-6 hours a day wasn't enough)

Now here's the thing, the management closes at 4PM and I'm guessing the neighbors don't return home until around 6PM to make the noises. I have numerous recordings of the noises but they won't tell me why they won't take those as an evidence.

Unfortunately we've kind of given up but it's really affecting our lives negatively. We have earplugs and headsets on top of it to blast music all day because just the earplugs or earphones weren't sufficient to negate the noise. I can't even talk to my wife  properly anymore and it's really taking a toll on both of us. Is there anything we can do about this situation?

61,"   We're both 19, we met back when we were 13 (7th or 8th grade), hit it off and became best friends pretty damn quick. We were inseparable, she'd come over to my house everyday after school, and we texted each other basically anytime we weren't together. She lives with her single dad and after a little while she began using mom to refer to my mother (still does) that's how close we got.
   I soon developed feelings for her and joked around with her about it a couple times and eventually worked up the nerve to tell her seriously. She turned me down because she'd be moving soon. Around the beginning of freshman year of high school she finally did. From Oregon to Texas. 
   We kept in touch the entire time she was in TX, texting, Snapchat, Xbox, Skype, etc. (I later found out this is when she realized that she really, *really* had feelings for me too) She moved back to Oregon sometime during my Junior year and we began dating and everything was amazing until about a week before our prom her dog bit someone and as they didn't have papers for him, ended up fleeing to California. 
   Thus began our long distance relationship. Visited plenty of times. During my senior year she moved in with one of her friends in my hometown so we were together for most of that year. Towards the end of that year she moved 4 hours away. We were long distance for a pretty significant chunk of our 2 and a half year relationship. Distance would inevitably be why we would break up. She and I have remained best friends after our break up even through relationships with other people. Still talk all the time. 
   It's now been 7 months since our breakup but I'm still very much in love with her. Last weekend I made the 4 hour drive to visit her for the first time since our breakup and we had an amazing time. That weekend was the highlight of my year. We stayed in a hotel room together and it basically felt like we were living together in a small apartment (something we'd always talked about before, during, and after our relationship.) We even slept in the same bed together. It seemed like in some ways the feelings were still there for her but in other ways not. 
   With my work schedule I have a three day weekend every other weekend and plan to use each one of them to go visit her.
   I'm still very much in love with her but as she has no intentions of getting back together I wanna know if anyone could offer me some advice on moving past her. A lot of breakup advice people offer involves cutting the other person completely out of your life but that's not at all something I want to do. 

Sorry for long post, probably don't need this much detail but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

64,"I’m 15, and recently I’ve had a realization. Well, kind of... I’m just a lot more considerate and nicer than I used to be. Not that I was ever mean, but I just think a lot more about people, and stuff like that. I don’t ever talk badly about people, that might be because I’m a guy. 

Anyways, I do smoke weed, and it is fun. I don’t do it super often, but I’d say I do it about once every other weekend, if even that. I quit smoking as often, because while it is fun, I always have a sense of guilt the morning after. It’s not a type of guilt you get when you disobey your parents, it’s a self guilt, like the type you get when you eat a cake when you’re on a diet or something. 

I don’t have a lot of friends, and the only friends that I’ve ever gone to their house, are the friends I smoke with. When I’m home, I usually watch movies or YouTube. On YouTube, I watch a lot of old Vines and recently, I’ve been watching this specific group of people. They’re a couple of years older than me, and it’s stupid (trust me, I know) but, I relate so much to them, and it sometimes it does frustrate me if I hang with people different from them. I am a lot like them, but, my friends aren’t. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I don’t know how to explain it... they’re not bad people, they’re just kind of reckless. 

For example, when we party together, they go way harder than me, they smoke and drink way more often than me (I don’t even really drink). But, even at my school, their aren’t many people like me or this group of people. It may just be because I go to a small school.

I've been in a lame struggle with depression for a long time, and I'm been often very gloomy, tired, and quiet at school. I don't do poorly at school or anything like that, I just don't look very happy. 

Fast forward a bit to Senior year and I've been undergoing therapy and trying my best to distract myself from negative thoughts. This has resulted in me being a lot more talkative in class and seemingly happy.

However, all of a sudden every single teacher seems to have a strong dislike for me and I don't understand why. 

So as an experiment, I tried for a month to go back to being noticeably all gloom and doom in class and what do you know, the teachers like me again.

I have confronted her about this and it improved, but now I don't even want to eat. She cooks strange foods and the apartment smells weird and makes me not want to eat.

1. As a child she was sexually molested, separately, by four different people. She managed to tell her parents about one and they did not believe her. The defended the abuser concluding he was drunk despite him owning up to it. When she told her sister she said ""ha you got raped"". Her parents, however, became concerned about another relative who experienced the same issue and threatened the abuser with the police but did not do this for her. Their own daughter.

2. She was abused emotionally, physically and mentally by her ""narcissistic"" mother.  Her mother used spirituality and physical abuse as a weapon to control and manipulate her. The have no intimate relationship. No hugs, kisses, no ""I love you"" and so on. Her father is equally manipulative but through money. She is constantly helping her father with money and has now got herself into a 5K debt.

3. She has no friends. Never had a boyfriend though has been initiate with men (she went through a phase). She believes no man wants to publicly ""claim her"" which is triggered by her parents refusal to be seen with her, particularly her father. Her parents criticised how big she was, right through to her bust which they find hideous because of how large it is. She has a serious level of self-hate and cannot look at herself in the mirror. In addition, she cannot fight for herself because she was never ""fought"" for by her parents in critical moments that would have signalled her value and self worth, to them about her. She no longer lives with her parents.

4. She hates her job. She has sent close to 130 job applications. 5 interviews. All rejections. Feedback from recruiters are positive but they wanted someone with more experience. Such useless feedback mind you. As a result she has developed insomnia and overthinks continuously. She feels hopeless. She is well educated to Masters level at a world renowned university - one of the big ones.

5. She took the right steps to get therapy and even an antidepressant but nothing seems to be working for her. She seems to be losing grips and it is becoming visible that she is ""losing it"". Spirituality has failed her too. There is more to her story but these are the main points.

82,"I'm not so sure how to phrase this question but I guess the title really says it all. Lately I've been finding myself in more and more emotionally draining and damaging relationships, be it friendships or more, and although I know I shouldn't like it, there's a part of me that can't stop turning back to the feeling of pain and worthlessness I get from them.

To clarify what kind of relationship I mean, let me give an example. I'm currently friends/a bit more with a guy who is quite nice, really, but.. We only really talk about him. Ever. If I ever bring up anything that has to do with me, he'll either ignore it and continue talking about himself or he'll give a vague uninterested response. I don't mind talking about his cars and trucks and things all day, but I also just don't really care and he's never once asked me about MY hobbies. On top of that, I'm honestly a bit scared of him. I don't feel comfortable around him, I always feel like I need to be on the edge of my seat. I feel worthless around him. I don't feel like anything I have to say matters; I'm just dead meat that he can talk to for hours when he's bored and then drop when he has other shit to do without any warning. 

This is not the first time this has happened. I know it's bad and damaging and I should get out of it but I can't help but feel attracted to those types of men and then ""enjoy"" the pain and the suffering that I get out of it. I won't be shy to admit that I have a very low sense of self worth... I believe it has something to do with that. Perhaps I subconsciously believe that that's the only type of relationship I'm worth. And in some ways I do; I don't see why anyone would love me if I don't serve them and their needs/interests/etc. To be clear, I am NOT talking about a fetish or anything. While it does apply in that regard as well, it's not just that and I don't see anything wrong with that if it's consensual... Which.. I don't know. Maybe this is consensual because I haven't tried to stop him. But I also hate it. I just want him to acknowledge me, even once, but then again I'm lucky to even be talking to him.

91,"Hey guys

So I'm 21, freshman in college, and I'm kinda interested in this girl, also a freshman. Ok, chasing is the wrong word, I get along pretty well with everybody, I have a few goals and I don't feel the need to be after some given girl. But anyway I find her pretty cute and interesting. Let's call her Mary.

So I started playing around with her. Let's skip the details and just say I was getting good vibes, she was laughing, wanting to talk with me, asking me to sit near her in class, etc., I was thinking of inviting her out for coffee tomorrow or so.

So what's the issue? One of my friends in the course, let's call him Jeff, is this 25 year old guy, he's been dating this cute girl for a few years, he's finishing the course, and he's the elected course leader, in charge of setting stuff up for the rest of the students. He also lives next to Sally, Mary's best friend.

So I guess it's easy to tell where this is going. I found out Mary is constantly texting Jeff. She will text him about a random subject, he will reply, 15-20m later she texts about a new subject, repeat. Obviously I don't know where they stand because I didn't ask him directly, but he said he finds her a bit annoying but that she's pretty fun.

Ok, so I get her point of view just fine. He's 25, he looks/is much older than me, has a more respectable body, is in a position of power, knows a lot of people, is clearly smart since he's finishing the course, and Sally gets a good word in for him. It's pretty clear why she's attracted to him, at least to me.

I just don't get why the hell I had to pay a part on any of this. I've made it pretty clear I'm interested in her, and I've given her pretty of space to say no, but she seems to go out of her way to say yes. Asking me to sit next to her, stopping in the hall to wait for me to stop talking to someone else so I can talk to her, etc.

What the heck is her angle? Is she playing me as second option, ""Let me see if I can get this older guy, and if I don't I still have this one as backup?""? Am I reading this all wrong and maybe she's not interested at all?

Neither of these options seems good. They both make me kinda frustated and make me not want to try anything with her anymore. What do you think? And how should I respond from now on when she comes and talks to me? Am I missing anything?",26Oct2017,2
92,"How bad of a person am I that I even had the thought?

I checked my mailbox and got something from what I thought was MY cell phone provider, so I ripped the envelope open and stared at a prepaid debit card for $300 with another person's name on it; probably a rebate from buying an iPhone or referring folks to this carrier. 

I know it is not mine. I know. I should return it. I am a recent college grad hard-up for money as my car is in need of repairs, have medical bills, etc. 

It will weigh on my conscience if I use it. But not that much. I need advice, been thinking about it for an hour. Should I at least try and contact him? Should I call the carrier and say deactivate this one and mail him/her another to a correct address? How illegal is it use this and is it worth it? Etc. ",26Oct2017,1
93,"Okay so I'm 18 years old and I have always had an interest in older men. So I opened a tinder account and I matched with many older men. They are all ranged 37-40. However, there is one that I enjoyed talking to and he's 38 and single. He wants to meet me and have fun with me. He is a quite decent guy and well-educated. He is like we can have drinks and have fun together. We also connect a lot. I just wanted to know your opinion on this. Is it okay? I really like being with older men but I don't know what exactly attracts them to me. I don't really know if I am ready for a physical relationship with them because I'm a virgin and idk if I'm ready for it yet.

I prepared for the test and was confident in my abilities but once I got in the field I forgot everything and ended up getting a 52% on the test. 

I've never failed a test before with my lowest test ever being a 68%. I now have a 70% or a C- in the class and have never had lower than a B in a class. 

I emailed my professor and T.A. and told them that I must not be understanding the material and if there is anything I can do to boost my grade.

Is there anything else I can do? I know I need to study more for the next test and start working harder. I currently have a 3.66 GPA and don't want this class to hurt it. I also can't drop the class because then my financial aid would be affected. Any thoughts?",26Oct2017,1

100,"Hi guys so I am investigating ways to survive ""on my own"". Last year I did a lot of research on going to live in Alaska (forgive the trope) and work in crabbing and/or the ""fish industry"". I told myself I would take a break from the idea because I thought I would grow out of the idea but it has been a constant. 

I will live very cheaply, no family, no desire for a relationship and I never have had this desire so I don't think my mind will suddenly change. Essentially, I only need to support myself. I already don't use my phone except in emergencies, don't watch TV, and I regularly go without internet for 6+ months. Very basic lifestyle and solitary lifestyle. I won't be going from a social media fanatic to a hermit essentially. 

I live in Australia currently, studying at uni, only have one year left. I grew up in China, Singapore, and Australia (mostly Aus) so the travel bug is in my programming. Most of my family is overseas ranging from Texas to Amsterdam so I am experienced travelling and moving around. New places are not a problem.

Plan is to leave Australia when I finish next year, get my Irish passport granting me EU National status. Allows free travel through EU/EEA States with health and other benefits. This gives me a lot of options. 

The part I am struggling with is finding ways to survive financially.

Can anybody point me in the direction of jobs or places to go which would allow somebody to live cheaply (no big cities) and quietly? I was fluent in French but lost it after years of neglect, should be able to pick it back up again. Ready and able to learn a third language if necessary. 

Any type of job is acceptable, from manual labour to freelance web design. However I do prefer the *""tangible""*.

Worth mentioning I do **NOT** suffer from anxiety. Although I am bipolar so I have to take regular medication. Doctor says if I remain stable for the next 6-7 years I can wean myself off things. Medication is extremely cheap in Europe (like Australia) compared to the US.

103,"Much like the title of my username, I'm the queen of my school. All the boys want me and does my bidding. The thing is, I'm going third year and my fourth year jock boyfriend is basically an idiot. He and his friends usually bully around others and assert dominance but the guy is dumb as bricks.

He was lead to believe that I was cheating on him and had one of his friends stalk and take pictures or me and they got a very suggestive photo with me and another guy. SO, he decided to kick me out of our apartment. Which I can't go to since he and about 5 others pay rent for...

So I decided to play his role and make friends of my own. This cute freshman that everyone talks about. Now he's done things for me in the past... for money that is... but unlike all the other guys that worship me, he seems to barely care. (I'll get to that bit in a bit) So I send him to get my things for me: clothes, make-up, class books, etc. He did it beat a few of the guys up there and came back. As a thank you we made out this time and I assumed he was mine. But no, when my ex decided to start a street war and fight all the guys I talk to with his friends, my little freshman didn't care about me at all. I had to find and tell him they were fighting for me and he rejected and left.

Not only that but apparently the word is he beat the shit out of my ex anyway and said, ""I don't want that slut, you just do what I say now."" So basically he doesn't care about me at all... he just wants to be the top face of the school like everyone else...

What can I do to get him back to me? Obviously if he just listens to me, I can make him as possible as he wants. I can give him a lot actually, even a girlfriend if he so desires. But no, he doesn't even look at me anymore, just runs off doing whatever the hell he wants, ugh.

Any advice on how to get a guy to like you? I've already kissed and chatted him, I don't know what else he wants. Do I try to cut him off and force him to talk to me? Or do I just wait wait wait forever? The reason I'm so interested is because he isn't like the other men. They do what I want at the click of a button, but this one seems like a real man.

It saddens me, even though all I want is to be friends with her. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be with her, but it never goes any further than a short thought.

106,"Hi Reddit. Pretty much what the title says but some details need to be mentioned.

The victim was my girlfriend, who I met 6 months ago. To make it short, we fell in love and had an amazing relationship that deteriorated because of strange behavior from her part, which confused me and made me react badly aswell. I asked her if anything was wrong, to which she told me about physical abuse she recieved in both her separated parents' homes and the mental illness (BPD being the main one, but she had all kinds of mental and eating disorders) she developed because of it. It made everything more clear, and I promised to help and be with her. However the situation didn't get better, I walked on eggshells and couldn't really blame her for anything,  although deep inside I thought (and still think) she was a lovely girl and was conscious about her behavior, but couldn't control it.

From then on my goal became to support her and help with her self steem. She built some confidence until she decided to face her step mother (who tortured her) and her father (who she loved, but was passive to her partner's abuse) hoping her dad would react. He didn't, she gave up and decided to endure the abuse until she was an adult. One week later, her step father at her mother's house (who she had told me talked at her in creepy sexual ways) raped her, and he affirmed would do so again (she went to his home every weekend).

I urged her to report the cases, but she loved her father too much, and didn't want to compromise her mother and little siblings as her rapist was the economical support of the house. She also admitted to me she had some Stockholm syndrome and her disorders didn't help. She was basically accepting the rape and abuse in both homes in order not to disturb her families. That was her decision.

Now, I had heard about mandatory reporting, but appart from that I had many reasons to do it, the main one being of course that the free rapist could put other people in danger, including her siblings. In the other hand, both families would be destroyed and the siblings would end in foster care. I read contradicting advice about rape: on the one side, I should respect the victim's decision, as the rapist already had gone against her consent. On the other, if I knew about imminent danger I should report it. As the next weekend came closer, the moral pressure became unbearable and I reported both cases to CPS without telling her anything before. I told her after, she got very mad and cut all contact with me, which broke my heart but is not the point if this thread.

This happened recently and I am very confused. She was a lovely person deep inside, but dealing with her made me question a lot of things. I usually ended up feeling guilty of things I'd normally not feel guilty about. I still don't know what the heck is right or wrong anymore, although deep inside I think I did the right thing. The worse thing is I can't really blame her for anything as she's the victim here. I need to step on some ground. I have had some anxiety since then, which is something I've never had before as my life is fairly calm. I want honest opinions, not hearing what I want to hear. Thank you.",26Oct2017,1

109,"So just some background info on me. I was adopted by two lovely Christian parents. I have a learning disability but I never let that stop me from reaching my goals in life. I actually just got the film job of my dreams. My boyfriend and I have known each other and I have known his family for 3 years. He has an Autistic brother who is basically like my little brother. 


So here's what happened. My boyfriend and I were in the hot tub and we were making out when he climaxed into the hot tub. I didn't think much of it then cut to a little while later and my period was late and I was showing some signs of pregnancy. Now at the time I didn't know that you couldn't get pregnant by hot tub. Remember I was raised very sheltered and I had to live with the constant fear that I would get pregnant in my teens and become a statistic like my birth mother. I had a basic understanding of sex but not much after that. I'm not dumb it's just how I was raised. I was sheltered and my birth mom wasn't sheltered enough. So anyway my boyfriend explains to me why it's impossible to get pregnant like that which he doesn't mind. He knows my situation. Of course It's a little embarrassing having to learn this stuff as a 21 year old but I'm glad I finally found someone to teach me these things. Fast forward to now. He told his parents. He thought it was cute and funny that I didn't know and his mom thought so too. His Dad not so much. He called me an idiot and called my boyfriend one for dating me. He didn't understand my situation. It was really embarrassing. I'm mad at everyone. My Birth mom for having me at the age of 15. My parents for not teaching me certain things, My now ex boyfriend for giving out information and his mom for not controlling his Dad, His Dad for having a hard head and not listening to the entire story. Most importantly though I'm mad at myself. I'm mad that I don't know these things, I'm mad that I didn't take the time to learn these things, I'm mad that I'm so afraid of not pleasing my parents and becoming a statistic that I didn't give myself the proper education. I'm mad that I made his father hate me. Now I'm sad that his autistic brother is going to not have me in his life anymore because I didn't know a simple thing about sex.

It's my first time posting on this page and never really expect I would. But I have been feeling chained and tied down living under my mom's rules. I am 21 and currently enrolled in Electrical Engineering School as a Junior. I've been living with my mom for nearly 4 years during my start of college and I have been feeling emotionally abuse by her blaming and accusing me.

I’m a 26 year old man currently living in Upstate NY. I moved here a couple years ago after living in Florida all of my life. I have no desire to move back to Florida as the only family member I have is my grandmother who is on her way out and I have a lot of skeletons to deal with and I don’t want a reminder of anything of my past. I’m a single guy who has a couple of cats I am not willing to part with. As to not sound crazy I will say it’s more than the 2 that apartments allow. I currently live in a single story house that my grandmother bought for me with a finished basement for space. I’m going to say that taxes here are too damn high. Like I don’t mind the area too much but its also not where I’d like to be. Plus it’s the suburbs and unless you have a family, you don’t fit in. 

I do not mind where it is in the country I should move to as long as it’s in the US. I much more prefer city living over suburbs but I will move to the suburbs if it’s necessary. I just will not move to a countryside home because that is way too much for me to manage being alone. I also like constantly having things to do. 

Public transportation is not a must but it’s great if it’s there. 

For price guidelines I’m looking for homes/townhomes/condos around  $150,000. Space isn’t that much of an issue but I do live with everything I own.

Thing is, I can't help but be overwhelmed by the thought of it. I noticed today that someone I considered a friend deleted me off of all social media with no explanation. And I'm honestly taking it far harder than I should. I asked a few other friends about it and the general response was ""oh he HAAAAAATES you"". I don't really even want to know why.

114,"There's a TL;DR at the bottom and key points are bolded.

So, I work retail, and I tend to be very friendly and conversational when I'm helping people, as you do when you're a salesperson. **I think I crossed the line with this one guy though, and now I'm kind of worried for my wellbeing.**

This guy is about 40, and I'm 18. **He made a joke about how his wife is bipolar and that's why they're separated, and he asked me if I get along with my parents. I joked that my mother was probably bipolar, which is true.** Then he gets kind of serious and just says, ""Really? I believe we meet people for a reason. **Would you mind if we exchanged numbers so you can give me some advice?""** Looking back, this was a red flag, but I've never experienced anything like that before. It was weird to meet someone with such a similar situation (I'm leaving out a lot of details to make this short) and I guess I've been so lonely that I jumped at any kind of friendship. Bad move, I know. Anyway...

So I give him my number. **He's been messaging me and asking me questions about how best to reconcile his relationship with his girls, what he can do better in light of the divorce. I've been answering them**, trying to help. **He hasn't pushed me for any answers and I said I would just stop replying if I was uncomfortable, which he agreed with.**

**Then he shows up at my work the other day.** I say hi, you know, it's normal. **He gets in line to buy something and when he gets to me he hands me this blue folder and a Starbucks gift card.** We're not allowed to accept gifts, so I try to refuse the gift card, but he won't let it go and there are people waiting, so I take it and leave it there for a manager to turn in. **I take the folder and he says, ""I just want you to know how much you've been helping me.** You know, you would be a good therapist.""

I just read through the folder. **BIG POINT:** his wife has filed for and been approved for a restraining order against him. As for the documents, there's an email from the family counsellor, a court order for therapeutic counselling between him and his kids, and records of supervised visits with him and his kids, including emails from the counsellors. Basically, pretty confidential stuff that I should have absolutely no access to, and I'm surprised he does.

As far as the internet has told me, **court-ordered supervised visits are for violent or neglectful parents. It could be either (or both) in his case.** He told me that he grew up as a gang member in LA, plus the restraining order points to violence. And in the record from one of the supervised visits, the daughter that hates him said, ""You could have been supporting us the whole time,"" when he says that it's been hard to support them, which points to neglect.

Also, I have life-long experience with a narcissist, and some of the things he does during these visits just reek of narcissism. However, that narcissist would 100% file a restraining order with no reason other than to gain power over another person, and I know nothing about his wife, so she might be really screwing this guy over.

Anyway, **he knows where I work, and that I work nights, and I demonstrated that I don't have as many boundaries as everyone else when I gave him my phone number.** So I'm worried that if the restraining order was for violence and not just some fit of insanity like he's trying to say, that if I stop responding to him the way he wants, **I won't be safe.**

**To be clear, he has not made any threats against me,** and I don't know of any violence he has demonstrated towards his daughters or his wife. This is speculation based off the (probably confidential) documents he gave me and what he has told me of his own volition.

Sorry for burying the lede, this is as short as I could make it.

**TL;DR** Befriended a shopper 20 years my senior with a supposedly similar situation to my crazy mother and my dad. Exchanged numbers. He came to my work and gave me documents I should definitely not have access to regarding court-ordered individual and family therapy, and supervised visits with his two girls, and learned that his wife has a restraining order against him. I would like to cut contact for obvious reasons, but no personal threats have been made against me. Worried that he is violent and that I might be in some kind of danger if I don't end this aquaintanceship kindly. Help.",26Oct2017,4
115,"Hey--as the title states--I am a 22 year-old student that is currently a Junior in a university. I am a Computer Science major--for those of you who were wondering. I believe this is my first post on Reddit and my first time exposing myself in order to get advice! Alright, I feel completely lost and lonely. I have had several failing semesters in a row--my GPA is still higher than a 2.0, but I don't think it will be after this semester--and it is finally getting to the point where I am not sure what to do. To be more specific, I have not failed any of my Computer Science classes--I have passed all of them with A's and B's--but I have failed other courses because I have lacked to really show interest. I am not sure what to do and how to get over what I am feeling at the moment. I have dug myself a really deep hole in my academic career and it is affecting me mentally and emotionally. I hate to admit it, but I am depressed. I have been feeling really depressed since I started consecutively failing semesters. I know what I am doing wrong and I know what I can do to pull myself back up, but.... the hole I have dug is too deep and I won't be able to save my grades this semester. I have used up my limit of re-taking units and choosing a ""grade"" of withdrawal. I know some of the options I have.. which are: Transferring to another University and Petitioning. Looking for classes at a community college will not work because upper division classes must be completed in the university I am attending--unless I transfer. Well that's my situation at the moment. I am so close to reaching my milestone of getting my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, but I have failed classes--just re-iterate, I have not failed a single Computer Science class, I have failed classes like Linear Algebra and statistics. The fact that I am so close and I don't know if I will be able to finish because of the stupid decisions I have made is eating me alive. I am not extremely depressed, but I am definitely depressed and it has led me to ask for help for the first time in my life. I have always done what I have had to do in order to succeed, but this is the first time in my whole life that I have failed and have dug up a really deep hole that is almost impossible to climb back from.. At least I feel that way. This depression is keeping me from achieving my goal and--although, that I understand why I feel this way and how I can overcome it--I feel this depression is trapping me, while slowly eating at me, until I break for the first time in my life. I need to hear and read the advice and wise words of other people in order to feel that I can break free from this flesh-eating depression. I have never given up and I have never been broken, but my failures are destroying me little by little.... I have never asked for this kind of help because I have never put myself in a position to need advice or help... but.. for the first time in my life, I am feeling a lost and lonely 22 year-old adult.

Thank you so much in advance, Reddit.

TL;DR: I am at a Junior standing in University and have been been failing classes that I need to pass in order to be able to take more upper division courses. I have a few options left and I am feeling depressed and I need help in order to overcome this extremely frustrating obstacle.

128,"To start off I’ll give you guys a little bit about myself. I’m a 24 year old male, I’ve been in a couple long 3+ year relationships. I’ve always had the opportunity to engage with women through school and events directly related to school. I’ve been out of school for a little over a year and my last relationship ended just before that. 

Now that I’ve left school and had very few experiences in bar settings, I’m not sure how to approach this. 

My roommates and I have been stopping at a bar in our town occasionally and have had the same bartender wait on us a couple of times. She’s around our age, I would imagine she’s out of college but she’s at least mid 20’s, we’ll call her Jenna. 

Tonight, we all went out again and she was working but didn’t wait on us. It was a little busy but I was determined to try and talk to her. After mustering up the confidence to go up to the bar and ask for a round of her recommended shot, I took a seat on the stool. Hopefully if that went well I could maybe take the conversation somewhere. Two women were behind the bar, one being her. The other bartender asked if I was being helped and I muttered “I’m not sure what I would like yet.” Or something as equally odd. Moments later, Jenna came over near me to pour a beer. She glanced at me and asked if I had been helped. I said I hadn’t and I was wondering if she’d pour me a few shots. She said sure! She finished getting her beers from the tap and brought them to a couple at the other end of the bar. As soon as she turned her back, the other bartender came back to see if I knew what I wanted now. 

I’ve truly never had an issue starting conversation, but it’s always been with women I knew something about from class, or a friend who knew them from a class or something like that. My dilemma here is that there has to be a better way to approach her and I’d love your input on how. 

What should I say and how should I do it? 

tl;dr

Local bartender is stunningly gorgeous. I’m interested in getting to know her but unsure of the best way to approach her. Please help! ",26Oct2017,1

I did study a little bit throughout this week, but i can't seem to reach the daily study goals i made, and the study goals are the bare minimum on how fast should my study pace be.

I tried out a couple of things, tried sleeping early, coffee, exercising, having breaks etc. However, I seem to get tired easily, like for the past 2 years or so, I did try some supplements, they do improve my energy levels throughout the day but now the effect seems to be watered down. Coffee do help at the start, but now I'm basically immune to coffee, I once slept straight after drinking coffee, and caffeine breakdowns too. Exercising is a method i only started yesterday, and seems that i've overestimated my body, as now my body is sore and tired after a one-night's rest (used to exercise daily a looooong time ago though). HAving breaks do help but I seem to spend more time on breaks than actually studying. And now my body feels sore, and my head feels heavy and tired.

142,"throwaway acc because a lot of my friends and family use reddit. first of all, im still in high school, and the last few months havent been too great for me. my friends are aware of this and i appreciate everything they do to help, but two days ago S told me she hates me. and because of the mental state im in right now, i took that seriously. she then later posted on twitter a gif that read: “the things i say, i mean” so i made a post reading: ““i hate you, the things i say i mean :-(”” because i was upset and always rant on my twitter, and i couldnt talk to her about it because every time i get upset because of her she turns it around and puts the blame on me, bringing other people into it and saying false shit about me to everyone. she started blowing up at me over twitter and i did reply at first telling her its easy for me to get upset over seemingly small things, especially if its my best friend telling me she hates me (which she later said was a “joke”) but she took it way out of hand and started getting angry. she was with these girls and noticeably talking about me, so i messaged her on snapchat asking her to please not talk about me behind my back because if she was going to make this into something it should stay between her and i. it got messy, we had a large-ish argument on snapchat— it was basically me trying to explain to her how i feel when she constantly makes my feelings invalid and puts the blame on me, and her retorting with how i always “make things about me” and how shes “sick of this constantly happening” fast forward a few hours i was the first to say im done arguing, i apologised although i had no reason to and have been making effort ever since to make everything right- she still hasnt apologised.
then last night my other friend, lets call her A, she messaged me entailing how all i do is complain and how im so selfish and that what i did was wrong- which is confusing, because then i had to think, what has S told A to make her react like this? A told me just days ago that she cares about me and that shes always here to talk if i need- i’m recovering from a suicide attempt, basically, and they ARE aware of that. do they truly think i want to argue, that i want this drama, when i’m going through stuff like that? so, again the first to try and solve anything, i told A i’m done arguing and that its cool if she needs some time to cool down. today at school, her and S were talking about me and i messaged S ‘cause i thought we were on the brink of ok again, “is A over this?” she replied saying “she didn’t say anything”... the thing is, i was WATCHING them as they read that message, and A did say something, and was looking at me with a stupid, bitchy look on her face as she did so. they also were talking on snapchat at that exact time, which is awkward, because i caught S in a lie. basically, everything has gone to shit and i don’t know whats happening. A is ignoring me every time i message her trying to fix things. another friend, G, told me to remember i’m basically dealing with kids who don’t understand any of this, he also told me i’m not being selfish because (i quote) “you still put people in front of you and do things for them when you should be doing things for yourself”. they’re both my friends, we’re in the same friend group (a small group of about 10 people) and i don’t want to lose them or for them to make anyone else dislike me. am i overreacting? is this just a petty argument that will be over after a week or so? it’s been just over a day.",26Oct2017,1

153,"I've had a rare disease, Klien-Levin Syndrome, for almost a decade now. If you don't know what it is, it's a condition that for a few days to a few weeks at a time, in episodes, I'll have an irresistible, constant urge to sleep, coupled with sleep paralysis upon awaking and I'll disassociate heavily, feeling extremely lethargic and not having a firm grasp on reality. My condition has costed me many jobs, and I was just asking for some general advice, I guess. I'm not sure what to do about working long-term. 

I tried moving back in with my parents a while ago but it just made me more depressed and they live in a not-safe area, and I almost got stabbed, so I took a part-time job, because I can pass interviews fairly easily, and moved in with some strangers from Craigslist. So now I'm working a job I can barely function at, and I'm constantly getting bad marks because I'm too visibly lethargic during work time. 

I've looked at moving out to South Korea honestly and moving into a Goshitel because those seem nice and safe and extremely cheap, (~200-300usd/mo, utilities included), and I could realistically save up some money and get a passport to go out there, but then I'd have to get a work visa and get a job there anyways. I am a coach for an e-sports and I was thinking I could write articles for a website or something?

Applying for disability seems unlikely because you're pretty much wasting your time here in the states to apply for disability for something like this because I can technically perform a job, because outside of actively having an episode, I am a perfectly fine-functioning human.

Posted on a burner account because some of the information I'm sharing is a bit too personal to have on my actual Reddit account.

EDIT:I forgot to mention it, but I've looked into clinical trials, but none of them pay for my specific condition. Also there's no sort of treatment for my condition besides ""dealing with it.""

I can't help but be pissed off. Had my flatmate asked me, I'd have been okay with her friend staying. But she didn't and just opened my room up to someone I didn't know. Am I overreacting?",26Oct2017,132

173,"I live with 5 roommates in an apartment near our campus. We’ve lived together for just over a year. As far as roommates go, things are pretty good, no dramatic stories to be told.

The issue I’m experiencing has to do with chores and cleaning. We attempted a chore wheel when we first moved in, but most roommates neglected their responsibilities until the point came where they didn’t want it, and agreed “we can all take care of things when it becomes obvious it need taking care of.” This has not been the case. 

I’ve silently had to take on most of the responsibilities, which stresses me out and takes up a lot of time. For example, since the chore wheel, I’ve been the only person to take out the recycling for almost a year. What aggravates this is that he recycling gets to a point of extreme overflow, which gets out of control until I have a moment to get to it. No one else bothers to take care of it. As you can imagine, things like dishes, debris on the floor, bathrooms, and other general tasks are similar, and mostly have to done by me.

I mostly accept the situation and am proud of myself for maintaining the cleanliness in the home, but I’m beginning to feel abused by this situation. I feel like it’s fair for everyone to help clean, and prevent disarray from reaching a critical point that takes a long time to correct.

I am hesitant to communicate, which is an obvious route of handling this situation. In the past I expressed my feelings, which have generally been met with extreme defensiveness, and anger. It hurts me when my ideas are met with resistance. 

I wonder how I can initiate a conversation to be more productive, and help me get assistance from my roomies.

It was a one month job folding boxes. It was great and I wish I could keep working there but they only needed me for a short time because they were understaffed. 

I've applied  at so many places and have only gotten about 6 interviews. I'm really shy and terrible at selling my personality/ skills to people. I also don't want to bullshit my resume and say I'm super confident etc. because I wouldn't be able to fake it. I've had multiple interviewers tell me to not be so nervous (which bloody makes things worse). Basically I've screwed up every interview because I'm too shy and nervous and end up giving idiotic answers to questions.  I think that reflected in my resume too so I re-wrote it a while ago. I think it sort of helped? I'm not sure. 

Anyway, I finally got another interview! It's tomorrow at a clothes store. I was hoping I could maybe get some advice. I have trouble answering those 'what would you do if a customer asked you ....' sort of questions. I don't know why. Just trips me up. Any sort of advice would be great.

183,"Today, I realised I didn’t have a mother.

As I lay curled in my bed in the fetal position, crying so hard I could have vomited, I longed for comfort. I thought about my mum coming and comforting me - this only made me cry harder, as I realised that the source of the tears came from her.

Let me dial back - for as long as I can remember, my mum hasn’t been happy. She’d always have random bursts of lashing out, and there was a long period of time (read as: years) where she was in her room. My mum would aways talk about how neglected she was. How badly the family treated her, how she felt she had no support, and how she had done so much for the family with nothing in return. She likes to diminish the way I felt about things, such has her implying I was too fat for the first 18 years of my life, and warning me that my bold snappy personality would result in people leaving me, as only my family would “put up with me”. 
It’s strange you see - as far as I’m aware my mother was very supportive of my endeavours, always proud of my achievements. There would just be a regular thing of how awful of a person I was. 

It was my birthday two days ago. I turned 23. I didn’t get anything for my birthday, which is not really an issue because I am not strapped enough for cash not to be able to buy myself things. I sort of explained to my mum that more than anything, it just would have been nice for someone to think about maybe getting something I would like. Just thinking of me, putting in a little effort, and more than anything just being interested in making me feel loved.
She accepted this and said that she knows for next time, “however”, she was incapable of giving that to me, or wanting me to feel loved 100%. She said her reserves for that sort of thing were depleted.
That to me, in a way, meant that loving me was conditional; dependent on the way I treat her. 
Now don’t get me wrong, I can be mean. I just hold so much resentment towards her that I’m still figuring out, however I don’t think I am so horrible that it garners a lifetime of feeling attacked. 
She told me that as soon as I was capable of bullying her (age 4 apparently), I did. There is a lot of blame pushed upon me for things that happened in my childhood.

I can’t even really remember what went down in our 3 hour long conversation today, but it is the same old story of her being an almost perfect mum, giving everything to the family, getting absolutely nothing in return and getting angry and resentful to us because of it. She told me that a couple of months ago she considers picking up and leaving, I guess in a sense emancipating from her daughter. She says she has no unconditional love for me. Every time I mention something about how I perceive what mothers should do, she asked me to produce evidence or a handbook as to where I got this information on.

I asked her to write me a list of all the things I’ve done wrong. I don’t know, she may very well be right, I may be a terrible person who cares about no one but herself and is a menace in all peoples lives. It’s just not really the response I get from anyone else except her.

Now, my fear, and the strong feeling I get about this whole situation is this: no matter what I do, nothing will ever be good enough.

I feel motherless. And looking back now, I don’t know that I ever did have one fully.
I don’t know if my mother actually loves me. I don’t know if she ever did. And what makes me just.. just so sad, and breaks my heart into a million pieces, is that I don’t know if she ever will.

I've been having sex since I was 13 and have never had an orgasm with another person during sex, foreplay, even with toys.

188,"I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 9 months for many reasons, but mostly because I just don’t have the same feelings for her as I use to.

I ended it about a week and a half ago and at first I believed it went well (as well as a break up can go). I hated breaking up with her. She is such a great person in so many ways and one of those kind of girls thats so sweet it makes your day. I love the girl, but not in that way anymore. I don’t know what happened but for the last month of our relationship I started having feelings that we might not be meant for each other and as time went on it just got worse. So I didn’t want to lead her on any longer with all of this. I would never say this to her, but I am very content with my decision.

So Like I said, she has suffered from severe depression all of her life and thats why I had to be very careful in how I go about it.

When I had the talk it was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. Like I said, she is the nicest person I know.
I broke it off with her in a way that she knew that I still cared about her and will always be there for her. She tried to tell me that she would do anything to get me back and that she’s never loved someone like she does me. This made it even harder. 

Eventually though, we both “seemed” to understand that this relationship had come to an end. I will admit I was a little worried that I was too nice about it and that I should have been more firm with my words. But this is so hard because of how good of a person she is. I have only seen her cry once outside of this break up and I literally had to try not to cry too. 

Her depression scares me in particular because, while she has never done anything suicide related, she is extremely fragile. Especially when it comes to being alone. It’s the one thing that scares her the most and depresses her the most.

So knowing how she hates being alone I knew leaving there she would try to text me that day or at most 2 days after, but it has not stopped for over a week.
I get text like “Good morning hope you have a great day today:)” or sometimes asks what I’m up to, to try and start a conversation with me. And the worst is that she tells me she still loves me and thinks about me. 

At first I would send back small stuff trying to be nice like “Thanks ******, I hope you do too.” But when I kept getting text I tried not responding but she kept texting me. Looking at my phone and seeing her name just instantly depressed me. Finally about 2 days ago I had to be up front with her and said something along the lines of “I can’t do this anymore. I”m sorry for everything, I still care about you but this doesn’t feel right for me” That was a very condensed version but you get the point. And I swore that she would get the point. But still she is texting me. She just text me “goodnight:)” while I was typing this. 

I need a way to tell her that I am done. DONE. But without sounding like an asshole like that. 
She’s always been a friend of mine and then we started dating. I don’t know how to do this.
I don’t know if its smart for me to go over there again to reaffirm what the situation is or if I should text her or if I should just ignore her. 

I just want all of this to be over with.

TL;DR: Broke up with the nicest but sadly severely depressed girlfriend who won’t stop texting me and saying I love you. Trying to end it without hurting her or her hurting herself.

190,"I live in a two bedroom college apartment with four roommates. It’s a pretty small apartment (795 sq feet) but we can have people over from time to time to stay the night with reasonable comfort. 

One of my roommates, let’s call her B, wants to have her friend (who is also her boyfriend’s sister—let’s call her S) stay with us while her apartment is being cleaned/fumigated for bed bugs. The other three roommates and I share the concern that allowing S to stay with us may spread the bed bugs to our apartment. 

B has told me that if S can’t stay with us, she might be homeless and drop out of school. S is really stressed out with school at the moment, and is on the verge of a breakdown now that she has bed bugs. 

I don’t have all of the information about what the university might do for S while her apartment is being cleaned, or if they’re actually going to completely evacuate the apartment. So there’s a slight chance I could be worrying a lot over nothing, because the university might provide her with a place to stay. But I’m pretty worried. 

S is a pretty nice gal, a little nutty, but very nice. I want to help her, but I don’t want to get bed bugs. I’m a bit of a clean freak and I’ve known people who have gotten bedbugs before. They’re so hard to get rid of and so awful. 

How should I proceed? If we can ensure 100% that the bugs won’t travel to our apartment, I’m okay with S staying with us for a week or two. But how do we make sure that they won’t follow? How can I help S get them out of her apartment? 

Is it okay if I say no to B? I care about S and want to help, but I won’t get bed bugs doing it. It would kill my anxiety and really stress me out. 



TL;DR: my roommate (“B”) wants to let her friend (“S”) stay with us while her apartment is being cleaned for bed bugs. We live in a small, college-owned apartment with 4 people total. How can I make sure that the bed bugs don’t spread to our apartment if we let S stay? How can I say no without feeling like an awful person? What can/should I do?

193,"I have a friend who has been married for over a decade now to a husband who cheated on her throughout their whole marriage.  She's cheated on him once several years ago because of what he was doing.  She hasn't left him because they have three kids, she didn't have a job up until recent times.  She's been working towards saving enough money to leave.  The arguments and fights that they have been having the last few years have grown steadily worse, lasting hours and sometimes multiple days off and on.  He wants her to work on the marriage even though she tells him she wants a divorce. He uses the kids as reasons why she can't leave (says she's selfish and will ruin their lives). He argues with her anytime she tries to go out with friends or even family.  He tries to control almost every aspect of her life, even tried to prevent her getting a job initially.  He complains that she doesn't treat him right, that she needs to work on the marriage and until she agrees to do what he says the arguing continues.  She is tired of everything and wants out.

My question is, is what can I do do help in the situation?  I've offered her and kids a place to stay, to help financially, and I listen and give advice if I can.  She refuses because she wants to do this on her own without assistance, even from family.

194,"**TL;DR** An anonymous coworker went to HR claiming there was an issue with my attendance at work. My boss brought it up with me to double check but has no issues with my work. Now I go to work feeling like I'm looking over my shoulder. I'm upset that someone has been able to take away my comfort of coming into work. I'm thinking about talking to my boss again about this new discomfort and I want your advice.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**And now for the full story...**  
&amp;nbsp;  
On Monday my boss was out of the office but scheduled a meeting with me for Tuesday. The meeting had no details so I knew something was wrong. Being the anxious and curious person that I am, I asked what the purpose of the meeting what. My boss's reply was that it was to have a talk about my annual review, which was something I had been asking to do. (We do reviews in February and I do like to meet with my boss every now and then to make sure I'm making progress towards my goals for the year. They give good pay increases when you meet and/or exceed your goals.) I knew this was a good reply on her behalf, but I also realized there was something else to talk about. I let it be, she had given me my answer.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Fast forward to the meeting on Tuesday**  
&amp;nbsp;  
We actually did start out by going through my previous annual review and I ended up getting some great feedback on how I could realign my priorities and got praise for the tasks I had already completed. At the end of the meeting my boss said ""And there is one other thing I want to bring up. Someone approached HR with a perceived attendance issue"". Apparently someone had gone to HR anonymously and noted or complained about me seemingly not being at work when I should be. My boss ran through a few notes she had about the days I had worked from home which she had approved and asked a few questions about my work habits. She actually said ""I'm thinking maybe they just walk by your desk whenever you use the restroom, because I'm not seeing any issues with your attendance."" We talked about a few things like the cause of my working from home a few times like a gas leak at a house I had just purchased and my tendency to get migraines. Essentially my boss had my back. She mentioned that she would tell HR about a few things, like the migraines that render me useless hence why I have been allowed to work from home (which I offered to provide a medical note and copy of prescription for) and that sometimes I work from headquarters (a different building) and often take my laptop with me to meetings in order to take notes and share information. Her only advice was to make sure I put up a post-it on my cube when I know I'm going to be away from my desk for an extended period of time. Something I'm typically good about doing anyways. I asked if there were any issues with my work or if any coworkers had complained about not being able to get ahold of me and she said there were none. I've never had anyone come to me and ask where I was, or say they couldn't get ahold of me for some reason.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Now it's Thursday and I have this gross, pissed off, uncomfortable feeling. I feel like I'm being watched. I never used to give a second thought to how I went about my day and now it's all I can think about. I feel robbed, like this person who complained has taken something away from me. I've gone through several different scenarios in my head as to why someone would do this and aside from actually not being able to get ahold of me for some reason and not feeling comfortable bringing it up with me or my boss directly, I can't think of one reason that isn't petty for someone to do something like this. Honestly, it doesn't matter why it was done (unless there was some way in which I impeded their work), what I want to know is how to deal with what I've been dealt.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm thinking about taking a few minutes to discuss this discomfort with my boss. I want her to know that this claim, which she has dismissed as unfounded, has affected my working environment. I feel like I've got a boogy man over my shoulders watching me now and I don't like it. My goal in talking with her would simply be to communicate this new feeling. I'm not looking for the other person to get reprimanded, but if their perception isn't valid, then that should be communicated to them. I want to know if I need to be worried about someone taking photos of me away from my desk anytime I have to pee. Enough ranting, I think you get the idea.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**So what do you say? What do you think? Should I let it be? Would speaking with my boss be a good thing? Have you had experiences like this?**  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Few final notes in case people think they are important:**  
*  I do not know the identity of the person who submitted this note/complaint.
*  I do not know if my boss knows the identity of this person. In speaking with her, it didn't sound like she knew who it was. I guess this because she has been around for so long that she knows the people I work with and has a good sense of their work ethic. If she knew who it was, I would imagine she would have been able to provide better guidance on how to deal with this person's note/complaint.  
*  I do not know if the person gave specific examples of when I was gone.  
*  Working from home is not often allowed at my company due to past bad experiences. My boss actually works from home in a different state, which is also extremely rare for my company. This has put me in an interesting position. Both myself and my other main coworker are allowed to work from home for personal reasons. Anytime we intend to work from home a note is place on our cubes in order to let others know that we are still available. We also need to seek approval from our boss in order to get permission to work from home.

199,"Hello,

I'm a post-grad university student. Today my group complained to our course director about a project we have been assigned by another teacher. We all felt the project was BS, and didn't really wanna do it, especially because all the other groups got way better, more practical projects.

Now, I'm very honesty and direct, so I told our course director right away that the project was BS and we felt that our time wasn't being valued. I complained that the project did not live up to post-grad standards, and we would like to do another project.

Afterwards, my group mates told me I was very harsh and used a strong language. That I should perhaps tone it down a bit in the future, cause even though everything I said was correct, I could've said it more diplomatically. 

So I'm feeling horrible right now. Not cause I spoke my opinion, but because I'm afraid my professors think I'm a troublemaker and unappreciative of their work. I'm in an industry where network is everything. My professors know a lot of people, and they are responsible for getting us really good placements with companies once we graduate. I'm afraid they wont do that for me or put in any effort, cause of my behaviour today. 

I already apologised via email to the course director for my language, but I'm not sure what to do now. Basically, I'm feeling like shit, and I'm afraid they can impact my career negatively now. I've only been at this school for one month, so it's not like the professors know me personally either. 

Maybe this was more of a rant, but any advice is appreciated. ",26Oct2017,1

I've been very ill for the past month, literally every flu symptom on and off, too sick to bother getting out of bed. I haven't been able to eat, take my medication for mental illness, or get up and go to the doctor. I have gone recently, but was unable to get a doctor's note. I told one of my professors that I've been ill and she accepted that (I've been a genuinely awful student otherwise, which honestly is because of the not taking meds thing) but I missed a midterm and she asked for a doctor's note. I forged one and it looks legit but I don't know if I should send it in. If I don't, I can't take my midterm and will almost certainly fail the class and maybe lose my scholarship, but if I send it in and she investigates whether my doctor wrote the note, I will most certainly be kicked out of school.

I don't know what to do. I'm thinking I can also present it during class and say I need to show it to my other teachers and I can't waste paper (it's a general excused for x amount of time note) so she can't investigate, or I can drop the class. I could also allow the mental breakdown that's been building to occur and see if that can get me extensions. 

Note: My professor speaks English as a second language so I don't know if that'll affect the outcome.

Now, I picked HVAC as a trade. Recently she asked if I truly liked what I do, and I said no. She said ‘ Why did you decide to go into it then? And I said ‘ Because it’s the most practical thing to do. It doesn’t matter if I enjoy it or not’ 

She just sighs and I feel her silently judging me.

The only thing I really enjoy doing is boxing. In the gym I transform from a quiet dude to an animal in the ring and a butterfly on my feet. How ever, it’s not like I can quit my job or even slow down to train full time and try to go pro and earn a living at it.

I've changed my major 3 times already and as of now don't know any major that I'd really love to get into with class scheduling beginning soon.

She has seen a psychiatrist in the past about the issue but it clearly only dampened the damage. The trauma from that still (understandably so) causes issues that affect our relationship.

I do, however, feel anxious at the prospect of this action since I think the red-headed gal would be offended, made uncomfortable, and possibly black-list me from her group of friends, of which I, too, share some friends. The school is very small and any black-listing will be socially fatal; I just want to be precise and considerate in my course of action and would like to know if I should ask the red-headed gal for permission, drop the case entirely, or simply do as I want to do (and ask the other gal out).

217,"Hi, this is an awful post to make but I need to do it so we can figure out how to get justice from this and let the world know what kind of horrible injustice is going on for money and to save face.

My son goes to an all boys school in my country Trinidad &amp; Tobago. It's a Prestige school named Fatima College, a highly selective Roman Catholic school that's assisted by the government. A lot of students there are from rich and powerful households. Only a few students there are from average income households. A few days ago a child was raped by another boy in one of the classrooms. There was no action taken by the School until a video started circling Social Media of the rape, the entire country was outraged and that's when the Government, School and Police decided to respond. 

They all said the boys were playing and that's normal to play that way but the country has yet to hear from the boy who was abused or his parents. Children and teachers in the school have said he was raped and it's being covered up. I ended up looking at the video to judge for myself and you can hear the boy screaming in agony and terror. You can see his hands pinned behind his back and you can clearly see he is being sodomised in the video. This is being covered up and swept under the rug by those in the highest positions of the government, the boy and his parents are being silenced just to protect the school. Is there anything that could be done by his parents?

Here is a link to some articles saying it's a hoax and the government trying to cover it up, I've also linked a video with people speaking up about it and saying it's no hoax. I'm not sure if to link the video in fear of getting banned for linking a violent act of a rape but if I can or should so you all can judge for yourselves then let me know.

Focusing on studying after high school wasn't an option. I tried my best to study and work at the same time, but ended up failing, or having to drop off. While I don't have any degree to vouch for it, I do have some skills that I picked along the years, mostly as an office worker. I currently have a very good job, and I'm quite happy with it.


But I feel pressure to start studying. I know it might be too much, working full time, commuting 2 hours each day, and adding 3-4hs of classes to it (plus another hour or so of commuting) is really daunting.


What I currently have is: 
* 1 year (out of 3) of System Analyst trade school
* 1 year (out of 3) of Graphic Designer trade school


I am passionate about making art (Although I don't think I'm very good, I consider myself more of a hobbyst), I was thinking about getting a shorter Concept Art course (9 months) instead of a full degree. But I'm unsure.


What hurts the most is feeling like I wasted my life instead of studying like many of my friends and relatives. I know this feeling is toxic to me, but I can't get it out of my head.

When we arrived,  he wanted to come inside for a bit. I said okay not thinking much of it cus I was still feeling ill. So, then it looked like his eyes turned pitch black.

I told him he had to leave. He didn't want to but I told him to please leave. And he finally did. And I totally freaked out after he left.

I'm 16, and I've been having weird, recurring dreams for most of my life. When I was younger (between 6-10) it would be  recurring dream where there is a smooth layer of a playdough-like substance, it gets violently scrunched up, and the 'camera' zooms into the creases. I would always wake up feeling terribly afraid afterwards, and it would disturb the hell out of me. 
Nowadays, I have lucid dreams a lot, and I always seems to be trapped in the same situations in each dream. The one that get repeated a lot is one of a zombie apocalypse (it sounds so stupid but give me a chance to explain). In the dream, I am in my house with my siblings and my mum, and a load of rabid people break into the house and start tearing people in my house apart. I always manage to get free, and when I do, I always end up climbing to the top of my apartment block and jumping off. It's weird because people say that you shouldn't be able to see yourself die in dreams, but I always do, and when I do, I feel relieved. My suicide is the same in every dream, and always ends the dreams. I've had times where in the dream, there will be a knife on the ground, and I think about stabbing myself in the chest but then I am too scared to, so I jump instead. Whenever there is a dream where someone/something is trying to kill me, I make the active decision to kill myself by jumping from somewhere high up, and when I jump I'm not afraid - I'm relieved and I'm happy. 

I want to go to someone about all of this but I feel like nobody will take me seriously, as they are just dreams, but they disturb me a lot.

The sleep specialist determined that I definitely suffer from insomnia, but he also suggested that it's possible that I suffer from sleep apnea.

237,"I work with my boss for about 8 months now and he lost all respect from me and everyone else in the office. One reason is that he has a very short temper. Whoever disagrees with him, he will lose it by yelling at the top of his lungs and cursing. His raised voice was loud enough for HR department to hear him.


Second reason is he is a hypocrite. He said he's ""open to any ideas or input"". But, when our team did speak from our minds or have another opinion, he doesn't listen. He then proceeds whatever project our department is working on with only his work and ideas. Also, one of my co-worker overheard my boss's conversation with his supervisor. She overheard that my boss was complaining how our team, especially me (because he hates me), doesn't listen to him and doesn't give him ideas/input for projects.


The third reason is his lack of office manners to employees and people outside of our office. Related to his yelling, he would also say the F-word or other curse words to our clients or vendors. Sometimes, he hangs up the phone on the clients/vendors abruptly without saying goodbye. But most of all, we scheduled meetings with our clients/vendors, but my boss never showed up. My team and I ended up rescheduling them, which slows down our projects.


Because of his behavior, I lost respect for him (and he probably lost respect for me, so feelings are mutual). I didn't bother communicating with him, especially if he asked me for my input, because he was wasting my time. Plus, he assigned me in projects that I'm not suitable in. For example, he put me in charge of creating some graphic design work to make some logos. Unfortunately, I'm a trained videographer but I did what he tells me anyway.

238,"Some context, this girl and I liked each other and have been out a couple times. We've known each other since freshman year and it wasn't until our senior year of high school that we really started talking. 

  A couple days ago we went on a small hike around a park, both had a great time and kissed. Few hours after I'm home she sent me a snapchat that she wants to stay friends for now, because she can't handle a relationship at the moment with all her college applications, drama rehearsals, her show coming up, and school work. She said she still likes me, and I still have lots of feelings for her. She still sends me cute snapchats, and we always talk. 

How should I go about this for the future when we hangout? I still want this to work out badly. This Saturday night we're going to a ranch to smoke at and hang out.

239,"Hey everyone I am a sophomore in high school and I want to drop AP Chem, but that means I will have 5 classes instead of the required 6 to be a full time student. What does being part time mean? I really want to drop the class because I am struggling in it (71 ATM) and I feel it is negatively effecting all of my other grades. I already have most of my high school required classes done with (ex math, language requirement) for a high school diploma and I am taking Magnet Molecular Biology right now so it’s not like I won’t have a science class this year. I am taking a semester long class second semester so I will be full time for the second half of the year.  

Summary: Want to drop AP Chemistry but dropping it means I will be a part time student for the 2nd 9 weeks (second half of first semester). I meet all other requirements for dropping the class. What does being part time mean and what effects will it have on me?

241,"I was born in Latvia, but I came to live in Ireland when I was three. So I've basically been raised Irish, but I still speak a bit of Latvian. I can hold up a conversation, but my grammar, word collection, and technical words are terrible. 

I'm 16 right now, and I'll have to choose what to do with my life when I'm done school in two years. The problem is that I have no clue what to do.

---

I want to live in Latvia, because I have a lot of family and close, meaningful relationships there. Also, I just love the country. The problem with that is that I would not be able to study well there, or get a good job. I've heard that there are options which teach in English, but if I plan on living and working there, I would have to study in Latvian. This is not an option because my Latvian is too bad. For example, I don't even know what 'multiply' translates to, so taking a course where words like that are used would be extremely difficult.

I hate living in Ireland, but because of what I said above, it is probably the only option. However, I don't know anything about universities (I'm the only person in my family going to go to uni) here, or what I want to do with my life. I'm pretty good at most subjects in school, and amn't very fond of any, so it's not like many career paths are ruled out for me.

---

The problem with studying in Ireland is still that if I move to Latvia, I will find it extremely difficult to find a job in a lot of areas as nobody would want to hire someone who can just about speak the language, when they could hire someone who is good at the language. I've looked into Latvian language courses in Ireland, but there haven't been many results, and my mum is not willing to help me with that.

So basically, I have no clue what to do. I don't know where to study, I don't know where to live, and I don't know what I want to work as.

---

I know that I have two years until I have to make the decision, but I want to start working on it now, because there is a lot of preparation involved if I'm going to move country, and also it would help relieve a lot of my stress.

I'm wondering, can anyone give any advice on what I should do?

I know that you can't make my decisions for me, so does anyone know any steps I can take to start making sense of all this, and make a decision? 

Thank you.

242,"So I've been struggling for a while trying to figure out what I'd like to do career wise, but I always end up going back to wanting to help people struggling with mental &amp; physical health issues who end up becoming addicted to drugs... But I don't necessarily agree with the AA/NA way of finding sobriety and I don't want to get stuck in something where I feel like I'm going against what I believe and know to be true from my experience...

But let me give a little background on me to kind of give you an idea of where I'm coming from...

I have a mild case of cerebral palsy, syringomyelia, and chronic pain from previous injuries. When I was about 20 years old, I tore the ligaments in my arms and was left undiagnosed for 5 months.The main option given to me by doctors was a mix of opiates, muscle relaxers, nerve pain meds etc. After a 4 year struggle of addiction which lead me down a dark path that seemed inescapable, I finally was able to ween myself off of opiates completely, then nerve pain medication, and now I'm working on reducing if not completely stopping my intake of muscle relaxers as well. Throughout my struggles as an addict, I voluntarily placed myself in detox because at the time it was my only safe option to ween off of fentanyl (&amp; I was treated pretty unfairly considering my circumstances). I attended NA &amp; AA meetings, yet found little to no help when it came down to maintaining my sobreity, and in some instances I felt more compelled to continue my opiate usage because I felt more alienated and misunderstood by the programs that were supposed to help me.

In the end, I beat my addiction and continued my sobreity from opiates by own means, in ways that are contradictory to many things that are generally practiced in rehabilitation and addiction therapy services. I find it very counterintuative that the first step in dealing with addiction is in admitting you are helpless, because I only found sobreity by admitting that I WASN'T helpless and only I had the power to defeat my addiction, instead of believing it had the power over me. I also found that it was difficult for me, like many others, to put my faith in a higher power... And in the end, I've ended up using medicinal marijuana and CBD to help with alot of my pain and other symptoms associated to my condition. All of these things are pretty much frowned upon by NA/AA, and traditional rehabilitation/addiction therapy.

After a long and hard struggle with chronic pain and addiction I had to form my own path towards sobreity and I feel like with our country in the midst of an opiate epidemic (one in which I see many of my family and friends struggling with and dying from more and more every day) we need to start thinking of alternative ways to face this issue. It's something I feel very passionate about and I have no clue where to even start. Any ideas on what type of career path I could choose tonwork towards this goal? Any answers would be much appreciated!!! Thank you!!!",26Oct2017,1

245,"The title says the (tl;dr) version. The full story is below.

My grandfather passed away 8 years ago and left his condo and his estate to my grandmother (88,F). 

During the last 8 years, my grandmother continued to live in the condo and slowly lost mobility. A year ago, she was diagnosed with Alzheimers, and 3 months ago, we moved Grandma into a special assisted living home for people with Alzheimer’s.  It costs about $60K a year to keep her there.

My mom (68-F) has power of attorney for my Grandma.

To be able to afford the 60K a year that it costs, Mom will have to use all of Grandma’s remaining savings and sell the condo. At this rate, she has enough money for 5 years. If Grandma lives longer than 5 more years, we will have to figure something else out.

Enter mom’s sister: we’ll call her Aunt J. (64,F) Aunt J’s son, (33-m, we will call him Kyle) was living with his mom (Aunt J) around the time of Grandpa’s death, when Aunt J kicked him out. He went to live with recently widowed Grandma “temporarily.” He stayed for 8 years without paying rent.  Kyle’s unemployed girlfriend (33-F) moved in at some point. Kyle and his girlfriend used Grandma’s credit card and check book frequently to “get her groceries,” stocking up generously for themselves at the same time. They also bought premium cable, internet, an excessive alarm system for the house, and who knows what else. This situation got so out of hand that my mother made it so that she is the only one with access to the credit card, not even my grandma has one (because Kyle would take it). Kyle and his GF are hoarders and have filled the garage with their junk, they brought 2 animals in the house that they didn’t clean up after, he bought a gun into the house that my Grandma didn’t care for, I could go on…

Unfortunately, Grandma became more and more reliant on Kyle for everyday things like preparing food, leaving the house, etc, and after a few years it was clear she could not live alone.

But Kyle. Kyle still lives in the condo with his cat and dog (girlfriend left him) and all of his shit. With some pushing from Aunt J, he got a job at Wal-mart. My mom, in efforts to get an estate sale going and sell the house, gave him multiple deadlines to move out that he has ignored. 

At this point it is costing my grandma $200 per month to keep the condo with association fees, taxes, etc.  This is money she needs to prolong her time at the assisted living home. I can’t even begin to tally the amount that it has cost her over the last 8 years to have Kyle in that house.

Neither my mom nor I lives close enough to Grandma and Kyle to handle this on a daily basis, but my mom comes into town once a month to make sure Grandma’s bills are paid and check in and do her best to motivate Kyle.

How do we get Kyle out ASAP? He and all of his stuff need to be out before we can run an estate sale or fix up the place to sell it. 

To make things more complicated, Aunt J’s daughter Amy (29-F) “borrowed” $10K from Grandma about 4 years ago to “put a deposit down” (or something) for her wedding, which was the day after she asked for the money. Grandma hasn’t seen any of this money. Amy is now married with 2 very young children and bought her own house. She and her husband are real estate agents. My mom is considering asking them to help sell the condo, and use the money to pay back Grandma, but we all know that won’t work. 

Pursuing legal action seems like adding a mess to an already big mess. My mom desperately wants to be done with this situation and she’s almost there. She’s so sick of her sister and her sister’s kids that she has expressed that she wants to “divorce” them after Grandma dies. Mom’s brother (66-M) gave up on the situation, and the other brother is deceased. My mom is so fed up and hurt and defeated that she can hardly talk about it. I want Mom and Grandma to be happy and not get taken advantage of, so I want to give Mom some really solid, foolproof advice to fix this. Reddit, we need your help!

246,"So I met this older guy (39) at the gym that I (28F) go to every single day. We work out together and him and I clearly get along pretty well. We have a lot of the same interests and all that good stuff. Well, a few months ago, we started talking about Game of Thrones and eventually turned into snapchating each other. It started with just being flirty but eventually turned into nudes and such. Well, eventually, the conversations turned into us hooking up. I didn't take it seriously, because he is older than me and also because I have recently (in the last year) have gotten out of long relationship where (12 years together and 5 years married.) Well, after weeks of flirting back and forth, I went back to his apt and we fucked. It was great, exactly what I needed and from what he said he enjoyed it too. But between the first fuck and the 2nd, 3 weeks went by! I literally could not be anymore explicit about wanting to hook up as much as we can (totally no strings attached, I have no desire for something serious right now, and he has already had a vasectomy, which is a deal breaker for me since at some point in my life I would love to have children).

So here is my question: I know that women usually are able to get a guy to have sex with them whenever they want, especially when its no strings attached, so am I working too hard? He mentioned that he felt like he may no keep up with me, but he blatantly talks about having sex with me, but it doesn't actually happen as much as I would like. TIA! ",26Oct2017,1

249,"Hello, I'm renting a house in Knoxville, TN and I haven't been able to get in touch with my landlord for 2 months. The roof needs replacing and the kitchen ceiling has been leaking during rainstorms for months now. I was told roofers were coming in September, but nobody ever showed. In addition to smaller issues, a couple more rooms are starting to leak from the ceiling and I have no idea what to do. 

I've tried calling my landlord over the past couple months, sometimes a few times a day. They don't have a voice mailbox and don't have texting, so there's no way to leave a message. My rent each month goes to a trust and not directly to my landlord, I don't know if that means anything though. Regardless, I've not been able to contact the landlord at all and they've never called me back.

Time passes just like that, and i am wasting my youth and life to pointless things such as being lonely on a friday night while everyone is going out with their friends. 

I tried going to club ALONE, no it does not work really, i tried fitting in but people were too busy having fun with their friends, all i could do a little chat while smoking cigarettes on the balcony, that's it. 

Besides i am 20 years old, you can't go to a park anymore and make friends, people of my age don't really hangout outside anymore, people of my age are busy going to school / work, perhaps a fun night out at the bar / club, travelling with their cars while having fun with their friends, taking a coffee with their bestfriend's, eating at mcdonalds etc..

PS. I hate the things i do right now especially video games.. Do you know the feeling when someone talks to you ( in my case my parents ) and you just go 100% aloof, you watch outside the window, ignoring all the words you hear, feeling emotional that you just wanna break free, go out and live life?! But you can't, time goes by and the more it goes, the more suicidal you feel because how shitty your life really is.

252,"I just quit my previous job, which everyone including my boss said was a shit job. Especially for what it paid and the fact that they illegally made me work more hours than I should have been (part-time). My last day was yesterday, I’ve got another job I will probably get after I go in to shadow. I wanted a break between jobs because my first job made me incredibly suicidal. Which, I’m never not suicidal, but it really made me a lot worse.

Today is my first day off of work, and I just got a call that I am shadowing next Wednesday. And I’m fucking crying because I know I need a longer break than that, but this is the best job option I have but the hours are going to be worse and it’s going to be way more stressful than my previous job, so it may even worsen my mental health more than the first job I had.

I live with my parents, I’m not really old and I believe it’s still acceptable that I would be doing so. They’re extremely shit so I’d like to get out of here as fast as possible but making money to get out is going to nearly kill me and that’s not fucking good. My dad is already bitching about me taking a week break between jobs. Which, I understand if I lived alone that would be an issue and it probably looks bad, but I’m taking what I need, and he doesn’t believe in mental illness so it’s pointless to try to fucking explain that to him.

If I say I don’t want to work there after shadowing, will they never hire me again if I go back later? Is there any way for me to take a longer break? Or do something? I’m not going to inpatient because I am not a danger to myself or others, but I could potentially be if this job makes me worse. And I vowed I’d never go back to inpatient again because it made me worse the first time. 

Is there anything I can do to fix this? Again, I really wish I could handle working there because the atmosphere seems great and the pay is way more than I got previously, but it’s just so fucking hard for me to convince myself that I can handle this shit. I know that I can’t if I’m just crying over the fact that I have to go back so soon.

I don’t have time to get my shit together which was the fucking point of this. A week is not time enough for that. I have a feeling I’ll have to deal with this shit my whole life and that makes me want to drop everything and kill myself right now. 

Does anyone have any advice or anything? Besides “every adult feels like this” because that really doesn’t fucking help and actually makes it worse, since that seems to be a popular thing I get told a lot. Thanks in advance.",26Oct2017,1
255,"So yeah, the title pretty much summarizes my situation and my question. Everyone I know has always assumed I was gay. Ever since I was little, I was interested in girl stuff, artsy things and always hung out with girls. 

As a teenager, I felt as though being gay was the only normal thing for me. It was the only way people around me could cope with my so called “difference”. It was the only way I could keep a certain proximity with my friends in an environment more and more gendered (even sexualized to some extent). It was the only way I could escape de social pressure of masculine conformity and all its toxic bullshit. It was the only way I could live with myself, go about my life and do all the things I liked without thinking I was so abnormal. I mean, when you’re gay, it’s okay to like makeup and hate football. 

The only problem is that I’m not really attracted to guys. Well, I won’t lie and say it never happened, but it felt more like convincing myself I liked them more than actually wanting to be with them. On the other hand, I fell in love, often very madly, for several girls that I met. Most of the time in secret, and surely always unrequited. 

That brings me to 10 months ago when I came out to my friends and my family as straight. After a period of time when people thought I was confused. Some tried to make me realize I was wrong by introducing me to all their most handsome gay friends and dragging me to gay nightclubs. That was unsuccessful. 
And then came the outrage. Some gay friends told me how I was brainwashed and how I had internalized homophobia. Some of my friends were horrified that I had lied to them all those years, when I fact I had lied to myself too for all those years. 
So, now I am more alone than ever: I have barely any friends, no respectable girl takes me seriously in terms of romance, and more importantly: I’m stuck in a hetero world I have never learned to interact in. I’m used to have hot guys telling me how cute I am, buying me drinks and making me feel safe: how the hell am I supposed to learn to do that with girls?

Everything seemed fine with our little vacation and we were in San Diego, CA for the day before heading back to our hometowns by plane the next day. We went to a restaurant and ordered some food. I had noticed that my friend's drink had not arrived yet so I politely asked the waitress if he could get his drink. It turned out the waitress forgot about it and so she quickly went to go make it. My friend, lets call him Aaron, gave me a quick squinted-eyed glare of disapproval. I asked him why he gave me that nasty look and he said that he would have handled the situation differently.

Would you just accept that?"" I realized right then and there that I was out of hand. I apologized to him later that night for it and the matter seemed forgotten.

The next day we were flying back home and on the plane we were discussing what we were going to do when we got back. Aaron said he was going to take a bath. ""A BATH?! that would use so much water"" I said. Aaron responds by saying that actually taking a bath uses less water than a shower. I was certain Aaron was wrong. I respond by saying that my showers tend to be short, between 10 and 15 minutes, and that I've plugged my drain before during these showers and that the bath water would definitely not be enough to take a bath with. By this point Aaron seems to have lost patience with me. He says he'll prove it to me. I say that I seriously doubt he is right. I want to continue the discussion but Aaron is livid at this point and yells at me ""Why do you have to make such a big deal about this? I'm done, I'm done, don't talk to me anymore."" I'm really confused at this point because I thought we were just having at most a heated discussion. I try to talk to Aaron to resolve the matter but he tells me that I'm just making it worse. He tells me that he doesn't want to talk to me for months and that I can find my own way home from the airport(originally he was supposed to take me to the train station). We are silent for the remaining 40 or so minutes of the flight. As we are leaving the plane I tell Aaron that I think he is being a bit oversensitive about the whole thing. And so this is how my friendship with Aaron ended.

After I got home Aaron and I exchanged some angry texts and he tells me that I am always making a big deal about little things that don't matter. He was especially angry at me about me saying: ""What if I slapped you in the face? Would you just accept that?"" the previous day. I then kind of understood better why he went off the rails on the plane. It wasn't a sudden knee jerk reaction, but apparently it had been building up and reached a peak that night at the restaurant. I know I erred that night at the restaurant, but I don't feel like something like this situation should end a friendship? I am having a lot of trouble wondering if I should or shouldn't feel guilty over this, because after all I did lose a friend. What do you think? Was I in the wrong? Were we both in the wrong? Does Aaron need to buck up? ",26Oct2017,1
271,"So, I am in a long distance kindof sortof not relationship thing. My ladyfriend called me up on Skype this morning and I answered, and one thing lead to another, and we enjoyed each others company in the only way two people in other states can. After I was finished, I got up and noticed that the door had been left open. I'm absolutely mortified, because I don't know if one of my roommates was home and walked by. So let me ask: should I say anything to him? Apologize? We're both in our mid twenties and in distance relationships, so I imagine he wasn't scandalized, but I have never been so mortified.

272,"I’m 28 and have always had jobs that didn’t require a whole lot of effort. My name was passed along to a local attorney/businessman and we just had an interview where he offered me that job and I accepted. 

The position is basically his assistant/right hand man. He’s a very energetic, goal driven individual and I can tell he expects a lot from me. It sounds like it’s going to be a learn fast and get right to work type deal and I think he really expects me to really be on his train of thought all the time and get to a place where I’m getting things he needs done before he even gets a chance to ask me to do them.

I’m excited about the opportunity because I feel there’s a lot of growth potential there and there’s a lot that I feel I can learn from him, but I’m nervous I won’t be able to keep up as I’ve never really been in this sort of position before.",26Oct2017,1
275,"I had a test in one of my classes today but my professor wasn’t there for it and had a sub for us. During the test I heard a girl about two rows over whispering but I originally didn’t really hear what she said. Then I hear this woman loudly and rudely say “uhhh I don’t think we’re supposed to be talking during a test”. She said this to my general area. I turned and looked at her because it scared the crap out of me to hear the room go from dead silent to sudden loud noise behind me. She just kept looking down at her test and I looked over at the people in my area and we exchanged the universal “wtf was that all about” look. 

Well turns out that original whispering girl had whispered “remember to put your name down in pen” (you will get points off if you don’t put your name in pen on the test) and I realized that after the 5 people around me started playing telephone and were passing that message down the line to the next person. Also once I heard a person say “remember to use pen” to me it triggered like a quick realization that the whispering girl had actually said that and my brain like put it together (hope that makes sense). Well then that rude lady stands up and leans over the rows and rudely says “excuse me! What is your name? What is your name? What is your name?” And the girl just stared at her and quietly said “it’s blah blah”. The woman then says “okay. Good to know” and just walks to the front of the room, turns in her test and pulls the sub aside and I’m sure she told her that we were all talking and cheating. 

Talking during a test is so stupid, trust me, I know this. You should never talk during a test for this exact reason! So someone doesn’t accuse you of cheating! I’m glad that girl reminded us to use pen because I had forgotten, but I do wish she never said anything so this wouldn’t be happening right now. I’m freaking out. I’m so nervous that woman is going to tell the professor that the group of students around that whisper girl were all talking during the test. I mean yes, 5 students played telephone and moved the message down the row of ppl, but no one was cheating. 

It’s going to be her word against ours. I’m wondering if I should contact my professor today and tell him my side of the story. I don’t want that girl to get in trouble and potentially get expelled. I know what happened, I saw and heard the whole thing so my conscious is bugging me saying “what if she gets kicked out of college and you could of prevented it”. I’m obviously thinking about myself as well. I don’t want to be grouped together in the “group that talks during a test”. Ider if I said anything. I might of said “what did you say? Oh okay” when the person told me to use pen. I shouldn’t of said a damn word. I just never thought one of my classmates would interpret my actions in the wrong way and try to punish me. Learned my lesson though. Never speaking during a test again, my stomach is in knots over this. Cheating is taken very seriously at my university and I could potentially be kicked out and not allowed to attend a different school. My mind is going to dark places. 

I’m worried. I do not want an investigation opened up. (And I also hate that woman’s nasty accusatory behavior).

Should I email my professor my side of the story? Or just leave it alone and wait to see what happens? ",26Oct2017,1

278," Hi there, this isn't my first post here and I hope you guys can help me out so, let's begin. 

 I'm 18 yo, my parents are divorced and I have three sisters. As you may have guessed, I was victim of fisical and psychologic violence from my own mother for almost all my childhood until I moved out with my father, and now that I've grown up I have a lot of interpersonal issues (including insecurity, lack of self-esteem, I find it really hard to make friends and even with the few I have I don't feel comfortable enough to open up and be myself, feelings of loneliness, etc.) 
 
 Ever since I have memory, I've had a weird relationship with my parents. When they divorced (I was 2 or 3 yo, I obviously don't even remember them together and that was never a trouble for me) my sister and I ended up living with my mother and my father was always financially present but I remember times when we didn't saw each other for months. He moved to another city (it actually wasn't far, just 40 min. drive) until I was 6 and we moved to that same city. 
 So to wrap it up, since I can remember they were separated and my father wasn't really around. 

 This leads us to my relationship with my mother particularly. Look, she's not Hitler and I still love her but she did some awful things to me and my sisters. She would frequently beat the shit out of me. She used to hit me with a belt, raw punching me on the face, kicking me in the ribs, using the classic but still op sandal (once she made me take of my shirt and kneel on a corner and started hitting me until she get tired), choking me, depriving me from food for 2 days as a punishment, yelling insults at me every fucking morning before school, telling me that I ruined her life, that nobody loved me, that I was useless, threatened to kill me almost everyday, and a saddly long etc...

 That was my daily basis. I was a pro at wishing I was never born, thinking ways to escape and go living with my grandparents or my father and crying until sleep.
 My sister and I eventually came with my dad, my mother had two other daughters and now days we pretend it didn't happened. I've made myself believe it wasn't that bad actually until recently, when I discovered that the reason of my socializing problems, insecurity and other problems might be that. I googled it and apparently I was a victim of domestic violence and child abuse, and I have a lot of psychological secuels because of that. 

 I guess that what I'm asking is what can I do to overcome all of this and improve as a person. I want to be normal, I want to be able of relating to people properly, stop feeling insecure and seeking for approval all the time. I want to live a normal life and move on.

Pd: I never went to a psychologist since I never thought it was necessary, but some people have recommended me to go but tbh I don't feel confident enough to ask my father to pay it. I don't want him to feel sorry for me.

 Feel free to ask me anything and thank you for reading.

279,I have difficulty concentrating at home so I usually study at the library or the coffee shop- but this adds up since a beverage can be $2-5 and I study every day. What are some places other than the library that I can study at?,26Oct2017,1
280,"Wew ok this is gonna be a long one. I'll rush through the beginning. I met a girl around 4 1/2 months ago and we hit it off immediately. Started spending a lot of time together and were having a really great time. Around a month in she told me she liked being with me but didn't want to start anything serious. I'll admit I was slightly disappointed because I did feel like we were really good together but I didn't mind just keeping it casual. We did however agree to be exclusive as we were having unprotected sex and it just seemed like the smart thing to do.

So this went on for a couple months and things were good and I was content. Even though we never talked about getting more serious it was obvious things were progressing. We were hanging out more often, going away on weekend trips together and making plans for things that were 6+ months in the future.

Anyways a long holiday came up about a month ago. We both already had made separate travel plans so we just said it was no problem and we'd see each other in a week. On the third night of the vacation we had been messaging back and forth all day then around 11pm she just randomly stopped messaging me and didn't respond until 11am the next day. She said she ""lost her phone"" and found it at the end of the night. I immediately suspected something but I wrote it off as dumb jealousy and didn't question her about it.

But, when we got back from our vacations her tone had completely shifted. She was avoiding hanging out with me and giving me 3 or 4 word answers through text. When I asked her why the sudden change she told me she ""doesn't want to be in a relationship and doesn't want to feel tied down"". I was really hurt because I hadn't expected her to change her mind so suddenly. Then about a week later I remembered about the night during the vacation. So I messaged her and asked her ""did anything happen with another guy?""

After some skirting around the issue she admitted that she cheated on me. If I'm being honest it really fucked me up. I thought we were happy and I couldn't imagine why she would do something like that to me.

She says she got blackout drunk and doesn't really remember much of it but knows she cheated and that she would never do something like this sober. I've drank with her enough to know that she does get blackout drunk quite easily. She also says she has been overwhelmed with guilt about it and didn't want to tell me and hurt me. But also decided that if she didn't tell me then she also couldn't, in good conscience, see me anymore. Hence, the pulling away and saying she doesn't want a relationship.

So my question is what do I do? Some people would say if you really care about someone you give them a second chance. Others would say I should cut her out and never talk to her again. I've never been cheated on before so I don't know what to do.

281,"So here's the issue. The high school I would normally go to has a majority of my friends going there, offers internships, and is one of the biggest schools in town. The other high school has five of my close friends going, and offers internships on almost any field. The place only takes in 100 freshman so I'd still have to apply for the first school if I didn't get in.  it's called New Tech and it's meant to try and prepare students for the real world, they give free college courses we only have to pay for the textbook, and they do a lot with connecting with the community, so I'd make more connections for a job.

282,"My boyfriend recently started a job at nationwide phone shop. He got the job but was never told a date for start.

Three weeks later he's told he has to travel over 200 miles for a 3 day training course for the minimum wage job role. He was surprised, but turned up anyway as he needed the job. (expenses were paid and he was paid for his time there) 

His contract was 38 hours a week, but he found he was rota'd in for 45 hours, but working 50 a week. They didn't tell him this and clearly hoped he wouldn't notice, but explained it was for extra training.

On the shop floor, he was not given any training whatsoever and was not allowed to shadow anyone due to staffing issues (nobody stays there more than a few months). The stress of being yelled at by customers constantly but not being given enough time to learn was really stressful for him, especially working ten hour days.

He was also promised a high level of commission when he started the job (which is why he accepted it in the first place), but after asking around, he found out they only receive about 13% of the commission promised.

He's never been diagnosed with anxiety (as he is too anxious to go to the Doctor - go figure!) but has had very anxious tendencies for years. Since starting this job he's had no appetite and was throwing up from nerves before each shift. So I said if he chose to quit for his health then I would support him. So after about a week, he quit. Bare in mind, he's worked retail for three years and this is the first time he's felt this way and it is not something that he does often, at all. 

He went for his debriefing today with the district manager, and he left the meeting feeling horrible. When I asked him why, I find out the manager had basically berated his character, called him a liar, and said ""You're a 25 year old man, you shouldn't be having anxiety.""

I'm so angry about this and so upset for him, that she could treat him that way after he had been lied to about every aspect of the job since he started. Is there anything we can do? ",26Oct2017,1

297,"Greetings!

I live in a nice neighborhood in the heart of east Texas. In August, a man moved in next door and shortly after, visited the houses in the immediate vicinity and brought bread that he had baked himself.

I thought this was a wonderful surprise, as getting to know your neighbors has seemed to be a dwindling concept in recent years. Though I'm no less guilty, as I don't really know any of mine.

Anyways, we talked for a bit, and I come to find his name is Sergei. He was born in the Soviet Union and lived through it's dissolution before moving here in '94. I didn't really ask too much about it, so i'm not sure if he's a communist/Soviet sympathizer, and honestly I don't care. He was a sweet man, and I enjoyed talking to him. 

Well, about three weeks later, he had two flagpoles installed in his front yard and one day when I came home from work, I saw he had the American flag hung on one and the Soviet Union flag (yes, the blood red banner with the hammer and sickle) hung on the other. Both at equal heights. 

It was kind of odd, yes, as I grew up during the last part of the Cold War and flying those two flags beside each other is kind of...ironic? But I didn't care. 

About two weeks ago he knocked on my door, and showed me notes that several neighbors had left him, demanding he remove the Soviet Flag along with a slew of other insults and threats. All of them anonymous of course. I apologized for their behavior, and told him not to worry too much. 

He explained that he understands people here in the U.S. may feel insulted, but that's not his intent. He said that regardless of politics, he's proud of his home country and the Russian/Soviet people and only wishes to honor them in the same way we do here hanging the American flag outside our homes. He mentioned his love for this country and its opportunities, and loves flying the American flag as well.

I told him I understand. I don't know where he had lived before here, but I made sure to explain that the South can be quite conservative when it comes to that stuff, but like before, not to worry too much about it.

Well, last week, someone cut his Soviet flag down in the middle of the night. I talked to him a couple of days ago, and he doesn't know what to do. I suggested it may be a better idea to perhaps hang it in his house rather that outside, but he didn't seem to keen, and mentioned he'd buy another.

So what do ya'll think. I mean, I don't think he's in any danger, and I understand it's a little odd. But that doesn't mean someone has the right to take another's property obviously.

He's a nice man, and I just want everyone to be happy. Any other advice other than ""don't worry about it""?",26Oct2017,24

In the interest of not being put in the middle of it, when Chad tells me this (he was drunk by the way) I decide to keep my mouth shut. Eventually Stan's wife admits to him of her and Chad's involvement. Stan confides in me about it, and asks me if I knew. Again, in order to stay out of it, I decide to lie and say I had no idea. Stan has not confronted Chad yet, nor have I told Chad that Stan has been made aware of his indiscretions.


What its come to, is that I'm on the fence about weather or not I should continue to keep my mouth shut, or if I should give Chad a heads up. 


If I tell him (and Stan told me not to btw), when Stan decides to confront Chad, Chad is probably going to do everything in his power to avoid Stan. That will be a dead give away that I tipped him off.


If I keep my mouth shut, and he is blindsided by the confrontation, Chads first instinct will probably be that I told him, not the wife. Then Stan will find out that I lied about knowing. I feel like I have been avoiding Chad, because I feel like if I see him, or talk to him, I'm going to tell him.

Always with her best friend and her friend's boyfriend. She ended up breaking my heart and dumping me which destroyed me because this girl told me she wanted to spend her life with me. We broke up then a few months later and she messages me. Second message reads ""Do you still love me?"". I was shocked but at the time I really thought I still loved her so we started talking again. Now three months have gone by and we aren't anything official. She keeps begging me saying she made the biggest mistake of her life breaking up with me and she wants to marry me and all this. Now I'm in a horrible situation because while I once loved her and wanted to spend my life with her, if I'm being truly honest with myself, I don't think I love her. I think I love the memories we had and the idea she represents. But I still find myself thinking about her all the time. I don't know what to do. Please help.",26Oct2017,1
316,"It started when I went to the bathroom (girls bathroom) and I saw a note written on one of the stall doors. It had a girl’s name, details about how much she wants paid for sex and something else (I’m clueless about this stuff, I’m forever alone) and the girl’s phone number. I don’t know her personally but I recognise the name since she bullies me and a few others. I do know that she’s underaged though.

I took a photo of the note just in case and checked the other doors for more clues. I usually don’t intervene with what the younger students are doing (I’m 19) but this looks serious.

Should I tell someone in school about the situation or should I take matters into my own hands? Or should I ignore it? I don’t care about what she’s done to me in this case, I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. What if she’s being forced to do it and there’s also a note in the boy’s bathroom? Or maybe it could just be a joke (since it’s in the girls bathroom) and I’m overreacting.

It could be dangerous to call the number and try solving it myself since I’m an adult and she’s a child. I thought of telling someone, getting them both in the same place then letting things go from there but I don’t know.

If I was to tell the school it would have to be tomorrow since after that we are off for a week and that might be too long.",26Oct2017,4

319,I just started playing guitar a week ago and bought this game that was recommended called Rock smith (2014 edition) and new there was a PC version and PS4 version but I got the console version and I think I made a mistake because I don't know if I can get custom songs on it.I want to be able to play my type of music too so I was wondering if there is there a way I can get LCD or custom songs on PS4 Rock smith??,26Oct2017,1
320,"I am an 18 year old male student in the US. After doing some research about why I’m constantly sad, irritated, and full of dread (amongst many other issues), I really think I have depression. I want to talk to my dad (parent I live with) about possibly going to see a doctor, but I feel like he won’t believe me or will think that I’m overreacting or that I’m just wrong. In the past, I have used Xanax and painkillers (not at the same time in my life) but I have never had any issues stopping, never had withdrawals or anything and don’t do that kind of stuff anymore. I know that my father thinks I will abuse medication if I have it, and as a result would try to intervene in it being given to me (he is the type of person that would rather deal with a headache than take Advil). I can’t just tough it out anymore, but I’m afraid my dad will just think I’m weak if I were to ask for help... what should I do?",26Oct2017,1
321,"I have horrible credit. I'm working on it. My lease is up and I am vacating my current rental on Oct 31 (costs way more than I can afford, roomates have left and wife and I separated, leaving rent all on me). I have been spending hours every day (while I'm supposed to be working) for a couple weeks trying to find an apartment that would be a good fit. Dozens of calls made and messages left with homes for rent and never got any call backs so switched to looking at apartments. The few that I find, I am not eligible for. I've applied to two now and gotten two denials and each one is ~$50 app fee I don't get back. I have a great job gross ~3200/mo employed over a year and can produce many letters of recommendation if needed. No criminal history and NO bad rental history either, but am still denied. Credit score ~540 and many things in collections, student loans in deferment but make ""total"" debt in the many tens of thousands.

Phoenix, Az, have 2 dogs, one small and one large but have a real letter from my therapist (licensed etc) for emotional support needs. I have my 2 small kids on the weekend so I don't want to live in the absolute shittiest ghettos but I am by no means being ""overly picky."" Cosigner not really an option. 

Tried an apartment finder service, nobody would answer the phone for him either when I was there and I haven't heard back from him since that meeting a few days ago. Craigslist nothing but scams.

Finding it humbling to be 4 or 5 days away from legitimate homelessness in spite of making almost 40k/yr. Don't know where else to post this so I guess I'm looking for any kind of advice. I wouldn't even mind being homeless for a little while except that means I would probably have to loose my dogs and that is not something I'm okay with.",26Oct2017,1
