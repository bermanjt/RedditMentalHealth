0,"My boyfriend (Joe) and I have a pretty full, strong relationship. He's everything I could ask for in a man, except for maybe he's too sarcastic. But his brother (Nate)...

He's okay with ""stealing"" married women, finding sugar mommas to pay for his dope and alcohol, stealing when he can't, and he doesn't feel the need to support himself at all. He'd rather just beg from everyone else. Not only that but he doesn't have any respect. We tried to help him but the more we try to give the more he wants to take. And he doesn't care if we end up with nothing left. He just moves on until we have what he wants again. And I'm not okay with being treated like that.

My boyfriend and I have been looking into buying a property so we can really start working on our life together. His dad (knowing that Nate doesn't want to take care of himself) offered to pay for half the property if we give Nate a place to stay so he doesn't have to worry about his son anymore. Nate isn't allowed on the property were renting now, either from stealing from one of the other renters or from taking the landlords girlfriend. He doesn't accept or deny either of them.

Joe wants us to help him, because he can't help himself. But we've already spent tons of time and money on him and he's given us a bowl of weed and $20 dollars in return. But then he made us smoke the bowl with him.

Nate, although not allowed on our current property, doesn't give a shit. He's almost gotten us kicked out a couple of times by showing up drunk yelling off our porch until the landlord comes down. I ask him every time he comes over to leave, but he thinks I'm just being a c*nt so he doesn't.

I've tried to tell both Nate and Joe that if Nate really didn't do anything to the other renter and the landlord that there's no reason he wouldn't be able to sit down and talk with him to figure it out, but he won't, which makes me think he did do something bad, and doesn't want to admit to it. Either way hes not taking account for his actions. And I don't know if I want to live with that my whole life. I've tried telling Joe that, but he thinks his brother needs the help anyway.

Sorry if this is confusing. I just have no idea how to go about this.",26Mar2017,1

3,"Two days ago, the area around the upper right side of my mouth started to hurt. It's a deep pain, like you would get with teeth. 

That being said, I don't know if it's the gum or the cheek. It feels like the cheek hurts on the inside, but the are is so far back where the gum and cheek connect that I have no idea what is going on.

The pain is a 4-5/10, and it hurts when I open and close my mouth or yawn, sneeze, etc. 

It's not keeping me awake or preventing me from eating (yet) and it's a weekend, meaning there are no dentists I can go check in with at the moment.

I've read online that people get infections and die from this stuff, so that's got me all worried and i'm debating whether to go to the ER in case this is very bad news. 

What should I do in this situation? Wait it out, or get my ass to the emergency room? I don't want to land myself in a terrible situation..",26Mar2017,1

8,"I work at a job I truly loathe. I make just over $20/hour but cannot stand the company I work at. I'm in ""sales"" but most of the time is spent dealing with problems that arise with our customers due to management issues like Poor quality, late orders and all wonderful things like that. Rarely do I actually sell things, typically deal with problems and act as the punching bag for angry customers. Been like this the past couple of years and I am just getting to a point that I want to say fuck you all and leave. Fortunately I have a family at home that keeps me from doing that. 

Now here is where the question comes in.. I went to school to be a mechanic. Never finished but I am close to finishing. I know that it will be a pay cut by a couple of dollars per hour but I think I can truly swing that. What would you do in this situation? I'm afraid I'll leave and it will be awful, but I hate feeling like I have to stay at my current job and continue dealing with being miserable because of a ""what if"".

10,"I am currently feeling empty, I really don't find joy in anything. I am a college freshman and the transition has been tough. Nothing excites me anymore, I don't feel passionate about anything, I don't even know if I have hobbies. I feel alone, like I can't really express myself to others. I have two very close friends and many acquaintances but I always end up feeling the same way. 

I am here, on a Saturday night sitting alone. I love being alone, it gives me time to think, but seeing all these other people go out and have a fun time hurts me. I don't know why. In high school I could go to school and then come back home and seek refuge in my room, nobody would bother me. I would still go out every few weeks with friends its just I find my strength in thought. 

I question if my University is right for me, I chose a second tier private university close to my home, and passed up on opportunities to go to first tier schools. The environment is not right here. When I visit my friends at other schools people take their work seriously and put in real effort. Here there is no such thing, its just a hang out session all the time. I have been trying to find my ""group"" but never really got there. 

I have tried clubs and reached out to people but being introverted i'm not the best at it. Because of this I have built a reputation. People see me as a nerd or try hard at school. But if theres anything thats keeping me going right now its learning. I have taken up language learning as my only hobby so I can fill my time with meaningful work. 

I met a girl, that got me going again. We had tons of similarities and really hit it off over politics, school, and hobbies. But this is no more, I waited too long, about five months too long. While she liked me at first, me never asking her out relegated me to the friend zone. And now, we are just friends, someone she can bounce ideas off or run to with questions over homework. Problem is, I have a different idea of what she means to me. I want to date her, why can't I? Because I am a bitch. I've never actually asked her for her number or even a date. All I ever did was talk with one of her friends who explained that she ""doesn't think of me like that"". Its weird now though. I fucked this situation like you wouldn't believe. I am expecting the obligatory ""ask her out you pussy bitch"", but you know thats hard to do. My new strategy has just been avoid her and pretend like I don't know her. Thats hard to do, especially when you pursue them for 5 months. The crazy thing is she does not understand how influential she was in my life and still is. She added new parts to my character and gave me new reasons to find joy. But to her I'm just Chet, the quiet, semi loner, who has never been seen doing anything but school work.  

This is just a sorry rant on reddit, but I can't help it. I am trying to get some passion, I am trying to make some damn friends that like cool shit, I am trying to grow a pair and ask out this girl. But everyday I do none of that and instead let the days tick down to summer. I don't know do I just pack it in and wait until next year. Do I finish it and rip my heart out by accepting that its probably not going to work out with this girl? Any advice to help me out of this pathetic state is greatly appreciated. 

P.S. I can't transfer schools because I am locked in here on scholarship. So that means I got 3.25 more years with these all stars! ",26Mar2017,5
11,"Now I know this topic is probably too cliche at this point but I really want to post this. Before I start I may sound like a ""edgy teen"" but I'm really not.

So I'm 14 getting into highschool in Fall and I'm attracted to one girl who is year younger than me. I don't know much about her but I really like her for now. My problem is, I don't know how to approach her. I'm neither too popular nor too attractive (at least I think that). She is friends with some girls from my class. 
I'm not that social (i'm not going out too much apart from school) so she probably doesn't now much about me.
In case this may help I play guitar and I'm really into video games (not just playing them a lot, starting to get into developing, designing and story telling in them).

So how do I approach her? I don't want this to get heard in my school since some kids here are really ignorant from time to time.",26Mar2017,1
13,"Hello. Today I made a really bad and stupid choice. 

I was participating in a speech contest for which I had practiced really really long for. For some reason, I decided I would not read from the script and try to talk off the top of my head even though they strictly said they would not judge based on that. 

The thing is, I really think I could have won had I not botched up my speech due to the fact that I wasn't reading from script while everyone else were. I can't stop beating myself up for such a stupid mistake. The first prize was a travel fund of 1000$ to Japan. In addition, had I won, I would have received a plaque of honor from my school and 400$ in cash. This was the last real opportunity I had. I still can't believe I was willing to risk all that for some stupid pride not allowing me to read from script.

This is the single most anxiety inducing event I have ever experienced so far. I know people make mistakes all the time, and people have to learn to get over them to grow,  but I really really think my mistake was one that really didn't have to happen. I can't help but hate myself for this. How do I get over this? Can I get over this? It might sound silly and trivial, but to me it's really uncomfortable and sad. It almost makes me want to cry.

Tl;dr: decided not reading from script and fucked up tons of preparation",26Mar2017,2

And it's not even a bad student, I'm in the top 10% of my class. I feel like I worked so hard to get here and it's all for nothing. I just feel so absolutely crushed and worthless. I haven't told my parents yet that I was rejected from every school I applied to. I don't want them to know because I know they'll look at me differently. They had high hopes for me since middle school. I worked so hard on each application and spent hours perfecting my essays. How can this happen? I just feel like this is my fault.

17,"I'm a 22 year old dude who graduated uni last May. Though my parents did pay for my tuition which I'm very grateful for, I've been paying for all other expenses such as housing for years. I got a corporate position over a year ago and since then have been living alone and working. I was not given the option to live at home after uni even had I wanted to; I was kicked off parents' insurance, phone plan, etc., I am completely self sufficient.  

Of all the people my age I know, not a single one has paid their own rent yet. About half are in grad school paid for by parents, and the other half are working but living with parents. None of them pay for any bills whatsoever. My coworkers are for the most part middle aged, and at the youngest a few years older than me. At this point, I feel like I can't relate to anyone my age, yet at the same time I'm just a child compared to my coworkers. I began dating a girl who was still in school, but I felt like I couldn't form a connection with someone who never worked, never paid a bill, and was basically in a completely different stage of life. Additionally, 90% of my friends have moved out of state in the past year.

Where do I go from here? It feels very awkward for me to socialize outside of work with people so much older than me, and it's not like they've invited me to do so anyway. Do I just wait for my peers to catch up, or try to find local interest groups, or what? Or maybe I'm in the wrong for caring about people's life situations?",26Mar2017,2

20,"What's up all,

Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I'm feeling a bit lost and I'm not sure where to turn. About a year ago I started dating this girl and things were going pretty good. Around May, things were going well enough that we decided once my lease was up in September we would move in together. 

I told my best friend/roommate of eight years and he lost his shit. Saying I was making a mistake, shes a horrible person, etc, etc. Our friendship effectively ended there. 

Things have gone well with the girl. We're engaged now and I'm happy about that. My ex-friend packed up and moved across the country, and we now no longer speak. 

But I miss him. Maybe not him specifically as a person, but in having a best buddy to go to a pub with and play video games and shit. I'm not sure what to do. I don't know how to make friends anymore, and I'm afraid if I bring this up with my lady, she'll think I resent her, or blame her for this situation (I don't).

Any advice?

22,"I'm looking for advice regarding disposition of my assets after death. 

Without getting into a whole thing, according the recent medical information I've received I'll be dying presently.  The costs associated with a 10% survival rate is not worth it to me, and I've planned for the eventuality of my demise anyway.

Although I do have some time left, I don't have any bucket list and have done everything I wanted to do at a young age,  and anything else won't be solved with money. 

So here's the problem.  Due to life choices I've managed to acquire between $3 and $4 million in stocks/bonds/insurance/401ks/etc.  I live very simply and put the majority of my income into savings.  But it looks like I won't be needing it after all.  

The actual problem is I don't have any family or friends.  I have no relationship with my biological family anymore and don't really like them much.  I am not currently in a relationship or have any children.  I don't really have any friends around either.  So I don't really have anyone that I want to give my estate to. 

At best I have a couple of drug addict nieces and giving them money will just end up killing them. Also, they're assholes. 

My intent is to make life easier for everyone involved and have taken care of any arrangements for me and my meat bag so no one will have to worry about that. I'm in the process of liquidating everything into cash, so there's no property, no hard to deal with things to liquidate, and all that. 

Since I have no one to leave anything to, my original intent is to put everything into gold/bitcoin and bury it in the woods and leave a treasure map.  I've always had a love of treasure hunts and Goonies style adventures.  

I don't give to much of a shit about the IRS, I'll be worm food. Which is why I won't have an estate to rob.  

What's a good way to give away wealth in an entertaining way where paying taxes is solely the decision of the finder/inheritor without a paper trail?   Legal means aren't important, hence the gold/bitcoin idea.  

Advice I'll be ignoring will be anything related to health concerns, I'm no longer wasting money on that, and I won't give a dime to charity scams, so that's nothing I care about either.  

I'm not directly giving money to any individual, so don't bother asking.  An element of chance or intelligence is a requirement for discovering it. 

Any interesting suggestions if you were in my shoes?   In the end I'll assume at least $3 million will be available as a ""treasure"" to be found or whatever good idea that you have.  Maybe just waste it on something.  I'm not really a ""blow it all on hookers and blow"" type of person, but I'm taking all interesting suggestions.",26Mar2017,72
24,"So I'm now in college. In high school I was an outsider mostly: went through multiple friend groups that all left me, ended up throwing myself into more and more extracurriculars so I just had no time for friends.

Now in college I've really been trying to change things. I'm kind of an introverted extrovert: I love to do things with people, just not typically tons of them due to anxiety. I joined a theater group that's basically a sorority/fraternity that puts on a musical each year starring freshman/transfers. Part of this whole 'new place new me' thing was I was going to audition to be cast for the heck of it, since I'd done drama and choir before for a while but hadn't been in a show for years due to playing oboe. But then over Christmas break I get thyroid cancer, have my thyroid removed, and lose the ability to speak/sing for a while and virtually all the confidence is built senior year HS/first semester college. I end up getting into pit, and it seems fine at first, super fun org.

But lately it's been getting harder. Cast hangs out together all the time and is closest to all the staff members. Crew is close by nature. I'm one of the few pit people NOT in the music school, and we don't socialize in pit, so I'm an outsider. I try my hardest to go to every event, to talk to everyone, but it's so hard. I feel my anxiety all the time, and I just struggle to make jokes or be interesting because I love to listen and learn about people mostly. I'm also really bad at texting and things like that from years of isolation and just preferring talking to people in person. I keep trying to push myself, to ask people to lunch or to hang out or something, but all the time I can feel the fear and anxiety building when I get turned down, or feel like an outsider at parties. I have a few close people, but I try not to talk to them as much because I don't want to be clingy and lose them too. I'm so, so afraid of being alone again and of doing something wrong I feel myself lagging behind everyone in getting close to people, which makes me more anxious and feeds the cycle and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm not sure how to kick this and get closer to people, to stop being so scared of being left behind again, or be shit on behind my back again. I have so little self-confidence anymore that I honestly can't believe a single reason people would want to hang out with me. Help?

TLDR: I have anxiety that's getting worse due to a situation in which I'm once again the outsider. I want to get closer to people, but im stuck on this pattern of anxious self-hate that prevents me due to the fear of them hating/leaving/shitting on me. Help?",26Mar2017,12

In the past three months she has drastically changed. We stopped texting and snapchatting everyday and we barely ever talk at school.

41,"It's been hell for the last 4 years. My sister is 19, has an abusive boyfriend, she abuses my parents, walks all over them and pushes around my mother (started before she had the abusive bf). She messes everyone around, waste's her family member's money(my dad has no money as it is), lies to get what she wants, and I'm pretty sure she knows what she does is wrong. I think she does it because she hates herself and wants us to hate her. She was abused when she was a child, we've took her to counseling and tried to be there for her, but it seems she never really got over it (I assume). She's always had a place to stay, yet she turns her back on us. My mom might ask where she's been and she'll explode in a tantrum throwing fists and turning up the place, no regard for anyone. We're debating weather or not we're doing anyone a favor by allowing her to stay here. If we tell her she can't stay here she'll probably scream in front of the whole neighborhood, break a window, punch hole in the wall and the police will be forced to drag her out(this has actually happened). After that, if we got a restraining order she would without a doubt still come here stupidly and end up in jail. She thinks if she cries and screams enough she'll get what she wants. We don't know what to ****ing do, if we kick her out she probably won't be able to help herself and end up a junkie. If we let her keep coming back here and walking all over everyone. Either way she's most likely going learn the hard way not to mess people around and eventually end up in the hospital.

It's really interesting and my adviser is very supportive, but I find myself not being able to focus and put serious time and effort into this project.  Instead I've been putting my time and energy into things that ultimately will go nowhere.  I've read a bunch of books, gotten into weight lifting, and spent a bunch of time fleshing out an RPG campaign.  Even when I spend time on my academic interests, I decide to start reading some textbooks in my field.  I've probably put in about 6-8 hours of work on my project per week max.

My adviser thinks my progress is satisfactory (although she's kind to a fault, so even if she was frustrated I'm not sure she would say it).

I've tried to be nice and ignore things she's said, for example: she's told him that we are too serious or that I depend on him too much and it's not right. 
Which bothers me, for the fact that I've never done anything wrong to her or her parents, except be loving and kind and help her family if they need it. 

I've voiced that his mother doesn't like me, but he doesn't really see it. She's made the comments to him that I've posted above, as well as commenting on certain things about me, she doesn't ""prefer"" (she smokes cigarettes, she has piercings/tattoos, she dyes her hair alot) . I only voice my concerns with my boyfriend, since he himself doesn't really care for his mom and tells me to ignore.

51,"I work as an IT coordinator at a local secondary school. Have done since aged 16 when I joined initially as an apprentice. My record is impeccable. From the UK.

Tuesday we had a new apprentice staff member be suspended for gross misconduct as she had a party which involved several of our students (a big no no). Because of this several rumours have been floating around accusing her of malpractice and safeguarding issues , between students and staff. We were told Wednesday morning about her suspension from the school.

Today the head of the school said he may/may not need to speak to me later on. Turns out he did so he phoned me and I went to his office. Several allegations have been made against me by a staff member who knows the girl and a student at the college at the school, stating I'd been making up inappropriate lies about what went on and why she had been suspended from her job. This got back to the apprentice girls mother who emailed in.

As I know a boy from the school he approached me with some story, which I told him they were rumours I had heard and just rumours, so he's told some friends (stupid move from me). I did play them down as rumours and nothing more. The student claims I made claims of what went on. When telling his friends this has gotten back to the girls mother who has been suspended. 

They now have been up on a charge of misconduct.

I have stated in a meeting with the head, numerous students have come up to me themselves telling me a rumoured version of events and I have replied with they are rumours and not to be said. These students have heard these rumours from other teachers as I asked where they overheard the story from. Surely these teachers should be disciplined too?

The girls parents aren't happy we've been told she's been suspended and the head asked how I even knew. I replied that my boss told me so he shook his head.

The meeting concluded with him stating he hated his position on the matter and he wanted me to take care and he wanted the discussion to be man to man as he likes me but he can't comment further. He did say he'd like to be in my corner but can't as it's an independent investigation. He seemed relieved when he said he has to make a recommendation to the school governors but again that it was ultimately up to them.

I am having an investigatory meeting soon. I have a union representative.

I never got to tell my grandmother I loved her. I just can't connect with them. And now, I'm afraid of never saying that to my other grandparents. And of them pass and go through it all over again.

I know it'll happen. They died with so many years left that they could've lived. I can't imagine my parents or sibling just being there one day and then being off the face of earth.

Im a 19M in my second semester of college and I'm not sure what I should do here

I'm in the midst of a depression as a result of not wanting to ruin a friendship with the most amazing girl I could ever imagine. I'm pretty sure I could marry this girl. We have the same sense of humor, same major, and a lot of the same interests in movies and music. 

The issue is that my current roommate told her that he liked her in the first few weeks of school. After becoming friends with her she told me this and said she was repulsed because he is creepy(I think he is a little too). Yesterday she mentioned she was afraid of comittment. Now she avoids my roommate when ever she can, she is visible annoyed whenever around him, and just hates him in general. I don't want to live without this girl in my life.

She goes for a specific type of guy. She likes larger brawny men. I other the other hand am lanky as can be. Over the summer I going to try and bulk as much as I can and see how she reacts next year.

59,"Annoyed at a fellow martial arts student
u/NotJosephJoffre
I attend a historical martial arts class once a week, for longsword. There are two students I have problems with. One of them, we'll call him 1. The other will be 2.

We'll start with 1. It's shorter. 1 is a know it all, and constantly challenges the teacher and brings up the previous teacher.

It's incredibly annoying and holds up the class. It also seems like he says things only with the intent of being seen as the cool guy.

Number 2 is longer. It honestly feels like he bullies me. During drills he has even given me slight friction burns and bruises. For instance, 3 weeks ago he bruised my chest during drills with a thrust, I can't even remember why the hell we had to use the thrust in the first place, but I do know that I was barely touching him. Literally. I would brush him as I was going quite slow and would pull my hits.

He is always incredibly aggressive during drills, and acts like I'm his greatest enemy for some damned reason. I usually just grin and bear it, as I have a decently high pain threshold and a very high level of patience.

But I'm getting tired of it, I am utterly done with this bullshit. It (issues with number 2) started just after this summer, and I have no idea why. I have been nothing but courteous and nice to everyone there.

Maybe it's because I'm the youngest student there? I don't know. It's frustrating. 

Thoughts? I've invested around 500 dollars into this. I like doing it but these two, especially number 2 is making the experience absolutely miserable.

61,"I honestly don't know what to do or say in this situation. My mother has been going through things that I just can't understand. I don't know where I'm supposed to look for help or anything of the sort. She has told me similar things for many years and I always shrugged it off, but I think it's reaching a new point where it could be dangerous for her. She's about 49 years old, and I'm 18 just for reference.

For the longest time, since I could remember, she has told me that things affect her like her heart speeding up, her hands getting red, headaches. All this amongst other things. She tells me that when she goes to the doctor to get a physical or checkup they say nothing is wrong with her. She has always attributed these affects to my father (who she divorced with when I was very young) somehow messing with her. She would never accept any other reason. It doesn't help that even after they divorced, he happened to find a house to rent right next door to where she lives. She says he somehow works through cellphones and the internet box. She says she's tested this out by turning off her cellphone, pulling out the battery and putting it somewhere away from her or turning off/cutting off her internet altogether. After that she says she feels better. But she needs her cellphone on for work and contact with others.

I understand that all this sounds crazy, but you need to understand that my mom has been a pretty normal person all my life. She doesn't always bring this stuff up, but she does every now and then. She says she tries to push past it and think that it's not happening for the sake of living normally, but it's always there bugging her in the back of her head.

Tonight she had a breakdown of sorts where she told my younger sister and I that she feels that we don't need her anymore. She loves us with all her heart and she says that we are what has always kept her going. But my dad has always had a steady job and a better salary unlike her and she feels that we only need to rely on him now. We are older and we don't need motherly support anymore. She says she just can't handle all these affects on her and she just wants it to end.

You probably don't understand how seriously she takes this though. She has cut off her internet many times and she is always buying multiple phones and has to change her number. 

I am honestly so scared of the way she is talking right now. She's making me think that she will probably just end her life. I don't know where to go or what to do. She won't listen to me about going to talk to a therapist either. I just need some advice on where to turn before it's too late.

Tl;dr my mother says she's affected with headaches amongst other symptoms by stuff my dad does, and she can't handle it anymore. She just wants it to end, and I want to get her help even though she won't listen to my advice on seeing a therapist.",26Mar2017,1

This actually isn't for me, it's for my brother who's going through kind of a complicated situation. We wanna go over his options with some people and see what the general consensus is.

Bit of backstory, he didn't get off to such a flying start his first semester. Caught up in the wave of college, life became more about parties and stuff the\an actual academics. Second semester is looking better in comparison, but it's still generally pretty bad. Not a very high GPA. Finally, my mother decides to stop paying for his tuition, given the circumstances. The way I see it, he has three options -

A) He says that, if my mother will not pay it, he will take out loans. Problem is he needs someone to cosign them to continue attending at his college right now, and my parents are adamant about refusing to sign them. There are few adults who will even consider it, let alone sign it. Those of you who have taken out loans, how's it shaped your life after college?

B) Move back to our hometown and attend colleges here, some of which he was accepted too before. Might be hard to get in with his GPA, given where it's at right now. Anybody have any experience when it comes to transferring colleges? 

C) Dropping out. Take a year or two off, move back to hometown, and get a job, probably moving in with two or three friends for a bit. Those who went this route, how's your life looking right now?

Thanks, any general (or specific!) advice you can give regarding this information would be really helpful.",26Mar2017,1

82,"*This was removed from /r/needadvice for relationship-related content, so reposting here.*

TLDR: Two men I know are spreading a rumour that I'm a sexual predator or something to that effect. What should I do?

I was out drinking with a friend last night, and we struck up conversation with a group sitting next to us. We all exchanged facebook etc, and I messaged one of the girls a couple of times during the night. Today I noticed she had deleted me, which was strange because she had deleted only me, and my messages were very innocuous. I checked her friend list, and lo and behold there was this thug of a guy who had tried to get me socially labelled a rapist a few years ago. Let's call him Costello. I can only assume he had seen that she'd added me, and DMed her. In fact, of the two who had tried to do this to me, the other one had said it directly to my friend's face when he had seen me at a bar a few weeks ago. Let's call him Abbott. After 3 years since this all started and 2 years since I'd last had contact with them, I'm not sure I can keep ignoring this situation. But I can't say there is any material loss due to what they are doing. It's as if anyone can spread rumours which affect someone only socially, with total impunity.

The obvious question is, am I actually a sexual predator? Defending oneself from that kind of accusation is already such a weak position to be in, but this is what happened to my knowledge. 3 years ago I was a regular at a language exchange event. I am a Westerner but speak Japanese, Abbott and Costello are the same, and everyone else in the above story is Japanese. I had met a girl at the event. Let's call her Hitomi. I invited her over for dinner at a later date, she came, it was fun but unremarkable. I invited her to go out for a drink with a few friends, she came, but sat gossiping with a friend the whole night and didn't interact with anyone else so I decided not to invite her again. The last time I saw her I met her randomly on the street, we briefly talked, and she went out of her way to cross a red light to end the interaction, which was very weird to me. I found out later that she was telling people that I had sexually harassed her. I have racked my brain, and I do not have any memory of interacting with her outside these four occasions. Before I found this out, I'd met a friend of hers at the language exchange without knowing they knew each other, and she had invited me to her birthday party. Let's call the friend Misato. Later she told me she'd cancelled, but after talking about in on IM she confessed that it was still on. I called her out for believing Hitomi without asking me if it was true (that was a mistake on my part, and I wouldn't do the same thing if it were happening now). She apologised and reinvited me to her party, but while I was there it was clear she had told everyone I was in some way dangerous.

After this, at the language exchange, Abbott and Costello (who were not organisers) took me aside and said that I was not to come there for awhile, and that the organisers were deciding what to do about it. That they might hand the matter over to the police. That they might call my workplace. They said that two girls had complained about me. Abbott, the older guy, kept stringing me along for two weeks regarding what might actually happen, and then abruptly stopped contacting me. The months following that were about the worst of my life. My social life had revolved around the language event, so I was immediately isolated. The axe of police contacting me hung over my head constantly, and because I had no money for a lawyer I felt that if it came to that I would be hopelessly fucked. I'd had anxiety issues, so I couldn't think straight about the situation I was in. I didn't even know what the situation was exactly. Without knowing anything, I had offered to apologise in person to try to get more information, but was shot down.

After a few months of social withdrawal, I decided to go back to university and finish the degree I had dropped out of years ago. In my second semester back, there was a BBQ in a public park jointly organised by the Japanese club and some other small youth Japanese organisation, let's call it J. For the first time in about a year, I saw Abbott and Costello there. They were affiliated with J in some way. Costello offered to shake my hand and forget the past, but I was still hurt and declined to shake his hand. Later, he came up to me and asked me to come with him. He brought me to a less crowded area near the registration tables for the event and said I had to leave. I told him there was no reason for me to do so. He then started loudly accusing me of being a rapist, and the volunteers at the tables went to go get the organiser. While we were alone, he told me he was going to knock me out, and I invited him to do so. The head of J came (a student), and since we were already friends he knew I wasn't that kind of person, and I was allowed to stay at the event. Of course, I couldn't stop the rumour being spread around. Due to the anxiety of what rumours were being spread at my uni, I withdrew socially again and had to take time off. To this day I haven't been able to properly get a hold of my anxiety and my studies have been greatly affected by social withdrawal.

Costello has a history of sexual harassment from when he was in high school. Abbott became fixated on Japanese women after his previous wife passed away, which is not a crime in itself but it is creepy. I say this because in the past I have thought about having them investigated out of a desire for revenge. However I don't want to get into some meaningless mud fight with pigs. If they are still willing to muddy my name, what can I do to get past this? Do I have a right to enjoin them from saying I harass women? Or is it wiser to just accept that they are going to be out there doing what they please?

Thank you for reading this.

PS If you feel the need to accuse me of lying or being what they say I am, at least frame it constructively please.

83,"The situation is, I [19 M] recently broke up a relationship of almost two years because of toxicity and instability.  
After one month, I'm trying to move on. Things in the relationship were so bad that I rarely miss her, so she's not the problem. (I do miss spending my time and sharing my life with someone, but it was not her).  

The thing is, lately I've been feeling quite empty.

TL;DR. I feel really lonely and empty, like an existential crisis, and I think it's just a phase of moving on from a failed relationship.

I'm not disable i love to do things on my own, but I can't get myself to know new people, in highschool i was loved by all girls always loved to hang out with me saying I'm funny sweet and having a good personality, in college it's the opposite people take the impression that I'm not nice and odd, i tried a therapist 3 months ago this helped a bit, started a diet I need to lose about 20 lbs, i met a very nice girl in college 1 month ago we are getting close but there's something weird in real life she nice and all but when chat she ignores me like be online without seeing my messages for hours, and now i feel my self esteem is hitting the ground again. 
I have 3 questions
-how to approach people (especially girls about my eye problem without freaking them out or giving them wrong impression?
-what to do with this girl and is there any explanation for that?
-how to restore my self esteem? ",26Mar2017,1

100,"I know it sounds horrible, but it's true. I have a friend with a heart of gold, but the problem is that he's not terribly bright. And, really doesn't tolerate alcohol very well. Every time his name and alcohol are mentioned in the same sentence, everyone rolls their eyes, and knows they're going to have to babysit him. Nearing our 40's, this is no longer something any of us can deal with. Anyways, for the past couple years he's been coming over to help me landscape in exchange for sports tickets. It worked well the first year because he didn't stay the night. The next year, it was an absolute nightmare! He did about 5 minutes worth of work, then proceeded to drink way too much, to the point where he was oblivious that he had lit a cigarette already or that he had dropped it. He was just completely out of it, like not even human. It became a huge annoyance, and it was anything but a relaxing weekend for me. He said he needed to go for a walk, and I asked him nicely to NOT purchase anymore beer for himself - which he ignored.  A year goes by, and we do this again. Before this, I let him know that if he's going to drink that heavily, I do expect him to obey my house rules, and that if gets into that condition, I will not allow him to smoke on my property, operate my grill or stove, as his reckless behavior could burn down my house. He thanked me profusely, and said it wouldn't be an issue. I also had nicely asked him to not bring any food, as I would take care of the arrangements. He ignored this as well, but I don't fault him too much for this slight offense. I was trying to be subtle, but, quite frankly, his cooking is awful! Everyone knows this but him, but we're just too polite to say anything. But, it goes beyond his cooking. He manages to make a ridiculous mess during the preparation, touching raw meat to every surface of my kitchen, and, doesn't wash his hands after handling the meat! Also, I once caught him dipping a basting brush into the the ziplock bag where the raw chicken had been marinating, to baste the chicken that had just come off the grill. We were all horrified, knowing he could make people sick with salmonella, which he was oblivious to. 
My friends and I drink a lot when we get together, but we're all in control, and aware of our surroundings. 
He then, of course, got ridiculously drunk, too, to the point he didn't know up from down. I couldn't go to sleep until I knew he was passed out, but every 15-20 minutes, I'd hear him walking around my house, which would make me get out of bed, and politely ask him to go to bed! This happened 4 or 5 times, and, by the last time, I was growing increasingly angry. The next morning, I noticed that he had drank ALL the remaining beers, and likely stayed up all night. Also, he was unable to get my stove door unlocked, so managed to yank the thing out of it's slot in my kitchen. So, he essentially violated ALL the rules, which I don't think were unreasonable considering his past behavior. I just don't want some idiot to burn down my house! Obviously, I will never do this landscape for tickets thing again, but, there must be a nice way to broach the subject without sounding like a total dick. I can't deal with him disobeying my wishes, and, being so oblivious to the fact that he's a total trainwreck, and, his cooking methods are unsanitary and can make people sick! I've mentioned about 1/100th of the things he's done, but believe me, it's a common theme. 
Look, I'm an awful cook, but I know this about myself. ",26Mar2017,0
101,"My dad has had the same old orthotics for as long as I can remember and bless his heart he's been taping the vinyl back onto them for years now. He's also added one of those o shaped bunyon pads to cushion a heel spur. Between time and money, he either can't or won't get new ones. 

I'm a practicing special fx artist, and I see an opportunity to help.. I want to make a cast of each of them, and make new ones for him. My work has only been with latex/clay/plaster so far. I have also played around with ""friendly plastic"", but it's something that you shape like clay.

102,"I don't have long to make a decision about whether I should continue to stay at my emotionally abusive Exhusband's house or move into the apartment I signed for yesterday. It's not so black and white though. 

Exhusband's home where I currently reside temporarily (was staying with family it became a bad situation so I left) has small (for now) cockroach infestation in the downstairs kitchen. I reside upstairs with my kids but do on occasion use the kitchen after cleaning it to prepare food. Most often we have been eating meals prepared elsewhere. 

I have an eviction from when we separated a year and a half ago and it has seriously inhibited my ability to secure an apartment. A good friend of mine got in contact with her landlord and after going back and forth with him for about half an hour (due to eviction) got him to agree to rent to me.

Great.... went signed lease yesterday afternoon. I went back to the apartment in the evening to clean in hopes that I could get a uhaul to move in today and came in to find a few roaches there. I moved the fridge and stove out after seeing this and found tons of dead one. Altogether o saw three living ones. 

The landlord offered to spray to kill them saying he doesn't like poisons or bombs. Or that if I wanted today he could rip up my lease and give my deposit back. 

I am torn on what to do. 

Roaches either way it goes. If I want them gone at the apartment I rented I will have to pay to take care of them properly myself which although I know is the landlords responsibility, I am willing to take care of it myself. 

Yesterday was my birthday, not that it's hugely important. I don't want or expect anything done for it. However,  the Exhusband finding out that I signed for a place (he wants me to stay with him and get back together), spent the evening screaming at me and putting me down in front of our children. My kids were so sad. It killed me inside. They love birthdays and even if mine isn't a big deal to me to them it's a magic day where you get special time all about you. So to see this happen to where I couldn't hold back my tears. Really upset them.

Everyday is not like this with him. But I never know when he is going to flip the script and turn into an asshole.

I grew up in an abusive home, and have spent my entirety as an adult being in abusive relationships one so bad in which the man is spending the next 60 years in prison as a result of his harm against my family. For years I went through intention therapy and psychiatric help. I left my Exhusband, divorced him, secured a good position, am 3/4 of my way through a legal assistant degree, and am trying to live a normal life where I only depend on myself. 

That being said with abuse being so normalized in my life for so long I don't want to make the wrong decision to stay here while I keep looking for other places without pests. I recognize what is happening with my ex as unhealthy and that we need to get out. I just don't know if I shpuld get my money back and endure it longer while I search for suitable housing or keep the place I secured and just do my best to get rid of the pests on my own. 

This is where I need some outside perspective, please weigh in.",26Mar2017,1
108,"I'm feeling so conflicted.

About 5 months ago, my wife's friend was being assaulted by the owner of the house she was staying in.  So, we took her into our apartment until she could find a new place, but, we made it clear it was a short term arrangement.  We also let her pay heavily discounted portion of rent so she could get back on her feet.  It's her and her daughter and they are staying in my office space. 

Everything started out fine, but then it got to the 3 month mark, and on top of that, she wasn't even trying to find a place.  My wife and I talked and we were not expecting her to stay this long, and we decided that we needed to clear the air and set a deadline.  So we gave her 3 more months, and at that time, if they had still not moved out, her rent would increase for that month and we would provide a full eviction notice and give her 30 days to leave.  My parents are the land lords of the apartment, and they obviously have no problem kicking them out if they won't leave. 

Here's the problem.  The end of that 3 months is in 20 days, and it's completely her fault.  She got up to the last month, and banked on three different situations and all didn't pan out, and she's been getting less hours at work.  However, that means, if we kick her out, she'll have absolutely no where to go.  She may have to take her child as a single mother on to the streets, and we are just not ok with that.  

But on the flip side, my wife and I can't handle keeping them in our house anymore.  Both of us have become extremely irritable, and stressed.  We don't get to spend much alone time together since it's a small apartment so it's hard to get away from them.  Her child is a demon so it adds an entirely new level of stress on to an already tough situation.  To top it all off, I finished my school, and I need to start using my office for business endeavors.  

We just don't know what to do.  We don't feel right kicking a single mom and her daughter to the streets, but we can't live with them in our house anymore.

I don't find either sex attractive and I hate it when people show too much skin.

112,"My family is obsessed with status. Over 60% of their conversation revolves around famous public figures such as celebrities and politicians. It is either that or affluent neighbors or cars.

Tbh I think all people care about status to some extent, but from what I have heard (not 100% sure), most people are not this obsessed with status. I think it has something to do with how we're at the upper boundary of the middle class so we are kind of in a ""silver medal position"" in terms of wealth and status so we are more likely to compare to people who hit that jackpot of gold as we are so close to there. Sometimes I ask myself why my parents are so obsessed with status when we are better-off than the majority of the population. It seems ridiculous.

I can't help but feel sad about this. It seems a bit stupid to say ""I don't give a fuck about status and money"" as everyone does that. If you don't give a fuck about these things, you can't compete with others. If you don't try to climb up the social ladder, others will do that and hence surpass you.

So I think about this. Comparing myself to those with more money and status makes me sad naturally. Comparing myself to those with less money and status make me feel guilty due to schadenfreude.

The funny thing is that it is usually my parents who bring up these conversations of wealth and status. While they do put these people on a pedestal for having a lot of money and status, they do somewhat resent them at the same time. Most of the time, they put these people on a pedestal and think of having fame and status as prestigious. When I get angry and point out that the world is unfair and how I hate the world, they will get angry at me. They will call me spoilt brat who doesn't know where I am born and that I should compare to all those people who are not as affluent. Sometimes my parents will resent high profile politicians for being egocentric, obsessed with money and status, cold-blooded, cunning, and selfish. When I point out that most people would act like that if they were given the chance to obtain more status and that it doesn't mean that they're bad people (as it is a part of human nature), they will get angry and call me out for defending some politician who gives zero fuck about my existence with rhetorical questions such as ""Is that politician your blood relative or something?"".

I feel like life is meaningless. We have pretty much evolved to be competitive in order to have offspring and the cycle just continues. If you don't compete, you lose simply because others will try to surpass you. I think it is called an evolutionary arms race. You can't just give zero fucks about ""superficial"" things such as money and status. You are ""stupid"" for doing so.",26Mar2017,9

First some background, I started my freshman year of college in the winter of 2015. I was just coming out of basic training and had some money saved so I decided I wanted to live closer to campus. There is a student only apartment complex (we'll call them UAD) across the street from my school so I began my application there. I signed my lease and my guarantor also signed. Move in date was ~Dec. 20th and it was approaching without any call back from UAD as if to i was accepted or not. I continued to call them frequently asking them if i was accepted and if could begin to move in. UAD told me multiple times that i had not been accepted yet and they are still reviewing my account. Two weeks after my move in date I got a call saying that my guarantor was not accepted because they needed proof of income (her husband makes the money and he was being paid in cash). They told me that I needed to find another guarantor or someone to buy the lease from me, I told them that it would be impossible for me to find another garountor and a new lease holder so they said that they would see what they can do. I did not hear back from them. So I gave up on UAD and decided I'd be better off staying at home. I then began to receive calls from a collection agency saying I owe ~1,800$ from UAD. This was over 10 month ago and I have made multiple calls to the collection agency and UAD disputing this account. Today the bill is at $6,404.

123,"**Obligatory introduction goes here.**  
I'm a simple university student living it small in good ole' South East Asia. Currently studying Computer Science.  Starting to realize that shifting interests, desperation to not become a NEET and randomly choosing STEM-ey  major might not be the brightest idea.    
**What got you into this shit to begin with?**  
I've always been a curious creature. Randomly jumping into whatever pique my interest like a chimpanzee on   crack (only to drop it later, eh, just like sobering up). And by God does that go well with the treasure trove of the   interwebs. I'd waste my entire day watching random (sometimes educational) shit on it.  
I thought my natural curiosity and willingness to learn new things would carry me through sciency careers. This   backfired harder than an 80s race car for the following reason:  
&amp;nbsp;  
-&gt;I have commitment and atttention issues  
My attention goes all over the place without ever settling on one thing. If something doesnt strike me as love at first sight, then down into the trash pile it goes.  
Unfortunately this applies to most of my course materials and lecturers (Apparently, Neanderthals still walks among us and they bang on keyboards to make text. Who would've thought?) Which are obscure as hell and explains fuckall. Killing whatever interest I might have in the subject and any further motivation to study it.
From Calculus to Comp Theories to Physics, It's all the same. Rote memorization and mindlessly copying works of the great minds.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-&gt;Don't know what I'm actually interested in or want to do.  
I've thought long and hard about moving majors but fear not being able to settle down and reenact the same shit all over again.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-&gt;Family dependent and very demanding.  
I currently hold a scholarship from the faculty and will get a hugeass fine for ragequitting. I dont even want to think about the familial fallout. Nan and da almost had a breakup over it once.  
My grades are falling. I can still salvage it. I'll get booted off the scholarship if I dont.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-&gt;Poor organizational and interpretation skills.  
I'm terrible at parsing words. This is disastrous for a career path so focused on wading through other people's shitcode and learning new programming language.  
I'm a pretty good visual learner, however. Give me a geometry problem and its getting solved in the next 2 hr.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-&gt;Addictive personality  
I'd waste my life away on video games to get some sense of accomplishment wreking some poor bloke who isnt even 10 hrs in Satisfying my e-peen, Realize how much of a scumbag I am and feel bad about it. Then get into the game again and forget about it all. Rinse and Repeat.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Actual interests**  
I love art, drawing, story-telling and light philosophy.  
I'd always create random works(fanfics, original works) that will never see the light of day.  
I never got to refining my drawing/writing skills to something that doesn't cause immediate brain aneurysm.  
Personally, this is where my natural talents lie. 
Didn't get into it because of the starving artist clice. Wasn't sure if I'd survive. Better stick with something safer and more in demand.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Possible Paths/Solutions**  
-&gt; Man up, get my shit together. Stay determined and hope I'd get to learn the actual interesting shit later(Turing-complete machine outta Legos? Count me in!) Lead a satisfying life as a not-miserable-self-deprecating-meatsack, and become a better human being.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-&gt;Man up, go straight to the elders about fucking off into the rainbow and becoming a (hopefully) not-starving artist. Get hooked into the industry somehow. Lead a satisfying life....yadada

~~beg for help from strangers on a random online platform~~

The reoccurring theme of conflict that keeps coming up for me....is somehow I offend someone or do something that triggers them but instead of them coming to me and trying to work it out or confronting me about it...they go to the salon owner or our coworkers and it becomes this creates the gossip mill behind the scenes. Yet once again nobody will come to me directly and discuss things with me ....if they did they would never get a negative response. I love direct communication I'm open to feedback and I'm always willing to bend and adjust things so there's harmony.

When I first started I asked a ton of questions that way I could understand the culture and the  rules so as to not step on any toes or do anything wrong but somehow it's happening. Hair salon culture is a beast all its own we all worked very closely with one another and there's a lot of different personality types in one space I'd really love any feedback anyone has....I know it's probably not much to go on but I think my biggest problem is people won't communicate and that's really all I need is communication and I wish I could communicate with others but every time I've ever tried to talk to somebody about conflict resolution it blows up in my face.

134,"To be clear: I wouldn't really call this ""social anxiety."" I always knew I was anxious in certain situations around people. I thought of it as social anxiety, but I finally realized something about it last night. I'm not anxious around people or the thought of meeting new people. I have an active social life and am confident about talking to strangers and making new acquaintances. I actually feel like it is one of my strengths.

Still, I often find myself getting very anxious before many social events, and sometimes even during. I don't think I realized what it actually was until last night, but it is crowds.

I'm not generally claustrophobic unless it is *people* that are crowding me in. Talking to individuals actually helps because it is a distraction from being surrounded by people.

I know that one part of this is caused by the fact that I have a whole lot of trouble distinguishing noises from other noises. I know that a lot of people have this and there is even a name for it but I forgot what it was. I even got my hearing tested before just to be sure it wasn't a hearing problem. It isn't. My hearing is fine.  But yeah, in a crowded room it is very hard to distinguish one conversation from another.

On the other hand, I think there is something else to it because it bothers me even when I am not trying to talk to anybody. I really don't know what it is.

Has anybody else experienced something similar? How did you overcome it?",26Mar2017,1

136,"Hi all!! I'm a freshman at an all-girls school in Southern USA.  Recently we had a dance where girls ask the boys (Sadie Hawkins/ Turnabout).  I was in a group where I knew a few people, then my best friend decided to join the group.  I was super happy because I would be meeting new friends of friends (the group I was in had people I didn't really know) and my best friend would be with me!!!  It all changed when they kicked me out and gave no reason.  I went to my friend who was in the group and answers varied-- either they didn't know me, or some other excuse.  It really hurt my feelings.  I told my best friend and she felt bad and was angry with her group, but I was already in another group and I couldn't get her out of it (she wanted to be in a group with me).  Then, she tells me there's going to be an afterparty and for me to come.  Turn out the girl who was hosting it was really stressed so I couldn't come.  My best friend felt super bad and said she'd make it up to me.  I know my best friend had nothing to do with these crazy girls, but how can I forgive them?  They kicked me out of the group and then wouldn't let me go to the afterparty.  I hope this doesn't seem too frivolous but I don't want to harbor any more anger or resentment towards them and their hurtful actions.  Any advice on how I can forgive them and deal with them going forward?  Thank you so much!",26Mar2017,2
138,"I would like to begin with kind of a background explanation of who I am as a person and in a school environment. 

I'm 16. For the most part I am very quiet around school as I don't really wish to appeal to people at school as much, and tend to stick to just about 3 people that aren't complete dicks at school. I am a person that tends to do a shit ton of thinking and I guess dreaming during classes, although I am still capable of outputting good grades and I don't have any problems with school overall. I like the subject that I took (electricity) and I don't really have any wish to change that.
Since I am quite quiet for the most part and don't talk to people I don't know much due to reasons mentioned above. I am usually alone and just chilling on my phone while sitting somewhere or leaning on a side rail during p.e. Now I have personally trained myself to sometimes get aggressive and physical when its truly needed as sadly people out there like saying shit about that one quiet guy and fucking with him, who's just sitting on his twitter and chillin. Recently, I have encountered this one person who I had previous conflict with which actually resulted in him apologizing and shaking my hand like a man. Here's me thinking that this kid had realized that he's wasting his time trying to fuck with some kid(I did actually threat him and was basically about to go in a fight with him before he apologized) that hasn't done shit wrong. 
Soooo anyways.... Recently during p.e. he seems to have decided to come up to me and mention that ""your hair is a bit browner in the back"". I realized this guy doesn't have any friendly ""joke-like"" intentions as soon as I turned around and he began saying ""You touch me and you're done"". Now this is where I begin to tell him to fuck off and to stop fucking my mind with his bullshit. We begin arguing and basically get kind of near to getting into a fight. Now me being me I naturally don't go right ahead to fight, but I choose to avoid them and end the argument with a ""fuck off"", unless of course it gets physical. In which case I will do everything to make him regret it. To add to the salt, 1 minute laters he throws a ""bullshit apology"" at me saying ""are we cool?"" and I just tell him to get the fuck out of here and fuck off because I realize that he thinks that I would just forgive someone so easily like that. 

Now the problem is that, after these kinds of situations I feel like shit about not just going ahead and fighting the person and I take shit too personally. I am honestly not a person that fights, I respect people who are capable of understanding one's limits and I wish my life was filled with people who don't think ""Yo mama"" jokes are funny.
I am too kind for this kind of bullshit..I guess maybe I just want to have friends who are mature.

So these are the questions to make it easy-

 -What should I do in this situation?
 -How do I avoid feeling like shit after avoiding a fight with
  someone that tried to mess with me?
 -What do I do? I feel lonely(I do have friends but in another school) and I just need a friend who isn't also a friend of someone I dislike. One of my friends in this school is friends with someone who's not very nice, although my friend is much more chill and takes ""I'll fuck your mom"" ""your sister is a whore"" ""you're stupid"" very fucking lightly, too lightly. Works out for him though, but fuck that I aint prepared to be insulted to be ""in"".
-Is there someone on here which I could just talk to? Someone that is capable of giving advice in life and just able to make one feel better about themselves? I feel like i'm missing this in my life.

-Also I have the option to move back to my previous school and just learn business which is another subject I really like. I don't really have any social issues in that school, my class was fine with me and no one really bothered me. I was able to chill and listen to music whenever. So should I move schools? For the sake of being able to have a relaxed life for the next 2 years? I can only move school at the start of the next school year.




Sorry for making this so long, this is short really because I have a lot more to say and express.

141,"So my ex broke up with me 2 months ago. Our relationship was extremely toxic and he did us both a favor because I would have stayed. I wanted to be with him and still loved him but I have accepted that we weren't compatible due to not seeing eye to eye on many things, lack of communication and situational circumstances that led to us being toxic, the end was inevitable.

He insisted on being friends but I was too angry and resentful of the breakup and past things that happened between us that I couldn't imagine being his friend. With some time away and some thought, I ultimately came to the conclusion that I could be his friend as I am no longer interested in him romantically and I've realized that there were many things about him that I wouldn't want in a partner. Basically, I'm no longer attracted to him in that way. He was a great friend before we dated and even in our relationship he was a great friend and I wouldn't want to lose that.

A week ago, we spoke over the phone and he expressed how he still loves me but wants to be my friend because he still cares about me and he knows he doesn't want to be in a relationship. I agreeded to be his friend and invited him to hang out with my best friend and me for my 21st birthday this upcoming Tuesday. When I asked him though, he said that he doesn't know if he wants to come because he doesn't think he can handle seeing me flirting or dancing with other men. I told him that I wasn't going clubbing but going to the movies and a bar instead, so he agreed to come.

That statement has been lingering because I don't understand why he would want to be friends with me but knows he still has feelings. On my birthday night, I do plan on meeting people at the bar and having a good time because I know I am single and I know where I stand emotionally when it comes to my ex. I want to let loose and meet new people but I feel like if my ex is there, it would make him feel bad and I just want to have a good time on my birthday. Because I know how he feels, I would feel like a jerk if I did flirt and meet guys while he's around.

I want to know if I should not continue to be his friend or if I should give it a chance and see where it goes?

TL;DR: ex broke up 2 months ago but wants to be my friend but he still has feelings for me. I invited him to hang out for my birthday but he doesn't think he can handle seeing me with flirt with other men. Don't know if I should continue a friendship.",26Mar2017,3
142,"So I caught my boyfriend this past summer texting a girl when we were in a fight. He was casually talking to her until she mentioned just coming home from a vacation. That is when he started asking to see pics of her in a bikini. We both knew this girl.

I forgave him after probably a week. He told me it wouldnt happen again and I thought- it wasn't anything in person and I knew he was sorry for doing it. 

Recently, I caught him doing it again with a girl I deliberatly told him not to talk to. He went out of his way to get her number and told her ""I like you"" and invited her out to MY BIRTHDAY PARTY that weekend at the bar. He was aware that this girl and I were not friends. He messaged her 3 times over the span of 3 months. The first being the messages about liking her, the next being about my birthday and how he misses looking at her, and the last was when he was on his way home from work made a comment: ""so you're home alone eh ;) ;)"". I was at his house when his phone went off saying ""see you tonight"". This was around 11pm and was from this girl. I recognized the number as I use to be friends with this girl. I immediately left and she send me the whole conversation.

Since then, I have recieved flowers everyday for 3 weeks. I have had notes left in my mail from him. He admits he made a huge mistake and regrets it. I know in my heart he would never physically do anything with any of these girls. He is the kind of child (very immature) who never talked to girls when he was younger and if he did, he immediately liked them (because it was the only girls that ever talked to him). I can see why attention from a girl would get him excited, but that is no excuse. He went out of his way to get this girls number. Multiple times she mentioned me: ""you are in a committed 4 year relationship"", ""why do you want to cheat on your gf so bad"", ""whats the point of having a gf if you want to talk to other people?"", and still- he didnt stop. He deleted the messages so he knew he was doing something wrong.

We have been together for 4 years. We have a dog and were planning on moving in together this summer. We are best friends. I thought atleast we told eachother everything. We are super close with eachothers families and all he ever talked about was what we would be doing together in the future. Hes bought me mostly everything I own; a vehicle, a phone, the dog, he helps pay off my school debt, and he overall takes really good care of me. He would give me the shirt off his back. Yet, He is very immature. He is a typical, little teenage boy still.

I know he did not have feelings for either of these girls. I want to assume it was horomones. I dont know what to do. I dont want to picture my life without him...but I dont know how to forgive him for this. I have a strong feeling he wont do it again, but I am embaressed and everyone in the world knows what he did. I want to live happily ever after, but knowing what he says behind my back really shows he doesn't have respect for me. But, being young, do people deserve 3rd chances?

I need advice. And preferably something unrelated to ""time will tell"" unless you can explain that thoroughly. lol",26Mar2017,5

144,"My sister sells Arbonne. She has a good paying job as a marketing director but hates it and wants to be a stay at home mom. She sees Arbonne as her way out. I really dislike these companies because of their scummy marketing tactics. When I enter into a friendship/am a family member with someone, I do not expect them to constantly try and sell me crap. For example, our family group messages now have ""before and after"" photos of her and basically just look like infomercials.

Anyways,  I've made it apparent that I'm not into Arbonne. No thanks. Also, I'm in grad school and everyone knows I'm struggling a bit for money right now. 

For my birthday, my sister somehow (I'm guessing through a guilt trip or by constantly bugging them) convinced my parents to split about $300 dollars in Arbonne products with me. All of it is stuff I will never use and now is just sitting in my bathroom. Meanwhile, my socks have holes in them and I'm eating chips for lunch. 

Because she split it with my parents, their part covered whatever she spent on it, and went into her pocket. In the end, it just looks like another marketing tactic from her. I hate being so cynical because I love my sister. Still, I feel like she is crossing lines. Also, I have a hard time believing this is any good for her. 

Any advice on how to handle the situation? I'm not upset because I didn't get a fancy present, but just her intentions behind it, and her constant harassment of my family members to ""throw her Arbonne parties"" etc.

157,"So from day 1 my parents decided to call me by my middle name, and basically everyone in my life has known me by that name. In fact only my closest friends and family know that I go by my middle name. I was named after my grandfather and for whatever reason he went by his middle name, so naturally I had to as well. 

It wasn't really ever a problem until I left high school and moved to another city for college. I can't tell you how many times I've had to explain to new professors and employers that I don't go by my first name listed in official records. I tried to change it so my middle name appeared as my first name in the official school database, but for whatever reason, I couldn't get it to stick. Even my advisor couldn't figure it out. 

I tried to stay on top of reminding professors who ALWAYS forgot what I actually go by because they only had my first name on the attendance sheet. 

Eventually, I gave up. I felt like a weirdo having to remind my professors that I go by a completely different name every time they called on me, and I was always kind of curious as to what it would be like if I went by my first name. Because I had plenty of friends off campus and didn't really meet anyone I was interested in hanging out with outside of class, I didn't see much harm in going by my first name. 

Now, however, I'm in a grad program at the same school, and my small department means I'm getting to know a select group of students and professors better than anyone else on campus. I feel weird going by my first name, almost like I'm insidiously deceiving them. I feel bad, but now that it's been almost two semesters with them, I feel like I'm in too deep to turn back now. 

So my question is, should I drop the bomb and tell them I go by my middle name? How would you feel if someone you had gotten to know over the last 8 months or so randomly told you their name isn't exactly what you thought it was? I feel like eventually someone's going to find out, so I'd rather tell them myself before I get caught in an awkward situation. 

Going by one name at school and another name everywhere else has in a weird way redefined how I see myself, and I'm not sure I like it. It's sort of arbitrary, but now I don't think of myself as one name, and that's sort of led to me feeling like I have split personalities. I've tried to mitigate this feeling by using my first name when I order food but that can only do so much. 

TL;DR: Should I tell people I've gotten to know over the last 8 months that I go by a completely different name to everyone else or am I in too deep? 

PS: If you have kids, please do not call them by their middle name. If you like a certain name so much, make it their first! You don't realize how much of a nightmare it can cause for them down the line.

159,"Hello Reddit. First of all, thanks for clicking on the link and having the curiosity to read this story. I'm a bit hesitant to submit this post since I'm sure I'll get a lot of downvotes and bad reactions, but I suppose I'll try.

I need to get my wisdom teeth removed because there is not enough space for them in my mouth, and they are crooking my front teeth with the pressure. When I went to the dentist, he told me that he always uses IV sedation for this kind of thing, and even if I manage to convince him to use only a local anaesthetic, I'm pretty sure he'd use a _lot_ of it.

The problem is I'm really opposed to most kinds of chemicals, and I don't want sedatives in my body or a lot of amount of local anesthetic. What can I do or say to convince him to use only local, and the lowest amount of it that's reasonable? I don't mean I'd like this done without any anesthesia, I'm sure it would be horrible, but I don't mind feeling a little pain (I have a high pain threshold), and since I'm a bit of a shy person in this type of social situations, I really don't know what I should say without having to awkwardly explain why I think this way.

I'm ready to lie in any way if I can manage to convince him of this, I don't intend for my dentist to understand what I think, only to achieve the result of him agreeing to use local anesthetic and as little of it as it's possible for me. After all, I wouldn't be doing any harm to anybody, only trying to get my opinions respected. As far as I know, there are no religious beliefs that oppose the use of anesthesia, but what about Multiple Chemical Sensitivity? (Like the case of Amelia Hill). Are there any medical tests to check for this, and if so, would it mean my dentist could find out I'm lying if I tell him this? 

I'd welcome any ideas. Thanks in advance!

So, last week a very very close friend of mine and I ""split up"" and haven't talked since. Although we weren't (officially) in a relationship, we talked every day, from 8 am to 1 am, our friends teased us (we used to ""date"" a few years back, it wasn't really anything,  and it ended with no hard feelings) about being together, and we spent a good amount of time together. We had even decided to go to prom together in January (4 months before prom). She even told me that she wanted to date me, but couldn't yet because she's still fragile from her last relationship (ended 2 months ago)

About 2 weeks prior, her ex (in college now) came back into her life, first with Instagram likes, then texts, and then they even went out for breakfast last week. They're relationship ended horribly, they had broken up twice before, and most recently he cheated on her. 

So last week, she told me that they had begun talking again, and in the blink of an eye, she told me that she didn't want to go to prom with me because she wouldn't feel right, and that, eventually, she wanted to get back together with him. Since then, we haven't talked since, but she's shown signs that she's wanted to talk. I've wanted to talk to her, but I don't want to mess anything else up. 

For the past week, I've been so depressed that I haven't done any homework, failed a test, and have done nothing but sulk. I want to start talking with her again, but don't know how to start. I also REALLY want to go to prom with her, but at this point don't think it's possible.

She had bullied him into bullying me into adding her on Facebook, commented on my shit and messaged me a couple times but that was it.

169,"Background: I work as an event specialist (doing sound and lights for concerts, corporate stuff, etc.). I am currently in school for a Bachelors Degree. The company I work for is a small business (Owner and approx. nine full-time staff), with no formal management structure. Our scheduling hours are pretty much anything from ""typical"", what I mean is we only do a few ""9-5"" shifts, and most of our work is 10+ hours days, many days a week (It's part of the industry). Many nights and weekends, but again, part of the job. Furthermore, we get scheduled for things (multi-day commitments, out of town, etc.) 24 hours or less ahead of time.

This company is generally very flexible with accommodating my school schedule, and with other things that may pop up (appointments, other commitments, etc.). Recently, however, the owner and HR person put in what they called ""Time Off Blackouts"". When they put them into our scheduling system, it was done without telling anyone within the company, so it came as a surprise to everyone. Now, if these were for a few days here and there, it would be a different story, but they are active for 20+ days at a time with a week or so in between. As mentioned above, we generally get scheduled for things the day before or day of, which is foreseeable as an issue if we have things like appointments. The description of these ""Blackouts"" are ""No time off requests will be accepted for this time"". 

Next problem, when I started (~10 months ago), I was told we would be doing a six-month wage re-evaluation, and there would be a cost of living increase every year on Jan. 1. Neither of these things have happened, and I feel like I am probably due for a pay increase. When I was hired on, I started without any specific responsibilities (general labor), and now I have a fairly large amount of responsibilities to tend to (CDL driver, Fleet Manager, as well as making sure we stay up to par with OSHA compliances). Whenever I bring it up to the owner (my direct supervisor), I get an answer back like ""We will get to that when we have time"", or ""E-mail me about it""(Then I don't get a response back).

What I'm looking for advice on is: 
1) Should I stay with the company?*
2) If yes, how should I handle the pay situation?
3) What is a reasonable amount of increase? (In your opinion)

*I have other marketable skills that I could likely use to get a different job in a short amount of time. It's also important to note that the good days at work are good, but the bad days (+50%) are pretty bad.

176,"Hey! I'm in high school. The other day, I was messing around making some batch files on the family PC with some friends. We eventually arrived at this file called ""Coolgame.bat"", which opens itself repeatedly and puts copies of itself in the startup folder and desktop. We got a good laugh out of it. I've since left it in my Drive so I can test in on VMs and things.

My computer just god a bad virus, so my mom had to take it to Staples to have the virus removed. I got it back yesterday, but the virus was still there. I thought it was quite funny how Coolgame was still on the desktop.

My mom just took it back to Staples, and they've apparently threatened to report me to the cops for making the malicious file. I'm really scared, but they can't get me in any trouble, because I'm not distributing it, right? What should I do?

177,"I have trouble processing things quickly/lack common sense/miss obvious things. I’m bad at explaining things. I stutter a lot and talk too quietly, due to low self- esteem from feeling stupid and from social anxiety. I mix up words a lot and am very forgetful. I forget basic things from school and feel like I can’t make good small-talk. I ask dumb questions to clarify things and often realize later that what I said made no sense. I can tell people think I'm dumb by their looks and reactions. This has been bothering me more lately since I started my first job as a back-waiter. People say I'm learning quickly and am doing a good job, but I feel stupid when I have trouble folding things neatly, or do things too slowly, or do not know what duties to prioritize first (when we're very busy). I didn't realize we were getting paid for training for some reason and got the most dumbfounded reactions at my comment. I think my anxiety may make me act dumber because I doubt myself more. I feel like I question myself on obvious things but more complicated things I assume I know. I guess I'm not completely stupid since I have straight As in college, a quick wit with jokes, some writing and drawing skills and I like to read philosophy books for fun. I'm just sick of coming off as ditzy and having low self-esteem and being anxious over my competency all the time. Help me please?

179,"Last year I broke up with a girl. We weren't together long but we basically spent a lot of time arguing based on certain things that were going on in both our lives, and in reality we weren't right for each other.

I've unfortunately found myself wishing I could go back now though and it's driving me crazy. She met another guy shortly after myself and they've been together ever since. I met another girl around the same time but had to end it because I wasn't over my ex.

All pretty normal so far I guess... but her new partner has a Strava account, and he uploads every time he cycles. I really don't want to check it as I know it's stalking, but I have viewed it quite a lot within the past week and have seen when he has been visiting her. I've been checking her Instagram account quite a lot as well.

I really want to let go of this relationship, be happy that she's moved on, and start to live my own life again but I'm struggling. I don't know what to do. Ideally I need to find a way to stop checking up on them but I feel I'm addicted to it, like I can't be comfortable unless I know as much as I can.

I lost my job last year and I'm now floating about between a few places trying to find stable work. I don't think this has helped me at all in trying to get on with my life, so I'm hoping once this situation resolves itself I can move on somewhat.

180,"This girl I have known for six months in my college classes.  In February I asked her for a movie, which she agreed to go but one hour before she flaked on me and said she wanted to go another time (the movie time was late 10 pm). I took this as a sign that she didn't like me and left her alone for the past month.

A couple of days ago she texted me and invited me to come to her college piano recital since she is a music major, I decide to go and saw the performance. I met her after at her reception and told her about how great she was, and left.

My question is whether I should just say ""hey I like you"" or something casual like that next time I see her or is that too creepy to say. I honestly just want to know if something can come of it and I don't care about rejection.

187,"I was approached by a friend ive known for around a year about a business opportunity where you do network marketing and things of that nature and you can retire in 5 years making 6 figures.He gave me an interview of sorts talking about how it's all about meeting your dreams and working hard to retire young. (I'm 19 hes 21) At first I didn't think it was a bad gig at all. Told me to read this book, Business of the 21st century and I didn't think it was a bad book at all. A few nights ago he said he could get me a spot at this ""business meeting"" of sorts where a man who made his millions and is helping young people do the same will be talking and speaking to the others about the business. I said fuck it, nothing better to do on a Friday night. Got there and there was probably 200-300 mostly under the age of 30 people and maybe 50 or 60 above the age of 30. All wearing suits and looking professional. The start of the meeting he kind of just rambled on about meeting your dreams and pointed some people out in the audience that were ""on track"" to making 6 figures buy the end of this year. After about 1 or 2 hours of talking about good morals building dreams and bettering your future he started talking about business. This is the part where it is a little fishy. He pulls up this power point showing your store's growth by just buying the products you have on your store. Then he starts talking about how pretty much recruiting and helping people get into it and you start making more money, help 6 people, you move up, help another 6 people, you move up. He also showed a slide or two about the partners with amway and worldwide and they pretty much use the exact same method of amway's path to success. Shit like that. He talked for maybe another half hour about the business and it takes hard work and it's not a get rich quick method and how if you work hard enough you will have a big 6 figure income in 5 years or less. After that a few of his higher level associates came up and spoke about how they are making good money now and managed to get completely out of debt and now are living great lives with their wives and kids. Then they talked about this spring awakening thing taking place in Vegas where huge billionaires and business owners are coming to speak. After the talk about that the function/meeting ended and my friend introduced me to his boss I guess and he seemed like a nice guy. Talked to me all about the work ethic you need and how to attain that big salary by working hard and helping people. He pointed out to me that my friend (who started this in july) will be making that big 6 figure salary in 8-12 more months. Ive arranged another meeting with my friend and I guess one of his business partners in a few days to talk about more information but im really not sure what to do.It looks really good on paper but im pretty skeptical about how it will work once you're in.

188,"Hi guys, I could really use some advice on what to do with my life right now. Everything for me has socially fell apart over the past two months and I'm at an all time low.

I'm a current sophomore at a big school (40,000 students) studying mechanical engineering. I enjoy the major, although am much different than most of the people in my classes. I connect with some, but would say I'm much different in the way I dress, like to party, interested in things other than math/science, and music. Outside of class or studying, I have zero interest to talk about school. I've always been like that though.

Freshman year I met 3 guys who I became pretty tight with. It was first semester, I lived in the same dorm building as the one guy and we were actually really close. Hung out everyday, studied together, etc. After being friends for about 4 months, we got into a fight which I can say was primarily my fault, although it was not just me who caused this problem. To add, this was not a huge ordeal, I told a guy he shouldn't come to a party we were going to with his ex-FBuddy who he used and hurt terribly. With that fight, I was basically shunned from the group. I was turned on faster than you can imagine and was never spoken to again. They blocked me on all social media, ganged up on me in every possible way, and talked shit about me to everyone I knew. As you can imagine, not only did I lose these guys as friends, but everyone's opinion about me changed.  Anytime I attempted to contact them or speak to them they would ignore me. To this day, a year and a half later, they still do not contact me and will occasionally acknowledge me if we pass each other on campus. Because of this I was never able to make any more friends freshman year. Remember, we did everything together first semester and then I still had to see them all the time in my dorm building since they hung out there. 

I ended up doing a summer session at my school and roomed with a friend of this one guy in my first semester intro class. I met him once and said a few words to him during an encounter, but basically was going into the living situation fairly blind. Turns out, we became best friends. I have never had such a good friend as him and am so thankful to have him in my life. I didn't really meet anyone else I became close with that summer. 

Sophomore year rolls around. Within 2 weeks, my best friend (summer roommate) withdraws from my school for personal reasons (no need to share here). I was devastated and yet again back at nothing. 

I decided to rush a fraternity. This was a bold move for me, someone with social anxiety and the complete opposite of your typical frat boy. Turns out, I got a bid to a good house (we have 40+ at my school, say this was in the top third socially) and decided to pledge. 

Pledging as a sophomore was terrible. The hazing, the time commitment, every day at the house from 8-12 midnight, studying all night, taking the hardest courses yet, did I mention the hazing? Regardless, I made it through. I still wonder how with some of the shit I did during hell week.

Then I was happy to have at least a few good friends in my fraternity. Of course there was 100 other guys, but I had gotten close with about 4-5 of them. I was becoming more content and my social life was going well. Parties when I wanted, new friends, common connections, etc. 

At the beginning of this semester, the fraternity was shut down due to a horrible accident. I'm not going to mention what happened as I don't want to give my school away but everything I did the semester before, the time commitment, hazing, friends, instantly taken away. Additionally, my closest friend in my fraternity was arrested for a few serious offenses. 

Lastly, my parents are going through a divorce. Another side note is I live with 3 other guys in an aparment. Two of them are the rudest, meanest, most pyschopath people I have ever met in my life. I could write a whole novel on the shit they have done like turn off the power in my room and lock the circuit breaker, throw away my food, eat my food, put me in a choke hold for absolutely no reason, and more. 

Now, I have literally no friends, sit at home on friday and saturday nights, and am literally at rock bottom. No one in my fraternity hangs out anymore because that common connection is gone. I don't know what to do. I can't take this for two more years. I've looked into transferring but why would it be any easier to make friends at another school than the one I already know? 

Any sympathy or advice would really help me right now. ",26Mar2017,1
191,"A little backstory. I'm 17 in high school in the US. Next year I plan to go University. My dad has bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, etc. He stopped taking his pills consistently. He gets about $1,500 a month in unemployment benefits but he spends $500 a month on cigarettes and alcohol. He can't hold a job and has been laid off of almost every job he's ever had. Today he gave me my passport, social security card, etc. My mom and I already have a tough time trying to put food on the table. He stays in his room all day either eating junk or drinking. 

I have a job and so does my mom. We are both on the path of getting a green card very soon but my dad handled that part. I have a good bit money saved up but it's not enough for me to be comfortable in taking on student loans. PS I'm from overseas, if my dad just decides to leave and go overseas. Do I have the power to take him to court?

193,"Here is the backstory: It's prom season right now, and my group of friends wanted tot do a party bus (there are a total of 9 of us), my friend D, his girlfriend that hangs with us, lets call her M, said that her group of friends, around 20 ppl (the 20 people are not completely random, I do not know them personally but I know of them) have a party bus and are looking for more, so we as a group said sure, we paid 5 dollars each to her friend so that our seats would be reserved but now one of my friends, G (a girl), found a limo and now the 5 others in our group want to do the limo while me, D, and M still want to do that party bus. P.S. if we went on the party bus us 9 would pay 55 dollars each while on the limo we pay 64 for just the 9 of us. Also G knows some people on the bus that shes not to fond of.



Here is why G wants to do the limo: 


- we have to censor the way we are because the others on the bus might not like the way we are 
- The music on the party bus is going to be music that is not our taste
- the limo has an aux cord 



Me and D's reasons for party bus:


- We are going to be on our own side of the bus
- Its called a party bus for a reason, its going to be super fun 
- theres going to be music playing and we are not going to be screaming so its not like the others on the bus will hear what we are conversing/ saying. 
- If you cant get comfortable dancing and having fun inside the bus with strangers then prom is going to be boring for you because thats exactly whats going to happen at prom dancing around thousands of randoms
- in the limo we are just going to be sitting down while D gets the aux cord (D is known for fire music) which sounds so boring
- I told G to get over the little petty grudge that she has with like two people that are going to be riding on the bus and it not like they are going to talk to her on the bus and the bus trip is an hour thirty so its not like we are going to be with them the whole night. 
- we are seniors, this is the last big event for graduation and we are not going to even see these people again that are on the bus ever again after prom. 

This argument has been going on for a couple of days, I want to hear what you guys would honestly do in this situation. Thank you for reading it all, im open to what you guys think.

He told me he thinks i have no respect for myself or anyone else. This really upset me. I think he's being a hypocrite but I'm not sure where this is coming from. Is he right to say those things to me?

205,"Hello, I am 19 years old and I am a family of 6 - two brothers (20+) and a sister along with my Mom and Dad. It's been 17 months since the incident was brought on when I overheard my sister who was 16 at the time, crying and having both my Mom and Dad in her room arguing and talking about what my little sister had to say. 

I didn't know what to do in that moment. I was scared, anxious and was in a state where I froze and thought about calling the cops, but I didn't. I regret that I didn't do anything. I have a case of depression, anxiety and was a person who avoided stressful situations before all of this ever began.

Neither my sister nor mother did anything about this situation. They had their phases of moping and even installed a lock on the door. They went to church and for some reason they thought that would do something. I don't believe in religion all too much - I just don't have faith that God will help me or my family. It's up to ourselves.

About two month ago, I told my mother I knew. My two brothers have yet to know. She told me that he would change and would likely move to his home country in the later future but I just cant see that happening. Not now or ever. He's a perverted, lazy man who wont do his laundry, wont get his own clothes, and doesn't even wash his hands after using the bathroom.

I intend to confront him in front of my mother soon. Every day I'm at home, it's a mental struggle. I don't talk very much with my family and it's difficult to express my feelings. I'm not a very courageous man but I feel like I should do this. I don't just want to cry about it. I don't know what will happen in this family but in my mind, it's never going to get better. 

Some things that crossed my mind was actually becoming homeless. Moving away and taking my savings from a part-time job I got during my gap year off of college if he doesn't leave or I just cant be at home. 

I even thought about suicide just to get away from it all. I've done some self harm in the past but everything is just pushing me. Most importantly this situation,then there's me me failing my first sem of college and having to wait til summer, building myself, regret of not saying the things I should have said, and everything in my family. 

I've taken meds before but I stopped because I know it wont help the underlying problems in my life.

As I grew up, my mum moved away from jim back to the town her parents live in to try and patch things up because she had cheated on jim multiple times and realised how bad of a wife she was. Things went well until one night my mums mum got drunk and tried to climb out of a window and my mum helping her by stopping her resulted in her hitting mum her mum in the eye. After that, my mum was with multiple men and around this time I found out my real dad wasn't Jim, it was someone called Ben. She then found a man called Alex and they got married all while I was still visiting my nan and aunts and uncle. That too went well until he almost killed her and because I went to see what was going on, I saved her life because he stopped. Then came Ian. He was cool but too violent and when I found out my mum was pregnant, I made the decision I didn't feel safe having a sibling  with this man as their dad. I told this to my mum and she trusted my opinion and split. He helps us move and we get on fine for a week or so and she tells me she had an abortion. She said it was because she didn't want it growing up with no dad like me, and I've always wanted a brother so this hits me hard.She then has a few more boyfriends and then settles for Noel, her best friends brother. This I when it gets bad. Previous to Noel, she guilt trips a guy into giving her £7,000. We buy a ps4.i am attached to this thing 24/7 and I turn to be selfish. I always end want to be on it and don't go out. We then move in with Dave. Daves cool and we get on well. He even bought a second ps4 for when we are at his and not at the flat. We fast forward a year and they are married. I am now a selfish prick and hide in my room all the time and don't even want to see family. Today was it.

I think LMU might provide a better college experience, but I am scared of the cost and the financial problems it might put onto my family. UCR is cheaper, but I am not sure I might enjoy it as much. 

I am lost at what I should actually do...

Would it be better to go to UCR and explore majors for a cheaper price and transfer out, or go to LMU.

I do not even know if this is the question I want answered...? Sorry, for the mess I can not comprehend.",26Mar2017,1

217,"Greetings All, This is quite literally my first post on here. Just made my account a few minutes ago. I'm a guy in the dead centre of my 20's. I used to be a 2 pack a day smoker for 6 years. I quit last May thankfully. Best decision I ever made, tbh. My actual problems started right after I quit though.I have remained celibate my entire life. Strict religious upbringing, low self-esteem etc. In order to occupy myself I started using ""Omegle"". At first it was just to rid myself of the extreme boredom I had succumbed to. I live on a metaphoric Island of complete ""social networking"" boycott. Hence omegle was my way out. At first it was fun to interact with new people from different backgrounds and cultures. Although the barrage of pervs is always there, LOL. Time went by and eventually my curiosity started getting the better of me. I started messing around with people. I discovered the fun world of ""sexting"" at the not so raw age of 24. I have always considered myself ""heterosexual"" but it turned out that had the capacity to entertain and enjoy ""bisexual"" fantasies, Lol. I met a lot of interesting people. Started having ""fun"" on video chats too. To cut a long story short; I met a guy there a few months ago. He identified himself a ""gay"". Had the most interesting discussion with him. Apparently I left a very lasting imprint on him and he asked for my username on a Skype. Days later I got a text from him. We started chatting on a daily basis for hours on end. Months have passed by and I feel like ""he's the best thing to ever happen to me"". He feels the exact same way about me, even though he's in a committed relationship. The thing is that I have recently completed my masters and I still don't have a stable job. If I plan to pursue this ""thing"" with this guy I will have to leave my family, friends, society and everything I hold dear. Because I live in a very close-minded third world country where ""homosexuality"" will never be acceptable. This person has reciprocated all my affections and considers me a ""god"", his words not mine. He's all in like I am. This conundrum of leaving everything behind engulfs my every waking and even sleeping moment. But I feel that can't ""live"" without this lovely person anymore. Please advise the best course of action available to me...I would love to hear more opinions.",26Mar2017,1
218,"So lately my life's been pretty crappy. More downs than ups, actually I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy when I wake up in the morning. My biggest problem is I've been seeing this girl for a year and we never labelled or defined the relationship but it was clearly a relationship. We did everything together and we meshed really well. Last night we went to a party and she ended up making out with a guy. I suppose we never defined anything so it's fine but I was hurt. I couldn't do it anymore, I left the party, went home, took some shots, and called it a night. We're on the track team (college) together so I saw her today in the morning and we talked as if nothing happened, but we both know. I tried to define the relationship a while ago but she says she gets freaked out by labels and doesn't want to ruin anything. I want to tell her how I feel but I am afraid that i'll lose her. I'm also injured right now so I can't even go on a run to feel better. It sucks. Should I grow a pair and tell her that I would like to be exclusive? Any advice is appreciated and thanks for hearing me out guys ",26Mar2017,1
219,"Ok... so a little context, I've got a chronic illness, and Just a few days ago, I went the hospital... and was given a little unsettling news. That news being that the illness im afflicted with, can become cancerous. Now... once the news hit... I was sad of course because of the uncertainty of my fate now. Wont know until i see a specialist. But that's not even what this post is even about. It's about the thoughts that begin to cross your mind when your laying on your death bed, and who you would want to be there in your last moments. For me... its a girl. Someone who has shown me a level of compassion I've never recieved in my life except from maybe my parents. Someone who shows legitimate care for me... something a lonely man such as myself has never felt. Do I like her? Obviously. Does she like me? Only as a friend. Yes... I know, friendzoned... won't make out of there anytime soon right? Well... that's what raises the question now, that has been bothering me since I got the news... and that is, would it be ok to tell her, how I only thought of her to be at my side in my final moments? How id be so happy to live my last days with her? How she was all I could think of as i paced back and forth in the hospital room, contemplating my death. I know maybe this is over dramatic, and im getting way ahead of myself. I mean I haven't even seen a specialist yet, and here I am thinking I'm a dead man walking. These thoughts tho... just really left me wondering about her. She knows how I feel, and for that, she doesn't want to ruin this friendship if we were to try, and for one of us to get hurt, or have a bad falling out, as well as she's focusing on herself trying to move to another city for school. Would it be wrong to open up to her about these thoughts? Should I just keep them hidden away? Or just confess that i basically might love her because she's all I could of when facing my own death? Mind you we've known each other for a fair amount of time to establish a bond, and we've been there for each other as much as possible enduring struggles together. A part of me fools myself into thinking she might like me, but I know better than that. I just don't know what I should do about this. Thanks I'm advance for the advice guys. Stay blessed. Have a good one.",26Mar2017,1

224,"I'm 17 and I strongly feel the need to change myself in regards to my character. I came up with 8 questions which their answers should help me better understand myself and give me a good approach to fix what I consider my problems. I will appriecate anyone who gives these questions a go. Anyone who wishes clarity on some questions please ask.

1. Why do I find it difficult to describe what I'm feeling? I have trouble trying to think of words that fit exactly with what I'm feeling. Maybe it's because my lack of reading? Or maybe because my low self-esteem?

2. Why do I find it difficult to be certain of what I'm thinking? Sometimes I simply cannot think straight. It feels like I'm putting my brain into overdrive. Maybe I need to calm down? 

3. I have found it insanely difficult to be confident of myself. How can I overcome this? This has been the biggest challenge for me so far.

4. How can I motivate myself to be the very best I can be?

5. How can I get along with everyone?

6. How can I learn how to  physically defend myself? Sometimes when I'm out in public, I don't feel safe. I feel paranoid to some extent.

7. I am quite controlling when it comes to the people I'm close to. Most of the time I don't even realise when I'm being controlling. I tend to want to know everything. I'm also very curious. How do I stop this?

8. Sometimes I take my friends and family for granted, even though I know what it means when they're not there for you. How can I appriecate them more?

226,"So last year I worked at this renaissance fair and I blew like all my money. Since then I've become better at money management and learning how the world works and all that mumbo jumbo. I'm going to work at the same place again this year but my dad had a different idea on what I do with my money. He wants to manage all my money and hold it in his bank account, but I don't want that. I want to manage my own money by myself but I think he believes I'm just a naive kid that doesn't know how to do anything. I'm 18 and (hopefully) going to be moving out soon for college. I'm going to have to learn how to manage my money on a larger scale before I move out and this is a better opportunity. I am in the search for a real job but none of the employers have gotten back to me yet, so I'm not gonna hold my breath on that too much yet.

227,"I started a program and became friends with a girl, we hung out a lot. I asked her out and she started, at least from my POV, avoiding me. This made me extremely upset  (I don't want to say depressed because I've never been clinically depressed) and I ended up quitting the program. We did talk the last few days (and admittedly talked a bit even after that, but she did mainly ignore me and it felt awkward), and I told her that I was quitting because I wasn't a fan of the program. This is almost 6 months later, and a couple of months ago I removed her from Facebook after just hiding her updates, because they did make me upset just remembering her. I was upset for a solid two or three months after quitting, as well as a couple of weeks before doing so.

Now, to me it's almost obvious that I shouldn't have said anything. She did nothing wrong by turning me down and ignoring me, despite the fact that we were friends, I'm sure she didn't even notice me just removing her, and she should not be subject to my depression that's completely mine to deal with. 

It's definitely too late now to write a message. I feel like that would be creepy and out of nowhere and make her feel anxiety that she has no reason to feel. But I never told her that I got upset that she avoided me. I talked to my friends about it, never said anything to her. Should I have said something to her or did I do the right thing not telling her the truth?

230,"Hey guys,

Hopefully this isn't as depressing as some of the other ones. I'm exactly not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask for these kind of stuff but i'll go ahead.


I'm a 3rd year uni student, having almost finished one degree (associate, not bachelors) already (and because of the credit exemptions i got into the 3rd year instead of the 1st year). But i haven't been focusing very well at all into my studies and i feel like i might be very likely to fail so i was considering dropping all of the subjects and doing a leave of absence instead for one semester.


I was thinking while i'm on leave of absence, i could improve my overall skills (being a bit more active social wise and improving the talents i have - like singing for example), and also trying to find a job (honestly that's the most important thing for me this year).


The thing is, friends that i've said this to have been saying it's a bad idea and that i might end up doing nothing if i were to do a leave of absence. And it kind of affected my decision. I've also had a hard time telling this to my parents who got freaked out when i wanted to do it in the first year of uni.


But i don't wanna mess up my GPA or a chance to obtain a good academic scholarship. The census date (or the deadline) is approaching very soon and i have to make a decision.


So i ask you guys.......am i making a good decision? I honestly think i am, but i want to be double sure because i don't want to regret it (as well as the fact that it's gonna extend my studies by one more semester). I also want to ask for opinions from people who have done this kind of stuff before (you know, taking a gap year and stuff) that could make my decision a strong one.

236,"Hello, 

Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I thought I'd start here.

I'm a working professional trying to pay off my student debt. 

I have debt that is currently under my name, and consolidated under nelnet. It's currently about 72k, and interest rate of 5%, and I am on an IBR plan of about $733 a month. 

I also have ""debt"" that is in my mothers name. It's a large parent plus loan. My mother made the mistake of signing for this loan my freshman year, and it has haunted her credit ever since. 

My mother has her own business, but doesn't make a lot of money. She can't afford to pay the Parent plus loan and we agreed some time ago that I would be paying it off. 

Her Loan is 32K, with an interest rate of nearly 8% and it is exclusively in her name (though I thought for sure I co-signed it). 

Right now, Nelnet is hounding me to pay off my loan, but I cannot afford to pay both loans simultaneously. What I'd like to do is pay into my moms loan with all my financial effort, since its the smallest, and pay it off completely before I put all my financial effort into my own loans. 

Are there any Financial Guru's out there who have any advice for me? 

TL;DR: Gotta pay my own Student Loans, and My Mothers as well. Halp. ",26Mar2017,1

The longest I've ever been single was about a month, and pretty much all of my relationships have lasted a year or more. I really have no idea how to be alone. I don't really know what it's like to not have someone I can call anytime to talk to, share the events of my day with, and someone to just... share life with. I'm lucky enough right now that I have a few good friends I can talk to and hang out with, but it's not the same. Also the lack of physical intimacy is almost like drug withdrawal.

My inability to be alone has lead me to make lots of poor choices in partners in the past and I'm sick and tired of it.

I don't have any alternatives, my parents won't pay for me to go back to college next year if I have to repeat the year/change degree.

I don't want to leave my friends I have in college. 
I don't want to just up and leave them..

I also don't know what I want to do, I feel like I'm taking a long time to make up my mind while everything keeps moving.
This is the first time I've had genuine freedom, I had such grandiose ideas for what I will do, and so far nothing significant, I did well in my exams to get into college, I am intelligent, but I'm not applying it.

I have been toying with the idea of becoming a barber for a long time, no idea why, I've never cut hair but I've always had an interest in style, mens fashion etc. I'm not sure why but I've always had an interest in becoming a barber/stylist.
But at the same time, my parents expect a college degree and a good salary.. we both have high expectations for me. It was never a case of just finding a job, having a decent standard of living and waiting for the countdown..
It's ideas of starting a business, being financially successful, developing and sustaining a certain level of freedom accommodated by building a portfolio..
But as of now, I don't know what to do..

242,"By the way, I'm in my mid thirties, my mom is her in 60s. She is from india. I was born in the u.s. She hates black americans (not africans, jamaicans, etc.) She thinks that everyone else managed to get over their own enslavement (from jews to indians) and they were too dumb to retain their culture.

Like ugh, if you heard the ignorant shit that comes out of her mouth, you'd just die.

It's becoming more of a problem, btw, because i've always planned to adopt rather than have my own kids (I find it to be a selfish act at this point to have ones own kids), but I am thinking of adopting a black son in the next 5 years or so -- to provide that kid with advantages that statistically would not happen for him otherwise. 

Anyway, i'd love to hear from those of you who had/have racist parents and how the hell you dealt with it. She currently lives with me and when the lease is up I'm thinking of just leaving and not giving her any of the info to contact me. I find her attitude to be vile and, as bad as this sounds I think the world will be better when she and others like her just die.
