Ive never really had a girlfriend so i cant really read body language all that much. I really want to just go in for a kiss but im not sure if she agrees.

3,"Basically, i can either grind out high school and college graduating with a good degree and 20k cash, or i can be lazy, enjoy partying, and other school experiences.

4,"I'm a freshman in college and I'm living in a dorm, away from my family for the first time. I'm failing most of my classes and it's unrecoverable. I have never really been good at school, but the reason I'm failing is because of a combination of depression and sleep problems. I have always had problems sleeping, and I've had depression since middle school. My depression was worse when school first started; I feel like I can manage it now. My sleep feels like it is completely out of my control. At night I can't fall asleep. I really try to sleep but I just can't until like 5 AM. But if I fall asleep that late I sleep through some of my classes. I have an English class on Monday and Wednesday that starts at 9 AM, and I've missed it something like 6 times and I've only actually made it like 5 times. The only times I've actually made it to that class are when I just forced myself to just not sleep at all, but if i do that im half asleep for the rest of the day. English isn't the only class I've missed because of sleep; I've missed all of them several times. English is just the most frequent. I don't know what to do about it. Another problem is that I'm not really interested in my major. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I want to switch majors after this semester, and the classes for my major don't apply to any other major, so is there any reason to really try in those classes? Id be struggling in those classes even if I was trying to be honest. I'm also working at McDonald's on weekends and struggling to balance schoolwork and work-work. My parents kinda forced me to come to college, but I wanted to do it since it had always been expected of me. I haven't told them I'm failing, I lie whenever they ask because i don't want them to worry and i don't want to say the truth. Maybe college just isn't for me and I should drop out instead of just switching my major. I feel like such a failure.",26Sep2017,40
5,"I'm an online school student, chose to do it for my senior year as I had panic attacks over the course of the entire junior year due to anxiety of even going to the high school itself. I've never been an A+ student post middle school, but I'm a bright kid. I don't mean to brag, it's not my intention, but I feel like I'm wasting my potential. I'm an only child, but I have no goals. There's nothing I look forward to, nothing that tells me I need to do my school work outside of my parents wrath. I know they want what's good for me and want me to be great, but I've even asked my mother before and she can't place me on any occupation for a future. I enjoy very little (albeit, I'm a teen, I've experiened very little.) I had few friends when attending the actual high school as we all split apart. Now I'm slacking off in online school and wanting to curl up and die because of it. I don't know what to do, I don't know if I should even post this here. I don't want to be the failure of the family while my cousins go off and do great, especially not being an only child and knowing I have the potential but no ambition to strive towards anything. I enjoy gaming and that's borderline it, but nothing I've ever looked into held my interest. I'm sick of lying and barely getting by to just survive high school.

7,"Ever since i can remember i've been jealous. The main reason for that is because i am also very paranoid, even when i was a kid. It has ruined a relationships and friendships for me. For instance i saw a pictute of my boyfriend with another girl. He sent it to me and the first thought that popped up was ""who the fuck is this bitch?"" and thoughts of him cheating etc. 

Another example is when a friend goes out with someone i know and doesn't invite me. I try to think rationally but it doesn't help. Has anyone here been at least in a somewhat similar case? I have no idea what to do.",26Sep2017,2

9,"Back many years ago, when I was still in high school- my sister who was in college at the time decided to tell me a secret. Now, I don't remember every detail, but I do remember that there wasn't much forewarning prior to the secret, or at least that it was a big deal. So, my sister told me she already had an abortion, and then said not to tell anyone. 

At the time, I remember being devastated. I didn't know she was pregnant. She didn't ask for advice, she just went and did that and wanted me to keep her secret. 

Fast forward many years. My sister in law and I were chatting about relationships. She asked about my sisters long term relationship and why things didn't work. She also was wondering why my sister hasn't found a new relationship. I continued to explain that my sister was in a very serious relationship and has had a difficult time getting over it. My sister in law continued to ask questions about why it was so serious, etc. etc. 

So, I said ""it was pretty serious without me saying why "". She then said was she pregnant, and I said ""possibly"". And she said what happened!? Continued guessing- ""did she miscarry"" and I said no. So, she guessed and I said possibly but not saying yes or no. 

Now, I feel like a complete b****. 
Do I confront my sister?

11,"So, basically I met a girl at a company photo shoot that I really like. She has a sister that was also there that kept saying things like ""Hey, she's single"" while she and I were both in the same place. We spoke and I got her phone number and Instagram, not explicitly for anything intimate. Her sister comes into the office once a week for a meeting with all of the managers. I was speaking with her today and I asked how ""Jennifer"" was, she said that she was good and that we should date. I basically said sure, and she was kind of taken by surprise that I said yeah. Another girl that works with her said ""ya know I always say only good about you to her"". She left since she had to be somewhere but I'm kind of wondering what to do at this point. I haven't contacted ""Jennifer"" since we spoke except following her on Instagram but her sister seems all for it. It's kind of a difficult situation since I'm not really sure what to say to open up a conversation and be casual at the same time, since I don't want it to come off weird. ",26Sep2017,1

15,"My boyfriend 29m and myself 25f both have busy schedules. I have a business, he works on commission basis so some times we put in some pretty long days. We are also big gym goers three times a week is a slow gym week for us. We also have two dogs and it feels like I do most of the caregiving for them. I buy the food, fees them,make sure they have water, schedule all the vet visits, get up at 430am to walk them before work, also usually the first one home so I walk them again after work, then again after the gym. They were both strays(pit bull crosses) and as you know that are the most stubborn a$$holes known to man so these walks are far from enjoyable. I am starting to resent my Bf because it feels like I am the one doing most of the work. And I get it. He is also tired after work he wants to hurry to the gym once he gets home, he typically puts in longer days( I have to hurry home or make a special trip home half way through the day so they aren't copped up too long).

16,"Last december I bought an iPhone 5SE 64GB from the United MileagePlus Merchandise Awards by trading 66,100 miles. While I had instantly noticed that the ""Home"" button had a slightly different click feel and travel compared to other phones. Now almost a year in the screen started to separate at the edges. First the top right, then the top left and later the bottom left. Since it had not been a full year since I bought my phone, I decided to take it to the Apple Store to get it fixed. The tech spent a good 30 minutes and then told me that the screen on the iPhone is a ""Non-Apple"" screen. It is an aftermarket replacement made by some chinese company! The serial number of the phone checks out but the touch screen is completely fake!! WTF??? I received the phone shrink-wrapped in an Apple box. I opened it myself. There were no signs of a ""fake"". I asked the tech if this was a rare occurance and he said that they see this more than often. The store even grave me the diagnostic report that says that the screen is fake. They offered $126 to replace the screen and if something else was to be found it could cost me up to a $260!

17,"So today at the library I'm just on my computer minding my own business as usual when a group of teenage guys decide to sit down on the couch beside me. I try my best to concentrate, but their volume is obnoxiously loud. I overhear one of the guys lean in and snicker that a ""chink"" is sitting next to them. Me. A chink. He then proceeds to laugh like it's funniest thing ever that an Asian person is in their proximity. I still don't understand what was so funny. Have you never seen an Asian person before? Why do you feel the need to say that? I'm sitting right there listening to him mock me. I had my earbuds in, so maybe he thought I wasn't listening. But I was. And I was pissed. 
His friends laughed in response, jokingly telling him to ""stop being racist lol"". I sat there at a loss for words. I glare down the kid who made the ""chink"" comment, but he kept avoiding looking at me. What was I supposed to do? In the moment, I just felt so embarrassed and angry and confused. I eventually just packed my bag and left the library. 

I wish I could simply move on and ignore their immature comments, but the encounter keeps replaying in my mind. I wish I hadn't just left. I wish I'd gone up and given him a good piece of my mind.

Any advice on what I should do? How do you deal with racists? 

Edit: thank you all for the kind words and advice :) I really appreciate it. At the time, I was in a blind rage while typing this up, but it all seems a bit ridiculous and extreme now that I've calmed down some and reflected from a more levelheaded perspective...",26Sep2017,17
18,"No matter what I do, I can't seem to resolve this. I'm really lonely and have so few people to look to for support. I'm hoping you guys can help.

I feel like a total failure right now. I have so few friends and most of those I do have I can't rely on. I've tried to engage with people recently but they either don't respond or I get scarce replies, and it gets me down how people I was once close to no longer seem to want my company. I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a regular occurrence; over the last two years, most of the friendships I've made have fizzled out into nothingness, and I have no idea what if anything I am doing wrong as those closest to me always assure me I'm a great person when I discuss it with them. In fact, some of the people I used to talk to said the same thing.

Romantically I'm a total failure. I can't get a date to save my life. I've tried online dating and asking in person, but nothing ever comes of it. Honestly, I don't so much as get noticed by women, and the very idea of a casual encounter is alien to me. What's worst is that I'm at university, so I'm surrounded by a culture of dating and it's often said it's the easiest time to do so.

Furthermore, my parents are on the verge of divorce, my brother is struggling with his own life, and I'm juggling all these problems whilst trying to focus on my own studies and future.

I do a lot of volunteer work and talk to people. I go to the gym and eat healthily. I travel, I read, I find time to relax and enjoy my own company. Pretty much anything one would usually suggest in order to counteract this problem, I've tried. Hell, I even hired a dating coach and saw several therapists and they all said I'd be okay.

I just don't know what to do. I'm at my wits end. :(",26Sep2017,1
19,"This is probably going to be really badly organized.
I'm in my senior year of high school and I'm taking two dual enrollment classes. I took one college class sophomore year and it was easier than any class I've had in high school so far. So when I was signing up for fall 2017 classes I decided that taking two wouldn't be that bad. I was wrong and I'm paying the price with my mental health. 
The two classes are Art Appreciation and Music Appreciation.

They sound like blow-off classes but they aren't.
Both classes have similar weekly assignments. Both have a discussion piece with the class where you have to post about a video or something and respond to another student. The other assignments are around 1 page essays and/or questions from the book. I have read the material for the classes so far and I haven't learned anything. The books remind me of the r/iamverysmart people who use a thesaurus to make a 5 word sentence into a 50 word sentence. Both classes are very focused on the books and don't really stray from it.

I have a 62% in the one class and a 73% and it's about one month into the classes. I've skipped 3 assignments in each. The way it works at my school is you have to take an hour off the school day for each dual enrollment class and the school pays for the price of the classes (unless you fail them). So with lunch and the two classes I get out of school at 12:30 and I work 20-24 hours a week. Getting out of school early has been so nice for getting more hours and that's one of my main motivations for doing dual enrollment. 

But here I am, working a part time job, going to high school, and taking two college classes. I think that it sounds worse than it is and I'm honestly not sure if I'm procrastinating or if it really is my mental health. Because aside from the cost of the classes, I've convinced myself that I don't care. I don't need these credits because I'm not going to college in general. I just need the shortened school day. But it's a weekly session of angry crying over how much I hate these classes and for the past few weeks I've just been saying 'fuck it' and not doing them. I've always been a procrastinator but I've never just not done assignments.

I emailed my high school counselor because I don't know what else to do. I don't think she'll be able to help me though. I'll probably have to pay full price for these classes and I guess I deserve it because I can't handle the classes.
I'm not even sure what options there are aside from getting increasingly more depressed and probably still failing the class or justing giving up now and failing and still paying full price which I might not even be able to do.",26Sep2017,1
20,"So basically me and this girl are very good friends and I love her a lot, and I know she loves me a lot. Her friends always tell me about how much she talks about me and is obsessed with me, so I know she'll say yes. But does that mean I should still do it? If things don't work out I'll ruin our whole friendship, I'm too scared that if things don't go well she'll just move on and we'll go back to barely knowing each other. Not to mention I have bad issues with overthinking and jealousy that she knows about, and she would help me whenever I needed it, but I feel like she'd get tired of it and just stop liking me. So what do I do?",26Sep2017,1
21,"I will start with how I found it out first. I came back home around 8pm yesterday and went into my room. First thing I noticed was a strange smell. It was definitely something but I didn't know what smell it was. And then I looked at my bed. On the bed sheet (close to the edge) there was some wet mark (size of say, a soccer ball) in oval shape. First impression was, did a cat or dog come in and pee then left? But it cannot be animals as my house door was closed and nothing seemed to be touched (or at least it seemed so). And lastly it wasn't watery. It was like a dried oil which left a dark wet mark on the sheet. When I touched it, it was kinda dry but not really greasy. On that wet mark area, there were also 3 brown spots (not deep brown). It looked like as if they were blended with the oil (I'm guessing it's some kind of oily substance and will explain why later). So the 3 brown spots were made kind of in line inside the wet mark, as small as a golf ball size. There was no sign of leakage on the ceiling as well. When I lifted up the bed sheet, just below the mark, there were very small amount of brown solid powdery substances. I really really regret not taking pics or leaving these for evidence. I was in huge confusion and just put them in the washing machine right away. After washing was done I took it out and checked if any colours or marks were left. And indeed the whole wet area was kinda bleached(it could have been brighter due to not being as wet) and not wet unlike the all other area (this suggests it's oily substance I guess). However, right in the middle of that area (small round shape) was still wet like other parts! The brown stuff were all gone. 
Once this has happened, I talked to my brother and flatmate &amp; his girlfriend who comes over often. 
My brother told me he was home all day staying in his room which is upstairs (my room is on ground level). He said he was in his room pretty much the whole time and didn't hear anything suspicious but his room is upstairs and he had his door closed so if someone was being really quiet he would have no idea. 
My flatmate spent previous night at his parent's place and came back home around 5pm. He said he noticed my room door was fully shut (which I never do when I go out for work) so he thought I was in my room. Then he spent around 2-3 hours in his own room which is also upstairs before going out for shopping. After I told him what happened he told me that about 2 weeks ago, he came home and opened the house door, he heard some abrupt noise made by someone. So he checked the house (not sure if he checked my room) and there was nobody or any sign of things being moved. So he thought it was sound made by the neighbour who lives in a separate section in the house; it is the same house just some specific area is used by the neighbour but all the doors are blocked with shelves and stuff plus she is a police constable. Also, another time, him and his gf found quite a bit of very bright coloured hair left on his pillow. They were even going to ask my brother if anybody used the pillow but I highly doubt anybody did. That's just not our way and no one in the house has that kind of hair.
So I told my landlord who asked me to call him to have a chat, and I also had a chat with the police neighbour and her bf but nothing we could do and no conclusion was made since the whole thing is just so strange. I couldn't find any evidence of things being touched or moved. All valuable stuff like car keys, passports, laptops etc were still left untouched. I never keep any cash with me and neither my brother nor my flatmate said any of their money or belongings were missing.
After we talked, my brother left to go to gym and I decided to spend the night at my friend’s place and my flatmate went to drop his gf off. Later my flatmate texted me and told me this; when he came back home he could see the lady who lives in the house next to us was looking towards our house. My house and 2 other houses share the same drive way and my one is the furthest in the drive way. The lady who lives in the middle house was looking at our house and when he was getting to the house the lady went back inside her house. He thought it was strange so he looked at her house again and the lady was still peeking from the half shut door from inside. 
Now, about this lady. She lives in the house in the second house of the 3 houses sharing the same drive way. She often smokes just outside the door (where she was also looking at my house last night). When my friend saw her looking at our house he said she wasn’t smoking. She is a very nice lady who always says hi when she sees us walking past. She seemed to be living alone. Her age seems to be around 50-60. She is skinny and not tall. 
One thing about my room: apart from the door, there is another sliding door that leads to the drive way. I sometimes don’t lock this door in case I come back home drunk for easy access. Only my closest friends know this and 100% it’s not them. This must have been the entry for the intruder. I placed some stuff in my room so I can notice whether those are touched by someone before I left my home last night. So I will go back today and check.
What I think so far: The intruder has been to my place more than once. Nothing has been stolen. No sign of looking for valuables. The oil was probably a mistake than intentional; the oil mark could be seen too obviously. I do not know what the oil and the brown substance are. 
We are going to always keep all doors locked from now on and going to install a motion detecting alarm or camera or both. But I still want to know what happened. What do you guys think?

24,"So I might make this short. I self harm. I would get a blade out and start cutting my thighs. Lately, I have been watching these videos on YouTube and that made me think about my self harming issue. I started thinking about how this is going to affect me in the future and that I might get caught sooner or later. I considered it but I don't know. I mean, I deserve this, it is helping me so much more now. I am starting to feel more in control of my life because of this but I know that this is bad and I don't know what to do. I want to stop people from ever finding out and the only way to do that is by stop cutting. I want to start being more normal, you know? i want to stop being so fucked up and broken. Anyways, 2 or 3 days ago, I accidentally threw away my blade. I was out of the shower and I just got finished changing. I had to clean up the sink so I got some toilet paper and cleaned up. Well, I then got my blade out and cut myself 2 more times. I put it back in this napkin and accidentally, threw it away with the other napkins. These past days I started feeling like I lost control and that being dead would be way better. I felt more stressed and rebelled a little more, refusing to do chores and stay inside the room all day. Today, I broke out a blade and I cut more but I felt relieved. I fucked up. I had a chance to quit this terrible habit but I can't. And now, it feels like self harming is everything, and is just a part of me now. I want to stop and stop anyone from finding out. But I can't. If I don't have a blade, I just HAVE to get my hands on one. What do I do? I don't want to tell anyone because I know that they are going to tell everyone else and all the attention is on me.

So, I'm a current senior in high school meaning I'm in the middle of college applications and doing all the senior things for the last time. I'm pretty excited for college other than the fact ever since I could talk, my mom has basically chosen the college/major I have to go to. She wants me to go to OU and become a pharmacist. I've already eased the fact into her that I don't want to be a pharmacist but something else in the health medical ish field (maybe) or business even. But the biggest thing is I want to go out of state or even 30-40 minutes away to UCO. OU is a great school of course, most of my friends are going there. But I just wanted to get out of my state and explore. But of course with tuition doubling or even tripling when if I go out of state, I decided staying in state was the best choice financially. I wanted to apply to OU, OSU, UCO, and University of Tulsa even. My mom has been so against me moving out for the longest time. I'm also Asian-American so the culture of staying with your parents forever is there as well. OU is barely 30 minutes away and my friend is offering to split an apartment with me and 2 other people for cheap. I told my I could go to UCO and get tons of scholarships but she coldly told me no because it was so far (40 minutes?) and why go there when you could go to OU. I said okay, so if I go to OU, then I'll do everything I want there. Greek life, band, study abroad etc. Once again rejected to the study abroad factor. My mom is just too attached to me? Is this a common problem with Asian moms?

Often they have a large number of friends over for these gaming sessions, so there's a chorus of four to eight voices. 

I complained to our management office, but they didn't do anything. I asked the guys once to watch their noise and they said okay but didn't do anything, and I'm reluctant to ask again because I once had a friendly exchange with a neighbor where, after a few months, she grew so aggressive and retaliatory that our landlord has to intervene and move her to a different unit—that probably wouldn't happen again, but it really turned me off of ever talking to neighbors. I've called the non-emergency police line a few times, when it was exceptionally late and loud or when the neighbors threw loud parties on weeknights, but I think someone screaming out an open window during the early evening probably isn't a police type complaint? (I'm in Southern California, for what it's worth, but have found the noise ordinances for my city very hard to research.)

Any great ideas I haven't thought of? What would you do? Moving isn't an option and they're starting to drive me really and truly crazy. ",26Sep2017,2

34,"I originally posted this here, but not getting any great answers...

(https://www.reddit.com/r/South_Korea/comments/729swe/is_hyundaikia_really_reliable_in_south_korea/)

I used to have a 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe back in the United States. I had it for quite awhile, and this thing was reliable. I never had any problems with the vehicle.
However, I have heard that there were plenty of serious problems with the brands right here in South Korea. I am a foreigner who is living in South Korea, and this worries me.
From the news, individual YouTube videos, and many rumors state that the cars are faulty. Ranging from Theta-II engine to the diesel four-cylinders, many people complain about the issue. The engines pop due to faulty connecting rods, and the engine oil overflows. And most of the Koreans rant about avoiding the Hyundai/Kia brand.
But buying imports are very expensive in South Korea. High taxes and staggering insurance costs are unbearable for my budget. In addition, I doubt the quality of other domestic brands (such as Ssangyong, Renault-Samsung, GM Korea, etc.)- they have similar issues as Hyundai/Kia.
The older models seem to have no issues. The ones that do are recent ones, notably 2011-2014. And people are getting upset...
As stated above, I can't buy imported models. They are expensive, and the domestic models are unreliable. Public transportation is good, but I want a car badly. What should I do? Should I purchase a Hyundai/Kia from the US and bring it here? Or should I get a V6? Even domestic brands have no issue with the V6 (although I would get taxed)...",26Sep2017,6

43,"I work for a chiropractor. As an employee, I receive free treatments, which is a great perk considering I am a student with limited time and money -and a really annoying shoulder problem (I honestly, don't feel 100% about the effectiveness of chiropractics, but it helps temporarily and it is irrelevant to the issue so please have that debate elsewhere). 

So today I had a treatment but realized I wore a dress which falls right above the knee. He has patients lay face down into a special table. I said, ""Pardon my skirt,"" pretty matter of factly to which he responded really aggressively without the ring of humor ""Yeah, COVER YOUR ASS."" It was really aggressive and bizarre. He then put a heating pad on my back as he usually does although this time he didn't leave the room. He talked without pausing for breath and seemed to be pacing the room but I couldn't tell because I was face down and by this point feeling very vulnerable and uncomfortable... At one point he rested his hand on my calf, and before taking off the heating pad had the back of my neck in a pretty sturdy grasp as he was still talking. 

Because I've had experiences with sexual assault as a young teenager (I'm in my late 20s now), and then later in college I feel I could be a bit sensitive, but not delusional. This seemed to be unprofessional behavior and even uncharacteristic for his interactions with me (only worked there 5 months, maybe). At one point face down on the table I felt vulnerable and was hit with the realization that we were the only people in the building and could be attacked very easily. Which I wasn't, thankfully.

That was basically the end of the interaction but I bolted out of there and had a hard time talking to him after because I felt really confused.

This guy is near retirement, and his wife is trying to give up her receptionist job which is where I fill in once a week. My coworker is of no relation to them told me she found porn on the office computer once which opened up when she went to check something on the web -which meant nothing to me at the time, cause whatever -maybe not at work, dude, but whatever. 

My friend suggested wearing a bunny suit which cheered me up a bit, and more seriously said if I must keep working there stop getting the treatments. Given my history, I feel like I can get over this (sadly) very easily despite my emotional discomfort with it -on the other hand, given my history, I don't want to. I'm familiar with grooming and nagging and backwards tactics. I feel like him saying ""COVER YOUR ASS"" was a way for him to attempt to embarrass me...and then have more control. The guy definitely has an ego.

My question is: Was this on the spectrum of sexual harassment, and how should I handle it? Was this language setting the tone for future comments or touching?

44,"Hi, I am a 12th grade student at a California public high school. All of my classes are going well except for English, where we now have a permanent substitute teacher since our old one got promoted to counselor within the first two weeks of school. Along with all the other shady things this new teacher has done, she is currently making us choose a controversial topic to write an essay on and has made us sit with people who disagree with us in order to get ""counter-arguments and all perspectives on the topic"". She claims this is required by the EWRC, but a simple google search disproved her statement completely. Here is the link: https://www.calstate.edu/eap/englishcourse/materials.shtml

46,"So my friend was recently dumped by her girlfriend of about two months. I'm not completely sure of how she took it, but from what I've seen, it's not good. At the beginning of Spanish class second period, she proceeded to scream at my friend about how something awful happened to her and for him to tell her what it was. (He was told by the girlfriend at lunch) She proceeded to get extremely angry at my friend for not wanting to talk about it in favor of doing his work. I could just chalk this up to her being in a bad mood, but the problem is that she is like this often. She often swears at us, and said it wasn't her problem when we asked her to stop talking to us that way. What's holding me back from having sympathy for her is how she treated my other friend's relationship. 

She talked to my friend like he was a baby when he told her that his girlfriend was potentially moving by saying ""Oh boo hoo poor you""(She was moving closer to where we live, but our friend assumed the opposite). When it eventually came to light that his girlfriend was cheating on him, she just said ""At least you kissed her and knew she liked you. (Her crush) never kissed me or liked me."" 

I'd also like to say that the reason her girlfriend broke up with her is not relationship problems. It's because they didn't want to tell their parents about the relationship, since my friend hates her parents so much, even though they are accepting of it, she continued to lie until her parents were fed up with the lying and didn't want them seeing each other anymore. My friend lied anyway and still saw her. The lying was too much for her girlfriend, so she broke up with her last night. 

I'm finding that I have no sympathy for her at all, but friends are supposed to comfort each other when they go through a break up, right? I just can't find it in me to comfort her.

Anyway I have some stomach problems. And by stomach problems I mean pain and nausea so bad that I've spent 3 years living with my parents because I'm unable to work and dropped out of school. It's hard for me to consistently leave my house. I've been to insane numbers of doctors and tried every diet or pill imaginable most with very limited (if any) success.

When I started drinking I noticed something, I started feeling better. And I'm not talking about WHILE I was drinking, I'm talking about the next day. I'm at most drinking 4 to 6 oz. A night and  three to 6 nights a week. So it's not like I'm getting drunk on it or anything.  But against all logic this made a massive difference in my health. 

My nausea and bloating lessened and many days was completely gone, the violent cramps hurt less and happened less often. The change was subtle and it took me about a week or 2 before I realized something had changed, and that it was that I felt better.  The change was so much that I actually started looking for jobs because I finally felt I was physically able to show up to them. 

But given that I have no job I started to run out of money. So I started drinking less. A couple glasses a week and I still felt pretty good, but when I went a week or so without it my symptoms started getting worse again. And eventually I got to a point where I didn't have any money to spend on alcohol.

That was around a month and a half ago. Now I'm back to hurting and having trouble driving myself anywhere or leaving my home. I can't find a job cause I'm sick, and I can't afford the thing that helped me function. The wine I drink isn't to expensive luckly, hell it's a box wine that cost like 20 bucks and a box last me around a month, give or take a few days.  But I don't know what to do, I need a way to make money, even if it's just a dollar or 2 a day, so I can afford a glass of wine in the evenings and I can get better again. 

To top it off I live with my parents who are both pretty anti-alcohol so I can't ask them for money for it (one of them knows I drink the other doesnt)  and have to keep it in my room (another reason box wine works well). 

The situation is so fucking absurd.  I mean, who the hell could have predicted that a fucking glass of wine would do more to help my stomach than any diet or pill could.

I found the guy on Facebook connected to the last cellphone # that threatened me. He has since blocked me (when I mentioned I was reporting his number to the police) to try and hide from repercussion, and she is acting like she has no idea why people are threatening me and stuff. This chick actually sent me a smug shrug picture like ""oh well, not my problem."" She is responsible, and she loves to see me suffering. Literally no empathy whatsoever; she thinks she did the right thing. The police are just treating this as some kind of prank. It's not fucking funny, though.

Honestly, this is all driving me back down into horrible depression and suicidal thoughts. I know if I get this Twitter post taken down (her account hasn't been active since December 2016 so I don't get why it matters anyway), but if I get the post taken down google will remove it from the image search and I can finally move on with my life. 

Why did Facebook immediately take it down, but Twitter basically tells me ""well, she isn't directly threatening you, sooo, we're gonna keep it up. it doesn't matter that it spreads your name without your consent and that you get death threats over it. we remove accounts that are inactive for 6 months usually, but still, we think it's cool if her intentionally destructive post about you stays up."" This girl posts about abusing prescription medications and doing illegal things, yet she has enough credibility to have a control over harassing me and destroying my reputation for years.

83,"Hello guys,

I just finished school this year and got my ‘Abitur’. I’m 19 years old and I’m going to university next year. 

Enough background let us get straight to my problem. 
I live with my dad after my parents divorced dramatacly last year and my mom left us overnight. 

Here starts the problem:
My dad doesn’t support me whatsoever. 
We have no food at home because he eats at work. 
I get 28€/month as pocket money and have to buy clothes, food and other essentiall stuff for me. 
We argue a lot and last week escalated. 
Again we argued and then he hit me. I had to go to the hospital with my best friend to get diagnosed with a hole in my eardrum. Me and my dad haven’t talked since then and I only saw him for like 1 or 2 hours because he always goes to his girlfriend. 

What can I do to get out of this situation? I’m currently feeling so down that I don’t even know if it’s worth the struggle to continue. 

Thank you for your time.

I’m a 22 year old female who is considering working at a strip club, but as a bartender.
Solely for the money.

I spend most of my free time reading and thinking of different ways to achieve some sort of familial freedom. I rarely go out to drink or party. MAYBE 2-5 times a year.
So working in an environment like a strip I club, I would be out of my element.

I’m a bit gullible, sometimes very naive. I’ve been though some pretty tough things, literally my entire life and I’m not sure when. But at some point I just stopped fighting, I began settling and accepting all types of abuse.

As of late, I’ve been practicing different ways to improve my confidence, I’ve stopped letting people speak to me like shit. I’m standing up for myself. It took my a while, and I’m not where I’m supposed to be yet, but I’m on the way.


Sorry, I started ranting.


QUESTION: how do I work at a strip club, without getting “ lost in the sauce” ? I want to save all of my money, and start a business. Can I be the girl who works at a strip club, but reads and writes on her days off?
Will this turn “ good men” away?

85,"Hello Reddit,

I have been depressed for a while but have tried over the last 7-8 years to get back to my old bubbly self. When things started to improve in the summer of ‘16, my partner (husband) decided to move back to his native country, which was sudden, but we had talked about doing it... and I was actually excited. I had to stay back to complete my Master’s degree and wrap up my job and we agreed that I would join him 6 months later (in Feb ‘18).

When I went to visit him this summer, he dropped a bomb on me that he had been having an affair for the past 1.5 years... while I was probably in one of the worst depressive episodes ever. He also admitted that he had been drinking heavily in order to numb his feelings because he did not know how to deal with it. Additionally, the other woman threatened to get him fired from a job he loves unless I would speak to her. I did and she explained that since she couldn’t have him, she wanted me to tell me in person to make sure I was devastated and would fall back into depression and that his life would be a living hell as he would have to take care of a depressed me again.

A month later, he and I met with a couples therapist - long story short - he doesn’t seem to understand the severity of what he did and I’m pretty angry/upset still + he is still drinking. I have cut off all communication for now (till December) and we’ll talk once I’m ready and hopefully he straightens himself out.

In the meantime, one of the only people I could confide and who was really a big help and support to me when this whole affair thing was revealed has slowly drifted away to the point that we don’t speak anymore (They are an introvert and myself probably more extroverted... we had some difficulties in the past and when we stopped talking, I was always the one to reach out and apologise -  eventually we understood each others’ nature a lot better).

I don’t have very many friends, and I feel uncomfortable sharing things with just anybody - there is the added cultural element here in Asia that we don’t share things that potentially bring shame to one’s family (a failed marriage and depression are such examples).

My husband and this friend have been my best friends for a good chunk of the last decade and I really value them both. I spent majority of my waking hours having fun, talking, laughing and crying with them and vice-versa. I understand they have supported me through some very difficult times and I truly appreciate what they have done. Many acquaintances who have “heard through the grapevine” about our relationship issues and especially my depression have disassociated with me.

All of a sudden, I find myself here, all alone.

I know I need to 
- Continue working on myself with my therapist
- Give it time to minimise the anger and hurt I’m feeling

I exercise, work, am writing my dissertation, watch movies, remember to take my medication and am not resorting to food to sooth my feelings. In fact, eating healthy since all this has happened helped me lose 20 pounds. 
However, I find it hard to socialise because I have to put up a front in public to mask the fact that I’m unhappy, just so I don’t give them a chance to gossip. 

I just feel alone and that I’ve lost a significant part of my being and don’t know how to deal with it. I would at least like to make things better with my friend but I feel that I’m always the one reaching out first and apologising to make things right. 

Thank you for patiently reading, kind Redditors - do any of you have some helpful advice for me?

Thank you.

I've been failing a class each year since i've started highshool (currently in my final year) but that being said...
I've got to redo my classes, so I have an extra science and math. All of this and peraonal shit from my family has been stressing me hard. I never would intentionally miss school on purpose but this month I've alread missed five days.
I come from an ""interesting"" background, you know, father left his country to seek a better life etc. I wouldn't say me, my sis, and my dad have the best relationship, but we got by. I was also the more isolated person from the bunch. I also felt like I could never have any fun for myself without being reminded by my dad about how im wasting my life away. Its not like im some junkie im just stupid when it comes to school and him calling me a dissapointment acouple of times doesnt help. I'm already failing 4 of my 7 classes and i feel i just cant take it anymore. No matter what i do im just gonna piss everyone off i guess. My dad told me numerous times (he was pissed ofcourse) that if im not gonna take school seriously he'll make me work with him. Granted i rather just get my good enough diploma and be over with school. 
I just fucking hate how im always the punching bag and i cant just be happy for myself. Im 18 but once (if or i decide to dropp out) im going to move out just to show everyone i can take care of myself..

91,"Not this past Saturday, but the one before that, I had surgery to remove my appendix.  I had an acute pain on the lower right side of my abdomen, and doctors did tests and said I have developing appendicitis (there's some term for it but I cannot remember the exact name).

Surgery went well, I was released two hours after and went home.  Then I got very sick.  I had over 102 temp and went back to the hospital.  I had chills, fever, and a bad migraine and nothing would shake it off.  They then hospitalized me from Saturday all the way to Tuesday.  They put me on so many different IV antibiotics to see if one would do the trick, but I never felt as though one did.  I was without a fever for almost 24 hours, and my white blood cell count dropped back to normal, so they let me go on two different antibiotics.  Metronidazole 500 MG tablets for 5 Days, with a total of 15 pills.  And cefuroxime 500 MG tablets for 5 days, with only 5 pills.  

I was told to take those daily at the listed times with food, and ibuprofen if I got a fever.  Well, it doesn't seem as though any of these worked.  Every day since I left the hospital I have run temperatures up to 101.4, chills, nausea (which I was told was a side effect), diarrhea (side effect), and within the last two days I have had this severe pain that comes and goes on the middle right side of my abdomen.  

I called my doctor and was told to wait until the medicine is up, and if I still am having trouble then to go back to the hospital or visit my Regular doctor.  I don't want to go back to the hospital because they did multiple blood tests, a stool sample, a urine sample, and nothing yielded any results.  I'm only 17, and both of my parents are as shocked as I am, and I just want to get better.  We were trying to get referred to infectious disease to see if that will produce any results, but I don't know what to do.  I really want a second opinion and/or any ideas as to what I may have.  I don't know what it could possibly be.

92,"A week ago I was the kid who was in Saddleback Churches high school worship team and I was going to graduate High School a semester early and have my AA degree before I turned 18, and now I'm on the verge of being kicked out of both the worship team and high school. 

I'm diagnosed with severe Manic Depressive Disorder, ADD, OCD, and a couple of other minor tendencies I forgot. I'm being treated for the main ones, but I have an extremely high tolerance for the medications I'm on, and I'm even on the main dosage for the main one. I can't get off my medicines because I'm addicted, not that I want to but that was an option my grandma wanted me to take. 

My mom hates me, my dad tolerates me, I've moved 450 miles away from everyone else I love and am stuck with my bitch of a sister, my mom who thinks my past suicide attempts are not serious, and my dad who is also bipolar and switches from being for me to being against me every two or three days.

 I'm not obese, but just fat enough to ruin both my physical image and my self-image, my arms are totally scarred up from my OCD picking and scratching, with similar scars on my back and chest. I tried a diet and working out, and at first yielded great results, but after it slowed down I gave up the diet.

 I still eat healthy, and go to the gym about four days a week, and drink lots of water, just like other guides tell me to do. I believe that God exists and even loves me, to the point I want to be a pastor, I know that deep down, my family loves me, and that if I work hard I can pull myself out of getting kicked out of HS and worship team, but every time my manic high wears off after a week, my world comes crashing down around me, sometimes just mentally but this time it's actually happening. The only thing that keeps me from having another mental breakdown is memes, and even though I know that's not a good coping mechanism, the only other one that works is gaming, which I'm not allowed to do because my councilor is over reacting and threatening to kick me out of school.

102,"As the title says. I live in what used to be a quiet apartment complex before this couple moved in four doors down from me. The first time I called the cops on them, they had been arguing in the parking lot. She was in the car trying to leave, he was standing behind it stopping her from backing up. After screaming at each other for five minutes, she slammed on the gas and drove her car up onto the sidewalk and into one of the complex's shared USPS parcel drop-off boxes. The next day I talked to our management(they're new to this complex, they only acquired it less than a year ago). My new landlord told me they'd be evicted by the end of the month.

It's been months since that incident, and they still live here. Tonight, they started walking up and down the parking lot in front of my apartment. She was screaming as he walked away, but after they went out of view I heard him shout ""Get back here"". I was already upset, but that freaked me out considerably. She was always the one to scream and he would be loud, but he never sounded as violent as that before. I called the cops again, but I believe they drove off before the cops got here. I heard a car going too damn fast drive by, and I can't imagine it'd be anyone but them. Not sure if it was him or her driving off. I talked to one of the cops when they got here and explained what happened tonight and the last time I called the cops on them, but I haven't heard anything since then.

I know they're dangerous from the damage they've done to the property before. These two instances were the only times I ever called the cops, but there have been plenty of other times they come outside and shout at each other. I don't feel safe when this happens. I've verbally complained to management about their fighting, as well as the mess in front of their apartment(old clothes, bottles and cans, bottles of lighter fluid all thrown about a shared walkway that I have to use to get to the dumpster)

Bad break of a 10 year relationship that terminated in the middle of midterms resulted in me going through a severe depression, not going to classes and failing a full semester of classes.

Ive checked other universities to attempt to take the class (Quantum III: particle and nuclear physics), but none in Texas offer it, and none that ive found in surrounding states offer it.

107,"I am in college rather far from home, and one of my only close friends here is a girl I've been friends with for a while, also from my hometown. For the past two years we've been here, she's CONSTANTLY been ""sick."" The first few times I freaked out and offered to come over, give her otc medicine that I had on hand, make her soup, anything. She never took up on my offers, though.

But as the months went by I started to notice that almost EVERY SINGLE TIME I asked her to hang out or go do something, she would say she was sick, with a different ailment every time ranging from headache to cramps to coughing up blood. I asked her if something was seriously wrong with her and that she should see a doctor, and she agreed and just said she couldn’t help it. After that she angrily reported back to me that the doctor didn't find anything wrong even though she had a laundry list of self-diagnosed things she thought was wrong with her.

More months go by, and it's at the point where every single week I ask her over or to go out, something new is wrong with her. One day she had acid reflux so she wouldn’t go out to eat, the next, her face according to her broke out in a rash (looked fine to me) and she didn’t want people to see her. You name an ailment, she had it at some point.

Every time I tried to talk to her, she forced the conversation to shift to how sick she felt with her new illness of the week. The VERY few times she did come out with me and some other friends, she whined the whole time even when she said initially that she was feeling fine. Once, she made our entire group (we’d carpooled) drive her back home from an event 20 minutes away after we’d already got there, then drive all the way back, because her contact lens itched and she wanted to put them away in their case.

I started wondering, since you know how when you wanna get out of a situation, you tell the person you’re not feeling so good? So I thought, maybe she just doesn’t want to hang out with me anymore for whatever reason, and I stopped talking to her. She called me asking why I never asked her to hang out anymore or talked to her. I flat out asked why she got sick so often, and she freaked out saying that she “couldn’t control it”, then vented angrily that the doctors she’d been to didn’t know what they were talking about and that they told her she probably just had an anxiety or depression problem and a lot of the things she complained about just stemmed from that.

Anyway, I’d appreciate some advice on what to do in this situation. I miss my friend but she’s acting like a psycho and I don’t know how to confront her about it without sounding rude and careless. I feel like a bad person for not feeling bad for her anymore, but when she complains about a different thing time after time DOZENS of times for over 2 years, and actual doctors are telling her she’s full of shit, it’s hard to be sympathetic anymore.

I’m not at all the type of person to get into people’s business but this situation just kills me. I’ve been the pregnant girlfriend and would’ve hated to have something like that kept from me. 
What if he gets an std and passes it on to mom and baby? What if he finds a new relationship and leaves her and baby hanging? This isn’t his first kid, but it’s hers.

111,"A little background about my work situation. I am a mid-level manager in an international company of about 200 employees (we are run by a Chinese firm, but many people in the organization are from Europe/North America/Australia, etc). I reveal this because much cultural confusion exists that I believe led to this communication failure that I'll outline below.

At any rate ... Due to my role, I am occasionally involved in ""senior-level"" discussions where sensitive details are brought to my attention about the organization's future plans/current situational status or employee performance. I am privy to these conversations because I am expected to eventually be promoted to a senior level position. I am currently head of my division (about 20 people). There is another mid-level manager who I work alongside (we will call him Carlos), but he is from another division of about 40 people. There are areas where our management overlaps, but Carlos has more institutional knowledge than me and has been with the company longer (plus his division is larger and more established than mine, which is new). His opinion is usually given more clout because he's highly competent and has been with the organization for 6 years, with me being here only 14 months so far. 

At any rate, it came to my attention that Carlos was planning to leave the company after this year. I was told this information by a senior member of the organization who is my direct line manager (we can call him Danny), and obviously decided to keep the details to myself. This was not hugely surprising information as many people expected him to move on either this year or the next. 

In discussion last week with the CEO about renewing my contract I asked if I could be considered for some of the job responsibilities that Carlos  will be leaving on the table should he leave (I don't know if this was appropriate to bring this up, but we were discussing the renewal of my contract so it seemed like the right moment). It was during this conversation that I learned the CEO was not aware of the information of Carlos' departure (only Danny the other senior member knew this, along with Carlos himself -- Danny and Carlos are very close). In the meeting I have now revealed to the CEO that Danny was in essence keeping knowledge about the departure of Carlos to himself. Danny told me as we were discussing changes to my own role before I met with the CEO. 

Did I mess up in bringing this item into my conversation with the CEO? Was it unprofessional?

112,"I have never been asked out my entire life. I look average and was very socially awkward in the past.

I guess I should try to make male friends first but it's kind of tough. I used to be socially awkward so I'm not close to the people taking the same courses as me and I get the idea that some subtly dislike me. 

I do socialise a lot in my dorm these days but my floor is all female. I did join a club but unfortunately almost all of its members are either inactive, just graduated, or is currently on exchange. 

I don't know how to meet guys these days. I joined some one word activities but people in these activities don't really keep in touch and I don't want to make the first move to seem desperate. I am also introverted and the activities I joined (eg. drawing, language classes) are disproportionately female with very few male participants.

Tl;dr: As an average looking girl who has never been asked out before who was socially awkward in the past, how can I meet guys at uni? Also, how can I increase my chances of being asked out from guys I meet at one-off events?",26Sep2017,1
114,"first, when i emailed her personally to ask for a recommendation for becoming a student leader (i emailed all my teachers not just her), she not only rejected me, saying that i was a distracting student that disrupted her lessons and that i was not ready for this leadership role, she even cc ed the email to my form teacher even though he was not at all involved in the situation - she had just wanted to tell on me (in the email, she listed many bad-student-things that i apparently did, but i don't even do at all.) besides, the friend that i talk or asks questions to (only occassionally) during lessons who sits beside me, got nominated when she sent the email to the same teacher. i can't possibly be distracting by myself and have 'private conversations' with myself. but still, i was the only one she recognised me for doing all these horrible things she listed in her email, which i never do, except talking very occasionally which is freaking NORMAL. I'm NOT constantly chatting or like not paying attention in class.
also, she will use my name when it is used in a example sentence related to negative things, and share it with the class. its just an example, i don't feel anything about it, but i think this just shows that she doesn't like me because teachers mostly use either their fav or most hated student's names for examples.

I am a good student with good grades, that participates actively in class, and does all my homework and projects and score well on them. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO? I'm very upset about this issue and she is bringing my confidence level and down and making me feel like i am a bad student ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT I AM NOT.

121,"I'm male, 21, from Canada. I've been travelling New Zealand for 8 months on a one year work-holiday Visa. I've taken one year of University back home right out of high school and failed one course for unreasonably stupid decisions I made. I have not told anyone about this and carry quite a bit of stress because of it. I'm also not sure how it will affect my future studies if I decide to further pursue school. I'm also gay, in the closet, and dealing with deep rooted shame about it. 

With only a few months left of travel I'm stuck deciding between staying another year either in NZ/Australia, or to return home to figure out some sort of future and start University/something to move myself forward. 

I've loved travelling NZ and most of the time feel like I'm not ready to return home however I have a looming feeling that I should get some sort of future started back in Canada. I'm potentially interested in studying physiotherapy or going into Education but I don't know much about either. 

Travel wise, I worked a full year between 3 jobs to save up a big whack of cash before I came here. I've spent about $8000 so far on this trip and have about double that still in the bank so I'm relatively secure financially for now. I believe I would be able to extend my visa for another year here in NZ or get one for Australia relatively easy. 

My dilemma is definitely a big part due to my own perception of how other people would see me staying another year without really starting university. I have friends that are nearing completion of a 3 year BA degree which makes me feel shitty for not having anything to show after all play, no work. I believe my parents would be supportive upfront if I had a plan for continuing to travel however I know they'd love for me to have a secure future and start thinking ahead. 

If I went home tomorrow, I feel like I would be stuck and idle again not knowing what direction to go and also being unhappy that I'm still not able to just be my authentic self. If I stay, I'm worried about wasting more time and still not know what I want to do with my life after yet another year of travel.

Any insight on how to move forward would be much appreciated. ",26Sep2017,6
122,"Okay. This will be long and maybe confusing. So I'll try my best. I'm on mobile to so please bare with me.

There's 3 individuals involved in this. My Sister(37) my niece(7) and my sisters ex de facto partner(47).

Okay. My Sister ex partner lets call him Dave and my sister lets call her Anna and my niece lets call her jess.

So backstory. Dave and Anna pretty much raised me as a child and again rescued me when I was 11 from my abusive mother. Dave and Anna had a son. I lived with Dave and Anna for years until they eventually separated and I moved out with Anna. Dave and Anna were still really good friends and had a custody deal with their son. 

Now Anna has had a very troubled childhood with my mother(there's 15 years between us, I'm younger) and has a number of undiagnosed mental issues. Anna met a guy and they had a child. Jess.

I was in high school when Anna and I had a fight and she kicked me out. I moved in with Dave and lived there for a few years. He was like a father to me and took great care of me. Wore all the expenses and treated me like his daughter. A while after I left there and now have my own place with my boyfriend.

Jess' dad left the scene when she was a baby and hasn't been seen since. However Dave has kind of takes jess under his wing and been a father figure. Dave and Anna have had fights about the custody of their son and now the son is with Dave full time. Jess goes out to see him regularly to ride motorbikes and things. They spend a lot of time together. Jess adores Dave and visa versa. Jess has been diagnosed with autism.

Now. My Sister Anna. She is the type of person that is very spiteful. If she does something for you, it's not because she wants to. It's because then you owe her something or she has one up in you. She's the type of person you could bend over backwards for, but if she didn't like something, everything else gets disregarded. She's the type of person that would make you do something you don't want to do, just because she personally doesn't like it. E.g. She doesnt like coffee, so nobody was allowed to drink coffee.

Fast forward to this weekend. 

Dave had picked up jess and took her out to his place. Anna(in one of her moods) called up and said that Dave could keep jess forever and not to bring her back. Dave brought her back and Anna had locked her daughter and Dave out and was not answering her phone. Dave called the police to come and open the door and they went in and confronted Anna about her behaviour. Anna then slammed the door of daves car abusing him then going back inside. 
It was her and daves son's graduation the following day and she did not even attend. But proceeded to call her son and tell him how much of a dick Dave is and that she wasn't going.

On Sunday I was at Anna's house picking up something she was lending me when she started complaining about Dave.

She then said to me ""Dave has been doing things to jess she doesn't like"" she then called jess over and leant down to her and said ""tell carrotfits what Dave does to you"". 
Jess, looking confused said ""umm. Well he kisses me on the lips""
Anna: ""and what else does he do""
Jess ""umm he shows me his wee wee""
Anna ""and""
Jess ""umm I think he is a bad man""
Anna ""and it was not okay for him to do that was it""
Jess ""no""
Anna ""and he should not have taken you should he""
Jess ""no""
Anna ""and mummy didn't know where you were did she""
Jess ""no""

Then Anna continued on about how Dave is an asshole and that she is moving away(not the first time she's said this).

Now. This is where I need advice.

I DO NOT think Dave has done any of those things at all to jess. In fact I am 99.9% sure. I have lived with Dave for many years by myself when I was a young teen and he NEVER EVER made me feel uncomfortable in any way shape or form. I KNOW he is innocent and that Anna has told jess to say those things.
This is why I think that:

1. That's the type of person she is. She got the cops called on her for being a shitty parent and then all of a sudden Dave is doing this?
2. Jess reaction when talking suggested she wasn't exactly sure of what she was saying. She does have autism, however she is not silly. If something made her uncomfortable, she would not hesitate. There was no emotion.
3. Anna's reaction. No cops were called and nothing has been done. And I'm sure if it was my daughter the guy would already be behind bars.

So this puts me in a shitty situation. 
Do I:

1. Leave it. Let it all settle down. And hope that Anna doesn't mention it to anybody else and jess doesn't say anything at school.
2. Tell Dave what has been said. Which I know will destroy him as he absolutely adores jess. She is like a daughter to him. Plus he has depression.
3. Speak to Anna about it and explain the trouble she could be in for making something like this up. Although I know she won't listen. Once she decides something, there's no changing her mind. 

If I leave it. Then there's the possibility of it getting out of Anna feels like being a witch or if jess accidentally blurts it out. we live in a small town so Daves life will be ruined with that kind of thing said about him and it's not true.

I'm just so stuck on what to do. I know there's people that may think he done it but I can honestly say I do not believe he did anything like that. I trust that man with my life. And although he's not my dad or any relation at all, when I get married Dave will be walking me down the isle. And I would never have an issue with him being around my kids. I know him very well and have lived with him as a child, a teen and an adult and he has done nothing but support and encourage me to be the successful woman I am today. 

What do I do. ",26Sep2017,90
123,"I don't know what's going on in particular, but I've been having weird mixed feelings towards her. Guilt, anger, disappointment, guilt, guilt, guilt. I feel like sometimes she doesn't treat me as a daughter but as more of a friend. One time she told me that I wasn't being a help, since I'm the oldest sister, and that she didn't feel enough appreciation. She also told me that she could feel how upset I was and that I should appreciate her more because she's doing the best she can. She would go off about how ""I'm not the most perfect mom but I tried my best"" bullshit. She's always whining over every minor thing, dismisses me when I express feelings or pains, and doesn't acknowledge how something may be bothering me. I just feel unimportant or unwanted and like I'm not doing enough. She also constantly complains about everything in her life from minor to major details that she shouldn't talk about to her kid, including her relationship with my father and issues that happened to her when she was a kid. She LOVES playing the victim and talking about how we have it easy and how her childhood was so tough and that we're lucky she's our mom, including undermining our issues and always talking about her own. I'm just so tired of this constant treatment that I catch myself acting passive-aggressive towards her and then I go into this cycle of guilt and self-blame and I just feel like I'm making everything up and that I'm acting unfairly because there's no obvious signs of abuse or anything. She's also a fairly attractive woman that in every other aspect seems like a dream mom, and she is a great mom except I can't really feel that because I feel like everyone's been shoving that down my throat.

124,"Hello people of Reddit, I have finished university with a 2:1 degree in Journalism but have decided that I don't want to go into the field because it's mostly self-employed and lacks security.

It's not like I wanted to have a crush on her; I just started looking at her a different way one day, and it's been getting worse daily. Normally, the answer would obviously be to just confess, but there are several factors in the way.
For one, she's panromantic asexual. For those of you who don't know, that means she wants a romantic relationship but doesn't want sex and the like. This is a huge gray area: I don't know what exactly she wants, and I don't know if I can have a relationship with no sex, at least in the long term. 
Next, she has crushes on other people. It makes me so angry to sit there and listen to her admire other people, but there's nothing to do to stop her from looking at others the same way I look at her. And the final thing:
A very close friend of both of us most likely has a crush on me. I can't say for sure, since the confession was anonymous, but I'm 98% it was her. Why is this important? She and my crush used to be best friends, and she's going through really tough times right now, so I'm scared of what she might do if I confess to my crush.

131,"So, basically all my life i've felt like i boycot myself, in school I always had the greatest ideas but when it came to execution i always failed, I always thought that if I actually did something people would end up being disappointed.
This kind of thinking has been constant throughout my life, when I was a kid I was bullied at school for being fat, and also gay, so I started hanging around with some bad company in order to protect myself from constant beating, this ended up making it difficult to concentrate in school and I only started college at 21.
I was taking a masters in architecture and I dropped out for financial reasons at 25. I always worked while in college and continued to work after i dropped out.
Now to the more sentimental stuff, when I was a kid I was seduced by an older friend, only recently I have been able to see that I was actually raped, I always felt dirty because I actually enjoyed it. So yeah, I'm gay and I'm ok with that, the problem is that I have trust issues, in others and in myself. My family while not conservative is not very open minded so only my mom knows about it, and she doesn't like it a bit. Now, this year I met an awesome guy, and things were awesome when we were together, but I always feared I would disappoint him, so i never made a move to officialize a relationship, we just hanged around, hooked up, and I was never able to tell him I thought of him as more than a friend, also, I should point that I was extremely busy with work and helping some friends building up their own business while we were meeting, but anyway, we drifted appart a bit but I never actually stopped caring for him or thinking about a life with this guy. Fast forward two months I get in contact and we meet, only to find out that he is already in a relationship with another guy. Now, this really knocked me down, cause I know that he still likes me (he actually told me that) and basically I lost him because of my fears and insecurities cause we were not ready for the same thing at the same time. I havent been able to get propper sleep or eat right for the last month, and I'm lacking the will to do anything except hitting the gym and get completely exhausted. Now, we have been in touch, and he has problems in this relationship, as anyone has, and I'm trying to be supportive, cause i wanna keep him as a friend, but it pains me too much hearing about his stuff and thinking that he would be better with me.
Getting back to education, I finally decided to change courses and need to apply again for college, the only problem is that in order to do that I need private lessons in Math, now, I keep having a full time job, I work at a family business and schedules are being incompatible. My father whos the owner of the company doesn't seem to understand that I want something different than what he wants and always puts doubts in my head about my goals (and I undesrtand where he comes from, because i've already dropped out of college once).
The point is (and this are the topics in which i need advice) I've always been worried about failing with family and friends that I completely put myself in second plan.
How can I stay focused on goals while everything around me seems to be putting me down?
How do I deal with the fact that someone I actually care for and love is in a relationship with someone else and I'm basically around for whenever he needs a friend?
How can I drop these fears of disappointing everyone and actually live while making mistakes?
I would appreciate any kind of advice, I'm in a really bad place and trying not to make it seem like I'm always complaining, but it is getting really hard to keep my chin up and face everything.

Thanks in advance to whoever puts in the time and effort to help me.

134,"Hello reddit

So I recently  graduated from college,but instead of landing that straight out of school badass career everyone thinks about, I landed on the more statistically likely side and am currently working at a local resteraunt to make ends meet. So naturally this isn't ideal and I don't intend to stay in this line of work forever (or very long for that matter).

In college, the only real skill I developed that has any application is speaking japanese. I'm not fluent but I'm comfortable with how it flows and the difficult stage of learning has long passed. Really I would love to turn this into my speciality, and develop it almost like a trade skill. Anyways,  soon I was thinking about signing up for a program that sends me to Japan to teach english, and I think it would be a great thing to do for both me and my professional career.

This is where the problem comes in, no one in my life wants me to go. My mom is terrified because of the recent north Korean nonsense, and even worse my boyfriend is looking at grad school and is really not happy about the idea of me being an ocean away despite me telling him how I'd have a few months break and he's get to come stay with me during the summer. I tried telling him that until we fully develop our professional selves our early 20s are just going to be kind of crazy, and that if we just go with the flow and communicate, visit, and encourage each other we would be fine, but it's becoming a real source of tension and I have to make decisions soon or I'm probably going to be in food service for a long while.

For obvious reasons. that his brother goes to). I said I was considering it. He asked if he it’ll be cool if his dad put in a word in to the college, I said yea that’d be pretty awesome (I already knew I could get into this college but why not).

All in all it’s nice, quiet and easy for me to just spend hours scrolling through subreddits with ease. Saturday  started out the same as every, a couple of check ins here and there some side work easy stuff. Locked my automatic sliding doors down at 12 (like always procedure) until about 3 when everything dies down and I’m left alone to watch Netflix in the lobby,  I’m back in the cafe area out of sight of the front door so if someone stays here they use their key card and it will open it if no I have to do it by turning the switch , I hear slight tapping nothing to alarming and get out of the chair to see a big white man wearing a black long sleeve shirt and jeans and a green pillowcase over his head. We made eye contact I think well I couldn’t see his eyes but his head was align with mine, and he starting banging, stabbing the door with a 10 inch very thick looking butcher knife with a blue handle I froze for a second unsure of what to do and then my legs just carried me I grabbed my phone before running into the bathroom and locking the door behind me I immediately sat on the floor and called the cops all while the banging kept happening I was sure this was fucking it for me, that the glass would give out and shatter, that he would get to me before the police showed up. I was hysterical and the dispatcher was doing her best to calm me down but I just couldn’t not until she told me it was safe to come out was I even capable of moving off of that tile floor, I still couldn’t bring myself to open the door “I’m scared what if he’s out there” I just imagined him being behind the door waiting for me to come out so he could slit my neck with one quick gesture. she reassured me everything was okay and that there were several cops there. That was an understatement, a total of 11 cops showed up and I turned the switch to let them all in, and they told me he came on foot and left on foot, none of them knew where fat white 6’0 man in a long sleeve black thermal (in 80 degree weather might I add) is?

142,"So I'm a librarian and one of my co-workers is retiring. It was a mutual decision with her and our workplace and frankly we're all pleased to see her leave. She's very homophobic and yells at children. She also is awful to our pages and is infamous for pawning off work to all of us. 
I RSVPed to her retirement dinner in the interest of a co-worker who encouraged me to be the bigger person and go. But that co-worker is now sick and not going. It's also going to be a really expensive dinner at a place I have no interest in going to.

So; do I be a bigger person and go? Or have my boyfriend call me to pick him up because ""his car broke down"" ",26Sep2017,1
144,"Me and the boyfriend have been together 7 years. Last year we broke up for about a 6 month period. Before said breakup, there was this girl he worked with who tried to get with him. 
      At the time of breakup, I simply told my boyfriend (ex at the time) to be happy, but asked him please to date anyone but the girl who tried to get with him while we were together. Its now 15 months after the breakup, and weve been back together for about 9 of those, now living together again.
         While we were split, my bf had promised to not see this girl, and told me he had no interest in her. But said there was this other girl he met on tinder. (Keep in mind weve been best friends since i was 16). I later find out the tinder thing was a lie. He met the girl from work before the breakup. He worked two jobs and was never home for the end portion before the split so he wasnt home much and was mainly for sleep.
         I found out last week the girl he met at work was the girl he had promised to not see and claimed he had no interest. That he lied about her name to make it seem it wasnt her. Even saved the number in the phone under a false name. 
          He doesnt know i know. And his keepin of his promise of not getting with that girl was a major factor in me taking him back. To me, it seems now that he left me to persue something with this girl from work, and since it didnt work out with her thats when he decided to come back. I feel like the second choice. Or last resort. I feel betrayed.
           Problem is, if i confront him, ill have to tell him how i know. Which will ruin my friendship with my now mutual friend. He works with him and was there to see it for himself. But this information is eating me. Im happy in the relationship, and i love my bf dearly. Some say I should tell my bf i know and confront him to try to work through it. Others say i should pretend i dont know if i want the relationship to continue. Should I confront him? Or leave him and not tell him why? Or just pretend i dont know and try to move on?",26Sep2017,1

147,"TL;DR: I have been forgetting things from my academic career due to depression. Now that I aim to transfer to University of Michigan, I need to refresh myself on STEM subjects and topics. How do?

Hello and Good Morning STEM professionals! I am an undergraduate student studying pre-pharmacy in Michigan, and am looking to one day join the ranks of research pharmacologists across the world. After a lot of work, I finally received my associates degree in science, and will be transferring to a university for further education next year.

My path hasn't been easy though. I graduated from high school a year ahead of my class in 2012, and it took me another 5 years to get my associates.

In those 5 years, I have been through a lot of emotional trauma. I have been fighting depression for a long time, and it worsened during those 5 years. But that's in the past... I am just now beginning to conquer my depression, and re-take control of my life for the first time in what seems like an eternity.
Here's where my problem comes in..

My undergraduate education has been scattered across 5 years, and I know that I am forgetting some of what I've learned in my time with my community college. My teacher's were amazing, I attribute the memory loss to my mental state for the majority of my education. I also made the mistake of finishing nearly all of my STEM courses early on in my college experience, so my most recent academics were humanities and other non-STEM subjects.
I know that I am slowly starting to lose topics and subjects to memory, that I believe are vital to my future education. I am hoping to transfer by next year, and that doesn't give me long to get back on my feet academically.

What are some of the best ways that I can refresh myself? I particularly enjoyed my Chem courses, and have decided that going into a bachelor's program, I will probably focus more on Bio-Chemical Engineering and the sort. Eventually I aim to achieve a PharmD, or at the very least a Master's in Pharmacology, and hope to one day work for either the CDC, and/or the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO).

At the risk of sounding uppity, I know that I have a lot of potential to offer to the sciences.. A lot... Despite my chronic depression, I am a very bright kid and have achieved a lot in my schooling. I say that only because my teachers insist that I embrace it.

I one day hope to help in conquering many diseases, and help the world through my research! But I can only do that with a university education, and getting into the University of Michigan is going to be extremely difficult. So I need to have the academic know-how to back it up.

Please help! How do I beef up my qualifications and get my mind back into doing PV=nrt equations, and titration experiments?! Any suggestions are appreciated, and I would be extremely grateful for any advice on the topic at all really!

-Sincerely, A Hopeful Student",26Sep2017,1

I'm a student and around the end of last year I offered one of my friends (call him A) a room in my flat since he seemed to hate the place he was staying. Over the course of the last year, however, I realized that we have basically nothing in common. In addition to this, one of my other friends (with whom I have a lot in common) is looking for a place to stay next year (call him B).

As such, I'm going to give the room to B next year, but I'm not sure of the best way to tell A. Living with A has not been an unpleasant experience and I want to make sure he understands this. 

Thanks in advance for any replies!

We're in South Africa, and the flat belongs to my family. There is no official lease contract (for either of us), but our arrangement was only discussed for this year. To clarify, we did not specifically state that it is only for 2017. We simply did not mention anything after that at all.

	Kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place here so any thoughts would be appreciated. Back in April I asked a friend that I’ve known for a few years out (well call her J). Now I met J thought C who I’ve known for around 10 years now after they had kind of a not so serious dating relationship about 3 years ago which is when I first met J. After I asked J out, we dated for probably about 2 weeks before she left for a month to go visit some family. This is where things get rocky. So C has some form of depression (this is the reason he always uses for issues with people) and basically used J to vent and play therapy to a certain degree, suddenly J isn’t able to get phone calls because of where she was and he takes this personal. From here on its all downhill, for the past few months on and off C and J have been going from friends to not friends because C won’t talk to anyone unless they reach out to him and if J doesn’t reach out on a practically daily basis, then C says things along the lines of she’s blowing him off and not trying to make their friendship work. I’m getting stuck in the middle because J is very emotional about this and with good reason, C is literally her first person she considers to be a true friend. I’ve tried reaching out for the two of them but I can’t keep fixing a relationship that only one person wants to put effort into. I’ve asked my dad and other for advice and the answer they give is to drop C and let him be miserable, but I don’t want to lose one of my few friends and J doesn’t want to lose him either. Is there a way to resolve this? Or should I just do what everyone has said and leave him be?

175,"This is me ranting, so I apologize ahead of time.

So I have a full time factory job and the area of the plant I work in consists of myself and four other people working together. There are about thirty other people that are about of my general area as well, but I don't fully interact with all of them just a few.

I would say within the past two years I've improved my attitude towards people in the sense that I feel like I've gotten better about blaming others/world for my problems and keeping my cool. I'm the only full time worker in my area and the oldest so I try to hold my composure externally more than what I'm feeling internally sometimes.

I will be the first to admit that there are numerous things that I'm not happy about in my life and these are all things that I've brought on myself, but I don't want to become angry towards people. I'm not volatile, I just don't want to be around them and I want to be by myself. I'm a very introverted person who can be extroverted, but it wears me out.

Lately all of my old group of fellow workers have been leaving and we've gotten a mix of newer people and people who are from other places in the plant. A lot of them are younger than myself and I understand that, because I was that age once and I get how much people want to feel accepted. But I don't want to be looked at as a leader even though they see me that way. I really want to go in, do my job at a good, it doesn't even have to be fully proficient level, and go home. 

I really don't feel the need to be friends with everyone there, but they see me that way because they don't know that internally if I never saw some of these people again it wouldn't upset me one bit. I know that sounds harsh and I don't mean it to be, but it's how I feel. I completely understand that a lot of it is just part of my personality. 

It's just little things to, like I know they're trying to help but they just get in the way or saying things to each other about me flirting with a ""woman"" on the line who I consider my go to person. I really wouldn't care if they were aggravating me to my face because that's what guys do sometimes, but it's more about being passive aggressive when I'm sitting over there talking to this very happily married woman about things like ""Her Husband Being Sick"" or ""All of the Stuff Going on In Her Life."" And on my end I'm asking her advice on what to do about this woman I'm in love with or telling her about the internal struggles I have.

All it does is make me resent them and not want to be around them. I hate even typing this because I'm talking bad about them when I know it's my own problems. I just wanted to get this out because I'm worried I'm going to lose my cool. Last night I was aggravated beyond belief so I kept to myself and when I'm like that they don't know how to act around me, so it's like they get more obnoxious. 

I know that I'm just complaining, that it's my personality and me that's the problem. I'm legitimately just becoming an older person, I'm 29, who's stuck in his ways and misses the people he used to work with. The people I work with aren't bad people and they have good hearts/intentions. There are a multitude of areas in my life where I'm unhappy and there are probably only about 4-5 people I genuinely feel comfortable with in my life.

I get this is a reflection of my personality, that this post is all over the place, and that it's just basically an unorganized rant.

179,"WARNING : long story, some ranting, but lots of important detail

Two years ago, the deputy manager position at my work became vacant. I was the longest tenured assistant manager at the time and I had a fairly good relationship with my general manager, who I will call Bob.  Bob has been my boss since I started working at this business 12 years ago.  I was always under the impression that we had a good relationship.  In a workplace full of teenagers and slackers, I was an extremely hard working employee and he seemed to appreciate that.  For these reasons, I fully expected to receive the promotion.  

However, the job went to a 20 something year old girl, let's call her Molly. Molly had only been working as a supervisor for a few months.  She had previously been a regular team member for a year or two, so I vaguely knew her.  She was a typical young lady who seemed to enjoy chit chatting with fellow employees more than she did working.  I have no idea why anybody ever thought it was a good idea to promote an overgrown teenager to a supervisor position, let alone deputy store manager.  

From the day I started working with Molly as shift supervisors, we had tension.  I often caught her using her phone and flirting with young male customers instead of getting our duties done.  When I confronted her about this, she basically told me to mind my own business.  As the more experienced one, I tried to make it clear that she was a step below me.  I suggested she watch and learn how someone in a management role should be acting.  However, she would ignore me and do anything to get under my skin. 

I wanted to tell Bob about the way this girl behaved at work, but I didn't want to blow my chances at becoming assistant manager.  Eventually, I think she started talking behind my back to Bob.  He started acting strange around me and seemed to start having a great relationship with her.  She was probably putting on a phony act in front of him.  I had seen her do it in front of some other high ups and certain customers.  It was after she got the deputy manager job that I realized they had most likely been talking about me in private.  Despite my anger and disappointment, I still had to make a living, and moved on. 

Fast forward to current day.  Molly is still the deputy store manager and she is more of a bitch than ever.  She loves having control over people, specifically me.  Molly thrives off of having power over the only employee that ever stood up to her.  

In the meantime, Bob has announced that after 17 years, he is stepping down as store manager of our store effective at the start of the new year.  He recently announced that Molly would be promoted from deputy store manager to general store manager.  The anger and disappointment has come back.  This should have been me.  I used to dreamed about being manager of my own store and I would have had my opportunity had this vile little brat not stepped in the way.  

I recently sat down with Bob for a yearly employee sit down and he told me that he had just gotten off the phone with corporate.  They want me to take a promotion and replace Molly as the deputy store manager when she becomes store manager.  If this was 2015, I would be jumping off the walls with joy.  However, knowing that Molly is going to be the big boss ruins it.  Should I accept it and play second fiddle to this woman that I dislike or should I just quit my job so that I don't have to deal with the drama any longer?

He says that it's an online job, its called Modern Commerce and it's good ""side income"" that all I need is a laptop. He told me over the phone he'd like to interview me, along with his colleagues/partners  and show me how all of this works. He told me that the interview is at 8:30 PM and that he'd text me the address (this creeps me out a little) . He just told me to let him know when can we set a date and I asked him where is his office located and he said he'll let me know..  he also says that in this particular job you have to be in said location at least one day a week at 8:30 PM .

182,"This past weekend, and currently, I am having the biggest fight I've ever had with my girlfriend. It was so bad that I basically convinced her to not break up with me ( we've been together 1 year and 3 months). I definitely said a few things I shouldn't have. I'm in college and she is in high school. She went to the homecoming dance with a guy friend and I was okay with that, but she wore a very very very revealing dress, and she got in trouble for it at the dance. My parents saw pictures of it and used the word ""slutty"" to define it, and honestly I kind of agreed. I talked to her about the dress and I told her how my parents described it and she didn't take that very well. She said that this comment tore her apart and she will never be the same. That started the fight. Anyway, we got to the point where she was bringing up what I've been doing wrong the whole time In our relationship. I promised her I'd change for the better and everything, but she said if she doesn't see change in me or she is still hurt in 2 weeks then we are over. Any suggestions on what to do or say?

I immensely enjoy the time we spend together, and I've always had a little thing for her, but I thought it was something that I could keep under control.  There have been times when I thought she was interested in more, but then if we broke up right away or had a fight it would be catastrophic because we see each other so much, and have the same friends.

However, after seeing her again, after a while, I've just sort of been hit by a train, and cannot stop thinking about her. She was interested in spending time with me but, I know I've been giving off a nervous and exhausted vibe. Right now I'm physically and emotionally exhausted. We go to all the same classes and go out to dinner twice a week usually. Should I try and distance myself? (which is a bit hard). I also don't want to alienate her as a friend, but I know I won't be able to move on if I don't get her out of my mind. Would it be best to talk with her about how I feel before doing anything? We've dealt with alot together and there have been moments where I thought she was interested, but I think it was just my imagination. I'm just in an awkward situation where its hard for me to do anything, tell her how I feel or slowly fade away. I just don't know what to do.

TL;DR:I realized that I'm (for lack of a better word) love (I'm very fond of her) with my friend. We've never had a chat about our friendship. Should I just have a frank chat with her?

206,"I need to “break up” with a toxic friend, but I am at a loss for how to do it. 

We became friends five years ago in college, and she has always been a rather tough person, but things have gotten progressively worse since we graduated. I worked very hard after school to jump into my professional field, while she has moved from job to job with no real direction. This has created a lot of resentment, and she frequently berates my “corporate” lifestyle as she pursues various freelance jobs and travel. Her insults are so upsetting that I refrain from discussing work (which is a big and happy part of my life) with her, period. 

She is not only condescending about my job, but also all of my relationships. While she has not made a new friend since graduation, I have a wonderful boyfriend and am fortunate to have cultivated good friendships in our city. When we discuss social activities, she makes fun of how I choose to spend my time and insults the things that my friends and I do. When I invite her to come with us, she routinely insults the people I am with— about their looks, jobs, taste, etc. It can be mortifying! 

This friend is also regularly rude to my family (she once accused my older brother of having no sexual prowess and on more than one occasion pointed out that my sister gained weight in college) and most of my friends who she has come into contact with have privately discussed how she treats me and recommended ending the friendship. My continued relationship with her is putting a great deal of strain on many of my other, positive relationships. 

While my friend enjoys being aggressive and intimidating, confrontation makes me extremely anxious and I tend to become a shrinking violet when the opportunity to address the behavior arises. How can I put an end to the misery this friendship causes me without hurting her and panicking when the moment to have the conversation comes? ",26Sep2017,1

I'm not too physically attractive. I'm short, my face isn't great, and I don't come from a wealthy family so I can't afford to buy new clothes all the time. Most of my stuff comes from goodwill, salvation army, etc.

Living with them has gotten my confidence to an all time low. They're always talking about their tinder matches while I've only gotten two over the last couple months, neither of whom have responded to me. At the bar they always get attention while girls sneer at me. In class, on campus, and in school clubs I struggle to catch any girls attention. I've been going to the gym and getting more fit but that hasn't been helping all that much.

I know that my personality outshines both of theirs, and I feel good about that. However, it seems like without looking attractive, my personality doesn't matter that much. I don't even think I look that bad but it seems like other people do.

210,"Good afternoon! 27F here.

I've been feeling taken advantage of from management within my current company. I don't feel valued. They keep giving me more and more responsibility within multiple departments, and I don't feel that I'm compensated fairly. I'm the only one within the company that has multiple roles, and I have been trying to figure out a way to speak with them about this. I pretty much do the jobs of TWO people but make the least amount of money. The big boss told my coworker that he is next in line for a raise... but he started out making more than me and I've been with the company for longer. He has about half of the responsibility that I do.

I'm the admissions/administrative coordinator for our center (though my technical title is ""administrative assistant"", the Executive Director approved the former job title for my business cards, and when asked he says I'm the ""administrative assistant""). Also, I'm the only admin in our building. There's a ton of responsibility - we treat vulnerable clients who are struggling with addiction and psychiatric problems. There are two programs within our company in the area, and our offices are in the same business complex. The program that I have primary responsibility in has four full-time employees. I'm responsible for office administration, maintaining our patient census, collaborating with our corporate intake department to know who will be admitting to us, guiding patients through the admissions process, collaborating with our physician, therapists, and nurses, collecting urine drug screens and sending them off for further testing, running 5 clinical groups per week (Relapse Prevention, Family Orientation, Skills groups, Step Group), preparing for these groups, documenting notes for each of these groups, keeping up with patient charts in our electronic medical record, participating in weekly group/individual supervision and treatment team meetings, keeping up with office supplies and sending out orders, maintaining a log of insurance checks, other billing stuff, taking notes at quarterly CQI meetings, etc. It is a lot, and I'm learning. I make $14/hour. Our ""recovery coach"" runs six groups per week and meets with clients individually every other week, and he gets paid more than I do. So, they basically have me working as a ""recovery coach"" and office coordinator.

So I've been putting my feelers out there for another position (medical-clinical office management/coordination). I have an interview this afternoon for an office coordinator position within a busy but well-known solo doctor's office. This doctor has a very good reputation not only within our major city but the whole country.

Of course, I've been learning how to market myself for this interview. It's really hard to get a ballpark number on how much I should expect to be paid, especially because ""office coordinator"" is pretty broad and the job description is a bit vague (billing, insurance, scheduling, ""administrative responsibilities""). I have a list of questions that I will be bringing to the interview. I will, of course, only make this change if I'm offered more money than my current position. I would really enjoy the change of specialty within the medical office, but my husband and I would like to start trying for children next year, and I want to find a company that not only pays me fairly but allows me to grow in my competency by sticking to one role. I'm always willing to go above and beyond, but I'm sick of feeling taken advantage of.

I guess what I'm asking is, how should I navigate this? Do you believe I am being taken advantage of? I don't know what is fair in terms of compensation for what I am doing. I am seeing anywhere from 25k-45k per year. Right now I am making around 28k, when I'd really like to be taking home 35-40k. I don't know if that is fair, though another employee who has about the same amount of responsibility I do makes 40k. It doesn't seem outrageous. I'm good at office management, and really am a hard worker. Am I dreaming?

212,"I have accidentally talked to a girl on the internet, she asked me why am depressed because this is what my posts look like and she tried to talk me out of it then I tried to talk to her back, then when she told me her story it was too hard to believe, but I just can't assume this is someone trolling, I'm gonna put this as points:


-She's 14 years old

-Her younger siblings ask her to kill herself

-They say she should jump

-They make her think she's worthless

-Her mother calls her a slut

-She wishes she's dead

-They don't hit her

-Her older sister asked her to come live with her and her boyfriend next year

-She's getting skinnier after not eating much

-Her mother doesn't let her break dance and do the stuff she wants because she think she's gonna become a slut

-Her father doesn't care


I am not worried about her being physically abused but I worry about her suicidal thoughts at this age and when I asked her to get help she said:


-She's afraid to tell anyone

-She's afraid to get help

-She's afraid that her parents finds out


The problem is that I'm 22, she's 14 and we live in two separate continents, so there's no way for me to meet her even if she lived right next to me, but that can't stop me from being worried, I'm still in contact with her, I have asked her to let me know if anything happens to her.


What else do you think I should do? should I signal that to child care or something? (she lives in Germany) or should I just keep trying to make her feel positive thought this year? I'm afraid to ask her any personal questions like her name, address or pictures because she's underage and I don't know if this could get me in trouble or not, there are some doubts in me that this is probably just an over reaction kid but what if it's true? what if I had the chance to help but I didn't?

I'm a nineteen (almost twenty) year old gal that has just began her freshman year of college at the beginning of this past September. While proudly appearing to be full of laughs and moving towards a future in STEM to those around me, I have honestly felt myself being torn apart on the inside. 

It's become increasingly difficult for me to find the effort to get up in the morning and I've been wrestling with unhappy thoughts during the days. Struggling with mental health is nothing new to me as I'm a former high school dropout and teenage runaway that was later diagnosed with PTSD and GAD after escaping my abusive family and circumstances. I already take three pills a day and I wouldn't be surprised if it's delve into situational depression at this point. I don't mind seeking therapy out, but I'm honestly struggling to do so. 

I feel so overwhelmed by even getting up everyday that I don't know what to do anymore. I can't go home (as I really don't have anywhere to go) and I'm  struggling to find the money to pay for my education. To make matters worse, the part of my family that aren't abominable pieces of shit won't help me in spite of clearly favoring my sister (they signed for her car and won't sign for my loans) and I'm pretty sure that my friends don't care much either. I'm not even sure if I'm here, at college, for a reason as I'm apparently not ""good enough"" to be in any classes related to my major right now. Sometimes I just get so pissed at the world that I feel like throwing myself in front of a moving car and then there's my horrible diet that leads to headaches.

I feel like the entire world is against me. I don't know what to do or where to go. I'm lost. Does anyone on Reddit have helpful advice they can give?

Nevertheless, i am thinking of asking him to drop the price to 100. Any advices

233,"Hello Reddit i have seen good feedback here and i could use some from you generous folks.

To start i work in the USAF i am an e-4 however my wife is an illegal immigrant. My wife was born with a rare disease known as nephrotic syndrome in Mexico and was receiving what was at the time some type of experimental medicine which was killing her if the disease didn't first. So, her parents did whatever they could to get into the United States as fast as possible to find a doctor to save her which of course involved a really interesting story about her travels over the border. Luckily, they made it and saved her YaY! they crossed at her close to her 9th birthday and she has lived here and gone all they way through high school and then at 20 years old i married her YaY! 

Now I have been in the airforce since i was 21 and i will have my 6 year contract end in Aug 2018. I cannot get my insurance to cover her since she is not documented or so this is what i am told. I have spent thousands trying to get her at least a legal status if not a full residence change but still to this day i haven't gotten anywhere i don't honestly know what to do.

Now to this hell of a week. My passenger side window was broken and my belongings were stolen from my truck. I fell and hurt my back and on top of it all my wife's physical came back with symptoms of her disease.

Now for your advice if you can. What can i do to make my wife's legal status change and/or is there anyway i can get any medical coverage for her to get the best care she deserves. I don't have much cash and the x-rays she is currently going under will pretty much leave me with almost nothing left. if the disease has come back it would be an astronomical cost i can't afford but i would give everything i had to pay for it if i have to.

Thank you guys for taking the time to read this I hope your days are filled with more laughter than misfortune and are better than my week.",26Sep2017,1

235,"I'll make this as digestible as possible:

- I'm a female videographer and I was working at an event. I brought my boyfriend to assist / guard my stuff while I was shooting.

- A previous client who is well known and liked in the community and has been instrumental in helping me get new work got me another client at this event. They are friends and I consider the previous client (lets call him PC) a friend as well, so when he asked to come along just to watch me work I thought nothing of it.

**The incident:** I'm taking a video of the client, my boyfriend is several feet behind and to the side of me, PC is several feet behind me and PC's friends are like 20 feet away watching. PC offers advice on a move for the client to do and as he's talking he gets closer and I back up to get the shot, video camera glued to my face. 

My boyfriend tells me this is how it went down: he saw me back up really close to PC without realizing it. PC lets me and doesn't move and I'm almost back-to-front to him. PC puts his hands down and open in a ""DAT ASS"" kind of position and looks at his friends to see if they'll laugh at the ""joke"". My boyfriend waits a couple beats to make sure he's seeing what he thinks he's seeing (he's paranoid in general and has misconstrued things before) and then goes up to PC saying firmly ""No, step back"". 

I don't see/hear any of this. All I see is my client looking behind me and then saying to my boyfriend (something like) ""I like you, you don't let anyone even look at her wrong do you?"" Then a few seconds later I see PC walking away from us and sitting like 20+ feet away on a bench by himself. He doesn't join us for the rest of the shoot. I was just trying to focus on my work so I didn't think anything of it at the time.

My boyfriend told me afterwards what he saw and I'm shocked and disgusted and disappointed. I just don't know what to do now. If I had seen anything blatant, it wouldn't be a question-- I'd have confronted him by now. However I didn't see it, and I'm worried about my business. If I confront him without solid evidence I'm worried my business will suffer (even if I did have evidence it might suffer but at least I would have something). PC has been such a good friend and business partner to me up until now, I guess part of it is that I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that he could have disrespected me like that.

**I'm not sure how to approach this professionally and not risk my business.**

My best lady friend said I should absolutely confront him, but perhaps do it in a joking / light hearted way and just reiterate subtly that stuff like that isn't cool.

My boyfriend said he felt like the situation was approached and dealt with already so I don't necessarily have to confront him and risk my business. Just keep my eyes open and keep in mind what kind of person PC is.

My thoughts: I have no idea what to do because I don't like confrontation, I don't want to alienate possibly hundreds of people with an accusation like this, and suddenly 'unfriending' and ignoring PC will not go unnoticed. I also feel disturbed, grossed out and disrespected and it upsets me every time I see him. Part of me wants this to go away and part of me needs closure.

237,"I work at a university and can walk from my office to the student centre.  There's a pizza place I sometimes go to for lunch, and an unpleasant man works the till there.  He seems to be in a bad mood at all times, as if he wishes to impart to all present that he doesn't want to be there.

Anyway, my depression has really been in a valley today and so I've not been in the best mood.  I ordered pizza today and asked him, in what I thought was a polite/neutral tone, if I could have a to-go container.  He proceeded to lecture me about how I should have told him that earlier and that I needed to ""speak up.""  I pointed out that he never asked if I wanted a container, he replied about how he has a lot of customers to go through, blah blah blah, back and forth.  At worst I might have said ""you should have done X"" but didn't raise my voice, or use profanity or personal attacks.

Until finally he said:

*Look, if you're in a bad mood today that's* **your** *problem*.

Oh, no he didn't.  Not today.  Not having it.  So I shot back --
 
""Okay, you don't have to be an **asshole** about it.""

He asked me to confirm (with a menacing, wanna-fight-me face) and I looked him in the eye and repeated verbatim: ""I said ...""

Then he went on and on about how there were cameras everywhere and that all he had said was ""have a nice day"" and this is how I repay him?!  Whatever.  So I take my food (to-go container and all) and walk away.

To tell the truth, I'm not sorry that I called that *asshole* an *asshole*.  I'm under no obligation to tolerate that kind of disrespect -- *especially* not the ""bad day"" remark -- and someone needs to stand up to jerks like that once in a while so they don't get too comfortable.  

My only concern is for my safety because I work on the campus and because I had a conversation with a male from that pizzeria in the past (I think it was him but not 100% sure) in which it came up that the person was a convicted felon.

238,"The title may seem a little confusing, but let me further elaborate. So there is this girl I've known for 3 years, let's call her Anne, and over the years we've bonded really closely. Last summer we tried to get into a romantical relationship, but it didn't really spark for me, so we broke up. Unfortunately, she still likes me in ''that'' way. I've tried to be as nice and clear as possible to express my true feelings and tell her I'm not into her like that. The reason I've come for advice is because I genuinely care about her and her feelings, so what I'm about to say is a bit difficult. Bear in mind, ALL of this happened AFTER our respectful break-up. A few weeks after our break-up, she introduced me to one of her close friends. I immediately found interest in her and I truly would like to get to know her better. The problem is that Anne still likes me and will probably never let me talk to her friend (Anne is the only way through which I can contact, let's call her Beth). Not only will she prevent this from happening but most likely never talk to me again which makes me lose both Anne and Beth at once. I don't know how to tell Anne I like Beth. I'm afraid of her response and the consequences. This is just a really unfortunate situation because I really, REALLY like Beth. I'm never really interested (maybe even ''in love''?) in girls, but this time it's truly different. So what should I do? Be honest or keep this to myself and never try to work things out with Beth?

240,"Hi All,

Little backstory. I have an 11 year old beagle, who is a 2 x cancer survivor.

After his last battle with cancer, the gf and I decided that we wanted to move him to a nicer place. A place with a backyard, and near the water as he loves swimming.

After a long search we finally found the perfect place, it was spaciois, had a backyard and the water was 1min walk from our front door.

When we applied we sent in references for our dog, from our previous neighbours on how good he is, and that he hasn't caused any issues whatsoever in the 4 years we were at our last place.

The owners and the strata commission approve our application for a dog, and the moving in commences.

First thing we do is introduce ourselves to the neighbours and introduce our dog to them.

My gf and I both work, so the little guy will have access to the backyard and an undercover area.
The only issue we can see is there's a fire hybdrant the encroaches into our backyard and if someone were to use it, our dog would have a clear line of site to that person.

Over the next week, there has been a little barking from our dog, but with a little detective work, we realise it's always in response to someone either standing outside our backyard fence line talking, or looking over their balcony from above us and enganging the dog.

Fast forward to yesterday...
As I'm arriving home and parking the car, I notice two old ladies who have connected a hose to the fire hydrant bordering our backyard, and are outfront chatting away and watering the plants on the street.

Naturally my dog is barking up a storm.

As I get closer, this is the exchange that happens:

Lady 1 - are you the owner of that dog that's just moved in?

Me - yes I am

Lady 1 - he's been barking

Me - for how long?

Lady 1 - for about 20min

Me- and how long have you ladies been out here?

Lady 1 - can't you just do something about it?

Me - he's only barking because he can hear you two and he's not sure who you are

Lady 1 - well we should be able to walk and talk wherever we want

Me -  of course.... but if you reach into our yard to connect your hose and then just stand here chatting loudly... the little guy is going to bark...

I go inside, and make my way to the apartment and sure enough he's out there barking.

I make my way to the backyard and can clearly hear the ladies talking, and notice they've even sprayed water into my backyard.

I calm myself down a little, hook up the dog to a lead and take him outside to meet these ladies.

As we get to where they are, he gets excited, wagging his tale, lots of happy sniffs.

Me - this is my dog

Lady 2 - awwwww is he lovely

Lady 1 - can you just get him away from the plants?

Me - I wanted you to meet hi--

Lady 1 - we are trying to water the plants

I took my dog and we walked away.

Now I have this feeling that this lady is going to go out of here way to cause problems for us, as she doesn't seem to have anything better to do.

My question is... what should I do?
I've figured I'll collect evidence / 0 photos of when she's near our backyard, and maybe record their chatting and noise that filters into our backyard... but any suggestions would be welcome

Thankyou :)",26Sep2017,1
241,"I've been with this company a little less than a year. I strive to do my best and get my job done right. I put in extra hours when needed. I've taken time to actually learn the equipment and how to trouble shoot and fix any issues instead of just blindly changing parts. My coworkers do the bare minimum hours and sign off maintenance not completed and just do half assed work in general. 

But it goes unappreciated/unnoticed by the higher ups. And when the others do an extra hour or 2 they get praised but I do it on a regular basis and it's nothing. I don't do it for the praise or anything like that but it's frustrating as hell. 

My work was called into question today by a coworker in a not so subtle way that was completely unprofessional on his part. Very uncalled for in my opinion.

so i have had a set of interests from when i was a child and grew all the way with them until 2 years ago when i decided to actually go after those interests and hopefully do something with them,i started working and learning pursuing an almost impossible goal which was that i work with those interests in the future

it's not entirely impossible but that's not the point

at some point down the line i just started getting anxious whenever i decided to enjoy them(my interests),i tried working out solutions and the problem is related to my confidence as an artist,i feel like crap each time i view my own interests possibly because i compare myself with those people who make them,or just because i see those people who have ""Better"" lives than me because they have gotten to where i want to get

i eventually realised this and many other things about myself but the anxiousness never seems to disappear
although i can probably work this out alone i feel like there's so much pressure from my life and my brain thinks this dream is too impossible so it (naturally) makes me feel like shit every time i think about it,to the point that i started giving up too much to escapism just to not have to think about it and it's not working,maybe i`m just writing this to get it all out and halfway thru this sentence i realised that i should ask for advice so...

what's the best way to stop doing escapism?
and extra question,do you think dreams are possible?should i pursue my dream?(which i don't know if it's possible or not,or if i even want to pursue it)
and also if anyone knows what to do about me comparing myself to others and whatnot,any advice is welcome on that front

248,"Hey reddit, I'm a 22 year old guy living in southern NM desperately trying to find something to do with my life. I've struggled with depression my whole life and I feel like the longer I'm here, the worse it gets. I've never been very open about this. A couple months ago when I hit rock bottom, I finally opened up about it to my brother. We're not super close anymore, but hearing him actually sound like he cared kinda woke me up a bit. I still feel stuck and I'm not sure what to do. I've been really unhappy in my current job and living situation. I left my hometown almost a year ago because my job was starting to get stressful (it was a sales job in in a small town where the economy crashed and business stopped.) I have a terrible roommate I'm stuck in a lease with (for a few more months) and plan on moving to Phoenix/Mesa AZ area once it's up to be closer to my brother. Before I moved here, I was living alone and things were good until my job was starting to fall apart

Currently I'm working for Apple tech support in a call center, which is about as fun as you'd imagine. I want to find something different but don't know where to start. I've always worked tech-related jobs. I worked at Best Buy for 3 years selling phones, Verizon for 1 year, and now Apple for 9 months.

Ultimately my goal is to live alone again in a new state, but money is of course an issue. I don't think I want to do sales again, and I definitely don't want to do another call center job. I'm still very interested in technology though. I've always been very independent and done things on my own, but now I feel like I don't have have a lot of options. This job isn't letting me save a whole lot of money either and I want to be out of this city ASAP because it's really affecting my happiness.

Over the 9 months I've lived here, I've put what little money I've been able to save from paychecks into fixing my car. Well, after putting over $1,500 collectively into a $2,000 car, it still doesn't run and I'm stuck walking to and from work every day. If you've ever walked and hour in the sun in southern NM, you know it's not fun.

My lease ends on Christmas. How do I save enough to move out after that if my job doesn't allow it? And if I can't save enough money to leave, am I just stuck in this damn city with this roommate? Do I have to find a job that will let me save enough to move out, just so I can quit that job and leave in a few months? And even if I do manage to get to AZ, then what? I'll still have to find another job, and I'll have a very limited time to do so before bills start racking up.

Even if I somehow had a couple grand saved up, that would let me get a uhaul to bring me and my stuff to AZ and pay for for an apartment deposit as well as first months rent. Then I'd still have to find a job quick. But I don't even have that. It all just seems like a really hopeless situation.

We've lived together for a few years, we've become well established in our careers and have a very bright future ahead of us.  He is the most intelligent and mature person I have ever been with. 

But over the past year, he seems to have grown more and more immature and seems persistent in winding me up and has become incredibly demanding to the point I feel like a parent more than a partner.  I feel like I'm looking after a child.

He is constantly trying to wind me up, when he does something and I politely ask him to stop, he continues doing it until I reach breaking point and yell at him.  He is constantly demanding food and other things even though he is more than capable of getting it himself.  He moans about my lack of energy but knows my job is incredibly demanding and during the week I come home exhausted.  He never suggests going out or doing an activity - I am always the one to do it and then he complains about it.   He makes the most immature and crude jokes and comments constantly.  I feel like my maturity levels have surpassed him and I am sick to death of having to deal with someone I deem so immature. 

His behaviour is making me want to spend less time and effort with him and he complains I lack interest in him and don't pay him enough attention.

When I try to resolve things and talk to him properly, he gets frustrated and adds nothing to the conversation.  When I then decide to end the conversation due to lack of effort on his part, he moans at me further.  Often his response is 'whatever, it doesn't matter how I feel because you're right and I'm wrong' when I'm trying to encourage him to explain his feelings and communicate with me so we can fix it.

I'm never nasty nor do I knock his confidence, I always compliment him and attempt to make him feel good about himself.  I don't just sit here yelling at him for no reason and I don't constantly belittle him or patronise him.

I'm at an absolute loss trying to get through to him.

I did not tell anyone, he stands there plain as day blabbing in front of everyone. but this guy like i said is a master manipulator and i can tell that he has people that i used to get along with believing his lies.

267,"     I work in a very small and close-knit office. There's about 12 of us and we're all in the same room all day, no cubicles or any dividers of any sort. I truly like the people I work with and get along great with them (okay, 90% of them) but we do not share similar backgrounds and don't have all that much in common. Most of the people there have worked together for 10+ years while I am fairly new and people there spend a lot of time talking about very emotionally charged political issues (abortion, race, police brutality, etc). About 3/4 of the office have opinions that I strongly disagree with and while I desperately want to keep my mouth shut it's REALLY hard to listen to hours of discourse (much of which is factually incorrect) without throwing my hat into the ring. 
     Today I opened my mouth and regretted it because I don't want people to dislike me for my political opinion and I also simply don't feel that the office is a place for these conversations. But here we are, they're happening, what can I do? Do I just vow to never speak about anything more offensive than what I'm having for dinner? Do I come prepared to every work day as if it's a televised debate? I have strong opinions and it feels like I'm being dishonest with myself to just stay totally quiet when these topics come up but at the same time I need (and want!) to keep the peace. I can't imagine with the most recent election here in the US that I'm the only one going experiencing something like this. Any suggestions?",26Sep2017,1

272,"Hi guys, this is probably a better question for a shrink but I'd still love to hear what Reddit has to say. This is probably gonna sound ridiculous but it's definitely become semi-debilitating recently. Anyway most people try to be nice to others, be calm, not raise their voices, etc. I'm not quite sure where I messed up down the line but I take it a little too seriously. I'm constantly worried that something I said or done might've come across as snappish or apathetic, or any form of mean or frustrated. I'm definitely not a superior person to anyone else and don't hope to be. I just want to become the best person I can, to be calm and collected and treat people with the niceness they deserve. Recently it's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to interact with people for fear of being a dick, and I'm just starting my first year of college so interacting with people is kinda a necessity. 
Now to the fun part.
I've been a little obsessive over the conversations I have on a daily basis, and tend to replay them in my head to make sure I didn't say or do anything mean. Recently I've caught myself unknowingly actually saying the words out loud, while walking across campus, sitting in class, stuff like that. A little worrisome.
Anyway I gotta take care of this somehow. Because of this constant worrying about other people's perception of me I've been pretty self-absorbed and haven't been there for my friends. Also I'm hoping to enlist as a medic in the US Army National Guard next summer and I definitely need to man up and squash this problem before I get to the military.

273,"I was talking to a guy for a while but he was extremely flaky, it took months to hang out and we live in the same city, he couldn't keep up communication either but he was only the second guy I slept with so I kept up with the games until he stood me up once again, only to tell me that I assumed the worst in him and he got arrested that day.

For the last week it's been a texting fight, he can't open up, he was flaky but his way of trying to get rid of me was by calling me a devil. I refused to accept that.

The guy before him was just as bad standing me up and blaming me for stuff, this time around I demanded he say that I leave him alone, that I wouldn't stop texting him until he did.

For the past week he's been saying everything else under the sun but those words. He refuses to take responsibility for ending it and wants to be like all other guys; act like an asshole and let them leave mad so he can laugh at how he got to me.

I'm pissed off as hell and only keep bothering him until he tells me. I've been spamming his phone and he doesn't ghost, just keeps responding calling me the devil, insulting me and saying nobody wants me, copying my words and retexting them to me (oddly enough he won't copy the leave me alone part) and claims I'm a child who has to be told what to do.

I don't understand why he can't just say it. He obviously wasn't interested otherwise he wouldn't have stood me up, or kept me waiting for months in the first place. Why can't he do it? What's his problem

275,"I guess this post is related to both work and school. I can sum up the question in the last 3 paragraphs if you don't feel like reading.

I'm 20 years working 30 so hours a week in a plant for a home builder. I'm also attending a two year school taking a evening class and a couple online classes. I went to a 4 year university right out of high school but left after a terrible first semester (my mental health started getting really bad). But now I'm back in school and am playing on transferring to a 4 year school possibly out of state. I plan on obtaining a bachelors degree and am considering going to Law School.

The problem is my job. I started working here last year (spring 2016) getting the job was easy because of a family connection. I had nothing else going for me in life at the time as I had just dropped out of college. I hate this job. But the pay is good and there's benefits and bonuses. I also get along with coworkers and the environment is ok. 

I'm starting to feel stuck here. And I really want to put my focus on school. I want to be going to school full time taking at least 4 classes a semester that are not online or late. In a sense I am looking to feel like a ""normal"" college student. I will be working part time at a different place. And I would hope to have a second source of income by starting my own online business.

I'm noticing that this full time job is leaving me drained physically and mentally. I feel like I've been dumbed down almost. I have a very simple routine that feels like a hamster wheel. I get in my car everyday after and drive home like a robot. I'm too tired to do important things. I'm slacking on school. I can't find a consistent workout schedule because I'm so tired after work. I would rafter workout in the mornings but that's hard with work starting early. I want to take morning/noon/after noon classes and not night classes and online. I want to have a normal schedule like my friends. A more open schedule.

I plan on finishing out the year at my current job. I'm looking forward to a Christmas bonus and other bonuses. I could really use this money. Quitting before I have the new job would really hurt my finances. I'm living at home right now but still have bills and I'm susposed to be saving up to move out.

Should I consider quitting sooner and trying to find a new part time job? Or just hold off to the end of the year?

278,"Hey everyone, this is my first post in this subreddit. But I'm stuck in a strange situation and have absolutely no clue what I'm supposed to do or how to act here.  

So I'm a second year uni student, and I do student theatre, which is a really big society at my school. Every year, to get new students involved, we have Freshers Plays, which is where the upper years, as ""Freshers Mums"" get a group of the yungins and creates a short play to be performed all week, its a ton of fun. This year I decided to be a freshers mum, and so me and two others lead a group of ten-ish freshers. Most people in the society are between 17-26, I'd say, but one of our freshers is a guy in his late 40s or 50s who's decided to go back to school to do another degree.  
Now I reallllly don't want to seem judgmental or anything. Because I mean, good on him for getting involved and going into this experience full on. But he's kind of a creepy dude. And I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to be treating him? I mean I'm being really nice of course, but I'd be lying if I said he didn't make me super uncomfortable. Whenever he's around (which I mean, he's only bothered shown up at a couple things so far) he just tries to treat us like his peers, without acknowledging his age whatsoever, or the fact that he's a balding older man and the rest of us are like 18-19 year old girls.  
And being one of the 3 leaders in the group, it puts me in a super weird position and I'm just not sure how I'm supposed to act towards him vs. the other freshers. Today at the dress rehearsal our group was sitting in the audience, and when the actors went up on stage, me and him ended up sitting a few seats apart and I pretended I didn't see him and jumped down a row to sit with my other freshers mums. Which is so rude, I know, and I completely regret it, but I didn't know what else to do. And its tougher still when we're planning other things. We were going to get drinks after dress rehearsal today and he was totally game to come along, but luckily plans fell through. Why do I say luckily? Because he's not exactly the kind of person I feel comfortable getting drunk and vulnerable around. He didn't come to the earlier rehearsal today either, which I also think was good because it was in the common area in one of the member's dorms and I don't think the non-theatre students would have appreciated him being there while they're all in their PJs cooking dinner.  

I don't know. It's a weird situation. Am I being a total asshole here for even thinking this is weird? I could just really use some advice on what to do here, from all fronts.  Edit: sp",26Sep2017,5
279,"So I work at a non-profit. The hallway I sit in is primarily the finance department/data entry, it's almost entirely silent during work hour. The IT area is at the end of the hall. There are two IT guys who normally rotate every day, but once or twice a week they're both there. And man...they don't shut the fuck up. I'd understand if they were spending all of that time discussing the servers at the office or whatever else, but they just chit chat about fucking current events and tell awful jokes/stories all day. They don't say anything offensive (or fucking interesting lol it feels like being trapped listening to an awful podcast), but they're loud and it's all day. I get that our hallway is quiet and stuffy, and yeah if they talked like that for maybe an hour out of the day it wouldn't be a big deal, but it's incredibly distracting for the 5 or 6 of us who sit by them.

281,"So today I was fired from an internship with a small startup company that I was and still am very passionate about. To give some background, I was hired at the end of July, so that's two months with the company. 

Within those two months, things, including hurricane Irma and a family reunion planned well in the past, hindered me from going to work for a total of five days. I completely understand that I should not be missing work, especially so soon, even with permission given. I do feel that it is my fault that I got fired. That's not why I'm posting here. 

(To clarify, my absences are the reason they cited for me getting fired. To quote them, they said, ""we need someone dependable who is here every day"".) 

I was fired via email without a notice and was completely shocked, and that is what I take issue you with. Also, I was told plenty of times by my bosses that I could make my schedule as I liked, and if I had to work out of the office one day out of the week it was fine. It was an unpaid internship, which is why they allowed me to do this. However, today that all changed without any notice. 

I'm asking everyone what they think if I am totally in the wrong and how to not do this in the future. This is new territory for me and I have no idea if an employer has an obligation to give me notice of my firing through an actual in-person conversation. I just feel like I was cheated out of an opportunity by my own actions but maybe I could have gotten some notice?

286,"Hi there! 
&lt;br&gt;

If there is a better place for me to post this, please let me know.



As the title says, I'm 28 and I don't really know what to do with my life. 



I finished high school with decent grades and chose not to pursue college partially because the thought of sitting in a room for another 4 years was wholly unappealing, and partially because I had no idea what kind of degree to even work towards. I figured that full-blown college was an unwise move for someone without much money or direction so I opted for some time off to save up and figure something out. 



And I did. I attended a trade school and obtained a license in Massage Therapy in 2009. Since then I've dabbled with doing massage (worked in a spa, worked part-time from home, even opened my own office with an acupuncturist friend) and working in restaurants serving and bartending. 



I recently came to terms with the fact that, while I love the idea and science behind massage therapy, I don't enjoy actually giving massage anymore. I currently work in an upscale restaurant and do pretty okay for myself considering I typically work less than 30hrs/week. However, I realize that this isn't exactly a dream job (even though when I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a waitress and, as I got older, a bartender), and I'm starting to become disenchanted with restaurant life.



I see my options as follows: 
-Pursue Sommelier level 1, and enhance my service industry resume (not exactly a lucrative move necessarily and certainly not healthy -- I already drink too much wine).



-Attempt to get a job in sales and/or liquor distribution. Which would be ideal, but my city is on the smaller side and those jobs are sought after and it would be really competitive work. 



-Go back to school. Apply for as many grants and scholarships as I can, and then get a degree in____________. The things I love are archaeology and sciences. Also architecture, but I'm just not sure that I have the drive to immerse myself in the lifestyle that comes along with those career choices. I'm not fond of math (as I'm HORRIBLE with numbers, and the idea of math homework makes me want to cry). Unfortunately, the only real college advice I got growing up was to go to school for ""art"" as I've always been really talented with drawing. But I have little desire to perfect that skill (although I wish someone had told me how cool being a tattoo artist would be). 





-Go back to school for jewelry smithing. This might be the most affordable (assuming I could obtain some grants) and realistic option. I've made jewelry my whole life, but lack the tools and studio space necessary to do what I want. The only reason why I don't try harder to sell my stuff now is that I feel as if it's too ""cheap"" (it isn't but I can never guarantee that it won't break, and it's very time consuming with the tools and materials I do have). The biggest issue with this is that I would have to attend college to have access to those classes. And then I wonder if it's really worth 4 years of school just to learn to do something I could probably piece together on my own (but I crave that proper learning environment).





-My final idea would be just staying where I'm at, and working on saving up to buy a two unit that I can rent out for extra income. (a decent house in my area that wouldn't need a ton of work can be anywhere from ~$130-$200k. But again, I just feel like I need to *do* something with my life, and I can eventually buy a house no matter what, if I really want to. 




As far as all the other details: 
I don't have any major debt, just actively paying off some minor medical stuff/money I owe the IRS from my massage days/financing a computer. Less than $2,500 total. 
I also lease a car for $209/mo. 
My rent is $225/mo. but I live with my SO and another roommate and would like to move out.
I also have a dog, and about 100 plants (I'm passionate about animals and plants/gardening as well)




These ideas have been rolling around in my head for a few years now and I haven't acted on anything (I tried to open my own massage office instead). I'm basically open to any and all suggestions. Is there something I haven't considered? Are there careers in the sciences that I don't know about (seriously, I don't really even understand how one becomes an actual, professional ""scientist""). Is there something YOU would do if you were in a situation like mine? Should I just go to medical school? 




Anyway, if you've made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I'm really just trying not to regret not trying. ",26Sep2017,1

So, should I wait for the semester to be over to ask her out on actual dates?

292,"So I met a girl recently. We're both 21. She's the 2nd person I've had sex with. I know late bloomer. I was always to busy with school and hobbies. 
I'm her 10th. The twist is I know 4 of the guys that she has had sex with. Casually. Not in a relationship. They're all my brothers best friends. And one of them I work with and is my brothers business partner. 

At first all i wanted to do was to hang out and have sex. But we got to talking And we really hit it off. My expectations were that she was a bimbo. I was wrong. Her past is completely different from mine. She drank, partied, drugs, very casual sex (with guys that are in my view scumbags) etc. At the beginning this was very tough to deal with. Not the drugs or alcohol and such. The sexual past. It was very tough for me but I ended up getting over it. It's her past. None of my business. Or so I think. 

My problem is everyone is telling me to fuck other pussy, don't get attached, get out, you can't make this girl into your girlfriend, she's a whore, etc. Shit bothers me to no end. I'm over it so why can't everyone else get over it. I know I met this girl recently but I really fucking like her. Like a lot. I already met all of her family and we spend a lot time together. 

My friends have stopped talking to me. I've caught texts between 2 of my friends calling her a whore and going off on her and telling me I have low standards etc. They keep saying since it's my first real relationship and I'm whipped for the pussy and I'm not seeing what kind of girl she really is and that's she's s whore.  She said that it's her past and she realized that she was young and dumb and all she wanted was a relationship but this what she did was more fun at the time. I get it. I guarantee I wouldn't have liked her if I knew her a year ago. But the girl I like today is because of her past. Her past has made her who she Is today. 

She has been very open about her past and told me that if it bothers me this much, to tell her because she doesn't want feelings to grow even stronger. She has been nothing but great and we get along very well. I try to tell these guys and my brother that everyone has a past but they're all misogynistic assholes that cheat on their girls. 

Frankly, typing this out shows me that I'm the problem. For being friends with these types of guys whose beliefs of women don't align with mine. 

I'm just conflicted and stressed about the whole situation and double standards. It's ok for a guy to fuck a bunch of girls but if a girl has sex with a lot of guys she's a whore.

294,"So this might be more venting than anything but I'm just at the end of my rope. Any and all advice for any content is extremely appreciated.

I grew up shy and awkward. My family didn't do much to help me become socialized normally, I grew up with no friends and I was far from a loving and supporting household. My father abused prescription drugs in my middle school and high school years, he was emotionally abusive to me and scarcely physically abusive to my mother. During this period I shut myself away from the world and battled with intense stress, depression, and anxiety. At that time I was more worried about surviving day to day than getting to know other people and getting good grades. It took me 8 years to get out of that environment.

I came out broken, emotionally pent up, anxious, and incredibly afraid. Being out in public was the most horrible thing I could do. I would sweat and shake and just feel a wretched pain throughout my body. I was an absolute stiff shell of a person. I got a job and started college and forced myself to be around people in an attempt to get more comfortable, and for the most part it worked. I still feel horrible in public, like I'm some kind of circus freak, but that's about the extent of it.

During all this time, however, I've only been able to make online friends. They've been with me for a decade at this point, they've been the only ones I've ever had to talk to or confide in at the end of a day. I've always appreciated them as if they were real friends and I've supported them as best as I've been able to, as they've supported me.

But recently my perspective has been changing. At the start of the year, I met a woman online through social media and we hit it off pretty well. We started talking and we had so much in common and talking to her was just so natural. I quickly developed a crush on her the more we hung out online, which I admitted to her (first time I've ever done so to anyone,) and she told me the feeling was mutual.

I was elated, this was the first time anyone has ever had any real interest in me. Like ever. I've always been shut inside and I've always been the one to make a real effort to get to know people, which is always more fruitless than not. The fact that she knew what I physically looked like and she actually enjoyed talking to me and everything? That was incredible to me. It's never happened before. None of my online friends have shown that kind of interest in me before, let alone anyone in real life.

Around February we made plans to meet one another in October. She lives a country apart from me but we're on the same continent. I don't have my passport but I was willing to get one for awhile just so we could meet. I realized, however, the situation as it was. I knew it was unrealistic to get my hopes up about her (in the end I got them up anyways,) so I made sure she knew I would understand if she changed her mind and/or found someone else in the meantime. There was a lot of time between February and October so there's no doubt something could happen and change everything. Annnnd it did.

We hung out more and more. We'd constantly be talking to one another and we were just extremely similar people. We had similar anxiety issues and were raised similarly, but it was easy to get comfortable with her. Eventually I fell in love with her. And it felt real. For the first time I wasn't just looking through rose colored glass, it was absolutely genuine.

As we were open with one another completely, she told me all about her ideal guy and it made me insecure. Her ideal was older than her, experienced, tall, scruffy, and fairly dominant. I'm a little younger than her, inexperienced, about the same height as her, not really scruffy, and I'm not really dominant. I'm passive, boring, ugly, and not as smart as I look. And I have zero confidence, if that wasn't apparently already. I have a huge inferiority complex and I can't get over it. No matter how I look at myself I can't find anything worth being kind to myself for. I've always felt this way about myself and I've only ever found ways to reinforce it over the years of nothing but social failures while fumbling through life. I can't find a way to stop feeling sorry for myself and my inability to do so even makes me feel like a failure.

We had our differences which made me insecure as well. While we were incredibly similar personalities, she was much more socialized than I was. She's had physical friends, not that many but she's actually had them. Plus despite her social anxiety and loneliness, she's had several boyfriends. She lost her virginity early on and she would occasionally talk about having sex with her exes in various places and that definitely made me feel inferior. She drinks, smokes, and has done various psychedelics, all of which enhanced her social experiences. I can't do any of those things, I physically can't even consider it due to how I was raised. I don't care if people do those things, but I have an aversion to drink or use drugs because of my father. I have an extremely hard time taking aspirin even. I've always felt like I have a hard time fitting in and relating to people my age because doing those kinds of things is something adults are supposed to do, and I don't want to do any of those sorts of things and they make me uncomfortable. 

And the whole sex aspect of life makes me feel even more uncomfortable and inferior, especially now. Sex isn't just about pleasure, it's intimate, it's proof of love, it's trust, it's a lot of things. Obviously, I've never been able to experience it so my perspective is biased. I've never been romantically involved with anyone. I've never held hands, hugged, kissed, anything like that. I've never even been on a date. The fact that the closest I've ever been to someone was through a screen makes me feel alone anymore. The furthest I've ever physically been with anyone is small talk and meaningless conversation. I've never even been on an actual date.

She quickly found someone who was much, much closer to her ideal guy. Pretty much the spitting image. I didn't find out until she just stopped talking to me and I had to go searching for answers. When she told me she was dating someone, I was crushed. I made the mistake of running through all my inferiorities and justifying them. I wasn't enough for her, I wasn't worth waiting for, I wasn't worth the effort. She was so worth the effort to me, she meant the absolute world to me. But I felt too much. I felt too much and because of that we can't even be friends anymore because she can't deal with people who have feelings for her. I can't get over that. The one person I've ever gotten incredibly close and intimate to and apparently there wasn't a connection there. It's been half a year since this and I still think about it constantly.

The fact that it was solely online makes me feel like a creep. I ruined a perfectly good friendship with the person I was closest to because I felt more than I was supposed to. Finding people like that is so rare, I can't get over the fact that I ruined it. And the fact that I still feel so much for her and I know she doesn't think about me whatsoever makes me feel horrible. I'm just another internet creep who felt too much for her. She couldn't even tell me off in the end, she just ghosted me away. I was just a distraction from a real man.

I've tried so hard to get over her. I used to be fine with the knowledge that I'll be alone for the rest of my life, but now all the sudden I'm just not. I know for a fact that I'll never meet anyone like her ever again. She was so patient, sweet, and intimate with me. She was fun and comfortable to be around. I miss her ridiculously but I know there's nothing I can do to redeem myself for falling for her and feeling too much. If I tried to say anything to her, I know I would just come off as a creep, as just another guy overstepping. It just hurts so much knowing how quickly I went from something to nothing with her. I don't want to do that ever again.

I'm just fucked. I've gone months suffering through this and I don't know what to do anymore. I can't just stop caring or erase her  from my mind. She was the best friend I ever had. No one has ever been so affectionate with me, so understanding. I don't want to try and replace her, I know that even if I did find someone who remotely liked me romantically, I wouldn't be able to give them my all until I could fully put these feelings down. I don't want to hurt someone by not being able to give them my all. But even so I think it's clear that I'm not worth the effort anyways. I can't love myself, how can I expect someone to love me then? I'm so trapped in my own bullshit, it's probably overwhelming. I can't just suck it up and change like I've been told to do. I've tried it for years, it just doesn't work. I always manage to dig my hole deeper and deeper. I don't want to be alone anymore but I know I can't be around other people. It hurts to be alone and it hurts to be out in public, it hurts trying to get to know people. It feels so artificial and awkward and painful. The idea of dating just seems horribly pointless and artificial.

But even then I'm getting ahead of myself. I can't make physical friendships to save my life. I've never had any physical friends. Ever. Nothing matters in life anymore other than love and friendship to me, and I don't have either. I never have. Careers and hobbies and interests and passions are immaterial to me now; they're meaningless and easily replaceable. I'm so tired of living day to day working my ass off and having no one to support me. I've become dependent and I have no one to depend on.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel too much if these paragraphs weren't proof enough of that. All of it's so overwhelming I just don't want to go on anymore. Life is just painful and I don't deserve anything I have. I could disappear so easily, then someone else with integrity and confidence could take my job and opportunities and make good use of them. I've tried so hard to change into something better for so long and it's never worked out. I'm so tired of trying.",26Sep2017,1

I have a few jobs in mind that pay amazingly and could support the lifestyle I want, but they are not my dream jobs. Also, I have a few jobs in mind that are my dream jobs, but don't pay very well.

298,"I was popular in school, loads of friends and burst out laughing at least 10 times a day. I had friends after school too.

I got into drug issues, homelessness, falling out with everyone, hostels, being let home to an abusive dad and moving to the other end of the country with my mum. 

Things are more normal now, me and my mum share a small flat and we get on. I'm 21 now and I missed a fundamental part of my post school period of learning the drive, consistently working, building new relationships/friendships precisely for the reasons I listed last paragraph.

I actually started dating someone 6 months ago but we always argue because she's critical of my personality and the way I'm not romantic, funny or whatever. I mean, I'm not even hot so idk what she's doing with me. 

I haven't met any friends while up here but I did have a temporary job which just finished and I'm looking for a new one, primarily to make money but also to make friends.

I miss that years ago, I approached everything in a different way, I was more spontaneous, funny, I was self admittedly the funniest person in my friend group and also romantic.

I don't laugh anymore really, I'm cynical as anything. I don't really make other people laugh but I don't understand what I've changed. Granted that people grow and I'm not making the same jokes that a 14 year old would make. I understand subject matter and topics that adults would discuss, I'm deeply interested in politics and world events so I'm definitely educated or up to date enough to discuss a broad amount of things with people from all aspects of life. So I just don't see what I'm doing wrong, that I was doing so right many years ago.

Am I not picking up on people trying to spend time with me outside of work or anything else formal? 
Is how cynical I can be after years of hardship and depression just making me a bore and downer to be around? 

I just don't know, I over think it a lot, I have for a long time and I just don't know why or how I've changed so much, for the worse",26Sep2017,3
299,"I’m a miserable driver. I hate it. I’m always angry in the car. When I’m driving I hate other people. When people do something stupid (like text and drive, almost hit me, cut me off, etc) I won’t just get mildly angry...I kind of fly off the handle and rage. I make it a bigger deal than it is and then I’ll stew on it for hours, which I’m currently doing right now. 


My dad has always been the same way, so maybe it’s just a learned habit, but I’m sick of being miserable every day.

302,"Kind of a long story so I'll try my best to sum it up... some back story me and 2 other people (ill call them A and B) are very good friends, I've been close with A for 6 years and have known B for 4 but only really got close in the last year or two. A and B went to a party over the weekend where A got very drunk and hooked up with his friend (C), who was also very drunk and is also good friends with B. 

B told me that C said he remembers A fully undressing and getting on top of C even though he said no, and then C doesn't remember what happened after that. B also told me that A claims they had consented to foreplay and was very vague and sounded like he was hiding something.B believes C and doesn't want to be friends with A anymore. A also doesn't know that C told this to B.

B told me not to tell anyone out of respect to C's privacy but this is fucking me up. I don't know the truth. I don't want to believe my friend is a rapist. Even if he is, as fucked up as this sounds, he's been a good friend to me for so long I don't want to just ditch him completely. He's never seemed like a bad person outside of this and he was really drunk too i don't believe he would ever intentionally do something like that. I don't know what to do ive never faced something like this before.

303,"Hello :) I am a 21 years old Spanish student and today I had a situation that has been hard.

A few days ago I met an american girl who is 20 years old who is studying here on Spain for a year. I truly liked her and we started talking each other on whatsapp. We decided to meet on Madrid and I was so happy because as more as I knew her the more she liked to me.

We met today and everything was so good. We were laughing and I truly felt a conection with her, but she told me suddenly that she wanted to be honest and that she had already a boyfriend. I tried to hide my feelings and we continue our meeting until the time she had to go. She said that I was nice and that we could be friends. I was nice to her the rest of the meeting as if everything was ok and she said that she would like meet more times with me. But I feel sad right now.

308,"I've got a couple of weeks before early admission opens, but i'm lost on what I should pursue, and i'm really all over the place.
 For some context here are the fields i've considered so far and pros and cons to each:
                  

Lawyer   
Pros: It's a career i've always found interesting, I took a legal studies class in highschool and really enjoyed it. I like the idea of helping people resolve issues logically and in a tight format. It also pays well, which is very important to me.

Cons: It's expensive, and not within my available funds which would mean i'd have to take out a student loan. It takes a long time, and I absolutely hate school. I'm just under the recommended GPA of 3.5, I have a GPA of 3.36. I'd love a reply from an attorney on what they think. My writing isn't great, and I know that thats a huge part of the job.  

Botanist
Pros: It's only four years. It was my original choice for a career. I have a major passion for it. 

Cons: from what i've found online it pays terribly, at a starting salary of $30,000, and i'd need to get my masters to make any actual money. I don't really know how to go about getting a degree in it.

Dental Hygenist
Pros: It's only four years. It pays really well from what i've seen online. I could own my own business. Normal 9-5 working hours. Low stress. 

Cons: I have literally no passion for it, my Chiropractor told me that it would be a good field to go into for the reasons mentioned above.   

Psychologist
Pros: I'm fairly good at reading people based on facts, as i have a very analytical brain. I believe I would enjoy learning about the human Mind and how it operates. It pays well.

Cons: Likely stressful, depending on the patient.  Six years of school is quite long. I have a feeling that I would hate some of the things I learnt. I am not empathetic at all.

I think that's my list of options so far, but I'm open to suggestions.
I would appreciate some replies from people within these professions, as you would know best the pros and cons and whether or not a specific profession would be a good choice.
Given all this, my absolute goal in life is to own my own business, as I don't want to work for anyone, which is why I want a high paying job, so that someday I can start my own business.
Any suggestions would be great because I'm as indecisive as ever and running out of time to decide.
Thanks",26Sep2017,1
