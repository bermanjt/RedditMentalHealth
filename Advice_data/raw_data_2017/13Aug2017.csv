2,"Hey guys. Throwaway because GF is a redditor and also can't post on r/relationships because she reads it.

I feel trapped in my relationship.

We met about two years ago and everything seemed to be going good. I thought she was perfect. Slowly, red flags started popping up. She would be upset if I wanted alone time. She would be upset over the fact that I dated other girls before her. She didn't like my friends. Not being the type to want to give up on a relationship, I thought I'd stick around and try to work on it. That was a little over a year ago.

Since then, we've had decent days sometimes. Other days, she hates my guts and I hate hers. She's constantly picking apart everything I say to find some insult directed at her. We fight constantly over such small, stupid things. She's incredibly lazy and doesn't help out around the apartment at all. She isn't very nice to me and makes me feel like shit. I've become completely isolated because I stopped talking to my friends so this is the only place I can get advice from.

Here's the issue. I know my relationship is shitty. I want out of it. I've wanted out for a while but haven't ever broken up with somebody before. To complicate matters, she's very depressed and brings it up constantly. On top of that, I stupidly moved away from my family and signed a lease with her that lasts until May. I can't afford to move out on my own either. I hate that it took me this long to realize that she is absolutely not what I want in a relationship. I've taken to drinking heavily in the mornings since I'm a morning person and she wakes up later in the day just to cope with it.

To add to the drinking, about two months ago I had to get on antidepressants and anxiety medication just to even get through the day. It's helped a lot. Maybe that's why I'm finally working up the courage to maybe do something about it. But I'm scared of the logistics of it. Where would I live? How would I breakup with her? What of our two dogs? I've never done this before and it scares me. 

At work, I quickly became friends with one of my coworkers about a month ago. We get along super well and she's incredible. Spending time with her at work is the only time I feel remotely happy and it's reminded me that a relationship shouldn't be like mine. I feel like I'm wasting my time because I want to pursue my coworker.

Sorry for the long rant. My thoughts are everywhere because I don't know how to even go about explaining the past two years of emotional abuse and social isolation to someone since I haven't reached out to anyone. Am I a shitty person for wanting out and wanting to go pursue my coworker? I dread the thought of spending the rest of my life with my girlfriend and become mortified anytime she mentions something about our future.

I don't know, guys. Please help me. I feel so, so lost.",13Aug2017,1
3,"I'm 19 years old, a junior in college that is pretty close to home, so I live with my parents. This recent summer I got an internship with a pretty big company so I was working 40+ hours a week. Now they offered me a part time position during the fall. So I'll probably be pretty busy during the week with school and driving an hourish to work. 

I always see my friends out doing fun things, going to parties, drinking & smoking. Looking like they're all having the time of their lives. While I'm here laying in bed reading books about fucking computers.

I've never been to a ""college party"" or anything big and fun really. Everyone says that college is the best 4 years of your life, but I feel the complete opposite. To me it's just trying to get out as fast as I can. I haven't even made any friends in college lmao. 

I'm depressed, tried to kill myself a few times so they've got me on antidepressants now. I hate it. I just want to be happy and have fun. If I feel like this now, then how am I going to feel when my life actually starts and I have real world problems? 

I want to get a tattoo, but my mother would hate me. I want to get a piercing but might affect possibility of jobs. Blah blah blah teenage shit.

I feel like I'm bitching but i don't know, I've felt like this as soon as I started school.

I have a HP pavilion touchscreen desktop PC, and it used to meet my needs, which includes running Photoshop, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion, as well as surf the web. This pretty much covers everything I need for a PC. But with age and the new windows updates, it's slowing down a bit and becoming a bit frustrating to use. 

Now the advice I'm looking for is either how to make my computer run a bit smoother, or is it worth it to sell and get a new one? I don't have the biggest budget as I am a student, but as I mentioned, my needs aren't exactly difficult to accomplish as the only game I ever play is over 10 years old. ",13Aug2017,1

12,"I've been an intern at my current company for nearly two years, and I've just completed my college degree. A few months back, my manager made me a full time offer, contingent upon my graduation, which I accepted. However, since then, I applied to another position within the company- with said manager's full knowledge and (supposed) approval. My current dilemma is choosing between the position I was offered initially, and this new position. Here's why:

Days after interviewing for this position, the true feelings of my manager were revealed to me. I was requested to meet with my management, and during this meeting I learned that my manager and others ""jumped through hoops"" to open this position for me to fill. Somewhat understandably, they were upset that I would want to leave my current position after they had done things to keep me there. 

I do not want to stay on this team because I am not interested in the work that I would assume to be doing. My manager's boss informed me during this meeting that we would be getting work in the next few months that suits my interests better, but those whom I interviewed with informed me that they would be working on the same sort of thing, if not the same project. So, one focal point of this dilemma is that I need to decide who is telling the truth (no one is necessarily lying as one may know more than the other). I was also told that I would be considered flighty for leaving the team, and that I would be looked upon unfavorably by future employers for leaving a position whenever I become unhappy. 

My management also claims that they have been ""grooming me"" for the role that I would be filling by staying within my current team, but I tend to disagree on that point. The project I'm working on largely is de-prioritized while there are multiple projects going on, which is extremely frustrating as there has been little tolerance for the competing deadlines between assignments. Nevertheless, I find myself feeling completely discouraged while working on it, because even though it is known that there will not be sufficient time to meet deadlines, resources are still allocated to other tasks. Moreover, I have not been mentored by anyone in this role. I have been teaching more senior members of my team about what we have been working on, as well as employees who join my project. This is not to their discredit, but I feel more like I am the one who is doing the ""grooming"", not ""being groomed"".

In the end, I personally believe that the new position is what I would prefer to be doing (although I can't say that with 100% confidence as my management has cast doubt on this with new information). Despite this, I don't know if it outweighs what my current management has done to help me get the new position, in addition to the fact that I would still be working with my current team (to a much lesser degree) in the new position, as we all work within 100 feet of each other. The point I'm getting at here is that damaging this relationship (in their perception at least) could hurt me professionally going forward.

I would appreciate any words of wisdom on this matter, even if it's not a declarative recommendation between the new job and my current one.",13Aug2017,1

16,"Hi guys, first of all, thanks for reading; it feels good just to be able to write this all out knowing there's at least SOME audience. For what it's worth, I'm a 20 y/o male. Anyway, here it goes:

When I was in high school, I began working as an EMT. I loved it and got a lot out of it. After high school, I enlisted in the military (Army National Guard) as a medic. After I finished my training, I enrolled as a full-time student at a university in a major city semi-nearby where I'm from. I started as a biology major on a pre-med track, but fairly quickly switched to studying Secondary Education because I've always loved teaching. For my first semester there, I was a fairly average student, had lots of friends, decent success in the dating scene, and absolutely loved my school and the city. Second semester there I met and very quickly became seriously involved with a girl. We became very close and started a relationship. While initially it was healthy, it rapidly became toxic and she became the only thing I had in my life: I lost all of my friends, my academic performance plummeted, and my reputation at the ambulance service I volunteered at back home took a hit after I shirked some responsibility at my girlfriend's request. Ending second semester, I had grades just BARELY adequate enough to stay a student at the school. Third semester, I failed all but one of my classes, didn't talk to my friends at all, and basically lost touch with who I am at my core. Toward the end of the semester, I began making arrangements for the near future, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to return to the college. I enrolled in a paramedic program at a community college near my home and began applying to jobs around that same area. The plan was to move in with my girlfriend down there and work full-time while attending paramedic school. 

About a month ago I came to my senses and realized how unhealthy the relationship was, so I called off the plan to move in together and ended the relationship. I've been working on piecing things back together, but it's a slow process. I've gained back two of my friends who happen to live near me, but I really don't think I'll be able to gain back any of my friends from school, seeing as I won't be returning there. Also, it's going to suck when my two friends here return to school at the end of the month, and I'm left, again, with no friends. 

I've been questioning whether paramedic school is the right move. I like paramedicine a lot, and I love being an EMT, but I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I also can't help but feel like a failure returning from the big city university to go to a community college. 

Basically, I'm at a huge crossroads and have nothing outside of my family. I've considered moving to a different region, switching from the National Guard to an active duty assignment, doing traveling medical missions, and pursuing surfing on a competitive level (I love surfing, but am really not that great at it lol). 

I've been trying to view my current position in life as an opportunity to rebuild rather than as being severely stuck, but it's hard sometimes to maintain a positive outlook. Any advice anyone may have would be greatly appreciated, thank you!!",13Aug2017,1
17,"Hey reddit. I need advice, I need something. I don't know what to do. 

Here is my situation:

About two months ago, I was working a shitty job. It sucked but I bared through it. I was a security guard at a department store. However, I finally got an opportunity to work security for a hospital, a much better job in pay and with benefits. I was over the moon. It was going to be the best job I've ever had. I could finally sort my life and debts out and really live comfortably enough to use my time more wisely and work towards something greater. 

Unfortunately, the job opportunity fell through due to a mistake on my behalf in the application process. A silly stupid mistake that I beat myself up over every single day. I was 3 days out from starting this new job. I had already resigned from my old job. 

Now I was left unemployed. I had no money left. It's been a struggle since. I immediately filed for unemployment. I just found out today that I was denied unemployment benefits. I owe 2 months of rent, I rent out a room in NJ and the owners want me out. I have a few days before I'm out on the street. I have no family or close friends to rely on. 

It's the worst situation I've been in. I'm lost. I have no clue what to do. Unemployment would have sorted all my matters out. It was my last option. I currently reside in NJ right in the border between NJ and NY. The only work I'm qualified for is security work which you need a license for and I have one but for the state of NY. I have no money to attend interviews. Security work is easy to obtain, but with no funds for public transportation, rent due, almost no food, I've found myself in a tight spot. 

My credit being low makes it impossible to take out a small personal loan from anywhere, and adding to the fact I'm unemployed, no one would lend money to someone unemployed. 

So I ask you reddit, what can I do in this situation? What are my options? The thought of being homeless is terrifying. To me, it's the end. Who comes back from homelessness? I don't have a car to sleep in, a hiding spot or a support system to rely in. What can I do? Please, I'm desperate. 

Maybe I'm missing something in this mountain of stress.",13Aug2017,1

 So, a little background first. I've loved IT and Networking since I was a kid. I got my A+ and N+ certifications in high school, and I wanted to pursue IT after high school but I wasn't sure if college was for me. During my summers in high school I worked for a plumbing company and it made great money for my age. I kept doing it after high school in order to get licensed in it. My thought process was that since I've invested time into it already I might as well see it through, I mean what's one more ace up my sleeve? I saw what 2008 did to my family and all the trades stayed steady. Knowing IT is competitive I thought it was a good idea. I am now 21 as of this past March and have been licensed and experienced both new construction and residential service. I want to get out. I love knowing it and I like doing what I do some days but most it's a struggle to find the motivation to keep doing it. I feel like my decision in getting licensed was the right one but now I don't know what to do. My certifications lapsed and people keep saying I need college. I don't know where to start. It makes me feel like every minute is being wasted and it kills me. I am looking for advice on what to do? I mean I could go to college with loans but is that the right move? I want to pursue Network Security or Management of sorts, but have no connections in the field and don't know where to start.

28,"Background: 21F and I live at home. I dropped out of college a year ago.

So pretty much I felt into a depressed state a year agoI don't know if I was actually depressed or if I was just upset with how my life was. Anyway, I wasn't so much suicidal as I didn't care if I died. I had a lot of social anxiety and all of this lead to me dropping out of school.

The first couple of months were really bad but then I recovered some and felt better. I've actually been feeling a little better but I still slightly depressed. I have a""depressive"" episode at least once a week where I don't want to leave the house and I don't want to talk to anyone and I hate myself. But this isn't too often and I can often times talk myself out of it. But the other big problem that really scares me is that one of the reasons my depression is lessened is because I've sort of created a fake life that I escape too probably 85% of the time. It's an absurd, impossible world that would never exist and it's just madness and bullshit. I think about it CONSTANTLY and whenever I have the spare moment of clarity and realize I've spend the past hour daydreaming about nothing, I get impossibly depressed. So I retreat back into the fantasy. (Yes, I follow Maladaptive Daydreaming).

So, I want to know how to get help and what to expect. 

1. I don't want my parents to know because they won't be supportive and the thought of them finding out will just push me to not do it. How do I go about this without them knowing?

2. I'm still on their insurance. Is there anyway I can go about this without them finding out while using their insurance?

3. How much does this cost with and without insurance?

4. What should I expect? I'm looking to get medicated at this point (I exercise frequently, I eat moderately okay, I meditate but all of these things just dull the pain instead of ""get rid of"" it.

I've been wanting to get help for two years now but the main thing is I don't want anyone to know. I realize that this seems immature and stupid but it's the one thing that always stops me from getting help. I want to do this alone and I don't want anyone to know and maybe if I get help, I can let people in, but not until then.

34,"I am 18 years old, she is 50, and dads been married to her for 4 years, divorced back in March. We have been in touch ever since mutually so it's not me initiating all the contact or anything. My issue is my anxiety disorder, and because of that I've always told her that she didn't HAVE to be in my life, and if she preferred to just move on that I understood and I admit I've asked her that A LOT ever since they divorced. Not that I would want that to happen, but I'd just rather be prepared emotionally than for it to come out of nowhere. She knows of the anxiety I have and has been very patient with me and even told me to always call her if I was having another anxiety moment. Again I admit that I've over done it, not on purpose though.


 Back on Saturday I called her while she was driving to Texas ( didn't know she was on the road on that particular day  )  and we talked and this is what I said "". Hey, I just wanted to say I know you're not my biological mom, but I love you as if you were, and I just wanted to know if that was mutual, but if not thats fine. "" I've told her that before by the way, Her response was "" Hon, I appreciate that, but you need to stop worrying about our ( me and her ) relationship, I keep telling you this remember? Remember I told you that I know how you feel about me, and if I didn't feel the same I wouldn't have interacted with you like I did when we first met. I keep telling you, you do not have to worry about our relationship. If I felt that I wanted to cut contact or walk away, I would have done that after the divorce, you need to stop worrying about this, we're better than that ok?. I treat you the same as my daughter . I'm a person of my word and I promised you that I wasn't going anywhere remember? ( Not that I asked her to promise anything ) I told you that I'm always here for you right and that youre stuck with me right? Maybe you need to talk to your dad about this. "" She wasn't mad, but sounded a little irritated understandably.






She then asked "" What are your plans for today ""? I told her I actual had an appointment with my therapist. She said "" Ok, you really need to talk to him about this, because I don't know what else to tell you. "" She couldn't talk for too long, but before she had to go she said "" Like always, just tell me how it goes, ok? "" 

So when I got back from my therapist, she texted me a picture of her and her dog ( that she always refers to as my older brother ) both lying in bed resting. I replied laughing, and said "" Both of your heads look huge, I talked to my therapist about my anxiety with you, ( I've had this with others to ) and he's given me some good insight. Me and him are going to continue  working on this during future sessions. I hope this isn't wrecking our relationship. Her response was "" I worry about you, but I'm still here to help see you through this, but as I said before, you have to want to make that change. ""  I told her that I was and thanked her for recommending me to talking with my therapist about this and that it was slowly starting to help. ( I thought so ) Her response was, good I'm glad. 

















Later, I started to have another anxiety moment because I thought I may have made a mistake, and went to far in what I said to her. In my mind I thought I harassed her which was ridiculous because she called 3 days before that saying hi, but my anxiety can convince me of anything. So I went downstairs and told my dad  "" I think I may have screwed up "" and told him everything. Now because of my anxiety, I probably unintentionally made everything seem worse than it really was, because that's what I thought. Anyway my dad said "" How many times has she invited you for lunch, over for dinner, or when you went with her and her daughter to bowling, and there cookout? You don't take her word for that? You don't think that maybe the reason why she's in touch with you is because she actually wants to? And she told me more than once that you were like a son to her, we were still together at that moment but still, and don't tell her I told you this, but she mentioned onetime that she saw a little bit of herself in you, in certain areas. "" I never knew she said that, but I do remember after the divorce, she told me that I am a great son to her, that she saw me as one of her own  and she did say "" love you "" once when saying goodnight over text, but I'm not sure if she still sees things that way or not.





 I guess with me is that, I have a hard time believing that someone besides my father could care about me, especially when they don't have to. The other part is, I've been hurt before a few times, not with a situation like this of course, but I'm used to things not being mutual, I'm use to things being one sided. So I guess in this situation where someone wants to be in my life as I do there's, I just, it's new to me. It always seemed like anytime something good happened, there was always a bad side to it that would smack me in the face, so I'm always on "" red alert "" expecting the worst. 














I got a text from her that next day saying "" I'm in the Bahamas now ( family trip ), and I replied by saying "" Good glad you guys made it safe, have fun. I just wanted you to know I'm serious about this, you have my word that I'm going to really work on my anxiety issues, I promise. She replied "" Great, I'm glad "" I said "" Take care. "" Now according to my dad, he did text her earlier that morning because he wanted to get some understanding and clarity of what happened.  She called him back before she got on the flight, I guess he told her everything I said, and from his words she said this "" No nothing he said made me uncomfortable at all! I think the world of him, but see, he keeps asking me about, if I'm going to be cutting contact with him, and I keeping telling him, I'm always going to be in his life, but he doesn't seem to get that, so it confuses me and throws me off "". He also told me that she said that she'd contact me when she returns from her trip.  My dad told me to just trust her.

Later on that day I got a text from her saying "" I just wanted to let you know, I think you need to take sometime, and focus on yourself, and when you're better, or when you're making progress, then you should touch base with me ""  I responded by saying "" yes I understand "". 

















I'm not sure if this relationship is damaged or not. I'm not sure if that's her way of cutting contact, fading out, or if she just wants to give me space to properly get better without any distractions, or maybe she's angry? I see my therapist once a week, and I definitely have work to do. I guess maybe I'll touch base during the beginning of next month maybe. Yesterday I got an accidental text from her but she apologized saying she meant to send that to a relative.

I asked my dad again "" when you guys spoke, did she say she needed space ""? He said "" not at all man, that wasn't even what the conversation was about she didn't say anything like that, she was just frustrated because you weren't seeming to understand her telling you that she's always going to be in your life "".

35,"I'm posting where I think I might find help, please excuse my spammy look. I'm just really scared. FTP here, throwaway, first language isn't English, phone format, the works.

I'm all kinds of sick right now, and I'm starting to worry. I have been diagnosed with hepatic tumours, BPD, and am too poor to buy the medication I need. That only affects my depression and anxiety tied in with BPD, but aren't all us Redditors depressed and anxious?

For the past two weeks, I've feel like I've had a dissociative flu. I'm really struggling to explain it. Everything goes numb, and I've noticed it starts with my lips. A kind of numb like you're blackout drunk, but it lasts only a split second. I feel very dizzy and sick afterwards. In the morning when this happens, I nearly get sick on myself. As the day progresses, I can make it somewhere to throw up. It feels like I'm there, but not, and then I snap back and it feels like a glitch, like in a video game. All the sudden my face is two inches from where it was, and I'm sick. I can't hold any food down but potatoes and bread. I'm worried I might be pregnant, but that's another carrot in the ear.

I don't know what's going on, and I don't know how to tell the doctor what's happening. ",13Aug2017,1
36,"Long story short I'm a 22 year old female virgin due to having grown up in a conservative household. I've don't have a boyfriend but really want to have sex. I go clubbing a lot and get a lot of attention from men so know getting a man in bed isn't an issue for me. But I'm deathly afraid of catching an STD even with protection as condoms can break. 

I don't know any way to circumvent this besides either not having sex with strange men or waiting until I get a boyfriend. But I don't know how long this wait will be.

37,"I was sexually abused by a neighbor which started when I was 6.  It went on for a long time because I wasn't really sure what was happening because he always made excuses that made sense to a 6 year old.  I finally got to an age where I knew it wasn't right and went to my father in tears to finally admit what was happening.  I live in a pretty country area and my father had a lot of 70s-80s views on things so his reaction to me telling him was to beat the shit out of me constantly and tell me never to tell anyone.  After I told him though he didn't allow me to see my neighbor anymore so I guess that was good.  Physical abuse never stopped.  Aside from that both parents were alcoholics and I constantly as a pre 10 year old found them passed out in the house and little me would call a neighbor or friend because I legit thought my parents were dead, idk if I'm being dramatic but I feel like that still effects me, I think about it a lot.  After I got to age 16 the physical abuse from my father was still going but my mother had stuck to just being a drunk, she only hit me when I was really, really young.

also side note I developed epilepsy from head trauma and had 4-5 seizures a week from ages 16-20 (now 20-23 yrs old I usually have 1-2 a month because of meds I'm on).

I stuck it out till college because I knew I could move out of state and get away from it all.  

Nope.  

My father had an affair with his first cousin when I was 18 and him and my mom had a silent battle for 2 months and they refused to tell me what was going on.  Stuff would happen like my mom would cry herself to sleep my dad wouldn't come home but when I asked they said ""don't worry about it"".  Finally they got divorced and it was really fucking messy and both sides wanted me to testify for them because in the divorce a lot of money was at stake (my mom is on the board of directors for a major bank that I won't disclose).  Finally my mom just told me I was forbidden from being involved in any part of it, even though she would get drunk and tell me all the disgusting details and stuff a son should never hear about a divorce.

So now it's been three years since I've talked or responded to my father and I feel good about that because of how bad he was for me.

Now I'm renting a house in another state and am in my senior year of college.  I moved out because my mom intercepted a letter from my father apologizing for hitting me and my mom refused to accept that any of that happened and just became really toxic.

I'm in college which is good but I take pills I'm not prescribed every day, smoke every day, drink from morning to night and don't even remember the last time I was truly sober.  I also don't sleep even when fucked up because I close my eyes and see different things that happened to me as a kid.  I know now I need help even if I've been over reacting about my past, I think.  My question is if anyone has any idea of what steps I should take; if I'm overreacting please tell me I just want advice on my situation literally no one knows about this except my parents.

41,"growing up i was the more extroverted person. i did not care about my appearance and wanted to talk to almost everyone in my class. i managed to get a few friends that i can hang around with as well as share my innermost thoughts with. eventually high school came around and all my friends went to another high school while i went to one quite the distance away from them, requiring me to start again and make new friends. at this time i became more self-conscious of my appearance and tended to not join any of the people. i was hella shy despite wanting to join all the clubs i could such as drama and such, but i became to cringe at my actions again the next day upon reflecting upon them. I joined several sports clubs as well as choir and drama, as well as ones that helped with community service. But then my introversion swells back up and forces me to leave the club despite being in each for pretty much a year. i have a lot of regrets of my high school life as it basically could have turned out better if i could have a better way to fight my introversion. now i graduated from high school, as of the year 2017 and now moving onto uni and i am betting my heart into having a second chance to be more extroverted at all cost so i won't be all depressed and alone and such. i understand it's hard to change from an introverted person to and extroverted one, but i really just need a person i can trust in my life who i have met.

She was going try to set up the interview that week but on the off chance that their schedules did not match up she asked me to send her my schedule for the next week so she could work out a day and time. I did that and its been about two weeks give or take and I haven't heard back from her/the company until today.  Today she added me on snapchat.

43,"New to the sub so I'm not entirely sure if this fits, but I am getting super stressed out about this situation that probably isn't too important but need advice and a place to consolidate my thoughts. I am in 10th grade and would be on the JV bball team this year, so I am enrolled in the 7th period basketball class consisting of a practice for last hour of school and sometimes lifting after that. Almost all kids in the program are expected to do it but it's not mandatory. I have been having knee problems that occur whenever I run or jump (for example I ran a mile and had to stop half-way through bc the pain was so bad) and school starts next week. I am not exactly sure what I have, but I am speculating it is Osgood Schlatter. I'm not sure if I should drop the class for a different class and just do the lifts after school, or ask to do homework during the class until I learn what I have (although I'm pretty sure it's just Osgood which you can play through except for pain). Or just continue with the class and do the drills I can, but sit out when it gets too bad.

44,"I think I'm losing it and could just use some advice. I have a history of anxiety problems and I'm not sure if this is all anxiety or something to actually be concerned over. 

I am a young female who lives alone in a small house with a dog. I worked Thursday night and have been off work since then. I got showered and dressed for work on Thursday early afternoon, then came back home Friday early morning. I slept until early afternoon, ran an errand, came home, went to the dog park for an hour, then came home and got showered and dressed for a date. When letting my dog out before the date, I realized that I had accidentally left that door leading from the garage to the fenced in portion of the yard unlocked while I was at the dog park. The door from the house to the garage typically stays unlocked as well. 

While I was getting ready in the same time frame, I also noticed that my green hairbrush that always stayed in the same drawer was missing. It hardly ever leaves the bathroom, and I only use it right after my showers. I've searched the entire house a million times and can't find it. It's absolutely bizarre. My house isn't necessarily ""clean"", but it's certainly not ""messy"". Not an environment where things just go missing.

I'm a little on edge now just because I know I left my door unlocked. I know it's so unlikely someone came through that door during the one hour I was gone and only took my hairbrush. I know this sounds crazy. But I'm especially on edge because living alone as a single female has made me so paranoid. I've been on tinder for a couple of months now and just a few days ago this guy and I matched. He sent me a message and I saw it, but didn't respond that second. He sent me a second message like 30 minutes later and I still didn't respond because I was still busy. Then he sent me a third message a few hours later and I felt like that was just a little too over eager, so I unmatched him. Then the next day he sent me a friend request on Facebook...we have no mutual friends. I blocked him on Facebook. 

I really didn't mean for this to get so long, but my anxiety is just going insane with these two very weird scenarios happening back to back. I could really use some outside feedback, even if it's just ""you're being ridiculous, this is nothing.""  Thanks for any input. ",13Aug2017,11

47,"So, this will be a bit long winded but I will try my hardest to make it understandable.

I was raised in a Baptist home with both my parents and five half siblings from both of my parents previous marriages. 
""My father had a divorce and my mother's last husband randomly left"" To put it simply, my father was physically abusive and verbally abusive, my mother did not partake in these things but she ignored them and did not say anything or try to stop him.

 After everyone grew of the age to leave the house I was left alone with my parents at the age of eight and the physical abuse went on till I was about fifteen. Whenever my father was confronted by someone or a family member about how he treats his kids or his way of life his response would be God allows him to do it, and my mother would respond that she has to be faithful to the Godly man of the house and obey what he says.

Fast forward to when I was about 17 years old, I realize I was gay but ever since I realized this I constantly dealt with the constant bombardment in my own head about how wrong and evil it is... Everything I have heard in church or have heard my parents have said I hear in my own mind.
I have attempted suicide twice, first time was when I was 14 by drowning myself in our pool and my brother visiting dragged me out, and the other time was when I was 20 and tried to fill the garage with co2 but my friend convinced me, thankfully, to stop what I was doing.

I was able to leave the house my parents were in shortly after I attempted suicide a second time and was able to get help with a shrink. He was able to help with somethings and gave me some medicine that helps with anxiety but he retired shortly after. I tried talking to other shrinks that I was recommended but all of them don't seem to understand what my issues are and they blame the fact that I don't have a better paying job as to why i'm depressed and holding on to my past which is completely not true. I don't need money to be happy nor does having money make me happier and I don't spend money encase of emergencies.
I have been trying to go to a church and date but constant reminders of my past bombard me whenever I try to do either of these things and usually it just leads to me going home and not going out to church again or with the person I went on a date with.

I just honestly don't know how to move on from my past and just try to aim for a future. I have tried all the shrinks in my area covered by my life insurance and my options are limited. I'm lonely and selfishly want to be with someone but I know now that i'm not ready for that.

I know my situation isn't that bad, and that people have it worse and the suicide attempts are on me but I honestly could just use some advice on how to move on and attempt to have a normal life.

P.S. This is a mild throw away account.",13Aug2017,1
48,"I have generalized anxiety disorder and I guess it's really getting the best of me. I just got a new job in call center environment for an internet service provider and I'm very quickly realizing it isn't a good fit for me, only about a month in. 


I can't relax between calls (if I ever even have a break between calls), but I can see other people have no issue reading, doing homework, doing crossword puzzles, etc. They don't seem phased by it whatsoever. Me on the other hand, my stress level is a roller-coaster. Some days are easier, I get easy calls with easy-going people and easy fixes for whatever internet issues they're having. Other days, not at all. And I work the late night shift that goes into the morning where conveniently all shift leads and support basically go home and you literally have to run around and find someone willing and available to help you (which, by the way, they put me out on the floor without letting me know that. I didn't know why no one was responding to my help ticket until another representative informed me.) 


I'm stressed the fuck OUT. I was in retail for years before this and was just so thankful to get out of retail, but now I'm having panic attacks at work and laying awake at night just worrying. About what exactly, I can't pinpoint. When my fiancé talks with me and we are trying to pinpoint what has me freaking out so intensely all I can come up with is the following: just hating the suspense between calls, never knowing what's coming after that unnerving beep that just means you've been automatically connected with a customer, the lack of support for night employees, and the feeling in the pit of my stomach that I'm trapped at my desk (my desk which changes everyday because no one has a permanent desk, so no comfort of familiarity there)....so maybe it's the lack of control I feel I have? My old therapist said I had control issues (not over other people but just over my own life) so I guess that makes sense. Plus generally there's just SO much information to know and I feel like I can't contain all of it on the spot like I'm required to. 


My fiancé has the same job and says it gets better, the first month is always hard, etc. And my mom is just telling me to be responsible and suck it up, but every instinct is telling me to get out or I'm going to go insane. I've stressed myself sick several times now while on shift, as in started running fevers in the middle of talking to customers. So then I feel delirious and I start talking in circles and can't do my job regardless. 


Man...but the money is so good. This is the issue. And I just got there, so it looks like job hopping if I put it on my resume. And I'm freaking out because I don't even want to be a part of corporate America when all is said and done, I want to make music. I have work dread all weekend, and those few hours I have after I wake up before I have to be at work you know? I can't focus on being creative. I can't focus on looking for other jobs. So today I went into work, had a panic attack an hour in, and left sick for the rest of the day. Spent all evening applying all over the place. And wouldn't you know it!! My brain starts rationalizing, saying ""well, it'd be easier to stay than to try to make up for interrupted income"" or ""you know, maybe I'm overreacting, I can do it"" and five minutes later it's like ""No I feel trapped, no I can't, I feel trapped, I can't do this, I hate this job.""


And now my mom and fiancé tell me I do this with every job and even though I believe them completely, I felt like this was my first time feeling this way. This complete misery. They say I mention how trapped I feel every time, how quick I am to give up on things I don't feel good enough at. 


How do I get past this? If I can't find another job, how do I stop thinking about work when I'm not there? How do I stop thinking ""only two days left until I work again, only one day and 7 hours til I work again, only 16 hours til I work again."" The more I think about it, the more I think they're right. I always do this, it's just magnified this time because this is the worst fit so far...but I really, reaaaaaallly need the money. So much debt, rent is ridiculous in this area, and for once I'm not going paycheck to paycheck. 


Does anyone have any advice? I meditate, I take baths to relax, I do yoga, I hang out with friends, etc. None of it works alone. Had a panic attack during my bath the other day, and then during meditation. And during yoga I was hyperventilating. I'm already on medication, so I guess seeing a therapist again is the only way to move forward. 


I'm venting I guess. But really if anyone has any advice, I would be endlessly thankful. I feel screwed. Sorry if I talked in circles just now, my head is spinning.


Tl;dr my job is not a good fit for me but it's the best money I can find for my experience. I'm trading my sanity for daily panic attacks and non stop anxiety and feel like I've exhausted my options. ",13Aug2017,1

50,"To make things brief, I had two close friends, I entered a very dark time in my life and since I am not one who opens up to many people at all I chose to confide in those two people. How I was acting and such resulted in getting those two friends to end up not wanting to be friends with me.

 The first friend just went off and told me I wasn't considered a friend anymore because I was selfish and manipulative. I was thought to be selfish by this friend because I chose to confide in friends instead of getting professional help and as for the manipulative part I don't know what I did to make the friend feel this way. My only guess is that the friend thought I was faking everything because of how I was acting at one thing where the friend was at (there are a few reasons behind this but just in general I am the type of person who can put on a mask and seem happy on the outside but on the inside I am no where near that. This was about a month and a half ago

The second friend stopped wanting to be friends because the friend felt that they were making the problem worse and they couldn't handle it anymore and thought I would be best off with the person in my life. This was less than a week ago. 

The problem is that I leave for college in 4 more days and while I have so many reasons to be happy I am not happy because of losing the two friends. I am going to leave feeling like I ruined this chapter of my life. I just want to fix things between my friends so I don't have it hanging over my head that I'm a horrible person but the second friend has already left for college out of state so there is nothing I can do it make things better with that friend. As for the first friend, I've tried to apologize for how I acted but the friend just ignored it. A month later I was doing a lot better then how I was when I was so I thought it would maybe help if I shot a text to the friend saying that I've gotten myself to a much better place and is doing a lot better but again it just resulted in no response.

I have managed to avoid people seeing anything but old scars so far since my main course of study is Shiatsu, which is preformed over the clothes. In class we usually have a short lecture, then a demo of the massage done by the instructor on one of the students or TAs, and then we pair up and trade off working on eachother. I was dumb enough to do both legs so theres no way that I can avoid them working on my upper thighs, and I can't skip class without having to drop it and take it over again, which I can't do because I'm supposed to graduate.

She's insufferable but I'm fairly patient and tolerant, despite how she treats me.

I know this might seem like a petty topic but this was just the icing on the cake that is the shit she's put me through so far. ",13Aug2017,3
72,"I am a happily married 21 year old male working two low paying jobs in order to keep us afloat. My wife is currently attending a technical school to become a medical assistant and is set to finish in 3 months. Luckily, she has a job lined up for her after she graduates so I will be able to leave one of my jobs and pursue a career. The problem is that I haven't got a clue what type of field I am interested in. As time passes I have just been getting more stressed knowing I will have to choose soon. I would hate to study something and figure out it was not for me, or study something that has little market value/jobs. So my question... What is a good degree to pursue? These are my priority's in the order listed 1. has an above average projected job growth 2. Can be completed within 4 years (college+internships)  3. pays an average salary of +50k/year 4. Has flexibility to be able to adapt to different fields. 

I know people always say do what you are talented at but the truth is I suck at everything. All my jobs have been food service, or performing repetitive physical tasks. One thing I did seriously consider was automotive repair, since I do some DIY on my vehicles, but after reaching out to people already employed in the industry I learned it was very frustrating work for little pay. I was advised to leave it as a hobby. I would like to know what you all have to say. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you",13Aug2017,2
73,"I know a lot of people are going to say just stop talking to her or just tell her straight up. Please give me other advice. I'm not the kind of person to really do any of those things (especially to a long time friend) and she's very sensitive. While I don't want to be her friend anymore, I don't want to be rude or hurt her feelings either. 

I've been trying to cut her off for a while now. I make up excuses EVERY time she asks to hang out and I have been for about a year now. She really annoys the hell out of me and always wants me to hang out and get drunk and go to bars with her friends which isn't my scene at all. Whenever she asks I always say I have work or that I'm going somewhere with my family. This past time she asked to hang out she told me two dates this month she wanted to hang out with me and because I've made up so many excuses recently, I ended up saying I'd be able to make the later date. Idk why I did it, I just felt like it was all I could say and felt mean if I told her otherwise. Now I'm really regretting it and don't want to go at all. She said it was for her birthday and she was having a board game night which I felt like I could actually have a good time at but then she told me everyone is going to the bar too and they're all going to be drunk. I need an excuse to get out of this and maybe advice on how to completely cut her off but how to do it gradually and nicely. I thought just making up constant excuses was working but then she asked to hang out again and invited me to her birthday so idk anymore. ",13Aug2017,1
74,"So i start my first college class next week, and i dont have anything i need to actually start.

My mom made me move into my dads house because i was having trouble at her house. We weren't seeing eye to eye on things and she didnt like the way i was living my life. So she sent me to live with my dad and took away my phone and my laptop.

NOW, she is expecting me to get a job and go to school (one of my classes is online) without my phone or laptop. My dad has to pick me up and drop me off from school everyday, and i dont have a phone to get in contact with him to tell him i'm out of class. He works nights a lot so he sleeps all day. my class is in the morning. 

I dont know how she's going to expect me to get a job without a phone since there is no way for my coworkers or boss to get in contact with me in a reliable way. And i wont be able to contact my dad to get me when im off work either.

I know i could get my license and make this A LOT easier but nobody has helped me learn to drive. i asked my dad and he said no... like what the hell. 

I might be overreacting a bit but this is very stressful for me. I don't understand why she is making this so hard on my dad and i. I know this isnt an impossible situation but its very stressful. I might seem like a cry baby who got his privlages taken away, but this seems so hard and i dont know how i'm gunna do it.  I need guidance because i dont know what to do.

77,"This is a bit of a long story so please bear with me.

Last year I was taking a class with this one girl, let's call her Violet. On the first day of that class I sat next to her and didn't say a word. When the teacher began to force us to introduce ourselves I heard Violet say that she liked Sailor Moon the anime. 

I was pretty happy that there was someone I could relate to in that class and she just so happened to be my lab partner too. After a few days we began to talk and she didn't really seem to be that interested by eventually she warmed up and we talked all the time. I asked for her number but instead she declined. 

Coincidentally around the same time she followed me on tumblr and started messaging me. We mostly talked about class and anime but nothing else.

A few months pass and during this period I really feel like me and Violet are friends now. But suddenly she blocks me on all social media. I create a second account to try to talk to her but her attitude towards me has become extremely toxic. The only responses I would get would be ""Fuckkkkkkkkk youuuuuuuuuu"" and ""I hate you"".

I was confused and worried because she began ignoring me in real life as well. I finally asked her what's wrong and she claims that someone told her that I had a crush on her (which is false, I knew she had a boyfriend) and that she was so disgusted by that she won't ever talk to me again.

Here are some unusuall things about her claims though.
1. She's told me alot of personal things about her that very few people know, and I've done the same.
2. She went out and bought me a present just as a gift a few weeks before she blocked me.
3. She says that she likes her boyfriend better than me so she'd never even think of dating me (and I told her i'm fine with that)
4. She's very shy, but used to wave at me in the halls during passing periods but ever since she's ignored me.

What do I do to get her to talk to me when the only messages I can get back are hateful? I don't think she actually hates me, and I just want closure about this whole situation. Thanks in advance r/advice

79,"Sorry if I ramble a bit, but I'm really panicking right now and can't think straight. I added a TL;DR

Background information: my mom's always been obsessed with making money the ""easy way"" and she's tried some stupid shit in the past to try and get cash which has left us in crippling debt (but that's a story for another time).

Her newest idea to ""get-rich quick"" is to sell NuSkin products. When she first told me about the company, I, a minor, could immediately realize it was some sort of pyramid scheme or at the very least, something very stupid that you can't make money off of. Apparently today she went to one of their meetings to gather new distributors, and now she's hooked on the idea of making money by selling those sketchy products. She gave me a 20minute business pitch to try and get me to sell them on Facebook too. 

I researched the company slightly and I found all sorts of sketchy things. It doesn't appear to be a pyramid scheme, but it does seem to be a complete waste of time. My dad and I are trying to talk her out of it but she won't listen to facts, as in, she starts screaming at us with stuff like ""how do you know??"" ""have you ever sold anything successfully???"" ""executives from the company SAID IT WORKED THEREFORE IT DOES"" etc. (Off-topic: I'm not certain but I'm fairly certain she may be a narcissist).

At this point I don't know what to do. How do I persuade her to not get involved with this?

TL;DR: My mom's convinced that selling sketchy NuSkin products will make her rich, please help me I don't know how to get her to not do this. ",13Aug2017,8
80,"So I guess the title kind of explains most of it, but...

I'm a 19 year old girl. Since I turned 18, I've been getting acne that has gotten progressively worse. It is constantly itchy and it seriously feels like my face is blistering and bubbling up at every hour of the day.

I have tried a TON of skincare and acne products, and nothing seems to be having any real effect. Not to mention I can only cover up so much with makeup. I also eat pretty healthy and drink plenty of water.

81,"Background:
Majority of my life I've felt depressed and practically bullied my whole life and that nobody gets me, started talking to this girl I knew from college I reached out that I knew vaguely a few years ago. We got close and I found out she was so similar to me in a lot of ways. 


After spending months having chats and helping eachover with issues we brought up, one of which is her ex bf breaking up with her by just blocking her on social media and then not contacting her ever again. As time went on I started feeling a genuine close bond with her, I felt I could bring problems up with her and she help me with them and vice versa, she always gave me great advice rather than people telling you typical ""it's gunna be ok"" or ""you're going to be alright"" crap. She always made me smile when I felt so down, I guess I had a crush on her for quite a long time.

Since I've never properly had a girlfriend I guess it made me feel really special knowing that there was a girl out there who gave a shit about me and knew how I felt and it felt good knowing I could do the same back. recently we had been out and about drinking and she was very flirtatious with me, she would be constantly in my company, grabbing my hand and lying on top of me when I would lay down, now obviously girls can get a little nuts when they are drunk but even when sober she would be playful with me. Even after the first night of partying me and her were having suggestive texts between one and other which made me extra attracted to her.

The 2nd night she was more flirty than the last and while she was using the restrooms her friend told me that she said that the girl I like was getting feelings for me and thought I was good looking, which I really got an ego boost from, I felt really good about myself than I ever did after that night. The next day after she was texting me loads and from my point of view craving my attention a lot and we would each leave 'xx' after nearly every message and she would talk about stuff that was very suggestive to me which from there I was hooked on her and I felt attacted to her both mentally and physically and I thought I had finally found love.

And tonight well, I feel absolutely dreadful. I told her about my feelings and she said that she was developing feelings for me but they weren't clear, one thing aswell she did mention that she doesn't want to rush into a relationship over text but I got confused cause it seemed like she really liked me and I maybe had a shot, anyways she mentioned that she isn't over her ex and she's mixed up and then my heart just shattered into pieces, she spent the night having loads of fun and by the way still leaning against me and stuff, I felt absolutely miserable I just kept drinking and trying to act like I was fine. After a few hours there I just couldn't take it and left. I contacted her telling her I just wanted her to be happy and she said that she is sorry she doesn't feel the same way and I told her that it was hurting me cause I felt a little lead on and she said flirting is part of her personality, but anyways after me saying im fine being friends I did ask if sometime in the future when you feel you are over your ex do you see us together and she said came back saying no.

Now I just feel so depressed about it and everytime I think about how it is never going to happen between me and her it physically hurts and I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like i've lost the one thing that has made me happy which was thinking about me and her being in a relationship. I just feel like the world is ending.

so here's the thing, I have two guys in my life right now. It's not like I'm two timing or anything I just mean that there are two guys I kinda like. One guy is one of my best friends and has told me how much he likes me and we've told each other we love each other in friendship. he would be like the perfect boyfriend, he's funny, nice, cares about my emotions and makes me feel safe. Unfortunately I'm not the only one who's realised this. One of my best friends likes him too and has told him that she loves him, he told her he doesn't see her like that and only likes her as a friend, he also told me not to worry about it because she knows his feelings towards her. But as much as I like him I don't know if I can do that to her. 

The other guy is much simpler and that's one of the great things about him. I don't know him as well but we have fun together and he makes me laugh. It's early days because I'm getting to know him as a friend as well as a potential guy.

87,"So, this might go on for a while, apologies.

I am currently sitting on the couch at home, anxiety still reeling over the epiphany that I have fucked up.

Recently, things ended with a guy I was seeing, his reasoning being that he had mental issues (which was true) to work through, and relationships were probably not good from him atm. Cut to a week or so later, and I found that he actually had found and fallen in love with someone else. Things then started making sense: his distance and behaviour (which I attributed to his problems) were because he liked someone else but couldn't be arsed to actually admit to.

Now, I don't miss him, nor want him back, but the way he ended things (similar to how my first boyfriend [with his own problems] ended things) makes me realise that, as the common denominator, obviously something about me comes across as inadequate or easy to fuck over.

I am 27 years old, and, because of my caring responsibilities for my autistic sister, I still live at home with my mum. I am very aware that I have to a degree used this responsibility as an excuse to not work on myself (""Oh, I would love to do that, but let's be honest, I don't have the time."")

As such, I don't go out at night all that much (I do have friends that I see semi-regularly during the daytime), I can't cook, I can't remember the last time I genuinely looked forward to something, and I feel like time I could have spent, even in some small way, improving myself was completely wasted.

My mum has started proceedings for my sister to move into shared accommodation, which is going to do wonders for her personal development.  However, a part of me is also petrified at the prospect of having so much more free time and, at least from my perspective, not much of a start to go on.

I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting on here, but any words of wisdom or encouragement would be welcome x

88,"Lately I feel like I'm in a slump that I'll never get out of. All the things I want to do in life feel like they're never going to happen and that I'm powerless to change that. I want to move out of my mothers place and in with my girlfriend but I don't have a car or enough money to move. So I try saving up for a car but with the bills I have I barely have enough to put money away. On top of that I don't actually know how to drive so I have to pay for driving lessons but again I don't have the money for that.

95,"Venting a lot here; there's a TL;DR at the bottom.

When she first hit puberty, my eldest step child turned viciously rude, self absorbed, and depressingly moody. Rudeness was met with punishment (taking the phone usually). she is no longer rude. She's just depressing to live around now. 

To stem the flow of recommendations to therapy and so forth, we've taken her already. Therapist said she's normal and we're doing everything we should. Her home life is peaceful and filled with extracurriculars, she's doing well in school and with her many friends, she's working. Her bio mom is a source of frustration for her, as she's just an unreliable pen pal at this point, but that's been the case for most of her life. She's also cheerful and friendly 50% of the time, but she's also the type to get gloomy often, and when she's gloomy, she seems to want to spread it around. This isnt to extreme a problem I guess, but it does really get to me every now and then.

Her gloom seeps through the house. Anyone playing happy music, laughing, ect, is glowered at until the joy dissipates. She oozes from room to room, sneering, headphones in, eating non stop, only speaking to criticise or antagonise her sisters. If she sets up shop in the living room before others can colonise it, the windows are kept curtained, a depressing anime is put on at full volume, and this will continue for many hours, until someone asks for the telly, which is usually met with a small tantrum. All the kids have chores, and have had for all of their lives since preschool, but despite us never wavering on insisting they be done, she still finds it draconian when reminded and will only do what she's been asked (which is the bare minimum, trust me) after trying to debate the matter. On one of her happy days, she'll ask if we can go to the beach, or on a hike, on Saturday. Then Saturday comes and she's glowering, sulking on the beach towel and asking when we plan to go home. It's gotten to the point that we all start planning an outing spontaneously when she goes away with a friend, because hats the only time we can go and actually have some fun. I tell myself that she's a teen and her moods are like weather, that it's silly to let it get to me that it's 'raining', (when she's sulky) and that this will pass. But her equally teenage sisters do not being the whole family's mood down constantly; they have moods, but also seem to realise that their moods aren't everyone's problem. They're more healthy about it. I was worried, early on, that the oldest was depressed or something; however heartless I sound in all this venting, I do care about her and want to know she's ok. But two different therapists say she's normal, if immature, and that some people's personalities are just like this; cranky, glowering and stormy. She just seems to naturally be 'that woman in the office' whose always unhappy with someone or something. They've tried working with her, but again, they don't see anything to wild, and she's honestly pretty normal outside of her depressing aura. Both times she asked to quit after a few sessions, they said that was fine, and it was game over.

The sucky thing for her (and me, selfishly) is that her sweet side draws people in, but she tends to lose friends and boyfriends when they get close enough to her for her to show her other side (many a sleepover has ended with 'did I make her mad? Can you please take me home?' and each time I wanna say '😅sure kid, if I can come with you') She's got two years before graduating high school, and has no plans for college. I've been telling myself she'd move out at 18-22 like most kids, but (sorry...) I don't see anyone wanting to live with her voluntarily. She works, and has brought up paying rent once she graduates before being asked (she is quite responsible in general, good grades... she says college 'isn't worth the stress' though 🙁) but I just... don't want to live with her anymore! Ugh! She's not a bad girl, but I've done my time, dammit! I sat through all of her teen years, encouraging her to stick with gymnastics and therapy, being there for her when she wanted me- I love her, truly. But I guess I don't love her enough to want to keep walking on eggshells in my own house anymore, seemingly forever. I feel guilty just writing that, but whatever, none of you know me. And the people that do often wonder how I put up with her at all! 

I do have faith that she'll realise she wants more from life then a high school diploma will give her, and I do believe she has personal growth coming that we can all be proud of. Does anyone have, I don't know, advice for coping with her gloomy presence in the meantime? Tips to help her grow? Or just to keep me from tearing my hair out?

TL;DR: my eldest is the gloomiest, sulkiest kid you could be without needing professional help. Her presence sucks the air from the room. She's behaved so there isn't a discipline issue, it's more a clash of personalities. How do I keep my own chin up when every outing is filled with eye rolls and complaining; how do I keep smiling at the breakfast table with her frowning back? ",13Aug2017,7

97,"This isn't something I have ever spoke about or sought advice for before, however being at the most crucial point in my life I would really like to know what you guys think. 

I am 22 years old and for the last 10 years I have been making some very questionable life decisions. I left school in 2011 with little to no qualifications, most of the time I spent there I was hanging out with people who didn't try to succeed or have any will to do well. It had reached a point one day where I was sitting a French speaking exam and it was required to hit a certain % to pass, so I intentionally failed because my ""friends"" got kept behind for failing and I didn't want to be the only one that got out on time, which was utterly ridiculous looking back. We would hang out during lunch and smoke weed, then lunch became after school and on the weekends, weed becoming heavier drugs and alcohol over time. 

I started a college course that spanned across 4 years after leaving for business and finance, then proceeded to do the same thing as before. It reached 2015 and one month before taking the final exams I had been given a choice; stay behind and finish all the outstanding coursework for the year, or fail. So instead I took my final student loan payment, dropped out and travelled across Europe for a few weeks, blowing all my money pretty much immediately. I had three cities planned in order of Amsterdam, Belgium then France with trains booked between each one. I spent all my money on drugs in Amsterdam, basically the entire loan in three days. 

The girl I was with at that point in my life had cheated on me twice and I didn't even care. We are no longer together and have no contact which I am perfectly fine with, but I am filled with regret because I wasted an entire claim when I was 18 of £5,000 taking the two of us out everywhere to parties and again, buying drugs and alcohol. 

When I came home from France I had no choice but to move into my nannies house, because I had no Higher Diploma, no money and no job. It didn't take long at this point for my girlfriend mentioned above to leave me, so I spent the next year unemployed and not caring about anything. Eventually I met an amazing girl who I have totally fallen in love with. We live together now in our house and have been for the past year, I got an entry level job on a temporary contract and it turned into a permanent job for an accounting firm. I have enough money to be financially stable each month and could start saving and planning a future but I am in a constant state of existential crisis. 

The group of friends I have now are even worse than before. The majority of them are unemployed drug dealers and junkies and we would party for days on end. Going to illegal raves, having violent confrontations with neighbours, blowing  through money like it didn't matter and I have never taken so many drugs before in my entire life. I would leave the house sober and within about 2 hours of arriving be on acid or cocaine falling all over the place, vomiting on myself, passing out etc. Some of the states I have gotten myself into have really panicked my girlfriend, as she comes with me to the parties but doesn't do anything other than smoke some weed, so she runs around trying to keep me okay which isn't fair. 

I'm at a point in my life where I wake up everyday wanting to make changes but I don't know how. I want to end this self destructive behaviour but I have never really been able to associate myself with people that have goals, or passion, and all I ever do is get fucked up and regret it. There's another side to all this partying, I sit in work and get text my friends and they always text me about how it's ""the last time"" and no more mad ones, then the same night it'll happen all over again.

I seriously think about withdrawing from society or just walking away from everybody. Moving to a new country, cutting off contact, anything to escape the cycle. I know I am at fault and I have gotten myself into these situations, but the internal conflict of knowing better yet acting on impulse is making me depressed. I feel a constant pressure to go out, like I literally have a fear on missing out. I have a lot of really bad comedowns which leave me in a state of depression and have cravings to do cocaine constantly. I hate it so much. 

I want to be free from this life. 

TLDR: I want to stop hanging out with toxic people and continue to better myself, but I can't detach myself from my friends.  ",13Aug2017,1
98,"I feel like I dont ever express my true thoughts. I feel like I always say what people want to hear. I rarely ever disagree with family members or friends and If I do, I end up feeling guilty. Ive been doing this for a very long time, its recently become a problem because I cant handle the fake smiles and laughters.

When somebody tells a joke that I dont find funny at all,I still laugh. I catch myself doing this around my brother in law and sometimes even my father. It seems like when I dont laugh, I feel like they wont like me anymore. 

It doesnt just happen with jokes,it interferes with my personal opinion,as I stated above. For example,a couple years ago my friend George used to show me pictures of random people that I didnt even know existed. Then, he would proceed to bash their appearances. He would laugh, and I would laugh,but I dont think he ever saw through my laughter. It really angered me deep down but I laughed because If I didnt his attitude would change and he would question as to why I am trying to defending that person. 

More recently,my brother wanted to crash at my place. I wont get too into detail about him but basically,he is suppose to be in jail as I am typing this. He called me since he knew I was visiting my sister. Of course I say ""yeah sure bro,I got your back"". That wasnt even what I was thinking at all!! I was thinking how selfish he was,that he is willing to put his own family in danger. I just couldnt bring myself to say no. Fortunately, I never told him when I was coming back to my house, so I dont know where he is or what he is doing. Only god knows. I just really need help expressing the way I truly feel. If someone actually reads this,your advice will be greatly appreciated! ",13Aug2017,2

101,"I'm insecure & have a hard time connecting with people & maintaing friendships/relationships because of it. 

It's been a problem for quite awhile now, and I've tried to monitor my own thoughts and feelings, physically taking notes that I can later analyze to help me figure out who I am. 

Originally I started doing all this to hopefully help me with my anxiety, but now, 4 years later, it's morphed into an entirely different project. As I've learned more about myself, I've made adjustments to help me get closer to being the person I want to be. 

However, there's one trait that really bothers me that I'm having a hard time changing. I've noticed I have a subconscious habit of staying detached & emotionally uninvested in other people, just in case things start falling apart, so I can be the first to leave - - whether that be a friendship or a serious relationship. 

It's either that, or the complete opposite, where I allow myself to be so overly attached that I choose to overlook major issues & red flags if it means that I won't be alone.

110,"This is a throw away account, for obvious reasons.
Yesterday I came home from a day in another city with some friends, and my younger brother (19), was screaming at my older brother (21, turning 22 in 16 days) in the field next to our house, saying he spit in his face. My older brother (OB) was screaming for him to stop and saying he didn't do as he backed away, and my younger brother (YB) kept approaching him, until finally they had run to the street and my YB pushed my OB to the floor where he kicked him in the face and punched him a good few times. My OB is yelling and sounding like he's near to cry, so I'm running over there to defend him. My YB is already leaving, very upset, and I smell alcohol, so I just assume it's that.

My OB is on the ground and talking about how he's let my YB beat him because he's too weak to fight back, and he sounds devastated. At this point I'm on my OB side, because let me explain.

My whole life my YB has seemed like a problem. He had terrible anger issues, constantly fought with kids at school, got consistently D's and low C's, and disrespected my father like crazy, to the point they got in a fight and the cops had to be called. He was coming home drunk in high school and treating everyone like shit, while my OB was the golden child. He got A's in school and was mostly well behaved, so obviously I loved my OB much more.

Right now we live in the house, my Dad used to live in but rented out to us. It's me and my brothers, my best friend, who shares the master room, and another guy whose not important.

Anyway, I'm screaming at my YB that I'm not going to help him anymore to get to work and I'll call the cops on him if he keeps fighting. I leave my OB out in the field and go in the house crying when my YB comes out and yells in my face 'I don't understand'. 

Only a bit later my YB come in my room where I'm crying and tells me that the reason he reacted the way he did was because my OB raped my YB for two years. 
My YB said it was when he was 4-5, so that means that my OB had been around 7-8 when he did it, which doesn't make sense to me. Can a 7-8 year old rape someone? I remember watching a documentary about young sex offenders on you tube, but they were very awkward and acted strange. My OB is a very charismatic guy, so does this mean someone did something to him?

I call my mom to tell her immediately (Her and my Dad are divorced BTW, so my Dad does not currently know) and she is shocked, and is like trying to justify why my OB could have done this and if my YB's claims are actually true or not. 

(Oh, by the way, IDK if this is important but my OB, during the divorce last year, my Dad got really crazy and suicidal and while trying to keep my mom, he blackmailed her with the fact that he was actually a bastard and they had been pretending he was his kid all these years, so she just told her she didn't know who his father was, but my OB didn't know that until recently)

Now, I completely believe my YB, and that's really, really hard for me to admit, because I loved my OB, even if he's recently become kind of a lazy pothead who doesn't do anything. 

I believe my YB is telling the truth b/c when we were all much younger, probably 6-7, (I'm 20F btw) my OB, while at my Grandparent's house, used to bring my YB and me in a room and he'd tell us to take off our pants and we'd touch each other. It seems like a dream now, but I do somewhat remember it, but our family never talked about it again after our grandpa found out. Sometimes I can pretend it didn't even happen. Also I believe my OB doing  stuff to my YB like that is the reason my YB later in life would touch me while I was sleeping. He had once touched me over the breast when I slept in his room when I was about 9 but I didn't do anything, and touched my butt when I was 11, which I did tell my mom and she grounded my brother and told me it happened in most families and I should forgive him. I also remember a point where my YB was outside the bathroom door of the basement while I was in there, trying to tell me to pull my pants down, then kick them away, then open the door. I never did, but I believe these sexual deviant things were caused by the Rape. My YB also only has gal friends, has never had any close male friends, and also has quit two jobs because he claims the manager were trying to molest him. His is also very quick to use homophobic slurs and get angry if someone does something 'gay' to him. I also believe the reason he was so cruel to my Dad is because he felt betrayed because he couldn't protect him and he doesn't like to be controlled.

I feel like my YB finally told me, because he is in a better place. He has a good job, a good GF, but this whole ""OB spit in his face' thing set him off, because YB is now much psychically stronger than OB, and YB has a better job than OB, quit smoking weed like OB and is actually happy. YB says that OB has always held this rape over his head, dropping subtle disses all the time, (they wanted to be rappers and OB apparently had a line that said ""Waiting for the right time to get you.""). 

My mom told us over the phone that she was raped by her older brother as well (which I also believe because my mom was abused heavily both physically and mentally by her mom, while her brother was treated very well, so I believe my uncle felt superior to her) and said that eventually he would grow to forgive him, and my YB said he wouldn't.

What should I do? I want to call the cops, but YB doesn't want it to be made public, but OB needs to be in jail. We locked OB out of the house and I actually felt really bad when he finally came back and was knocking on my window. I wanted to help him and I hated myself for it. Should I never speak to my OB again? Should I call the cops? I don't know how to handle this. I had no idea how fucked everything was and I feel blind sighted and stupid. This isn't good for me, as I think I may have depression and I've been battling suicidal thoughts for the last year and half, attempting it once.

I hate everything that is happening to me and I want it to stop, but I also want justice for my YB, but I also still love my OB and don't want to fuck up the rest of life! Is it even possible to throw him in jail still. I'm in Florida if that helps. Any advice or anything would be really nice. I just need someone to talk to that isn't close to the situation.

Thank you for reading and I'm so sorry this is so long, but it's also kind of rant/advice.

115,"Obligatory - Throwaway account. 

2 years ago I went through a really bad depressive stage (one of the worst I've ever had). My marriage was going through some rough times, my wife was pregnant and I didn't know how I felt about it, the list goes on. I started chatting with a girl online and we really connected. The chatting continued and escalated over a couple of months. Wife found out and left me. The online relationship continues and turns into an in-person (though very long distance) relationship (called LD from here). 

I have depression and LD has anxiety. We were both very guarded when we started talking and we both hid some details. (She is still technically married and her husband thought they still had a chance of getting back together. She was still close friends with some past boyfriends who were pretty abusive in my opinion.) The relationship is primarily on snapchat, but we chat basically all day every day, plus phone calls. 

My child is born, and lives in another state. I travel there for visitation (about a 4 hour drive). Visits with LD are about a 10 hour drive, we trade drives. Because of above mental issues and rocky relationship start, the relationship has some insecurities, there are trust issues, and a fair amount of co-dependence. 

20 months in, I broke off the relationship with LD (this actually happened yesterday). She is devastated. She had wanted to get married, move her kids to the upper midwest, the whole deal. I am stressed. It is hard to deal with the constant travel, and the lack of space/downtime. Like I said, we chat constantly. But - she stuck with me through one of the toughest times in my life. I thought I was okay with my decision, but I have devastated myself a bit as well. So yesterday was the first day of limited communications, our snapstreak ended. Still said good night and good morning, but of course, it's not the same. I'm still feeling the anxious attachment and co-dependence.

I think I'm falling for him, although we made it both clear that we're just friends and I even asked him before if he likes me, he said he doesn't in a romantic way. When he tells me about his possible conquests or his crushes, I get hurt but I try to brush it off. Now i'm thinking of just cutting ties with him to end this but try as I might, he's in my system.

So people of Reddit, I am here for your advice. Long time reader/lurker but never really posted anything. So here it is, I've been with a girl now for around 4 years and everything seemed to be going awesome, she is currently studying in another country (15hours on a plane 6hour time difference) for another year. I think she is cheating on me with another guy but I can't prove it for obvious reasons. I have since found out her Facebook password (I know I'm already in the wrong) and have been trying to catch her out speaking to a guy I think it is. So over the last 2 weeks she has been speaking with him and video calling each other and then deleting messages they send each other so they can't be read. See I love this girl and have given her everything I can to help her in another country and to show my affection, so it's killing me to be how I am snooping on/in her Facebook to see if she is doing anything.

The paint on my car is getting completely destroyed and I cannot see through the windows/mirror well anymore. In an attempt to identify the assailant I installed a security camera recently which costed me 120$.

After checking my camera playback footage, I can vaguely see the scene where an egg flies out of a car at about 1am. However, the footage is VERY blurry due to how fast the car is going while performing the drive-by egging and how the camera's IR performs at night. I cannot identify the car nor the driver as I monotonously re-watch the footage. After doing some research i've learned that most security cameras are useless when recording fast moving cars at night.

128,"So I just took the GMAT yesterday. Last minute. My employer gives us 5000 a year for an mba, so I thought why not. I scored a 660, 41Q 42V. I did not expect to do that well. My prep consisted of one free practice test on Princeton Review and listening to YouTube videos on the three hour drive to Nashville to take the test(Last minute, closest center available this weekend). 

Now, I had already applied to my local state school, Tennessee Chattanooga. My undergrad is from Tennessee Knoxville. I had a 2.7gpa in finance, but I didn't go to college til I was 28 and I happened to be over 500 lbs at the time so let's just say i wasn't in a good mental state. Depressed, probably attended 25% of my classes, hated myself, etc. Anyway, not here to whine, I basically figured my mental shit out three years ago and I've completely changed my life. Lost  250 lbs. Tripled my income. Healthy relationship. But that leaves me with this.....

If I made a 660 without trying I could probably make a 725 if I studied the math for a month, right? Maybe going to my local state college and doing a 4 year part time MBA isn't the best use of my time. I'm 35, I feel like I have a compelling story with the way I've turned my life around. I've always been pretty smart but now I get ""it"", and by it I mean life, and discipline, and drive, and how to accomplish the things important to me. 

This is kind of a wake up call to me. I'm still young enough I can accomplish a lot. I love my job and I'm good at it but I'll never make more than 100k doing it. I've felt for a while this nagging need to make up for lost time. I feel like I can either stay the course my life is on now and live a good solid life but I'll always wonder what if......

Anyway, so what I'd like is some outside opinions. What is realistic? If I put off enrollment this fall, take it again in a month and make a 725 what would my options be with my history? If there is anyone out there who is in admissions or just knows the system and could give me some advice I would be very appreciative.

129,"Hi. This is my first post ever on here. Im going to try to keep this as informed as possible but not excessively long.

Im 22 years old, live in the midwest, have a decent job at the moment that provides for myself a little bit. nothing too extravagant but i make enough to get by i suppose. my benefits are unreal though, and i really enjoy them. as far as paid time off and raises go. anyways my dad has been in the air force for 23 or so years. in this process, as most people do, we moved. 4 times. from utah. to washington. to delaware. and then to ohio where he retired. in that, they want to move back home. where theyre from. actually to the same city in washington that i lived for four years in my younger days. And i have been going through some pretty wishy washy feelings about moving with them. mostly because, i do not want to give up everything ive worked for here. i know nothing really about the working life out there. id have no friends. no ties to anything. no job. be back in my parents house. etc. completely start over. recently ive escaped an abusive relationship with my ex girlfriend, who had some pretty intense depression issues that caused selfish motives that really drained me. its messed me up quite bad, not to where i need THAT kind of advice, but still it has affected me. im still getting over it. but theres a LOT of mental confusion within myself about everything. not just because of her, but i feel like in that situation with her, it magnified everything that already existed. about moving forward with my life. and i dont know what the best thing to do is. 

in points, these are the conflicting thoughts that i have. and im reaching out to you guys for some help, id really appreciate it. let me know what you think.

- i dont know anything about whats out there. i dont remember, what the work opportunities were like, even when i lived there, i was 7 to 11 yrs old lmao.

- my entire family is out there. i would have zero family here. no cousins. no one. and seeing them is a rarity.

- id have to start over. completely. and that bothers me. even if im not exactly ""happy"" and content with my life as it is right now. its still not that bad.

- at the same time i dont want to simply allow my independence here, to prohibit me from moving. i know that EVENTUALLY id be able to get there again.

- i know that problems follow you. no matter where you go. i dont want to try to run away from anything here and just expect it to go away simply because im around my family again.

- if anything happened here, even though im a grown adult, i still would have only a couple of people to rely on here. and in the same way, they wouldnt be as there for me as say my family would.

- and really, i just dont want to move out there and hate it. or stay here and wish i did move. that uncertainty about what the best decision to do is really what affects me the most in my thinking.

what would you do.

For usefulness alone, I'm a young female. I don't have anything that I think would be considered a major disfigurement, but I still feel incredibly ugly and constantly self conscious about myself. 
I guess that in turn just makes me feel unworthy of my relationship. I love my partner, and he tries so hard to help me and prove that he loves me, but no matter how much I want to believe him I can't, because I can't see how anybody could love me. I feel paranoid so often because I feel like he's going to meet someone else and realise that he's making a mistake by being with me. Me being like this is pushing him away, and we argue constantly over stupid things because of me.

How can I stop hating myself? My boyfriend says he thinks I could have body dysmorphia, but I really doubt that. I really do just think I'm ugly, and everyone is afraid to tell me the truth. I'm scared of going to talk to anyone else about it, because I feel like I'll just be laughed at.

131,"I've played football since I was 9 years old, and I'm currently 16 and going into my junior year in high school. I've enjoyed football a lot the last couple years in high school, and I've just started my first year of varsity football. I've gone through four days of tryouts, and usually I would be loving it, but right now I'm absolutely hating it. Despite working out and lifting out a lot since January, I'm one of the weakest on the team, and I'm not aggressive, despite having been very aggressive last season on JV. I only like one or two of the coaches, and I barely ever work with them during practices. I only have a few friends on the team, and I don't feel like I get any respect from anyone. It's not fun, and I'm not enjoying it, and seeing the recent studies of CTE is only making me question this decision even more.

What should I do? I'd like to stick it out for another couple weeks before making a decision, but it's been wearing on me physically and emotionally. It's getting to be a little too much, and it's only been a few days. ",13Aug2017,1

136,"Alright so about 2 weeks ago my best friend and girl I like stopped being friends, this is kinda complicated but i'll try to explain it as well as I can.

So apparently he texted her saying how he thinks I like her and didn't want her to get hurt or something (BTW how does he get to decide who I like or that sorta shit). So for some weird reason they stopped being friends and now i'm sitting on fence wondering whether to try and get in with her and face possible rejection and humiliation + also losing my relationship with my friend or stay friends with him and lose touch with the person that I REALLY REALLY like.

so i live with 2 other guys in a share house and we have known each other for around 10 years so were good friends, when we moved in(around a year ago) we agreed it wouldn't be a ""party house"" and so far its been not bad, we have had parties in the past, Christmas for example and its been fine.

one guy i understand works late but again im telling him more than a month in advance, the other guy idk hes a grump and a bit antisocial these days, either way the group i would be inviting are all common friends

so i let them know i want to have a Halloween party(a month and a half in advance) they shoot me down like im having parties every all the time saying this isnt a party house, sigh it pains me that they are being so strict as this is the second party i have had in a year.

My stupid problem is that if people don't message me first, we are just not going to talk at all. The thing is, I really want to talk to these people. I just have no idea how. 

I can't imagine a ""hi"" leading to any discussion about a topic. How to people even begin talking about a topic in the first place?

Part of me is angry because I feel lead on by the flirting and paranoid that all of what she said to me were lies, part of me is sad and depressed because I don't get to be with her and try be her saviour from all the depressing thoughts she had told me about.

151,"Hi all,
I'm a recently graduated senior looking to start college this coming spring semester. I'm looking at either going to a community college or straight to a university but I have no idea which would best benefit me. I already know what program I want to go into and the university I applied to has a really good one. My problem is paying for tuition. It will take me about two years to finish the prerequisites for the program I want into, and my work will reimburse me $2,000 every school year until I make it into the program, when they'll reimburse me 100%. The university I want into isn't too expensive. I would probably only be paying about $5,000 every semester (including books because I'll only be taking about 13 credits). But I will also have to pay to live down there because I can't afford taking the time to drive back home everyday (3 hours total everyday). Also, My work is within walking distance to the university. 

So my question is, would it best benefit me to just go to the community college for my generals to save money and then transfer over to the university? About 50% of students from this community college transfer over to the university I want into. I have enough saved and my work would reimburse me enough that I could pay for those couple of years at the community college just fine. But, if I already know which program I want to go into would it be best for me to go to the university? I want to make sure I'm getting the best education out of these two. If it would be best for me to just go to the university where I can start my education on track to go straight into the program I want into, I can work out paying for the tuition. But I have no idea if it would set me back to go to the community college or not. I've read a bunch of articles and other forums/posts about it and from what I understand, I just have to worry about my credits being transferable, getting all my prerequisites done, and getting a good gpa. 

I have no idea what to do and I'm super stressed about it. ANY advice is greatly appreciated!! Thank you for taking the time to read this.",13Aug2017,1
152,"I'm currently learning how to drive in a manual car, but I hate gear changing and the clutch. It's too mind-occupying while driving so I feel slightly distracted while driving, and also I hate knowing that if I mess up I could potentially kill someone, which makes me really nervous and hesitant to go over 27mph (which greatly annoys my driving instructor). 

If I learn automatic, everything that currently negatively affects my driving will disappear. However, my dad says that I'll regret learning how to drive automatics because I'll be restricted with what I can drive (I don't care that I won't be able to drive manuals; the entire point is that I don't want to drive them in the first place). When I tell him I don't care, he says that I will when I'm older.

Thing is, for the past few weeks I've been really distressed about every driving lesson. I hate having to do gear changes and the clutch stuff, and have nearly crashed a few times. Last week, I came home with my lips literally bleeding because they got so dry from pure fear.

My next lesson is in a couple of days, but I have until tomorrow to cancel it unless I want to pay the instructor extra. My parents pay the lessons (I'm 17 and have no job) so I have to convince them to cancel it and let me learn automatics. My mum is really passive about my driving and leaves all the decision making to my dad since he's the car guy of the household, so there's no point in trying to convince her.

155,"He's the youngest, at 7 (almost 8) years old. Between me and him is an 11yr age gap (and 4 siblings), so I've been watching him grow up in front of me and co-parenting him. 

Recently (within the last month or so) he's been behaving quite strangely. When he gets upset or angry, which he does at the tiniest things like taking my mum's phone away from him, he starts saying things like

""Everybody in this family hates me""
""No one loves me""
""I never want to see any of you ever again in my whole life""

This doesn't make sense to me because every single day I shower him with hugs and kisses and tell him he's the most beautiful boy in the world, the best boy in the world etcetera etcetera. 

Then he would even threaten suicide which actually shocked me a lot. He actually said ""I'm going to jump off the roof and commit suicide"" and ""I'm going to go kill myself"" so he knows what he's saying. The only way I managed to calm him down was asking him what he wanted in exchange for coming back down and he said ""£100"" and I said ""fine come and I'll give it to you"" and he'll be like ""no I want you to put it right there and back away"". What kind of 7 year old behaves like this?

He also threatened to 'go get himself lost and not come back home' after we lost him and told him we were looking for him everywhere and mum was drowning in her tears because she thought she'd never see him again. 

Today is the most recent 'event', he'd been playing on the PS4 for a few hours straight so my middle brother came to have a go himself, and when he took it my little brother threatened to stab him saying ""okay I'm going to get a knife and stab you in the chest"".

He also hits his older sister (she's 10) wherever he knows it will hurt the most. So if he's mad at her (often over petty tiny things) and she's got an eye infection he'll hit her right in her eye (punch or kick), or if her stomach aches he'll kick her there. 

He even said that he aims for the heart so it will really hurt. 

Now if you don't upset him he's actually really sweet, he'll give you hugs and kisses, do you favours (go get me this/that), share his things with you (food and toys), buy you things with his pocket money, behave himself in public (he never throws temper tantrums and will walk by your side if you treat him nice, but if you yell at him he'll drive you insane) and overall is a very nice child. 

But all this stuff has got me worried and I don't know where it's coming from. I mean how does he even know what suicide is, and where does he get all these thoughts?

He only ever watches things on Netflix Kids, plays things like Talking Tom and watches Cartoons. But I will say he's played quite a lot of GTA V, but then again that has no suicide themes in it, and I played a lot of San Andreas around his age too and never said things like that.",13Aug2017,1

Three months ago I got on a birth control pills that worsened my anxiety and made eating less enjoyable. I quit my job and the anxiety got MUCH worse. Now it's very hard to eat. Some foods that I used to love make me gag or throw up, and whenever I try to swallow my throat feels tight. It's not like I don't want to eat- I'm really fucking hungry all the time now. :( 

Doing deep breathing exercises and meditation doesn't help, although they do make me feel calmer. Neither does it get easier when I've had a few drinks in me and I'm a little more relaxed.

I stopped the birth control a week or so ago, so I'm hoping it's just a side effect from that. But this is very debilitating and frustrating. I don't know what to do. I'm always hungry and it's making it hard to think clearly and sleep. I'm definitely not pregnant, either.

160,"So I met this guy a year back and we would talk almost daily (mainly via text) for 4 months. He was a lot of fun and we got along great but  he eventually told me he wasn't empathetic and that made me slightly upset. I even told him that I refused to believe it and he said to try him. So I guess somehow the discussion of the No Contact thing came up and we went a few days right after I broke it (which shocks me till today because I usually never do). Anyways, his ego was fed at that point and we didn't laat too long until he stopped replying to my messages. 

Now a year has passed and we somehow got to speaking again but only this time we had a few Skype calls that lasted almost 5 hours each. I was in no way interested in him the way I was back then though, so it seemed casual and nice. Anyway, we started discussing the past and he even said if we were to have such a ""game"" again I'd be the one losing. Lo and behold, we did somehow stop talking (so I assumed this was the NC thing again and it didn't bother me at all this time) and now he's come back to me, literally begging me to call him... pushing me to make the initiative and sometimes even calling me multiple times even though I cut the call. 

My question is, why not do I feel repulsed by this behaviour? He seems to be putting all this effort, that a year back I would've enjoyed but not now. Now he kind of disgusts me... Why?",13Aug2017,2

 Once I went to him for advice telling him something negative and it seem like he almost wanted to take advantage of me because somebody did something negative to me. Well texting I felt at some point he was potentially not good so I stop texting him

 Recently I went to him for some advice on a spiritual thing I was going through with somebody who did some type of spell on me.  He calls himself a life coach but in this case I'll he did was act weird and rude about it and tell me that I invited it.  He was acting a bit strange and I left his party 

 When I got home later because I'm perceptive I could sense that he began doing the same thing to me and what he was doing to me was very strong and terrible.  He began doing the stuff that I was complaining about and all of it together was so painful I can barely walk.   It's still 12 PM and I haven't gone to bed yet because it was so bad. I wrote him a bunch of text messages asking him to stop and then he wrote me around 11 something and the way he wrote of course he was the one who did it.  Also because I was texting him constantly he's the one who is doing it I don't need proof.  I've known him nine months and have never been through this before with him.  What he did was I told him something bad that happened to me and rather than help me he decided to do the exact same thing to me and make me suffer even more.  I was really scared and I didn't know what to do for now I begin texting him trying to negotiate and slowly I started feeling better. He did it for power control.  Basically I assume he's a sociopath and predator who if you go to him and tell him something bad he will take advantage of you. What kind of sick freak is this. ",13Aug2017,0

My brother at the time was living at home with my parents cause he lost his job the past due to, you guessed it, the bipolar. He was at the time stop drinking, and acting fine so my grand thinking was since I was, at the time enjoying his company, to invite him to be the third housemate. Biggest mistake I have ever made.

164,"So I don't know if I'm in the right place to ask advice or even if advice is what I need.. My gf of 4 years recently broke up with me, I'm heartbroken. For the last 4 years I've been gradually feeling more and more home with her and the people around her. After 3 years of feeling out of place I finally started to feel like her home was OUR home.
Then she ended it.
To give some backstory, I fell for her about FIVE years ago, we met at a party and hit it off, only problem was she was with another guy, a relationship of 11 years that had lost it's spark.
Say what you want, I know I'm an asshole for wanting her but cliché as it is, the heart wants what the heart wants. I would have never gone after her if the guy wasn't an absolute douchbag when we met.

The next year I spent talking, flirting, making out with her. All the while waiting for her to end it, she said she would and that she loved me, however, it would take a full year of sneaking in what little time (and little it was) I could get with her while I waited and waited and waited.
A year of waiting for her to finally decide that I was more important, that our love was more important destroyed my self esteem, constantly wondering what about me wasn't good enough that she would do it already. Mind you that I've always had self esteem issues due to an abusive father but at the start of the wait I was the most confident I had ever been in my life.

Through the four years with her, she always insisted on trying to stay friends with him, something I hated but wanting to be the good bf that I was, I tolerated it. I have no reason to believe she did anything with him. 

Now that she broke up with me and I have moved out, she is hanging out with him a lot more. I don't believe she is doing anything with him now either but I'm afraid it won't be long.
I can't stop feeling like her leaving me to go back to him means that I wasn't good, that I am not worth being loved.
I've come to realize that the reason I feel so much hate for him is because to this day I feel inferior to him. More so, I fear that to everyone in my life, my presence is nothing. That I am easily replaced and that that is exactly what she's doing.

My electronics that we relied on that I took with me, replaced with borrowed from his, before we broke up I bought her a new SSD for her computer, which today HE installed and setup for her. This annoys me extra much because she has ample opportunity for some else to do it, but even though she said she is't replacing me with him, she continues to do these kind of things knowing that it hurts me so much (she insisted on staying friends with me too, which I would like).

166,"Hey guys. So for the past 5 years or so, I've struggled with a lot of mental issues. It started off as anxiety, depression, and eating disorder all in one. I've stopped having anxiety and depression, but the eating disorder is still somewhat here. I used to restrict, but now I binge more. The depression is gone, but it made me used to being isolated so now I deal with all my problems in my head. I've never been one to deal with problems by talking to other people. 

My main struggle right now is with eating and isolation. I keep on going back and forth between the two ideas: to eat or not to eat?, and to numb myself with internet or be bored?. It's a constant war. My mind keeps telling me the pros/cons to each side. I keep giving in, I can never set any goals. My head hurts from trying so much. I often just want to restart my day to get better results, but I can't. I just want to be free of the struggles and live life like a normal person without the war in my head. I'm constantly thinking about food (mainly junk food) and artificial stimulation of my mind (mainly internet). And when I say war, I don't mean that I'm driving myself crazy, because I'm not, but what I mean by war is that I keep going back and forth between ideas trying to choose the best one so much that it makes my tired and my head wants the headache to go away.

I'm constantly trying to improve, and I keep thinking that some day, I will probably be free of this war but I've been telling myself that for years and nothing has changed.

I've gotten professional help, from multiple people, and even family, but they can't help me. I don't really have a mental illness so they can't give me pills to temporarily fix a problem. Simply talking with them doesn't help either. So I'm stuck with giving myself advice, that's going nowhere. Please don't tell me to keep trying to find ""the right professional help"" because 1) I don't have the money anymore and 2) I doubt they can help me anyways.

**TLDR:** I battle between the two thoughts of ""should I eat or not eat"" (food is always on my mind) and ""should I numb with internet myself because I have nothing else to do"". Professional help doesn't help.",13Aug2017,1

168,"I'm an young adult whose spent his entire life in Southeast Kansas, in a small town called Independence. I'm twenty one years old, graduated high school, and Votech with a certificate in machining, with some college under my belt. 

I'm sick and tired of Kansas, I believe I belong somewhere else. Somewhere that's not so flat and hot during the summers, I'd like to move to a place where there's all sorts of activities. Such as hiking, fishing, canoeing, paintball, etc. I love outdoor activities and SEK doesn't have much to offer. I often play video games or go on a bike ride around a town where I know every street.

Some problems I'm facing is I don't have the slightest clue of how I would move away. First I think I'd need to find a job in the town or city I'd be moving to, preferably a machinist as that is my trade and they make decent money. But I don't now what states, cities, or towns outside of Kansas have a good industry.

I've thought about Colorado, Oregon, and Missouri, but its uncharted territory to me. I don't know what any other state in the U.S. has to offer. I'd greatly appreciate it if you would tell me about your state, city or town and why you think it may be a good idea for someone like me to move there.

I live in a usual city in Germany.
Last week I heard a woman in my neighbourhood scream very loudly at 3 A.M. and thought it was a murderer or something.
Then two days ago I heard neighbours downstairs arguing very loudly, you could hear it very clearly. That was at about 2 A.M.
Now, a few months ago there was a 19-year-old murderer who killed a 9-year-old boy and just got away.
And that made me think: There could be anyone, ANYONE, coming into my home and killing me. I could be dead in the middle  of the night.

I need to get this out, and I refuse to talk to anyone about it because I hate opening up to others so any help would be fantastic.

About a year and a half ago I met a girl, we'll call her ""Peach"". I got to hang out with Peach for a week while we spent our reading week vacationing in Cuba. She showed me this whole different side to life as I know it and was the reason I spent my summer last year backpacking through Europe. 

But when I arrived home from my adventures, all my problems I had left behind immediately resurfaced and I found myself searching for every last bit of weed I had left to keep myself incapacitated, to escape all of these faults. 

I had the opportunity to go see Peach last week before she moved away for good, and I didn't.

Now here I am drowning my sorrows in weed again, every waking moment trying to forget the fact that I should be with her and not here alone.

I talked to a GI doctor and he told me that I probably have celiac disease (gluten intolerance) and (EoE) which is a newer esophagus disease and is a minor allergy. Basically, your esophagus is allergic to the food you eat in a way. I have other real food allergies that aren't related to the esophagus issue and I'm really freaked out when eating because I'm always afraid I'm going to have an allergic reaction (this has been going on for 6 years now) I got tested so I know my food allergies but I still have severe anxiety around food so I tend to worry a lot around eating. I developed an eating disorder called Selective Eating and I'm on a very restricted diet. I don't like trying new foods because fear of allergic reaction even though I've been proven otherwise. 

Anyways, I thought all this getting sick after eating was my body telling me I was allergic to it. Essentially I am allergic but it's my esophagus and it's not deadly. So, since everyone thinks I have (EoE) and/or celiac disease I have to get diagnosed right? Yup. I do. That means I need to get an upper endoscopy. In order to do that I need to be put under.

Meaning it is just me and my mum staying at home currently. After the night out I got home at around 1:30am, I believe. I came in moderately quiet, but not ninja quiet. I walk down the stairs to see my mum's room is closed and locked (rare to happen). Music is being played, however it is no where near loud enough to drown out the sound of them HAVING SEX.

My heart was pounding and I just didn't know what to do. I lost it when I heard him say ""no I want you to cum"". I felt so disgusted. I immediately banged on the door asking who is that she's with. She was just giving dumb replies like, she's just watching a movie, music, etc. My mum's room is connected to the garden and after about 1 min of me shouting and even cracking the door, I. realised that the man probably was leaving through the garden so I ran to my room which had a window to the garden. I saw the back of a man in my garden. I immediately jumped out (I've never jumped over something so athletically before) and approached the man saying ""who are you"".

197,"I (30F) just got out of a pretty intense relationship and have been cycling through feelings of happiness/independence and sadness/loneliness. For the record, I've also struggled with my drinking habits for a long time now. I guess that provides the basis for what happened at the wedding.

It was my cousin's wedding, and there was an open bar. I was hitting it off with this guy seated at my table (we were the only two singles seated at the table and around the same age). By the time the dancing started, I was already pretty wasted, so I asked him to dance and at some point during the night, the sparks were flying (though I was also hammered) and we started making out on the dance floor. This was a wedding of ~100 people, and this particular side of my family is largely conservative and Christian. (I am neither, not that it really matters.) Honestly, I'm not positive, but I have a feeling I was the drunkest person there and I know my whole family (cousin, her new husband, my dad, and my aunt and uncle) saw me dancing like a madwoman and making out with this guy who I had CLEARLY just met. (I didn't know anyone else at the wedding besides family and I think that's another part of why I was so intent on getting hammered and making a ""friend."")

Anyway, I'm 30, which makes this behavior really sad and pathetic. I felt like a complete ass the next day, but my entire family was acting normal, so I didn't mention anything, hoping that maybe I was more discreet and that everyone was wasted. As the day went on, however, and my cousin made a couple comments to me about the guy I had been making out with, I realized that in no way was I being discreet. I apologized to my cousin, my dad, and my aunt. Everyone was so, so sweet about it and insisted that I shouldn't worry about anything. Even so, I've been stressing about it for this whole week and wondering if I should apologize further, maybe send flowers and a card to the bride and groom, as well as my aunt and uncle, who housed me during the weekend?

201,"Good friend is getting married in Mexico next week. I'm a groomsman. I'm flying out Wednesday to the resort. Some of his family is in my area so we're all on the same flight.

My friend asked a week ago, and I agreed, to let his aunt catch an uber with me to the airport. 

When I started coordinating with the aunt via text, she said ""let's leave early so we can get coffee at the airport and not be rushed."" I responded with ""I'm planning to leave at 5:30 which should be plenty of time."" (Flight is at 8:40, airport is 1 hour away). She responded that sounded good. I thought the issue was resolved at this point.

Then, yesterday, friend calls me and says his aunt was concerned and wanted him to talk to me. Couldn't I leave earlier, like 4:30? I said no, I don't want to get up that early, and 5:30 is plenty of leeway. At this point I'm getting annoyed since I agreed to help and my friend and his family are being a pain. It's not my job to get his family to airport and change my plans for them and I feel a little taken advantage of.

The solution my friend proposed was to use some points he has on credit card to book us hotel room near airport the night before so we aren't rushed. I said fine, if you want to do that, I'm cool with it. To clarify I asked whether he had enough points for 2 rooms. He told me he was getting one room with 2 queens for me and his aunt to share.

I made clear I was not comfortable sharing a room with his aunt, whom I barely know. It just sounds super weird and creepy to me (I didn't say it in those words) to share a hotel room with some woman who's a stranger to me.

His aunt chimed in (she was there when he called me!) and said she could stay with his parents in their nearby hotel at the airport instead. I said cool.

But in the ensuing back and forth with my friend, he said I am being ""objectively weird"" about the situation. From my POV it's completely unreasonable to put people of the opposite sex in a hotel room together when they're not family and don't know each other. Pretty common sense. I'm actually kinda flabbergasted.

And I feel the whole situation stems from the assumption that I'm somehow responsible for getting his aunt to airport. I originally agreed to let her tag along as a favor, but my friend and the aunt have been pushing me to change my entire plans to accommodate their whims.

What do you think? Am I wrong, or is my friend?

As some further backstory, several weeks back my friend was trying to get me to put the bride's cousin in my hotel room at the resort - after I already spent thousands of dollars and took a week off work. Sorry, I don't want to spend my hard-earned vacation with some random dude I don't know. It feels like a pattern of pushiness and bait-and-switch. It was another case of me being responsible for cleaning up the lack of planning.",13Aug2017,5
202,"My 18 year old nephew took his life about a week ago. The funeral is tomorrow and I am a speaker. I am trying so hard not to carry so much anger, but truth is as much as I break down in agony, I also feel that much anger or more.

203,"He has never physically hurt a child. When I was 15 and he had was 18, he used to pressure me into having sex but I eventually made it extremely clear he was being a horrible person for that and he realized that I was right, felt awful, and stopped. He has also watched child porn a few times but he has also stopped doing that for over a year now because I also made it clear it was horribly illegal and immoral and he also just felt so much guilt for it. 

He used to look at kids and get a boner, he claims that it doesn't happen anymore and he lost his attraction. However I know he is still attracted to the thought of childlike stuff and innocence because we do ddlg role play. And I totally don't believe he's not attracted to random children on the street. I'm really trying to just accept that it is who he is. I look at older men and women a lot with googly eyes and if I had a penis I'm sure I would accidently get a boner, so I can't be jealous or anything? But I can't help being jealous and obviously extremely disgusted thinking about it. It wasn't that long ago that he told me the last time he got a boner when he saw a kid in a store bending over. I freaked out when he told me and cried a lot and i would imagine he wouldn't tell me it happened again after that if it did. 

I just need help getting over this and forgetting he likes kids. I want to have children with him someday because I truly don't believe he would hurt a child of ours. But the thought is still there, what if he does? I'm terrified. Is he just not right for me? All of my friends dislike him and his old friends who are now my friends don't like him anymore because he sexually harassed one of my best friends when we were broken up. God just fucking saying that pisses me off and I just remembered I'm not even over that either. But whenever I express to him that I am upset about those past situations he gets upset at me and tells me I need to get over it already. I just don't know what to do and I'm losing friends because of him. I love him so much though. ",13Aug2017,2

206,"I was walking into my local supermarket this evening and there were a group of young boys (I'd say around 12-14) sitting on their bikes and loudly shouting at anyone who walked by.

I just walked through them and ignored whatever the hell they yelled at me, but then something made me stop. Right as I got past them, I heard one of them loudly shout something along the lines of ""we have to deal with that <N word>"" or ""we have to put up with that <N word>"" or something similar.

I then entered the supermarket and the security guard was a young black man who looked really troubled by something. Putting two and two together, I asked him if he was OK. He looked in the direction of the boys on bikes outside and then smiled a little sadly at me and said ""yeah, I'm fine.""

I felt I had a pretty good understanding of what was happening then and to be honest, it made me pretty damn angry. So I left the supermarket, walked past the boys again as they shouted more bullshit at me and went straight to the town police station.

I told the police officer on duty exactly what I've written here and said ""look, I know you guys are busy but I think if you and one or two of your colleagues went down to the supermarket together, you'd give them the scare they need.""

She agreed with me, thanked me for reporting the incident and, as I was leaving the station, she was putting on her coat and asking a fellow police officer to accompany her to the supermarket.

As I was walking home though, I couldn't help but feel doubtful of my decision. I know they're only kids but no one should think it's acceptable to treat another human being that way, so didn't I do the right thing by going to the police? They're too young to get criminal records from it anyway.

Also, none of them saw me walk towards the police station so there's no possible way they could know it was me, right? The police officer would just say *someone* told her about what they were doing?

Sorry guys - I'm a worrier! Hahaha",13Aug2017,11

211,"Hello, I've never really spoken about this sort of thing openly, but it's stressing my out a bit recently so I'd like some advice from some real people, so thank you in advance for reading.

When I was 14 I had something very unkind done to me by a youth worker, I've gone through court, it was a horrible experience but I won. My mum was told but my dad still doesn't all these years later, the issue is that due to what happened I get very uncomfortable going outside and being around other people and have symptoms of developing PTSD, due to this I've lost 95% of my friends and I'm unable to work currently (However I'm on a 9 month psychotherapy course that I'm optimistic about).

My dad thinks I'm a lazy failure. I see him every week and he grills me about it and all I can do is agree with him, it's been so long since it happened that it doesn't feel right telling him, he's a very unhappy person as well and constantly talks about how depressed and suicidal he is, he also thinks that I would tell him if anything like this happened to me straight away, I feel like telling him would make him feel like a failure and would push him over the edge, he seems close.

The other thing is that once while drunk together I hinted that something happened to me once, he said that he didn't really want to know because he didn't know how he'd react. 

I'm not sure what to do, should I risk telling him? Or keep up this false presentation of myself which is further making my dad disappointed in me, I don't want him to die one day thinking that of me that way. It feels like I'm doing the wrong thing by trying to do the right thing for him? Gah I don't know. I'm stuck.. What would you all suggest? ",13Aug2017,2

216,"A couple years ago I rented out my house and moved in with my mom so I could go back to school. At that point I had already taken over doing her bills for her, because each month it was becoming a greater and greater ordeal helping her struggle through how to do them herself. At that point I put it down to her not being very technically minded, although she had been managing up to that point since my parents separated a few years before. (Before that, my dad did all the bills.) But, living with her day-to-day, it became clear that there was more going on. She started asking the same questions over and over again during conversations and had trouble following the plot-line on TV shows. At Christmas other family members noticed and mentioned it to me. My uncle even pointed it out to her (undoubtedly in his usual blunt, ham-handed way) and she told him to get out of her house.

Things started getting steadily worse, with her occasionally getting me mixed up with both my dad and her sister, getting details of family lore turned around, etc. A few months ago she came to me all upset about an event that simply could not have happened in the manner or timeframe she said it happened in. It would have involved a twelve-hour road trip within the ten hours or so since I had last seen her, for one thing. When I pointed this out she became incredibly angry. She spent the next three days telling me she hated me, that she would never forgive me, that I was stupid and arrogant and selfish. In desperation I went down to the local hospital, hoping they had some suggestions for what I could do to help her, when she refused to see that there was a problem. They had me leave a note for her doctor letting her know what had been going on, since my mom was scheduled for an annual physical in a couple weeks anyway. In the mean time I buckled, apologized to my mother, and pretended to believe her. I don't know if that was the right thing to do or not, but I couldn't take the abuse any longer.

At her appointment her doctor ran some cognitive tests and suggested she be evaluated by a neurologist. Unfortunately, the neurologist was booked two months out, but she did, at least, make the appointment. Over the next few weeks she seemed to be coming to terms with her memory issues. She was upset, of course—angry and scared, but seemed to be accepting that there might be a problem. But then, about two weeks before her appointment, she suddenly decided she didn't need to see the neurologist and canceled the appointment. When I tried to convince her that it wouldn't hurt to be checked out, and argued that early treatment could make all the difference, she more or less accused me of gas-lighting her.

So, for the last few months she's been in denial, and I've been avoiding confrontation by ignoring her increasingly frequent false ""memories"". But this morning she came to me wanting help renting out a house she hasn't owned in fifteen years. That's not something I can do, obviously, and I had to tell her as much. She insisted that she did, and that somehow the proof lies in a pair of rocking chairs. How does one even argue with that? I ended up crying and telling her how worried I've been about her, how, if she doesn't do something about her memory issues, it's just going to keep getting worse. But she's back to being angry and abusive, and now she wants me to move out.

The stress is killing me. For background, I am on the outer edges of the autistic spectrum and have no friends to support me. I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a little kid, but had been doing well recently. Now, for the first time in years, I find myself having suicidal thoughts again. (Don't worry. I'm too much of a coward to go through with it.) I know I'm living in a toxic environment, and part of me wants to honor her wishes and move out. But, I also know that she relies on me. She no longer remembers how to cook. She can drive, but she can't remember how to get anywhere outside the small town we live in (and recently has started getting lost even here.) I'm the only person she has. My parents have been separated for years, I have no siblings, and what little other family I have lives in another state. I don't know what to do. I want to help her, but I can't live this way, being told repeatedly every day what a worthless disappointment I am. 

**TLDR: Mom is delusional and becomes verbally abusive if her delusions are challenged. I have no support system, my anxiety is through the roof, and I go to bed every night praying not to wake in the morning.**

At what point am I justified to pack it in and walk away? Am I doomed to spend the next fifteen or twenty years of my life in a living hell, with no life of my own, watching my mother slowly be replaced by a difficult old woman wearing her skin? If so, how do I cope with the stress? Are there any other options out there for me?",13Aug2017,4

219,"This will be long, so I apologize in advance...

I (F, 20) work at a grocery store and one of my coworkers (M, 32) started working there about a year ago and seemed like a sweet, carefree guy who was always laughing. Let's call him John. 

In November, John told me that he is so stressed out about work. We have each other's phone numbers from a list we got at work so he asked if we could text some time. I said, ""of course!"" I thought it might be beneficial for me to complain and vent a little about work with someone who understands. 

Then, the problem began. John was texting me nonstop about EVERYTHING he hates in life. He said that he went to a chiropractor to get his back fixed just because the guy who is the doctor is cute. Now he just talks about wasting his money and how the doctor messed up his back forever. He constantly talks about how much he hates our coworkers (who I happen to like), how he doesn't want to quit full time and move to part time because it wouldn't be enough money, etc. He also lives with his parents and wants to move out, so he wants to work , but when we work together all he does it complain about the store.

I understand that retail sucks... but he will complain about the products, customers  and store to me and our bosses have walked by and told him to stop MULTIPLE times and now it looks as though I am involved with him! I don't want my bosses to think I am agreeing with everything he blabs about (I have mentioned this to one of my bosses before, by the way.) 

John goes to a therapist and after every session he texts me and says ""I am not going to take my medication and I am not going to do what my therapist tells me. I hate his recommendations. He says I talk about myself too much and that I should listen to what others have to say."" This surprised me. I figured out that he is taking medications for something and I couldn't help but agree with his therapist, to be honest... 

At first, I was very selfless. From November up until about June I always texted him back quickly, never talked about myself (he never really lets me anyway), and just overall was supportive. Recently, though, I haven't been responding as much. Here are some examples of our recent conversations:

-The other day I complained about work hurting my legs after a 9 hour shift. John said, ""I work full time and twice as much as you so I, of all people, don't wanna hear it.""

-John said he wants to switch to part time but doesn't want to lose his insurance coverage. I told him self-care is more important and he agreed he would switch. A week later, he is complaining to me about the same thing. This has happened multiple times, and I feel like this conversation is stuck in a loop.

-I didn't read a text from John for a day. John then sent me, ""Am I bothering you? You don't seem to talk to me often anymore. I guess you're not excited to talk to me"" and stuff like that and that was when I kind of lost it.

Normally I would block an annoying person but he is a coworker I see several times a week and also someone who is taking medication and may be in a vulnerable state, so I want to go about this carefully. I feel that he is taking advantage of me and his constant texts have recently been driving me wild. When I don't respond, John reminds me that he has no friends and that his mother won't help him, etc etc so I feel like I have to be the one to help even though I wouldn't even consider him a friend at all.

I'm going crazy... What should I do???

225,"Im going to break down this post into a few parts so it makes more sense.

**My disability:**

I have severe stomach problems. Violent cramps and neasua. Its also accompanied by sever amounts of fatigue.  The pain is random and because of that its impossible for me to make ANY sort of commitment to be somewhere. I can't work because I can't hold a scheduled, I can't show up at the right time , because I have no idea if I'll be sick then or not. 

Im also having issues with my hands. I hurts to type and to use the computer for any meaningful amount of time (though Ive found ways to work around my issues and extend the amount of time I can work on the computer its a big problem). Im having surgery on my hand in 2 weeks, if it helps then Im to scheduled another for my other hand. 

Im becoming convinced that a large part of my fatigue is due to the stress of living with my mother. Im always tired, every second of every day, from the way she acts (i'll get to that in a minute) and the stress of living with it. Any time I get away from her, she is out of town, Im out of town, whatever, my life improves dramatically. Its like a weight is lifted off my shoulder and I can finally start to HEAL, but then she comes a back and the weight returns and its like I'm back to being exhausted 24/7.

When I was 18 I had surgery and then had to move into the dorms for college. It was, objectively, the hardest period of my life so far. I had complications and was in extreme pain every single day, It caused me so many issues that without realizing it I stopped eating. I lost over 100lb in about a month or 2. 60 of that came off in 2 WEEKS. If I hadn't been fat I doubt I would have survived. While all this was happening I was going to all my college classes, getting use to college life, trying to socialize (which I suck at) AND working 20-27 hours in retail. Objectively this was the hardest and most stress filled point in my life. But whenever I think of that time all I can think of is how GOOD it was, because I was out of my parents house. I had energy, I had my shit to take care of but no one elses, and I was MUCH MUCH MUCH less stressed. Take a moment to let that sink in.  I was literally STARVING TO DEATH and it was less stressful than living with my mother. 

**My Mother:**

My Mother is completely toxic. I don't even know where to start, because nothing she does in and off itself is something you would look at and go ""yep, thats fucked up"". She has a background (masters degree) in counseling. Basically she knows everything she is  ""suppose"" to say/do. She is obsessed with being a ""good mother"". Everything she does is about building up her ego in that regard. She is always cooking for us, or trying to do SOMETHING that is for the benefit of others. Except its not. Its generally stuff no one ask for, no one wants, and that she holds over our heads when we don't fall in line like she wanted. At one point I needed he to drive me to some doctor appointments and we had a fight prior, during which I didn't yell, but she yelled at me telling me to stop yelling, and then when I pointed it out ask me if I wanted to walk to my doctors appointment (not possible it was to far away). the second she walks into a room she starts either A) monologing B) critiqing something about me C) giving me a list of things she wants me to do  D)Or doing SOMETHING for attention. Its like, every moment your in a room with her she is screaming for attention/validation. Its extinguishing, she doesn't have a genuine bone in her body, everything about her, how she acts, what she says, its all fake. Its all whatever she feels will get her approval in that moment. 

When she wants something done she always ""ask"" us to do it, except its never really a question, its a command if you don't do it you get shit on. Or she says ""I would like"" as if Its somehow my responsibility to give her anything she wants. hell she acts like its a PRIVILEGE to help her, as if she is doing ME a favor by asking me to help her. 

If you complain, the problem is you. If I get frustrated because she is trying to micromanage every little fucking detail of my life (I do not need to be told how to wash dishes, or how to put on my fucking clothes) then Im told that Im the problem I'm to sensitive, I'm over reacting, she is just being "" a mother"" and she ""loves"" me. she doesn't love anyone, I'm not even sure she is capable of love. To her love is a weapon, its something she uses as leverage to get what she wants out of  you. She is always a victim, always ""feels bad and needs help with xyz today"". she is not helpless, she is a grown woman, despite the fact she has the emotional maturity of a 6 year old. On top of everything Ive somehow become the scape goat for every fucking problem in my house. Not enough towels washed? Must be in my room. Dirty dishes? must be mine. Its like I have a constant microscope aimed at me 24/7 looking for any problems at all. 

And anytime I do anything that seems to line up with what she wants, then she thinks its because I'm doing it FOR her. Like If I wash my plate after eating (which I normally do) and she sees it she thanks me for washing my dish for her. No, I didn't do it for her, my decision making process does not involve her, I don't do anything ""for"" her, the closest to doing anything ""for"" her is doing it to get her off my back.

The ONLY thing worse than her nagging and attention whoring, is her praise. At BEST its patronizing and most of the time its all about her. Its like she takes credit for anything Im a part of that goes well. I was in choir in college and after a performance she would beam and it always bugged/embarrassed me. She couldn't just say ""good job"". Looking back, she was just trying to steal the success. She wanted to take credit for anything I did because she was my mother.

She doesn't care if she hurts others or makes them miserable, so long as she gets what she wants. 

Well she can fuck right off, i would be THRILLED if I never had to see her again in my life and if I ever get financially independent you better be damned sure thats EXACTLY whats happening. 

**My education:**

I went to college for music, not the smartest choice in retrospect. Regardless between all my health issues getting worse and worse I ended up dropping out my senior year (though I had at least 2 more years to go). 

Over the past 3 years Ive done some online courses and that sort of thing in the realm of audio engineering. Its really where I ""click"". I love it, more than that I have an aptitude for it. My work is good, I really want to make a living doing it and have put as much focus/energy into making that a reality as I can. But the big problem I have(other than my hand issues) is networking. I have shit social skills. In college I worked really hard to get better, and I did, but I never really got good at developing relationships, much less creating deep friendships. It doesn't matter if my work is good, Im good to work with, and produce quick results while retaining great quality. That doesn't matter if I can't network to meet clients in a mostly word of mouth industry. I certainly can't build up a client list while Im so low on energy because of dealing with my moms shit. (I really can't express how much its destroying my life)

**My life now (and for the last 3 years)**

I wake up whenever I get up, I make my own scheduled, I do whatever I want all day, and thats basically it. Sounds great, but its a shitty life. I live in pain because of my health issues. I live in pain because of putting up with my mom. I only have one friend i know in real life.  Ive never had a girlfriend, only been on a date or 2  and have only been kissed once. I'm not actually sure what a healthy relationship looks like if I'm being honest. 

generally I get up, eat, take medicine, shower, workout, practice mixing(audio production) until around 4 or 5pm. then play video games until I go to bed. Then repeat the next day. Thats it, thats my everyday outside of minor variations. Course that doesn't take into account my mother nagging me to death about any and everything all day or the days when Im so sick I can barely get out of a chair.

I'm trying to get on disability so I can move out but its slow. I started the process in january I think (give or take a month). Im waiting to hear back (they called a month or 2 ago needing more info which I provided).

Even if I get it, i don't know if I can afford moving out. I can't get work with my health, and my food is expensive with all my stomach issues (have to avoid certain things so I don't get violently sick). If I push myself to much then the stomach stuff tends to eventually get super bad and I end up basically in a chair all day for a month or more. Im not helpless, I don't look ""sick"" but I do have very real limitations with my health. 

I just need out of this hell hole. I don't care how at this point. I need to escape before I snap and lose my sanity.

What should I do"" here I am making a measly 29k struggling to get by as an Office Admin and I try to pick myself up and tell myself I could be without a degree like the rest of my family and working customer service for the rest of my life.... I can't keep friends because I compare myself. I compare myself to my ex that graduated at 22 as an IT starting at 25$/hr. I compare myself to his life.... he's just so much happier without a care in the world financially. He has family to fall on if he fucks up. He's not my family anymore. My family casted me out. Constantly I beat myself up about my English degree. Even though I really enjoy English reading and writing. I wasn't smart enough for IT or much else. 

So how do I stop? How do I be happy with what little accomplishments I've made? How do I be happy and tell myself it just means I have more goals than others? ",13Aug2017,1

228,"  Basically, like half an hour ago my internet best friend and I decided to download a game and it took me about six minutes to download while her game took 45 minutes - an hour. 

I was getting everything ready in the game, played the tutorial, and I was getting pretty excited. I didn't really plan on playing this alone, so I decided to just wait for her. So finally the game downloads and we take like a long time trying to find the same server as each other in this big list of like, a thousand servers and I find it.  

I get on, wait like another five minutes for her to actually load in, and she tells me, ""Oh, I can't play it because I forgot to download  BattlEye.""  (which is required to play it)

So I look down in frustration.. silently taking big breaths in and out. 

And then she laughs, and doesn't really care and continues to look for yet another game on Steam. I say ""Look I don't want to download ANOTHER game."" I say with a fake laugh. She says ""I know it's just for the future."" So we sit there in silence for a few moments before I say ""You know what I'm just going to go watch youtube for a bit, bye!"" 

I tried so hard, probably more than I should have to, not to be rude or get all pissed. Because me and her both know I get pissed very easily. I know she hates it, and I hate it, but I seriously can't help it. Stuff like this happens too much.

Also, I'm super argumentative. 
She'll say something and I'll correct her. Or I'll tell her my opinion and why it's better and right. Every. Single. Time. And then I apologies and I say I can't help it. I really can't and I want to stop and I have been trying to hard but nothing is working! Help :(",13Aug2017,2

I often find myself playing it until all hours of the night. I've made so many friends off of there. I recently put in my 2 week notice for leaving my alliance and the game. I feel as if this game is taking up much of my life and I need to cut it out of my life altogether. As I said, I've made many friends and I've helped this alliance grow since day 2. Since I've announced my week notice for leaving, many of my friends and alliance members have came to me asking me to stay, more like begging. I talk to pretty much everyone in the state, and alot of people have said that if I leave, they will as well. I don't want to be the reason people leave an amazing game. I also don't want to be the reason the states dies because of so many members leaving. I'm torn.

231,"Hi everyone!

I am going to be applying to university soon for the fall of 2018 and am looking for advice on what to take..

Ideally I'd like to graduate and move straight into a job that pays well, has lots of benefits, easy work hours and the potential for lots of time off (obviously). 

I have been leaning towards a bachelor of commerce majoring in finance or accounting, maybe economics but I'm not sure which (if any) will give me the most options for my ideal career or be the most lucrative after graduation. 

Careers I have thought about after graduation are real estate appraisal, accounting, financial advisor, portfolio manager. What worries me is how difficult it will be to get into these fields or if I should be trying to get into them at all. I'm not sure if any of these would be what I'm looking for or if there is something completely different out there, I have to do some more research and I figured here would be a good place to start.

If anyone here has any personal experience with these degrees or jobs or has some advice about any other degrees and career paths that I may benefit from I'd really appreciate it and I'm sure my future self would as well.

Thanks!

- to read books/magazines because the language has amazing works in literature

I hope you guys can help, sorry if this is the wrong place.

Basically a few minutes ago my cat was in the garden trying to catch moths, but she swatted a dead wasp. I didn't even realise until she kept flicking her paw and licking it. 

She didn't seem to be hurt, but she ran off and I'm a little bit worried after reading that if a cat gets stung on the tongue, it can swell up and kill them. She was licking at it, maybe she will eat the wasp after or get stung as it comes out?

244,"Hey all, so I'll be leaving tomorrow to live in an apartment instead of a dorm for college. I'll going into my second year of college, along with three other roommates (one friend from last year, one friend from highschool, and a friend I've known since elementary school).

We've all been pretty excited to be able to live on our own. We all lived on campus last year, but decided to go to a nearby apartment complex since it was just about the same in costs, but with more comfort and freedom, with one of those freedoms being the ability to choose what to eat on a larger scale.

I'm not entirely new to cooking, though I would appreciate some tips and tricks I guess on what to do, what to avoid, etc in regards to cooking at college.

Some thing that I've looked into are meal prepping, cooking chicken often since it's cheaper, having a rice cooker, and having a Costco membership for easy cheap/bulk foods and stuff.

Also, this question has probably been asked before on this sub, so if anyone knows of any other like-minded threads from before, I'd also like to look at them to see if I can learn a thing or two.

Any other sort of advice for a 2nd year college student is appreciated as well. Thank you.",13Aug2017,2
245,"Long story short, to make rent cheap, one of our housemates has converted the living room into his bedroom. He has a 9-5 job. His gf doesn't. The fact he sleeps in the living room has rarely been an issue, as he's usually up for work before I come down so I'm never tiptoeing around him. 

His gf stays the night a few nights a week and will sleep in until midday, and maybe only leave the house around 3/4 PM. Again, fine because I'm usually at work. It's only annoying on weekends when I want to chill out in my own space, meal prep, watch TV etc and can't because she's sleeping. 

I took the day off work today so I could have a relaxing birthday by myself after months of stress. I planned it out; coffee, cooking bacon and eggs whilst playing some tunes, then settling in to watch TV. I won't be able to do any of that now since she's still fast asleep downstairs and it's 9AM. Knowing her, she won't be out the house until mid arvo unless I actually wake her up and kick her out and I know I can't do that, but I'm just so fucking annoyed.

I am 28 years old still living at home as I moved out twice before and it didn't really work out (rent for one bedroom was 1700 with friend then another time I went to Vegas to live with a friend but I just felt like a guest in his house with all his animals and furniture). 

 

I am now thinking if trying to live in Vegas again because it is so close to my Cali friends and family and it is super cheap compared to here. This time I will be getting a apartment of my own with my girlfriend who currently can't stand her job here and hates every single second of every single day. We are planning on just signing a 6 month lease so if we can't stand it there we can move back to Cali and not be stuck for a whole year.

Given the stressful, alien-like environment at the school (I have no interest in religion), I am changing schools for my junior and senior year. The private school that I am at right now just recently made over 100 students in the high school. The school that I want to go to has a very great academic department, and all-around it is a very, very decent school. However, there are almost 2,000 students enrolled in the high school. 
     I am terrified. I know that this year will be stressful because I will  be spending it at a school that I dislike greatly, but I am nervous, still, about the year ahead of this. I have one friend with me that I enjoy being around, and he will go with me to the school. However, I am still terrified about being at such a large school. Of course there is only a slim chance that I will actually get classes with my one and only bud. I am nervous about being around a group of people who know most of each other and I know barely any of them. I also have depression and anxiety issues, and that doesn't help.

I think all his actions in life are resembling an undiagnosed bipolar disorder and possibly anti-social behavior. He s my godfather, and a short haul trucker with his own ranch.
