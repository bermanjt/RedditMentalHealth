0,"There's a girl, she's a friend of friends. I've known her for just over a year but we've rarely had proper conversations, not for any particular reason though. I know that she's finds me attractive and I do too. I want to ask her out on a date but I don't know when I'd next be able to see her because I only ever really see her at parties or if my group of friends decide to meet.
I think I could message her but I'm not sure how I would go about doing that. I am kind of a shy person.",31Dec2017,1
1,"So I haven't seen my friend in over 7 years since graduating college. I live in LA and he was staying nearby in Anaheim at a yoga retreat visiting from Florida. 

He wanted to go to a Lakers game this last week but for some reason I was hesitant. I know he doesn't have it together and isn't a responsible adult so I had my doubts. Hasn't been working and no source of income.

He was supposed to borrow a car but wasn't sure, he wanted me to buy his ticket in advance, didn't want to pay for parking or stadium food, never been to LA, and it was like 2 1/2 hours before the game. I was like man, I'm not dealing with this. I know I'll get there but you are on your own.

So I convinced him not to go saying it's too expensive and that you don't know the area. I still went but I didn't tell him so. 

He found out the next day that I still went and was all butt hurt about it. He called me a liar and said that I really didn't want to go with him which was far from the truth. 

I just think seeing a friend you haven't seen in years at a sporting event isn't the best place to bond or talk to especially last minute. Sometimes you just have to look out for yourself.",31Dec2017,1
2,"Ok so I’m about to move to Canada (my home country) but I’m currently in Texas and I love it here. My ‘best guy friend’ I’ll call him Andrew he became distant lately and that was weird cause we told each other everything and stuff and I had a little crush on him but I’d never wanna date him and I find out my friend cat and her friend (not my friend her friend) Mary told Andrew I like him he doesn’t like me (don’t really care never wanted more than a friendship) and Mary told Andrew the best way to deal with this was to stop talking to me. I force cat to tell me what happened and then i talk to Andrew saying how that’s not cool and all I ever wanted was to be friends and he acted like he didn’t know what was happening then we talked all night trying to sort this out and he PROMISED he wouldn’t tell Mary I knew what she told him but I wake up the next morning and Andrew told Mary and now Mary is really mad at cat and cat is crushed. I text Mary and tell her it was all my fault but she doesn’t budge and Mary also says I better not talk to Andrew about this and I’m kinda scared. 

What do I do? Do I stay friends with andrew for my last month and a half in Texas even though he broke a promise? Do I tell Andrew and talk to him about how I felt when he told Mary? Do I forget about both Mary and Andrew and hang out with people who don’t lie to me? 

I thought Andrew and I’s friendship was worth trying to save and idk rn. 

Please help, if you need more information to help I can do that I just idk what to do and I’m freaking out.",31Dec2017,2
3,"20 y/o m, been struggling with weight loss for around 2-3 years now, but i just can't seem to kick my old habits. any time i'm feeling down, which is most of the time, i turn to food for emotional comfort. i have a pretty sad/ boring life so there's very few things that bring me happiness throughout my day.  

i pretty much watch tv, play video games, and scroll through social media all day until i go to bed. my dad's recovering from surgery so i'm putting off applying for a job until he's recovered. even then, when i do have a stable job that doesn't help.  

i have literally 0 friends, and spend everyday inside doing nothing. doesn't help that i'm battling depression and social anxiety so it's kind of a recipe for failure. how do i stop binge/ overeating if it's the only thing that makes me happy?",31Dec2017,1
4,"As the title said, I have no friends and no hobbies apart from gaming. The problem is that as time goes on gaming is becoming less interesting and I find myself bored for a couple extra minutes every day and I find myself much happier when I get an opportunity to go out and actually do something. The only problem is I have literally nothing else to do with my time other than stare at the television. What do non-gamers do all day? What am I supposed to do with all of my extra time?",31Dec2017,37
5,"After nearly 20 years together, my wife and I separated back in October. We have basically been just friends for many years of our marriage, and with her new-found religiosity, she is looking for things in a partner that I (an atheist) simply can't provide. I have been living in my mother's house while she winters in Arizona, and my wife is living in the apartment we've had for the past 10 years. Mom will be back at the beginning of April, and I need to be out by then.


Throughout our time together, she has had mental issues, diagnosed as Panic-Anxiety disorder and PTSD from various traumas. This has meant that she has been on Social Seciruty Disability for the past ~18 years. I have had several jobs over the past 20 years, mostly in retail, and have settled at a Store Manager position for a smaller store, currently bringing home $1,014 every 2 weeks (this is net, after all taxes and insurance). For the entirety of our marriage, I have been the only ""breadwinner"", with her SSD checks paying for rent and insurance. We live in NH, where divorce is (as I hear it) relatively easy, but we are unsure how it would all work out. The biggest concern is health insurance -- she is currently on my plan through work.


With our separation, I have been giving her money out of each biweekly paycheck to cover bills. We may not be together anymore, but I still feel for her, and don't want her to suffer. But, in looking at the future, when I have to get a place of my own, I'm not going to be able to afford to keep giving her money, at least not nearly as much as I have been. I have no savings, don't own any property, and my quarterly bonuses from work aren't always reliable. Also, her family are useless, so she can't just move back home. My own family are supportive of both of us, but are not in a position to help in any meaningful way.


So, basically, I need advice on how to get both of our lives rebooted. How do I move on, while still making sure that she is able to manage?",31Dec2017,1
6,"I believe I know myself pretty well but I feel there is also deep chasms of darkness that lurk in my psyche. This shadow self pulls at me to be selfish and leave everyone and everything and never look back. I purposefully deprive myself of material and mental 'comforts', I push my patience and judgements beyond my own safety and I forgo my opinions for peace. I want balance of my dark and light but I don't foresee that happening anytime soon. Sometimes I love everyone and I feel One with all that is and sometimes I can literally taste the blood of the humans around me that most likely need to be 'put down'. I can go on and on but that would be redundant and I bet someone will get it with just the intro title. ",31Dec2017,0
7,"So, I am 19 and transferred back home into a community college as my first four-year college wasn't very unsatisfactory. But I don't really have that many friends to really hang out here.

8,"Hi

I have become a relatively successful and well known YouTube and social media figure among fans of my favorite soccer team.

I never intended to become any kind of internet celebrity when I started this but many would now refer to me as such. I have appeared on TV numerous times and met some of my idols thanks to this ""fame.""

And 99% of feedback I ever receive from people is positive. Many idolize ME, as crazy as it still seems. Kids ask for my autograph. Adults chant my name in the street. And generally people seem to just appreciate the good-hearted, well-meaning work I have put in to creating good content and building a successful YouTube channel.

But the 1% really get me down.

The 1% who hate me.

The 1% who take my own photos and try to use them to ridicule me, posting them with demeaning captions or edits.

The 1% who only follow me so that they can immediately ""like"" any negative response I receive.

The 1% who have conversations (usually behind my back until I am tagged by someone else) making fun of me.

I've tried to watch videos and read inspirational quotes on how to deal with these types of people. But it's not so easy in my case. They are internet trolls, but they are real life people who are from my city, follow my team and attend the same games as me each week. They are amongst the people I am surrounded with, and they are motivated to see me fail.

And as thick skinned as I'd like to think I am, and as much as they are outnumbered by those who are fans of my work, it really does affect me.

It makes me feel empty inside, logging onto social media again to see venom and hatred even on a day when our team has done really well and come from behind to win a match. A day when I am positive in everything I say and do.

I am positive in general - I'm a mild mannered person who sees the good in others, and I really struggle with things like this. I don't think I'm motivated to have people like me, but I certainly hate it when people hate me.

I don't want to reply to these people because I don't want to legitimize them. But at the same time their demeaning comments are making me feel like shit and I'd just like to ask them why they hate me.

I don't want to be seen to be complaining about them because the world of European soccer (especially the social media world of European soccer) is so heavily based on being ""macho"" and letting negative comments brush off you without a thought. So I let it get the best of me inside.

I should be better at dealing with this by now, but it feels like I never truly will be able to. I don't know why these people have such a vicious level of hatred/obsession with me, and it affects my whole day. It leaves me wanting to not engage with social media as much, to not put out as much content.

This is a rambling post, and I apologize. I'm just looking for someone who may be able to relate or may have the right perspective to help me get over this stuff quicker, to tell me something other than ""their hatred is them reflecting their own insecurities on you.""

Any help is sincerely appreciated.

tl;dr: I became famous in a specific world, and it really gets me down when people I've never met but who are part of that world hate on me in quite personal ways. I don't know how to deal with it and feel stupid for letting it affect me.",31Dec2017,1

13,"My main struggle in life is getting women interested. I'm a massive failure in that department. Nobody ever acts like they're attracted to me, and even when I do see it happening, which is incredibly rare, any interest on my part quickly leads her to put that to rest right away. (Fuck this miserable phase of my life, may it be over as quickly as humanly possible.)

This leads to a *humongous* jealousy problem with everyone else. If you've ever had a hot girlfriend, or a girlfriend at all, or if anyone I think is attractive has ever expressed interest in you, I *hate* you. Not because you deserve it. It's fully involuntary. But I hate you. You have what I can't get and your existence makes me mad. 

Obviously this is bullshit, but that never stops it from being a problem because people are flawed and I'm no exception. The issue is, I *have* to be around these people I'm jealous of if I ever want to get better at getting girls attracted to me, and it's gonna be tough doing that. 

Things I have tried that did not work:

* Just don't think about it

* Think of all the things you have that they might be jealous of

* Stop wanting what you can't have

* Stop being a sexist who only sees validation in sexual conquest

* Grit your teeth and muscle through it, it won't last that long

15,"My boyfriend and I are both 22. We have a 3 month old daughter. I have a previous post about our sex life but it’s bad. Like bad bad. I haven’t orgasm in almost a year. I’m basically asking is is terrible unsatisfactory sex a good reason to split when you have a child? 

I mean the other alternative is stay with him and maybe only orgasm once a year of the rest of my life or be in a sexless relationship because I’d rather have no sex than bad sex. 

Edit: okay since y’all want to say communicate. We do. Last time I said I dont cum from sex he said and I quote “I don’t really even care, what are you going to do? Leave me?” And then proceeded to laugh. He knows the sex is bad. He’s known for a long ass time. HE. JUST. DOESNT. CARE.",31Dec2017,0
16,"Okay so, here comes a massive wall of context. I'll leave a TLDR at the bottom somewhere

* I'm  a 19 year old guy, fairly introverted

* I'm a supervisor at a reasonanbly large sports bar cross night club.(yes, I realise that is a fairly sizeable contradiction, but at the time it was the only job I could get(although I wasn't a spervisor originally))

* I work very unsociable hours, typically Wednesdays through to Sundays between 6:30pm and 3:45/4am(although around 2:30am on Wednesdays and Thursdays). Some saturdays I also might start earlier at like 4pm/5pm, and I sometimes also do split shifts, generally starting from around 11:30am. I also go to the gym after work sometimes on Wednesdays and Fridays. As a result of all this, I'm typically waking up between 12pm-4pm(obviously depending on when I end up going to bed, when I have to get up for work, etc.

* I'm feeling tempted to leave my job atm, mainly due to the fact that I'm a supervisor but I hate telling people what to do amongst other things but don't know what other job to I want


* I have one friend outside of work who I generally credit to being my best friend, as I basically owe my life to her, and she's done a hell of a lot for me. I'm no longer in touch with any of my schoolfriends(apart from one who got a job where I work basically coicidentally) mainly due to a number of reasons.

* I spent most of my time outside of work to myself. Because it's been December, so Christmas, New Years(should be a fun night tonight /s) etc, I've been quite busy, to the point that I haven't been able to speak to my best friend in over a month because whenever I've tried to speak to her, she's always been busy, or with her boyfriend or something, so I've felt pretty lonely recently

So basically the only friends I really talk to on a regular basis are work friends. Now purely because I get so bored, I go out for drinks with them(sometimes after work, sometimes on days off and things), but I find that all they like to do is smoke and dance. Now, I don't smoke, I while I don't mind being around them when the light up, standing in an overcrowded smoking area is a big no for me. I hate it. Now, dancing is something I really have issues with. I don't dance(unless I'm really really drunk or someone won't shutup nagging me to) for several reasons, mainly 1) I don't know how to dance at all. I've looked it up, I've watched other people but I just can't wrap my head around, low self esteem(originating from years of bullying as a kid, followed by an unhealthy dose of severe depression, although I'm mostly over the mental health issues now), and just some general anxiety towards it(what about I couldn't tell you, I geniuinely have no idea). Now, because of the whole not dancing and not standing in a second hand smoke pit I'm often on my own when we go out, so usually just browse Reddit or something. But even when they come back from doing whatever and sit with me, and I'll put my phone away and try to be sociable, I still typically end up out of the conversation somehow. Now, I'm a fairly boring person, like at one point I ended up talking to one of them on a boring night at work, and I ended up talking about the safety features on the British plug, because I find that sort of thing interesting. They just kind of laughed(can't really say I blame them tbf, I know to most people that's not an interesting topic of conversation).

**TLDR : I work unsociable hours, am very boring, only really have workfriends, very lonely, and struggling to expand my social circles big time, and don't really know what to do.**",31Dec2017,13
17,"Gonna try to keep the post short, but basically I got a new phone. My mom told me to not trade in and to not give anyone my backup phone, should something happen to my current phone, i.e it breaks or cracks, etc. Couple days later, my dad asks me for the phone, and being so excited and happy I got this new phone, I give him it. My mom specifically told him that I was not to give the phone to anyone else, or trade it in, yet he took it anyway (not blaming him, but including this because after the fact I was confused on why he took the phone when he knew our plan, but then that contradicts me giving him the phone, when I knew the plan as well.)

Anyway, fast forward a couple days after that, my mom snaps at me for giving him the phone, and reminds me what my reasoning for keeping the phone was. Woke me up from my honeymoon phase with my new phone. So I ask dad for the phone back, and he tells me no, that he wants to keep it (even though he already has two phones), is going to fix it (the screen was severely cracked), and may or may not sell it. (I believe he had full intention of selling it, because why else get the screen fixed?)

I was livid. And didn’t talk to him for a week and a few days. Fast forward another couple days and he asks me how to take my iCloud off of the phone (he isn’t an iPhone user, has galaxy s6 edge, lol.) Feeling kind of petty for being angry at him over a phone, I legitimately tried to help him, and legitimately didn’t know how, since I’ve never had to delete an iCloud from my own phone. So I deleted all my personal things from the phone and gave it back. I then looked up how to solve the problem, and it said without the iCloud password, you couldn’t take the iCloud off of the phone, meaning he couldn’t sell it without me telling him my password to take it off.

I then remembered how ANGRY I was with him. How he laughed in my face because I was asking for the phone back. How he told my mom “oh well” and “She’ll get over it”. I then realized even if I didn’t have the phone in my possession, I still had the phone in my possession, because without my password the phone was useless to him or anyone he was trying to sell it to. 

We start talking again, and about a 5 days after us talking and getting back to how things were before he asked me for the phone, about 30 minutes ago he called me and asked me for my password, and I told him no.

He hung up on me, came home, threw the phone at me, and told me to shove it up my ass. It’s all hilarious. His anger is hilarious. He found it HILARIOUS when I WAS ANGRY, now I should find it HILARIOUS that HES angry. As much as I don’t want to be in a fight with him, and feel awkward with him. I just could not let him sell the phone, fix the phone, KEEP the phone, any of it. It would nag at me for the rest of time.

Should I care that he’s angry? This whole situation is petty, I know. And he’ll get over it (oh irony) But for the time being, I wonder if I should even give a fuck. I do feel kinda bad, but I remember how angry I was and how he laughed in my face and my remorse flashes away.

TLDR: Gave dad phone. Asked for it back, dad refused. Dad then asked for iCloud password and I refused, making the phone useless to him and anyone else. Dad is now angry.",31Dec2017,1

Sex and drug problems are virtually nonexistent and your popularity is determined by your academic status. The difficulty is immeasurable with only 8-10 kids receiving straight A's all four years of high school. We also have an SAT average of 1470/1600. Our suicide rate is also extremely high with suicides occurring every 2-3 years. Last year I managed to scrape an unweighted 4.0 (We can't take APs till junior year) but this year our first semester has ended and I am going to receive 2 Bs on extremely difficult subjects with an unreasonable teachers. Now my dream career path in life is to become a pediatric surgeon and  I am hoping to get into an extremely competitive 6 year BS/MD medical program with a &lt;6% acceptance rate.

She claims that I am not spending enough time studying and says that I am a miserable wretch and that I am good for nothing. I am constantly emotionally abused.

She has also taken away my computer and my phone leaving me nothing to do my homework with. I have to walk 2 hours every day to go to the public library and use their facilities for homework and this is taking an even bigger toll on my grades. My extracurricular activities are dropping, my resume is getting weaker and soon the only colleges I will be able to apply to are low tier UC's. Now I know this sounds extremely pretentious but with the amount of work I put into my studies combined with my ambitions, not getting into a high tier school would be an absolute blow. My mother demands that if I want anything I have to fund myself and I have tried getting multiple jobs but I do not have the time to juggle my copious school work along with my long walks to the library. Now recently there is a swim academy that opened near the library and it would allow me to work and still have time for other things. However, my mother refuses to pay for the initial certification I must receive, despite my pleas. She also threatens to divorce my father and take the house and my brother if he tries to fund or assist me in any way, whether it is letting me use his computer, or driving me places and giving me money.

24,"So I recently got a new(er) car and decided to sell my old car. This car is actually under my dad's name. He gave me permission to sell it. This car had MANY fixes over the years (a year 1999 car) because my dad never wanted to sell it until now. It hit almost the 200k miles mark so we've replaces the tires, AC, belts, transmissions, thermostat, and other stuff I honestly can't remember. Deal is, we've put so much into the car. My dad takes real good care of the car, so it's been in really good condition.

After my dad gave me permission to sell the car, I posted it on OfferUp and Craigslist. My friend was helping me post on OfferUp and posted the car for 1700, which I thought was ridiculous. We still got tons of offers but mostly all flakes or wanted to buy it in a week or a few days later. I decided to post on Craigslist for 1400. Someone was interested and wanted to bargain. I told him to come down to see the car and we'll see. He drives down, takes a look at it, notices small problems here and there. He tests drives it and likes it. He ramps up the engine pretty high, higher than I ever do but it performs to his liking. He asks how much lower I can go. I told him only 1350 and he takes it. He pays cash. I go home and tell my dad, he tells me to go and drop off the slip to the DMV, so I do. 
We agreed to put it for $300 on the forms.

The next day he starts complaining to me that the transmission is faulty. I personally never had an issue with the car, the only thing is it's an old car so it needs to warm up in the cold mornings. I told him I never lied, I did get the transmission changed by my father's friend. So there's no actual paperwork - all cash. But I know for sure it was replaced because it had problems back then. I told him he already got such a bargain for the car that I was genuinely upset I did agreed to sell it for 1400 when I could've been patient and sold it for 1700. He starts complaining to me that he'll call the police and put a police report and such. I told him do it. In my defense, how am I supposed to be sure he didn't take parts of the car or he himself drove the car and damaged it? That would be on his fault would it not?

What do I do now reddit? I'm not going to take the car back, I don't want it, that's the reason for selling it.

EDIT: He's now telling me the check engine light went off and the D4 on the shift is flashing. I DIDNT have this problem when I had it. He says he is gonna come to my home to get his money back.",31Dec2017,1

27,"TL;DR; My mother is afraid to ask for more money from her job. She asks me for money all the time. I worked really hard for it all (3 jobs and university). It is incredibly frustrating when my mother won't take care of herself, and I'm considering just not talking to her anymore. 

Long version

My mother was a waitress most of her life and a single mother (My father passed away when I was 10). I had little guidance growing up and I didn't see my mother much growing up, even though I lived in her house. I moved out when I was 18, I worked 3 jobs and went to university and paid it off myself. I am 27 and an engineer and I have saved a little bit of money from working part time and internships. But right now I'm unemployed. 

A few years ago my mother started delivering medicine in trucks, she made $14/hr. She has worked there for over two years. Six months into her job she started complaining about needing a bit more money for living and gas. I told her to ask for a raise. She said ""Now isn't the time"" and continued to ask me for money. She said ""This is what family does"" (I definitely have a different view on what family means). I worked SO hard personally to get out of my situation and I have asked for raises multiple times. 

I have been telling her to ask for a raise for the last year and a half. Recently they hired new drivers and she asked them what they made, which was $16/hr. She was angry and complained to the boss. They said they'll give her a raise 2 months ago (Since early November, still hasn't been given a raise). She continued to complain, I told her to ask them ""When will I get a raise?"" and to be more assertive. but she said she'll wait it out and continues to complain. (Probably $16/hr by Jan 1, because that's when minimum wage increases in Canada.) She is even talking about suing them for gender inequality....But she has never asked for a raise, so I don't see how this would hold up. 

I told her that the market changes and that you have to negotiate a raise because you work hard and deserve it, so the company did nothing wrong if you don't ask. 

So almost every night she complains about not being paid enough, she asks me for money, she drives a shitty car, and she lives and a really shitty neighborhood. I am SO scared her car is going to break down while she's driving on the highway.

ALL because she won't ask for a raise. Or she likes to put herself in this situation. IDK.

I am personally scared because she should obviously be making more, and if she continues on this path she won't have anything once she retires. She's going to look to us (Me and my sister) for money. This personally angers me a lot because she's pushing her problems onto us and it might affect us in the future. ",31Dec2017,12
29,"Hello. This evening my father told me he might not renew the lease to our apartment because he is tired of working. He doesn't mind being homeless, but I do. I'm currently enrolled in community college, I'm supposed to be starting my second semester in January, however, if he decides not to renew the lease, I'm not sure what I can do. I have no friends or family I could stay with either. I'll be turning 18 in June. I considered enrolling in a 4-year college with campus housing and taking out a loan, I'm not sure if that would be a smart option or not.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

He then did not turn up for a few weeks and I had spotted that he was being dropped off by his parents at college and then getting the bus straight home. So this made me and my friends worried and we decided to contact his mother about the issue. She explained how he had wished to completely finish college and he had told her that he had been speaking to his friends(hadn't messaged any of my friends or me) and she explained how she didn't know what was wrong with him and she would assume he would message us sometime soon.So now it's gone over the Christmas holidays and me and any of my friends are yet to receive a reply off of him.

In the summer something similar happened, he was faced with family issues and did not speak to any of us until we had to go back to college.

34,"**-----Beginning-----**

Long story short, I tend to be very confrontational. That is, whenever something upsets my sense of justice, I can't help but let my anger do the talking for me. 

For instance, I believe that it is not right for people to just simply berate someone on the internet because it is easier to do than doing it face-to-face, as I find that as an excuse for something far greater and disgusting within that person's psyche. That said, whenever someone shows a great deal of negativity to another person on the internet, whether it be me, my friend(s), or some stranger, I lash out in an attempt to destroy that person's values and almost force them to accept the fact that what they're doing is wrong and disgusting.

Another example would be (and I find this to be a bit more... unnecessary) that whenever someone ignores me or insults me, I almost become another person, from the usual calm/kind person that I usually am to a person who can't think of anything else than wanting to not only prove that person wrong but also to make that person feel terrible for what they've done, and I usually don't stop in my pursuit of that until I feel satisfied. In essence, I feel that I am a very angry and vengeful person on the inside, mixed with some level of being a sadist, which has been something I've been trying to fix for a long time now. 

Many tell me to think before I act, which I am capable of doing sometimes, but other times, I just can't help it; it's almost instinctual. I just lash out in anger. Of course, I'm not screaming like a maniac. When I'm angry, I'm more... honestly, ironically, I *think* better when I'm angry, as I feel that I'm put in a position, where I don't have the freedom to say something dumb/irrelevant/non-constructive to my argument against a certain person or people. That said, despite the fact that the volume in my voice doesn't change, my tone does. When I talk, I am usually gentle and try my best to come up with the best words to say to someone so as to not insult him/her. However, whenever I'm irked, my intonation becomes more coarse, my words become like a soft staccato, and I accentuate certain words in my statements so as to almost strategically lead the person I'm talking to into a state of mind that allows them to understand where I'm coming from. Of course, I add in some of my thoughts that are an attempt at either making fun of or disvaluing the other person's argument, almost as if I want to show them that I have the higher ground.

I hate that I do this to other people so much because it's torturous, condescending, and, worst of all, I enjoy it; it's not me. Whenever my boiled emotions die down, I enter a state of regret. I wasn't always regretful, as I've been like this since I was a kid. However, at a certain point in my life, I grew up and accepted the fact that I have to learn to feel remorse for letting my anger take the better of me (rather than having a more intelligent and calmer conversation) so that I could prevent myself from doing more of it in the future. However, contrary to what I had originally thought, it's done no good, as much of it is, as I said, very instinctual. Almost like a programmed mechanism to allow me to stay firm and on the ground with my sentiments; however, I just wish I could do this in a more appropriate and less insulting manner.

If anybody has ANY experience with anger management, please give me some of your wise words of advice. It may very well come a long way.

**-----End-----**

**Extra (don't have to read but will help you understand my point better, as I detail some important checkpoints in my life that may have lead me to this point)**

This is a story of my dark past, which I believe to be the epicenter of my behavior.

When I was a kid, I was always servile in my demeanor. I would always ask people what made them happy, and if it were in my power, I'd try my best to help them achieve their happiness. I've also always been good at paying attention to things, and I believe that it was because, as a kid, I had always tried to read the subtleties that would allow me to know whether or not someone whom I tried to make happy was truly pleased. That said, sometimes, I wouldn't even have to ask. I'd just know what made some of my friends/classmates/the people around me happy. However, without me even noticing it (ironic, eh?), people started using me and taking advantage of my kindness. I was too kind to even notice it, as I had always assumed that people had a great deal of goodness in them and that they would always be purely thankful to someone like me who always endeavored to make them happy. In essence, I didn't believe it were possible for people to have enough evil in them to look at someone like me as an object to fulfill their desires. However, the adults around me had started to notice that my relationship with people weren't healthy, as they were always using me. That said, I came to notice, little by little, the darkness in people and their manipulative behavior. Slowly, but surely, I started to grow more sour. Eventually, it got to the point, where I would become the exact opposite of what I was: someone who endeavored to know what made people happy and try to crush it, rather than to make it come true. 

Eventually, my mother and father moved me from a private school to a public school during the former years of my middle school career as per my request; however, little did they know, it wasn't for me to run away from the people who were manipulative. Rather, it was for me to start a new life with new people - to have an opportunity to create a fake image of myself as the nice guy who would have access to people's trust. Then, I would cleverly make them miserable, slowly such that it wouldn't be noticeable to them in the short term but enough for me to feel satisfied. What did I have to lose? It was my last year of middle school, and I wouldn't have to see those people ever again in high school (I was applying to a high school out of town). Might as well finish off middle school with a blast and try to make as many people as I possibly can unhappy - it doesn't matter what they think of me in the end. These were the thoughts that were going through my mind at the time. 

One of my most regrettable actions was rejecting a girl before she even had mustered the courage to confess to me. A 'friend' of mine (at the time), who was a friend of hers, told me that she liked me. Long story short, I devised a plan that simply went like so: I led her on, met up with her privately, and turned her down before she even gave a hint of liking me. I'd say things like ""there's no way I would've said 'yes' anyways, so it's a no"" and ""I don't want to go out with you. I don't really find you attractive"", and I'd threaten her by saying things like, ""if you tell anybody about what I just did to you, I'm going to turn you into a laughing stock."" Believe it or not, I had many people who considered me their friends, and I was, to a certain degree, popular. I had a lot of, and it's weird to use this term like this, *political power* back then, as many people would rather believe me than most other people because I had earned their trust. This is what gave me confidence to keep people quiet. Whether or not there were rumors about me spreading, I wouldn't know and quite frankly, I wouldn't have cared because I didn't really see these people as... well, people, really.

Sometimes in gym class, when we played kickball, I'd purposely kick the ball towards people's faces and apologize afterwards to hide my intent. I'd purposely peg people really hard during dodgeball; I'd throw the basketball, rather than lightly passing it; I'd 'accidentally' push people, when we were running during field day; I wouldn't pay people back; etc. These were all the little things, but that's what I wanted, as the little things would eventually add up. I'd borrow money from friends, little at a time (like $2-4) a day or every other day, but by the end of the year, I'd owe over $400 worth of money to people. Sometimes, I'd find myself getting lucky, when I'd 'accidentally' make someone go to the nurse's office with a nosebleed during gym (to which, I still can't understand why people would so easily forgive me if I made it seem like I was sincerely apologetic). Of course, I was smart about it, so I wouldn't do the same things over and over again. Otherwise, I'd get caught. So it was like a game to me: I'd come up with some creative new ways to, in a sense, bully people. The rule of the game was simple: ruin someone's day without looking like the bad guy. I'd always tell myself to do something that can be deemed as accidental. The environment mattered a lot for this to be feasible, so gym class was one of the classes, where I experimented a lot. I never got tired of this because every time I tried something, it was new and fresher than the previous idea, so there was a sense of accomplishment with every plan.

Of course, I'm a very different person now. I realized the error of my ways eventually in high school, when I met some people who restored a bit of my faith towards humanity; however, the events that transpired were during my formative years. Hence, the me of the past really has a hold on the me of now. In fact, it wasn't even that long ago that I was a terrible person, as I'm not that old. You can say terrible things about me if you want; it's your opinion and you have every right to do so. In fact, I wouldn't even be surprised if you labeled me a psychopath or insane. However, please consider that I was a pure, honest, and good kid back then; I was a VERY sensitive person, which was why I was so keen on people's happiness and why I was, to a certain degree, very perceptive, when it came to helping people. Unfortunately, that was my downfall, as my sensitivity caused me to take more mental damage than I could have ever imagined; instead of being hurt for just that moment of realization or just letting it go, I let my anger stay cooped up inside of me because of the faith I wanted to have in people. Thus, I gave the anger and pain a chance to live and fester inside of me. I let my anger, frustration, and lost trust in humanity take me down a spiral of madness. In essence, my past realizations were VERY scarring to me and haunts me even to this day. As sad as it is for me to say this, when I came to the realization of the thing people thought of me as and the terrible ways people were treating me, I became socially crippled because I didn't know what clue I could find in people that would allow me to know whether or not they truly accepted me for who I was or if they were just using me; it became easier to talk to people, when I saw them as  things and tools of my enjoyment, rather than as people. Fortunately for me, I found someone who was able to get some of these words out of me, when I needed to most. That person helped me realize that I was becoming the very monster that caused me to do such heinous things in the first place: a manipulative person who enjoys the position of being able to be domineering over other people, using their kindness towards me as a weapon against them. That's when I started to change and am now nothing more than a regretful shell of my older self: someone who wants to be kind and caring towards people again, but my anger is always there, ready to choke me and control me.",31Dec2017,8
35,"I [27F] work at a small start up. I found out recently by some of my coworkers that they had their yearly review and got a raise. I’m in charge of the companies brand and marketing. I am there more than the owner and my boss working on stuff. I’m also working more than most of the employees there. I’ve increased their sales and got them noticed for television. I’m extremely underpaid and have asked for a raise before. They said they couldn’t afford to give me what I wanted at the moment. Now I found out people who are packing boxes are making just as much as I do. I feel so disrespected and undervalued. I wanted to walk in next week and quit on the spot. But after cooling down and thinking more without this cloud of anger I’m at a lost of what to do. I don’t want to stick around after being so disrespected like that. I mean I’m kinda salty about the raise thing but they didn’t even give me a yearly review?!

38,"I am 19 years old and I am trying to attend college. There is a very long story that I could explain and give very intimate details about but I'll cut it down to some of the key points. 

My family has never believed in college. I think maybe one or two of my distant cousins have went but that's about it. This is both because of religious and personal beliefs. 

A few months after turning 18 I left/was forced to leave my house because I told my parents I did not want to follow their religion any longer. After a few months of being homeless I was able to save up and get an apartment. I want to attend college now and persue my goals of becoming a teacher. 

Alittle under a year has passed since then and I have started seriously looking at going to get a degree but I am being stopped at every turn. I tried to fill out FAFSA information but I need my parents soical and other information regarding taxes and such. When I asked for there help they stated that it was against their beliefs and did not want to ""encourage me in unholy behavior."" 

So because of that I am unable to fill out applications. I can't fill out FAFSA, my Residency Determination, or any other documents that need their information. ( And yes I have checked I am still considered a dependent under certain guidelines) 

I need help in figuring out what to do next. I don't have any money for college and sadly my whole family is like this so there isn't a member that I could turn to. What can I do so I can attend college? How can I get these documents filled? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

If you don't like them that's fine but I always thought if you don't have something nice to say just don't say anything at all. He adores me and treats me well but he just can't take me saying anything about him. Whenever my dad and I fight he blames it on my mom and says that she's pitting me against him which is not true at all. In fact she often tells me to stop fighting with him so we can have a peaceful meal etc. My dad and I don't have problems but his behavior ends up leading to altercations like this.

His comments lack basic human decency. I know my fathers father also didn't like them and all of my fathers behavior is also making me think negatively of my fathers father.

45,"..but it really hurts :(

I've been living on my own and working for 4 years now. I moved into a very large town for that, after having grown up in a small village. And it was fine at first! I wasn't afraid or anything, I loved my freedom, I loved my first job. It was a really fun and relaxed job with great young coworkers, we were like a little family. In this time I rarely missed my old home. I can think of maybe 2 or 3 times and it wasn't serious. I thought I had gotten used to 'adulthood'.

I had to change my job and also moved into a new flat, and for various reasons that triggered a, pretty much, mental breakdown for me. I was very stressed and depressed for a few months and got a therapist. Now I've been having the new job, flat AND my first therapist for over a year. In that time, much has gotten objectively better. I've worked on issues from my past, my social anxiety is pretty much gone, I feel much more independent, I improved my body to the point that I finally feel comfortable in it etc.

And yet I don't seem to get happier. For a few months now whenever my therapist asked me how I'm feeling I said 'neutral' because that's what I felt. Not bad really, but not good either. Kinda meh. The job is alright - nothing really wrong with it - but I find that I kinda don't give a shit about it. The new flat (not even really new anymore, but still feels like it) is alright, but for some reason I don't feel at home there. I feel like although I have not been hating everything anymore, life was just kinda.. passing me by. Although, I was temporarily happy whenever I was with friends or distracted by doing something fun. However there was always the feeling that something was.. missing. I have friends too, and regularly do social stuff and other hobbies. So it's not like my life is empty, but it does feel like it.

And now I visited home and my mom for christmas. It was good to see the old place and some relatives again. I've been back for about four days now, which I spent mostly on my own, chilling. And today I started feeling restless for no obvious reason. I felt really tense and annoyed for a couple hours. It got better in the evening. And then as I tried to sleep I just started crying. For some reason I felt terribly homesick. I realized that although I've been feeling 'fine' in the last months, I completely lack any goals for the future (other than 'traveling') and I cannot really see myself as an adult making her own life. I don't at all know what to do with my life and I just see no point in anything right now. I feel so homesick like if I just went back home all would be better, but of course it wouldn't.

The last time I felt like this I was about 19 and studying abroad. It was horrible, I cried almost all the time and wanted to go home but somehow pulled through. But feeling like this at 24? That's kinda pathetic, right? I have to build my own life but that seems terrifying right now.",31Dec2017,1

49,"We've been friends since high school and she moved to a different state in the southwest four years ago with her mom but we've maintained contact ever since and have been extremely close. She came to her home state to visit family earlier in December and we hung out every day-she was supposed to stay past Christmas. We had so much fun together. Her trip was cut short because she got into a huge argument with the relative she was staying with and they kicked her out of the house during a holiday party when she got into a huge fight with one of her cousins. I told her I would come and pick her up and told her she could come stay with me- she opted for a hotel and flew back home the next day, we exchanged few words but she told me the only good times she had when visiting were with me and that she was so lucky to have a friend like me. We made plans to FaceTime once she got back home but she bailed and kept telling me she was busy. She told me she was spending time with her mom and brother and that she was okay. I told her I was worried about her, that I hoped she was ok, told her she could FaceTime whenever she wanted and if she wanted to come visit me I'd pay for her plane ticket and she could come and stay with me.

I should also mention said friend is bipolar, has had an opiate drug problem in the past and currently does not work or go to school. Her last text message to me, two weeks ago was ""thanks."" After I told her that i would always be her friend and be there for her. She hadn't responded to any of my texts since then and would leave me on read. My last text to her was yesterday, I texted ""hope you're doing ok and we can FaceTime soon."" Left on read. Asked if she was doing ok and if she was upset about something or with me. Left on read again.

I find out this evening that she's since unfollowed me on Instagram and unfriended me on Facebook. she posted a picture of some fruity cocktail drink on Instagram so I'm guessing she realized she doesn't need me anymore.

This year was a bad one for me. I was sexually assaulted, went through my first real heartbreak, self-harmed, spent more time than I probably should've by myself, cried more than I ever had in my life, and still stayed friends with her.

I'm not goddamn superman. I get that I should do task A, task B, and task C....but do you expect me to take care of it like usual when I have tasks D-Z overhead?


And yeah, I get I can be incompetent at times, but that comes with learning on the job, don't you think?


Our last talk escalated into a heated argument with me being noticeably angry. I just can't deal with him, and I get the feeling he's almost had it with me too. I wanted to try and make things better between us, but honestly I don't see that happening. In fact, I'm wondering if I might even get fired for how badly I'm getting along with him, since my supervisor will probably use him as a reference for how I'm doing on the job.


Am I the one at fault here, and should I change somehow? What can I do to fix things with my coworker? Should I just ask my supervisor to change who I am assigned to for a mentor?",31Dec2017,1
59,"Probably like most redditors, im pretty introverted. However my sister who is 3 years my junior isnt. As a result my sister often teases me saying i have no life since i have no friends (i do) and is always pestering me why i dont have a bigger social media presence. Thing is im not interested in instagrams and snapchats. Thing is my sister loves pointing my introversion out to pretty much everyone she meets now im treated as some kind of no life by everyone she talks to about me even if they hardly no me. So i guess my question is how do i get her to stop without coming off as an asshole because i dont think she realizes what shes doing is really hurting my self esteem and only pushes me further away from other people.",31Dec2017,1

63,"Hi reddit. A normal person would ask this to his/her parents, but I can't because I want to leave them before things go worse.

This year I'm gonna finish my studies (if all goes well, ofc) and from March to July I will be working in a business of my sector (I will work as construction manager) without payment.

Trouble comes there. In Spain (especially in my city or near mine) there are a lot of jobs (of any kind) with bad salaries. Construction is pretty quiet now and I don't feel ready to have responsabilities, since I want to learn more. But I'm willing to start working.

If I get a job, my parents will ask me for money while I still live with them(this is fair) but I know they don't save any money since they spent 300-400€/month of 1300 in tobacco (one box per day for each other, while the price is about 4€), some alcohol and gambles. This leaves us with ~800€ for food and bills. 

House renting is about 500 and other bills around 200€ (as a total). They haven't pay the house renting for almost 3 years, so we are going to be evicted in a few weeks. In a few weeks we will live in a new house, being my big brother (who doesn't live with us and has give my parents a lot of money that will never recover) the guarantor. I know for sure they won't pay the rent again.

Since I know how many money my parents waste, I wanted to leave the house. Also my relationship with them is not easy, it seems like I am their servant and I have to be always for them to do anything they don't want to do. My parents asked me for 150€ about a year ago and I still hold the debt with them, and I think I always will.

I know that if I work, they will ask me for more money than I expected to give them. If I refuse, they can fire me, as I'm 23; if I don't, I will never be able to leave the house.

I tried to talk to them so we can save some money, you know, basic stuff: smoke less, no gamble at all, as they don't win a damn euro... but they don't want to hear me.

Before you ask, yes, I would leave my parents homeless if I don't help them. It's their fault for not being responsible with money. Maybe I deserve the worst, but it's me or them.

Any idea of what can I do? I'd like to leave in 2-3 years.",31Dec2017,1

I get discouraged too easily if things don't turn out perfect, and it becomes to hard for me to continue working on them.

74,"In general I'd say things are good or at least not bad.

Career wise I have a decent job but I'm applying at other companies as I don't see the current company offering much career progress. I'm sure I have a bad case of Imposer Syndrome but I get raises so can't be that bad at my job.

Finances are great. Have an e-fund, savings, only a mostly paid-off car loan, student loan paid-off.

I think my biggest problem is being lonely and not feeling self-sufficient. Maybe feeling like I wasted my youth a bit missing out of things and money from a late start on my career / everything. I tend to be pragmatic about regrets and limit how much I dwell on them.

I have never had much of a romantic relationship. Dated very little never got laid. No real friends. Still living at home. In my early 30s. These sorts of things make me feel awful. Again, I know it could be worse and I know other do in fact have it worse with these sorts of things being my biggest problems.

I also want to start dating. Getting laid would be part of this but I kinda want something a bit more than just a one night stand. I'm not really expecting to find a wife but build a rapport up enough that they won't take the idea of popping my cherry too badly. I can see some women taking as a red flag or at least a turn off. I would also hope to find a good relationship and do the whole marriage thing but I think it is fair to expect to meet a lot of people and get to know them before finding something that ends up being long-term.

I think I'll make an online profile and try to meet people that way. Try it keep it sort of light and get to know them and see where things go. Put in effort but try not to rush into something serious or just a hookup. Might go for a hookup after the first time later I don't know. I did the online thing before but I don't think really put in much effort and having little to no success. I ended up focusing on getting a career instead. There might be something to say about why I didn't really pursue things in like high school but I'm not sure how much that matters at this point.

At this point I've lost contact with old friends from school. I seem to have a very hard time forming and maintaining friendships. I might do stuff with people from work but most of the time it's a related a work function and I've never keep in contact with people after they leave. I've thought about doing some meetup thing but really I'm more worried about this from a social support structure or how it looks to others than just wanting to spend time with people.

I'm currently looking at moving out including figuring out what I need to be able to do for myself. I think my parents never really taught me how to be an adult but let me stick around. I'm not trying to blame them but I had to kinda make it a point that I needed to do my own laundry. I think I'll also have to build good habits for doing chores. I'm sure I can afford a half decent place, rent, I just might have to lower my saving rate and take longer to have a down payment for a house. I feel embarrassed and ashamed about living in the same room I had in high school. Forming relationships, romatic or otherwise, is a big motivation for me to move out as I don't feel like I can invite anyone over or let them know where or how I live.

I think moving out should be my number one goal outside of staying alive and employed. I could see waiting on a possible switch in companies as I wouldn't want to break a lease and location of a job is important in living location. I could also see beginning to date before moving out. Just avoid going back to someone's place and have fun spending time on the date.

I don't really know what kind of advice I'm asking for. Maybe feedback on what I'm doing or a better way to do. At the very least I think typing it out made me feel a bit better and get things straight in my head.

Edit: I'm not seeing the flair thing. Is that still a thing? Sorry if it is.",31Dec2017,1
75,"I've known my girlfriend since we were friends in school. We've been through a lot of shit together including helping me move out of my abusive mother's home when she threw me out during hurricane harvey. Because I know some people will raise a brow at the label of ""abusive"" she kept me isolated, physically abused my grandmother, tried to forcefully convert my girlfriend into her religion after verbally abusing and berating her for being bisexual and told me to kill myself when she found out I didn't believe in god. Without my friendship that turned romantic I would likely not be alive to write this as I suffered with heavy depression and suicidal thoughts.

So I think I do have a good ground to notice abusive traits, even when subtle, in someone else. My girlfriend seems oblivious to how her mom and step-dad behaves, even though her mother has personally told me she finds her husband abusive too. The issue currently is that me and her live with them and we do not make enough money to live on our own. She has graduated high school but is finding it hard to get into community college and my mother was very spotty with my schooling so I have one grade to go before I can graduate even though I am 19 and taking online courses to finish.

Her mother basically invalidates her feelings, and is very hypocritical. She will tell us not to spend OUR money at starbucks for a date but she blows all of hers in booze and even forces her daughter to buy it for her. My girlfriend does pay for the groceries, and I have helped, and we split the internet bill. Both of us work retail and there just simply isn't enough to live on by ourselves considering we live in Illinois and it's expensive up here to get anything nevermind food and the government hasn't gotten back to me about my Medicaid application yet. Her mother is very selfish, and has had a history of physical and verbal abuse before taking medication but her alcohol habit really doesn't help. She's very inward and kind of expects a gold star just for being a human being and treats anyone else like shit, and has basically ruined three marriages with DECENT men because of her instability. Her husband has an anger issue and will become aggressive quickly. Earlier he kicked the dog for doing something wrong, and this dog has hip dysplasia and yelped, to which her mother got upset. I made the comment that kicking the dog isn't necessary and he got in my face and started yelling calling me things like ""motherfucker"". This did not affect me because I refuse to be intimidated by someone like that, but it does bother me knowing that me and her are forced in the middle of an unstable situation between them. Her mom wants a divorce, and he seems basically apathetic to the idea of it happening but clearly has a domination complex. He refuses to get help and she denies that anything different needs to be done because she is already seeing a doctor.

I'm not part of their family. The only thing I have going for me is that her mother does seem to like me despite her rude moments, and that my girlfriend's two younger siblings do like me a lot. I try to help keep the house clean and I am working probably one of the shittiest underpaid positions in Wal-Mart. However neither me or my girlfriend get any respect for our efforts. Her mother, for instance, basically invalidated me being sore from work, because of her prior experiences. Neither me or my girlfriend are allowed to have issues of our own. Her mother and step-dad have a very ""we had it worse"" mentality, even though no comparisons are even brought up besides them.

I'm conflicted as to what to do. It's not my nature to bite my tongue to outright abuse and it's hard to bite my tongue when one of them are being complete dicks to my girlfriend, because it makes me feel like I'm shitty at being her partner if I don't say something but I don't want us to get kicked out. We've tried talking to one of her friends about the idea of room-mating but I'm not sure how well that would work. 

It's also getting harder to keep my mouth shut when one of them are rude to me. I mean, her mother, me, and her are the only ones with actual jobs. Her husband literally does not work and when he does it's for his dad who does not even pay him. So right now all those groceries in the fridge, the laundry detergent, their precious coffee, the overpriced Comcast cable bill -these are things me and her are paying for. And yes, I do realize these things count as rent and should be expected of us but I do not think it is okay to basically be dicks to us when we're contributing. Her mother is in so much debt that if she did leave her husband she'd HAVE to rely on us. It's very toxic. 

Obviously my plan is to graduate within the next few months and try hitting up nursing school or something medical related so I can afford to get us the fuck out, or hopefully get a promotion/switch to a better paying job and line up a room-mate. Going ""home"" for me is not an option, as at least I have friends and my girlfriend now and I am not completely alone and isolated and depressed as I would be there.

We've been together for about three months, but we've known each other for six months.

We tell each other ""I love you"", and I believe that we really do love each other...I do. Make fun of me, tell me I'm just young and dumb, I don't care. I feel very comfortable with him and I feel like I can be 100% myself with him.

We started getting kinda sexual in the past few weeks. Before that we were just kissing and hugging.

So, in the past few weeks, he has seen me...disrobed. He has seen and touched all my lady parts and put his mouth on them and whatnot.

But the thing is, I haven't seen him yet...he kept all his clothes on during our shenanigans. 

And, well, I want to see him and touch him, and all that. I really would like to. 

I appreciate that he's respectful of me...he tells me that I don't need to do anything for him and that he just cares about making me feel good, which is very nice. He says he doesn't expect anything from me.

He also has said repeatedly ""I'm up for anything"" and ""I'll do anything you're comfortable doing""...and he asks me if there's anything else I'd like to do. I usually just say no, I'm good, or ask him if there's something in particular that he wants to do. He just says no, he only cares about what I want to do. 

How do I ask? When he does things to me, he does them slowly then asks if it's okay and periodically asks if I'm comfortable. I want to give him the same respect...I don't want to do something like [this](https://vine.co/v/eUXp7H52OZw) and just be like TAKE OFF YOUR DAMN SHIRT. 

I mean...he takes off my clothes for me and asks if it's okay. Do I, like, subtly pull at the hem of his shirt or something? Or do I directly ask ""can you pls take your clothes off thx.""

Do I touch him over his clothes first? Or is that groping and is it creepy? ""Surprise, here's my hand, grabbing your dick.""

Do I ask before I do these things, or do I just do them then ask if he's okay with it during the process?

Am I moving too fast? Forgive me, I'm just an eager beaver who loves someone and gets horny sometimes. I don't want to rush things and make him think that all I care about is sex and getting in his pants...that's definitely not the case. I'm curious.

90,"A friend (lets her call her Ashley) had been married to her S.O for Financial Reasons for almost a year but never told her immediate family. She told Me and several other close friends. Almost a year ago, her husband invited me to participate in a beach house/ weekend birthday party for Ashley. This was a huge inconvenience as I had moved out of state and had to drive nearly 3 hours to be there, as well as pay for part of the weekend rent. I thought only Friends were invited. Instead, it turned out to be Ashley, her Husband (unknown/ S.O), her aunt and 1st Cousin. That was, frankly, awkward. On the night of her birthday, everyone was drinking and---I admit it, I got a little more than tipsy. Not fall down sloppy throw up on the couch passed out on the picnic table naked, but drunk. During this evening, I made a complimentary comment toward her and her S.O and called him ""your husband"" ...in front of her aunt and cousin. There was an easy fix to this but Ashley didn't take it. She freaked out in front of the ""family"" and it came out they'd been married for almost a year. By the next morning at wake up, I was persona non grata and ended up leaving, a day early, with my tail between my legs feeling extremely guilty and upset. I called several friends on the way home and explained the situation. Their consensus was that Ashley's reasons for the secret marriage were selfish and immature (a big wedding, gifts, money, ect) and that it wasn't my Responsibility to perpetuate her Lie for her personal gain. I was told I should not feel guilty because she Choose to lie to her family about her status. I talked to her husband before leaving and was told to give her time to ""cool down"" and she'd contact me eventually to make amends. This did not happen. I waited, patiently, for that day to come. She didn't delete me from her FB friends and I took this as a positive. 

However, things came to a head tonight. I learned, after midnight, that another good friend's son in the same area (state I don't live in anymore), had been killed in a car accident. He was only 18. I was devastated. I knew this young man well, having stayed at their house numerous times. 

I contacted Ashley on FB and said, that I had hoped she'd contact me sooner but my friend's son had died in a tragic accident not far from her, and could I come stay (they're childless and have a huge home, btw) and maybe we could talk and it would give me a chance to apologize to you, face to face....

Her response was: I'm sorry to hear about (deceased's name). That is a horrible thing. I do not hate you but we did not leave on the best of terms and that situation has not changed or addressed since. That being said I do not think that having you stay here will work. I would create a very awkward situation for everyone, distract from your actual reason for being here and also obligate me to ignore/forgive the situation. Now is just not going to work. I am sorry for that. 

So, what now? I don't feel (in hindsight) I was obligated to perpetuate a Lie she perpetuated for selfish and, IMO, immature reasons.

108,"Good day to all!

Okay so. Let me first begin by saying that I am a 19 year old girl who has been living on her own for about 11 months now. My mother is VERY religious and most likely bipolar. My father is a police officer who retired from the army (who I am terrified of) and expects very high things from me. For the past 2 years just about, I have been lying about being in college and for the past year I've been lying to them about my boyfriend and basically every other aspect of my life and honestly I can't believe how far this has gone. For as long as I've been renting my apartment, I've basically been living with my boyfriend who is 25 and has a felony DUI. I also started smoking weed about a year ago and became agnostic. I recently got a new job in the field that I've always wanted to work in which is great but if my parents found out any of this, they'd flip their shit. The thing is, I'm getting so sick of this secrecy. Today, my brother found my tarot cards in something that I had left at my moms house. My mom called me and WENT OFF telling me that I was getting into witchcraft and all this other crazy shit. My only response was something along the lines of ""I don't believe that rectangular printed on pieces of paper will bring evil into my life."" She was so mortified by that response! She told me that I needed to get back into church and that the next thing she knows Ill be telling her that I don't believe in God or the Bible!.....Well news flash mom. I don't! AND ITS DRIVING ME INSANE. My older sibling is visiting us for the holidays, and every time they are here, my mom complains about their lack of maturity to me when their back is turned and then in turn my sibling does the same when her back it turned. I am the youngest and it puts me right in the middle. Often times I feel like I am dealing with 2 unhappy and mentally unstable children while also having to try keeping my sanity. Something tells me I'll be a lot happier if I can just be free to tell the truth about myself and not live what feels like it's a double life.

112,"I[17M] added this girl[17F] who goes to my school on snapchat about six months ago because she is a good friend of one of my tennis teammates.  We snapped each other every now and then, but it was mostly just the ""hey, how u doing?"" type of stuff.  A few months later, one of her friends started dating one of my friends and so this was when we really started talking.  For the past couple months, we have been talking on snapchat a lot, and so rumors have been springing up that I'm trying to hook up with her because she's pretty hot, which I'm not.  I only like her as a friend because of her fun party animal personality and we've never really flirted, but everyone thinks I'm trying to have sex with her and even some of her friends are trying to get her to hook up with me.  

Cutting to the chase, one of my friends told me he hooked up with her, intending to make me feel jealous.  I didn't believe him at all, but just for confirmation and also because I thought it was pretty funny, I asked her if it really happened and she said no.  She seemed somewhat bothered by it, so she asked me to give her my friend's snapchat.  I refused to give it to her because I didn't want to unleash an angsty teenage girl on him, and so for the next week she spams me asking for his snapchat.  I initially thought she just wanted it to ask him why he was saying such bs, but she seemed a little *too* persistent, and so I ended up asking her a bunch of times why she wanted his snapchat so badly and each time she only replied with something along the lines of ""idk"".  Out of the blue, my friend adds her himself and according to him, they snap a bunch with each other.  A couple days ago, I asked her if she wants to meet up to have a face-to-face chat because we've only talked about 3 times irl due to our loaded schedules and I was worried my friend was telling her a bunch of stupid crap because he likes screwing around with people a lot.  I realized too late that that was the WORST possible time to ask to meet up.  She gives me a very seemingly nervous response, basically saying ""no"".  My friend calls me and tells me that she thinks I've been trying to slide in this whole time.  I tried to confront her about that but she isn't responding to me anymore and the whole school isn't making this any easier.  How would I go about cleaning this up?

120,"So Im 25, have been travelling on and off over the last few years while juggling a uni degree at the same time, I finished the remainder of it abroad, spending nearly a year in Europe where I had a great time, although I broke up out of a serious relationship in the first few months of the exchange as the long distance thing just wasn't working.

Jump ahead to now. Im back from that trip and I feel like I haven't cemented in the person I need to be, and at least owe myself to be after years of great experiences abroad.
I've come back and have found I don't really click with the friends I've had sporadically over the last few years, they've all gone their own ways and I sort of feel like a generic person who only has travelling to his name.
Tied in with this is the need to finally get out of the family house, i need to find somewhere where I can develop strong bonds with the people I live with, I suppose they will naturally become the people I become close with, although I scared I may get unlucky and find myself with closed, mind their own business type housemates, is this often the case?

I haven't gymed in ages, I wonder now if Im trying to find a new look just by getting fit? I grow no facial hair which sucks so creating a personal identity is tough. Im quite skinny and I now packing on a few kilos of muscle will be a good look, but trying to have a unique look seems confronting, perhaps only at first?

Looking for that special gal is a bit tricky as well, im thinking a lot needs to change beforehand though.

Its nye and Im stuck at home tonight, have lost touch with too many people to find a decent party to attend. Doesnt phase me too much, i know its only temporary but I guess I just have to chug along.

123,"I am a 20 year old male, have 0 friends, and has social anxiety.  I am very depressed and angry as well.  
 I also have a form of hives called cholinergic urticaria.  It makes my skin extremely painful when I get hot, or nervous, or practically anything that gets a person to sweat.  It also affects my legs where it is very itchy and I can't stand long because of it. 
 Also, the skin pain is literally the worst pain I have ever experienced and don't wish it on my worst enemy.  It ruins my life. 
 I haven't finished high school and dropped out due to hives, social anxiety, and no motivation and interest in it at all.  I went to high school for a few months then eventually online courses.  

So what exactly do I do to make a living?  I assume working at home is best as it will be the least pressure on my social anxiety, hives, etc.  However what exactly can I do?  I searched many times on google and found things like blogging, writing books, etc.  I just don't see me doing well in that.  

My hobbies/ interests are animals, I watch youtube everyday, netflix and movies, video games, music, thats all I can think of right now.  

A dream job that would be interesting is making youtube videos but it's 1 in a million to earn a living on there as well as with my social anxiety and depression I don't see me being entertaining.

My depression has gotten so bad over the years that I feel i hate people and I am angry a lot.  I have never had a girlfriend but even if I somehow got one, I feel I would be so angry and rude due to my years of depression and built up anger that it wouldn't work out.  And I don't want to hurt anyone.

I have become suicidal but I never see myself doing it as it just ends my life and not my pain.  

I have worked on my hives and social anxiety for a year.  I reguarly go on walks outside and go to family holidays, I stopped going to those before.  For my hives I ate healthy and exercised, as well as take antihistamines.  The hives were manageable but I still have it and would outbreak whether vaccuming or standing too long, or just simple things people take for granted.  The hives have slightly gotten worse and I am not counting on it disappearing.  There isn't really a cure for it.  I have to hope it disappears completely.

Early on in our dating, she told me about this and asked if I'd be willing to wear women's stuff.  I was game and it's increased in frequency as I got over the initial discomfort and nervousness.  We worked my way up, dressing more and more.  She's let me know in the past that, if I was up to it, she'd be happy for me to just dress like a woman all the time.  So, I told her that in this new year I'd commit to moving to full time by the end of March.

Now, I'm wondering where to get the confidence.  I don't have an innate desire to crossdress, but I've grown acclimated to it in each step of increased frequency and have learned to enjoy it.  I'm also wondering how to keep up the momentum-wearing makeup and coordinated outfits every day.  My wife likes a really feminine look and it always feels a bit overwhelming trying to put something together that balances the line between feminine and over-the-top.  

I really want to be somewhat independent in this process rather than relying on my wife.  She's already taught me a lot about clothes and makeup.  And I'm wondering what would be a good gift(s) or gestures (either physical items, or experiences) for her to show her both my appreciation and to make this a special time.

Last night, we went to Target and me and a friend that is a girl got orange juice. Well, we drank it all last night and I was joking with him and asked him if he would go to Target to get us some more. He responded with why don’t we go together tomorrow morning. So this morning we took a half an hour walk to Target and laughed and joked the whole way. Later today, we were walking together with some friends and I was on my phone talking to a friend and he randomly grabbed my hand and asked if it was cold (we were inside and we hadn’t gone outside). I made the mistake of pulling my hand away to while he responded with I wasn’t trying to hold your hand. Was he trying to hold my hand and he just said that to cover it up?

I wish him excess healing. I hope he finds peace. It just bothers me, you know, how he used to take advantage of me and my silence, never believed in consent and called me a mood kill several times. It's time to let all these horrid memories go. I can do this. People can do whatever - I can't control them.

152,"I’m (18 M) trying to decide if I should still try to be friends with my ex (18 F) . We were both good friends throughout high school but it took us until our second semester of college to announce that we had feelings for each other. We had a sort of relationship going over “long distance” (3 hour drive). She could never wrap her brain around that idea and always told me how she wants a boyfriend who can actually be there with her. We were best friends for at least a solid year leading up to this relationship and I just miss it now. Her parents don’t like me even thoug they’ve only met me once... they think I’m some sort of hooligan with a loud car. With that being said, they fill her mind with doubts whenever she’s home and then we start fighting. Her parents even told her that they’d take away her college funding if she didn’t stop talking to me, yet she still talks to me.

My issue here is that she constantly brings up that we need to end “whatever we are” because she can’t do it. All I’m trying to do is save our friendship but she doesn’t get that. It’s quite obvious that she still has feelings. The few times I’ve gotten her on a phone call, she just starts crying and hangs up. The only conclusion that we’ve come to was that the timing wasn’t right.
She told me she wants to block me so I don’t have to see her with other guys or me with other girls because it will only hurt more...

Has anyone maintained a friendship post breakup? Do any tensions ever rise again? 

The main thing I want to know is how to go about being friends with her again like we were before; when we had short conversations every day and I could tell that I made her happy. (Because now I only get a response half the time, and if it’s on Snapchat, it’s just a black screen) ",31Dec2017,0

155,"For the past year I have been baking a lot and posting lots of pictures of my baking. I live very very far away from my family but they take a lot of interest in my baking adventures.

My in laws sent me a Kitchenaid for Christmas. A brand new white one. A wonderful gift! However just a few hours later I opened a box from my husband and it's another Kitchenaid! This one is a refurbished one in my favorite color, blue!

My husband said he really didn't feel like keeping two Kitchenaids and I agreed with him. I don't really have a use for two at this point. He wanted me to return his blue one and I keep the white one. But color is really important to me and I'm not a fan of white.
 
I spent a few days deciding what to do. I was basically paralyzed with anxiety trying to decide what to do. I originally wanted to return both because my other Kitchen equipment is in a slightly different blue than the blue Kitchenaid my husband gave me but the shipping charges for that would be astronomical. So I decided that the only thing to do was to try to sell locally. After a little hesition and planning I listed the new white one locally and quickly got a buyer. I immediately felt more free. I took out the blue one my husband gave me, cleaned it up and was really excited about my mixer for the first time.

A few days later I've got my blue Kitchenaid all fixed up. I've got the white Kitchenaid half sold and I'm really starting to enjoy having a mixer. I've purchased attachments and accessories for my blue Kitchenaid with the money I got from selling the white one. However I still haven't told my in laws what I've done. I want to be able to post the things I make with my blue Kitchenaid but I don't want them to see it's not white without me telling them.

I feel that I should tell them I gratefully received 2 for Christmas and I decided to sell the one they gave me to get attachments and accessories so I could have even more fun with my Kitchenaid.

My husband thinks that I should tell them I took the Kitchenaid to the store and did an even exchange for the color I wanted.

The other option is to just not post my Kitchenaid or tell them and hope that by the time they see it they forget what color they got me.

160,"I’ve been dealing with really bad depression and anxiety for the past several months, and recently I think I’ve started hallucinating a little bit. Last night when I was trying to sleep, I heard various noises coming from outside my bedroom. I heard creaking, a noise that resembled the washing machine, and noises that resembled what my mom‘s TV sounds like when it’s turned on. My mom was not home and none of her stuff was on. The noises stopped after half an hour or so and I was able to sleep then. I also had a couple plushies on my bed with eyes and I set them facedown because the eyes were bothering me.

If that wasn’t scary enough, I think I had some visual hallucinations when I was driving to work today. I go to work really early in the morning, so it’s still really dark out. While I was driving down the hill I saw what looks like a turkey on the street below. But it was made out of shadow, if that makes any sense at all. I saw it walking across the street and getting bigger as I was coming up to it, but when I got really close it vanished and just transformed into ordinary shadows being casted by a lamp post. I’ve never seen anything quite like that before.

161,"Not a native English speaker and I’ll try to make this as short and simple as I can, please bear with me.

My father is a pretty sensitive guy with almost no masculine attributes whatsoever, this made people abuse him many many times, even family and friends.

His brother in law ridiculed him and caused problems in my family for years...His little religious group and only friends left him after 20 years of knowing him suddenly because of reasons I best not mention....one of our relatives managed to put him into a scheme and we lost a lot of money.....

The list goes on and on, I honestly feel ashamed and I sometimes get depressed about it but this isn’t about me, it’s about him.

My mom was physically abused throughout her childhood and teenaged years, when my dad came knocking, even though he is more than 10 years older she agreed to marry him, because of the abuse my mom became mentally ill, we only found out about it recently though, my mom goes on what I can describe as rampages sometimes everyday, about how he let people step on their heads and he didn’t do anything, how he married her pretty young and took away her youth and how he ruined her life by not making the right decisions.

I don’t really blame my mother, her husband didn’t protect her and he didn’t balance his relationship, also like I said before, she has severe mental problems.

The relationship between me and him is not good, I don’t respect him, I just can’t, I always criticize him to make him realize what he is and fix himself and it has helped but then I noticed it’s doing more harm than good and I stopped, my Dad just sits at home all day and does nothing, he has no friends and no hobbies.

Every mistake I make I tend to blame him in my head, because he didn’t raise me to be strong, He didn’t raise me to be anything, he just had kids because he wanted to.

A couple of weeks ago one of his work buddies asked my mom if she could come by his place and my mom didn’t react well to it, keep in mind this guy knows my dad from a long time, we met his wife, his sons, even his granddaughter, 

after that I felt like I had enough, I don’t want anything from this life anymore, I feel nothing.

The problem is, we have not been able to get along that much. It has come to the point that we don't talk to each other unless if it's about the work.


He mostly has something bad to say about my performance on things. If I try to make my point about why something might be A when he has mostly seen it as B, he will stubbornly keep to his opinion until I just have to give up and let him see my as an idiot. Maybe this is just my anger talking, but he seems to have no concept of empathy/understanding. He just sees the performance of what he wants to see: even if I have other things going on, he will just say ""Prioritize. Don't get distracted. Follow directions."" No shit. I'm not goddamn superman. I get that I should do task A, task B, and task C....but do you expect me to take care of it like usual when I have tasks D-Z overhead?


And yeah, I get I can be incompetent at times, but that comes with learning on the job, don't you think?

170,"So, my stroy goes lilke this.
My mom is 56 years old (I'm 20), she struggles with severe anxity ever since she was a teenager. which gotten worse as she became an adult and a parent.
I have two brothers who alredy left home and started their own life and were all very 
well connected.
for all of mine and my brothers life her anxity was present.
nights awake when we went out with friends, every school trip or vacation she has to know our constant status and god forbid we wont talk on the phone each and every day.
she's constantly suffering but she has so goten used to it she just gave up.
My father and brothers has given up aswell about convincing her to take care of herself so insted they just feed her with what she need in order to remain somewhat calm.
But I hate to see her suffer, I hate absorbing the shit I get from her when I tell her she needs therapy.
recently, I travled abroad to visit m girlfriend and just layback and get some rest. But her constant calls and anger when I asked to be left alone just a bit and she just gives me shit like I don't care made me angry so we got in a huge fight.
The situation is now is that she's really hurt and won't talk to me and I feel really help less beacuse I hate seeing her like this and I feel that if I do what the rest of my family dose she'll suffer for the rest of her life.
So what I think doing is as soon as I get home I'll try talk with her about therapy again, but this time I'll give her an ultimatum.
Either she goes to therapy or I'll leave.
what do you guys think I should do? am I right? am I acting stupid? help!

My mom has severe anxity and we constantly have fights about her not taking care of it and suffering. How do I get her to go to therapy

I am 18 years old and probably a bit rich for my age, mostly from cryptocurrency tho I already cashed all into fiat, 2018 probably a bearish year.

I went to the university, I dress like a poor kid who buys cheap shoes, oversized jeans, and a long hair. A lady on my class once said her first impression about me is a poor guy with scholarship because I attend one of the most prestigious Business university and they're expensive but dresses like a poor kid, especially because of my long hair makes me looks like homeless.

I like Soju. I always try to invite everyone to a Bar, no one want to go. Later that week, everyone went to a Bar, I am the only kid that are not invited. No one talked about it that day, for sake, I knew they went there because of Instagram.

Some people told me that people are self centered. They only want to hang out with interesting people, and I am not because I am the one that try to befriend a poor kid in the class (and probably he does not consider me as a friend), so if you're not interesting enough, you will never get invited, the same principle works for those who lose their interesting quality, they never got invited again.

175,"I'm having a big problem with my oldest friend.  Ever since the long, toxic relationship with the father of her children has ended, I've noticed that she lies A LOT. 

Since the ex, she's had 2-3 short relationships, but during and after these relationships she's always lying about things. Some examples:

- She told us (my other friends and I) that her boyfriend bought her a phone for Christmas, but when showing us some other texts from him, he clearly said that she still owed him the last £100 for the phone. So he may have bought the phone originally but he expected to pay her back. 

- She'll tell people one relationship was 8 months long when it was 3 months 

- She tells people she kicked her ex out for being a shit partner when they didn't even live together and he left her for another woman (hard to deal with I know, but I don't condone lying) 

- She's told me her current person (not serious) disappears for long periods of time, around 3-4 weeks with no contact whatsoever. I know she wants a serious relationship so I think he's a waste of time. However to other people she'll pretend she sees him regularly and never goes a week without seeing him and they talk every day.

- She will tell me she has cheated on her partner when drunk, then deny it when sober.

- I've seen her send naked pictures to other guys and then she denies it 'I NEVER send naked pictures to people I don't know'!!! Literally saw it.

- The one that really wound me up, was she said he ex had threatened to 'rape her' and I took this very seriously. I know he is a semi-decent human being and I know she lies so I asked her to show me the messages. She started deleting stuff and I just took the phone off her (trying to keep it jokey like 'er dont delete stuff, I need to see the full picture and whether you should go to the police!!). She had sent him a naked photo and he had said 'ooo sexy, gonna come round and rape ya later ;)' with tons of sexual winky smileys. I know these type of comments aren't appreciated by many, but I think it's clear he meant it in a non-violent (actual rape) way.  She knew it was jokey and had also said 'lol' and continued to text him, yet tried to slate him as some sort of rapey perv.

I can see there is a pattern here in immaturity (we are both 27), her seeing what she wants to see (lying to herself) but I'm SUCH a realist and these sort of lies really bother me. I feel like I cant have a genuine adult conversation with her about her relationship because its full of these fake facts with her trying to prove its better than it is.  I am someone who has very high morals because I believe in treating people how I wish to be treated so a big part of this is me struggling with how she treats people in a relationship.

I'm starting to think its the end of our friendship, but our other mutual friend doesn't seem as bothered about it as me. She just feels like my friend is lying to herself and it doesn't affect us, but everytime I know she's lying I literally feel this BURST of anger lol. I guess I need both advice on the friendship itself, and also how to deal with getting so irritated over small lies? I think its because I'm such a realist. I can't stand bullshit.

I should add that we come from very different backgrounds - I have quite a stable family that has given me a lot of guidance and raised me to be aware of other people's feelings, whereas my friend came from a volatile single-parent household with many men appearing and disappearing and not much emotional guidance.

I'd previously had a Pontiac Vibe, and I loved that it was a small car with big carrying capacity (49.4 ft cubic feet), but I wanted just a bit more. The CX-5 has 59.6 cubic feet, but was also longer by 7 inches, which wasn't too bad. But what I didn't realize was two things: 

* the extreme angle on the back and the giant wheel wells cause me to be able to fit LESS than I could in my vibe
* the hatch window doesn't open like my vibe's could, so when I transported lumber or things I couldn't just let it stick out a little and leave the window open.

After doing a TON of research I've landed on the Element because I'm so in love with the cargo space and the back gate, as well as AWD and lots of sporty accessories. When I told one of the car salespeople what I wanted to trade in they were *shocked*. ""You want to trade in a CX-5 for an *Element*?"" I have found one with pretty amazingly low mileage, so I'm not too worried about buying an older car, but I do wonder if I'm making the right choice?

Obviously I suffer from extreme anxiety. It’s controlled my whole life. I am an alcoholic. I went a year and a half sober until I had my first relapse this November. Been sober since though. So that being said, I see a psychiatrist so benzodiazepines is definitely out of question. Been prescribed non habit forming anxiety meds and they just make me sleepy but don’t help with my racing thoughts or anxiety. The reason I am posting this is to get help with my fear of choking. When I was 10, I choked on a mint. It was full blockage so it immediately suffocated me and I couldn’t move a muscle because it literally paralyzed me until luckily my dad walked in the room and did the hymolich and saved me. Ever since then, I don’t eat when I’m by myself. I can’t tell you the last time I ate when nobody was around. I will seriously starve my self until my wife gets home or I will go somewhere and eat when people are around so if I choke someone will be around to save me. It’s a really dumb fear I have and I can’t get over it. And when I do eat, I’m an extremely slow eater. I chew and chew and chew until it’s mush then I’ll swallow it. That’s just half the reason I’m so skinny. I’m a 24 year old male and weigh about 145. I weighed 130 through out high school and somehow managed to gain 15 pounds over the course of 3 years.

The reason I’m just now posting this is cus my wife will be out of town for a business trip and will be gone for about 3 or 4 days. And I don’t want to go somewhere and eat every time I get hungry.

                                    ——————— 

I met him a few months back and was pretty reserved then. But I got comfortable and soon enough, started joking around with him. I wouldn’t say the jokes I made were mean, at all... but perhaps he didn’t like it. 

He was a really sensitive person and couldn’t stand any jokes well. He didn’t like the fact that my friends and I chose to talk and play around instead of studying. He didn’t like the fact that we didn’t listen to his rants. To which, I admit, to a certain degree that I wish I knew earlier that he was sensitive, that I would put myself in his position. His rants were trivial (but he was always triggered), something that everyone would have probably went through before (e.g. having a teammate with a bad grammar). 

He loves to indirect on his social media accounts as well, and out of impulse, I did something - I had replied to his indirect through another indirect, but have lifted off the words he used... which is very obvious and a stupid move from me. Although what he mentioned was false, I felt bad after I posted it.

I don’t want to have any bad blood with him, I still think of him occasionally, but I am afraid that since he is one that doesn’t shares his dislikes to people face-to-face that my reply to his indirect indicated the end of our friendship.

First: I was at a party and girl approached me and said she liked the way I dressed. I said thank you but then I blanked. I didn't think it was appropriate to shoot a compliment right back at her immediately and it just deteriorated into an awkward silence extremely quickly.
Second: I'm paying at the till of a thrift store and the girl working there looked my age (19), she asked what I was reading and I was eager not to bore her as much as i loved the book. This lead to a rushed summary of the book. And after I hd payed she looked like she was expecting me to say more. I just hit her with the 'Yeah, you should give it a read. Thanks, have a nice day'.

There are many more examples and I feel as if I'm missing out on so many potential conversations. The thing is it's not as if I'm nervous, it's just the ideas don't naturally flow at the time. If you want anymore examples just ask.

https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7n3n6h/im_cutting_off_the_person_i_love/?st=JBUYEJGA&amp;sh=7dddbbfd

I talked about how I was trying to cut her off a little bit, but that was only for a pulled days. Now, everyone's convinced me to go for this girl. This girl likes me back guarantee, but, now that I'm trying to talk to her again, she's ignoring me. She just leaves me on read whenever I respond to a text she sent. This is just now starting to happen. It's gone on for a couple days. Of course, I don't do the follow up texts because I'm not trying to come across as needy. Is she losing interest? Is she mad? What can I do to fix it? Please leave any advice. It's greatly appreciated.",31Dec2017,1
191,"I got 4 wisdom teeth out yesterday a little over 26 hours ago. So it’s been a full day and I know I want to avoid dry socket as much as possible but is sex something that I could still do? It’s New Year’s Eve and while I can only give my boyfriend a few small pecks and kisses to avoid heavy making out I’m wondering if having sex with him would affect anything tonight? Also what time period should I wait before being able to normally kiss and make out with him again (ie, tongue sucking, lip biting, etc) and what about oral as well? I’ve been told I should wait at least a week before considering or attempting oral which I’m fine with. And I understand kissing has to be a minimum for a while but how long? I just want to enjoy the New Years with my man as much as possible and sex would be a pretty good way to have a little bit of fun through all of this.

192,"I have told her that I'm there for her and that I'm always going to listen to her, I've reminded her how much she means to me and how much I love her. It's not enough.
She's been having a hard time at home with her parents and she's not ready to tell me what exactly is happening. It's hard to not know, but I don't want to push her. Recently, her mental health's been horrible and all she ever says is that she hates her life and she wants to die. She said that she wouldn't actually kill herself though, because she's not capable to doing that to herself, but if she were, then she would do it. I haven't seen her in over a week because we're on break so I've just been texting her. It got really bad yesterday, and 95% of her texts just say that she's given up, she wants to die, she hates her life, and she doesn't feel like trying anymore. I've asked her if she's thought about consulting a mental health professional but she says she doesn't feel like doing anything because she doesn't feel like trying anymore. I'm not sure if seeing someone would be an option for her because her parents are the main cause of this whole thing, and I don't know if she'd feel comfortable talking to them.
I really don't know what to do. It's so painful to receive her texts that just say she hates her life, over and over again. I cried my eyes out last night, I thought she was really going to take her own life. She didn't reply to my texts for 3 hours and I thought she was really gone.",31Dec2017,1

195,"Okay I met this girl on tinder 2 months back. I've never gone out or even met anyone from an online site so it was my first time doing that. We talked a little over some coffee and we ended up smoking the next morning in her garage. About a week later we text a little and shes about 40 minutes away and i decide to go meet her and drive around. It was at like 1am so I guess it was sorta like a booty call but for some reason that never crossed my mind, I just wanted to see her again. So we end up hooking up in the backseat of my care for 4 hours and it was my first time ever.

Then a week goes by since I send a text and she finally replies telling me she was in the hospital for a week and didnt have her phone on her. She told me she was in there for depression which she told me she was diagnosed with. Another thing was that she just came out of a 1 year relationship with some guy that she told me she was in love with. I thought there whole thing was over with so I decided to keep talking to her. 

A couple more times we hang out, we end up hooking up most times, but we did other things like out to dinner, movies, even painting pottery. So I thought things were going well and I realized I was really into her and she seemed to like to hang out with me so I assumed it was all good. About a month into knowing her she broke her phone and we barely talked outside of the time we saw eachother in person, she would use snapchat on other peoples phones to message me and we would make plans to hangout through there. One time she signed into my phone and then left it when she left, I didnt want to snoop around but I saw a recent name was her ex boyfriend. So being really curious I read their chats together and theyre saying how they still love eachother and how they want to be together but cant because things are ""too fucked up"". She talked about him with me and was really open about everything in her life, she said he was really controlling and was really needy and her parents hated him so they broke up. 

I know that I shoulda ended things there but me being smitten by this girl I wanted to keep on seeing her. We hung out a couple more times and she signed into her snap on my phone a couple more times and each time there would be new messages, so I was really curious why she was still seeing me while talking with him. She said she didn't want anything serious because she wasnt over this guy and I said thats okay and just kept with the fwb thing. Until recently we kept the fwb thing going and she even came over to my house and met my mom and stuff so I thought she was getting over the guy and starting to like me more. One time she stayed the night without telling her mom and they filled her missing and the cops called and i drove her home to find 3 cop cars waiting for us and I had to explain the situation to them and her parents. Her parents seemed to like me and were mad at her because apparently she does this alot. 

I had and still have no idea how she really is outside of with me because when we hangout its only the 2 of us everytime, I havent met any of her friends and the way she talks about them they seem to not like her very much (one time we were supposed to go to her ""best friends"" house and hang out but she said it was too late and told the girl and I we couldnt come anymore. So i start having thoughts that shes like the crazy girl in school, and there were many many signs about her being crazy. She told me she was 18 when we met, when she was 16 (turned 17 a few days later, and I was 18 now 19), she lied about how many guys shes been with (said 2 at first then it changed to 4 then to 5, and its now 6 including me), she asked me to prom when she barely knew me and I thought that was odd because she talked to a couple guys that she knew better than me, and she was in and out of the hospital alot for depression and stuff. Knowing all of these things I still continued to see her.

 we hung out about a week ago at my house and ended up sleeping together and she fell asleep until 7am so I was scared as hell her parents were gonna call again, but thankfully they didnt. A couple days later I think things are fine but she calls me and says we need to talk. I say ok and she tells me that she can no longer do this with me because she doesnt know what were doing and she cant do anything serious because of her feelings of her ex. I say okay wow you can just throw me out of your life that easily after all that and she doesnt really seem to care all that much. Until i send her a text explaining what i thought of this and what she did was kinda hurtful. 

She texts me 3 hours later basically saying shes sorry and that she doesnt want to lose me and that she instead wants to take things slow and that we cant sleep together. She calls me and tells me she slept with her ex again that day and thats why she broke things off with me, im like cmon wtf but i knew i shoulda seen it coming and she tells me she could see herself happy with me in the future. I just kinda listen and dont say much, and eventually she says she needed to be with him one last time and now she knows she doesnt want to be with him again.
 Also that night her ex boyfriend texted me saying hes sorry and stuff, I say whatever man and go on. The next morning she texts me saying that she talked to him but that she thinks that me and her should take a break apart and become better versions of ourselves. I still really like this girl despite all of this somehow and I kinda agree to it and say if we ever meet sometime in the future we can see if itll work out. 

The next morning I text the guy about her and what was really going on, he thinks and says theyre most likely getting back together even though she told me last night she was going to end things with him. She never told him any of that but I did and he seemed confused and pissed. Eventually he tells me shes unstable and really unhealthy mentally and that he loves her and wants to marry her. I'm like okay I really need to move on from this girl because they love eachother and she doesnt really care for me at all, but I just cant stop thinking about her and the time we spent together. She was the first girl and only girl I've slept with and really the only girl I've gone on multiple dates with, so im thinking that could be the reasoning behind me liking her so much. I keep trying to deny my feelings for her but I feel like im in love with this girl somehow. We are still on the break thing but I think it might end up being for good unless I contact her again, but i gave her like 70$ for a prom ticket that she asked me to go to in June. Were probably not going to go to this prom so I want to get my money back but I cant really contact her right now, and I also dont believe she and her ex are stable together. Theyve broken up and gotten back together a couple times the last couple months and he seemed like a very regular mature guy who is tired of her shit. 

I want to move on but I just cant imagine myself liking another girl as much as I liked her, I cant picture myself ever forgetting her either so its driving me absolutely mad. I havent stopped thinking about her at all since it got broken off only about half a week ago. 

Should i continue to keep trying with her because my feelings for her are so strong and I think she would make me happy. her and her ex both say they love eachother and want to get married but i cant bring myself to believe it to be true. I guess im asking for anyones advice on what to do next and how to move on from here. 

I want to know your opinions of her and of me and her ex, I wanna know what is worth trying and what I should do. I really believe im in love with her and it hurts alot to see her love someone else so much. I dont want to move on but I feel like there was no closure because she wanted to take a break instead of ending it. I cant contact atleast for a while either so I dont know what shes thinking. I know her and her ex are still in contact and they talk alot to eachother. He really cares about her alot as he told me, but i want to be there for her too but I have no way of doing so.

 I have no clue what is going on and I feel like im not the same person as I was before, I changed more these last 2 months than I did in the last 2 years. I am making improvements to myself because I keep doing alot of things to keep my mind occuppied and myself busy so I can stop thinking about her. I find myself checking her instagram every now and then and theres nothing new ever, so I dont know whats happening with her at all and if I should actually wait for her or not.

Obviously he can’t be doing this, and if we try to bring him in he just runs around out of reach. I know it’s not wise to chase him. He’s also smart enough to realize we are just baiting him back in with a treat and refuses it. This dog is not attention starved, we walk him or take him to the dog park everyday. He even gets car rides with us. On warm days I will even go out with him, but the moment I step back inside he barks for me to come back out. I don’t know how to stop this behavior.

Current: making 96k(USD) in Los Angeles doing software support &amp; training for a hospital system.  Commute is about 1 hour each way.

Offer: 80k plus 10k sign on bonus as a data analyst, 20 minute commute.  Will be using identical software along with salesforce, avaya, and possibly others.  I also received an email from the manager offering her commitment to getting me certification in hospital software (this is hard to get because you need to have a hospital recommendation/backing).  

Concerns:
Is the email offering certification legally binding?  

New team is brand new, recently formed in past 6 months so room for growth.  Also means less direction/guidance since they're pioneering new project.

Ive been with my current team for 3 years and things are pretty good.  Nice team to work with, my manager is awesome, work is EASY.  Reasons to leave are commute distance &amp; no opportunity unless i leave team.

 My cousin gave us 2 months to leave. My family are waiting on income tax to come and to go on from there. We're, or just me, are going to look for an apartment. With me only working, it's hard to even live off that because we lost work and they cut my hours and only working 6 or 7 hours, If lucky 8. Making 10$/hr and having taxes taken off. Now making roughly about 270 each check. 
 I have no schooling in college and already graduated high school. I'm thinking about getting 2 jobs because my mom cant get one atm. I had a plan with me and my brother but he's somewhere else and plan isn't in action anymore.

207,"Three weeks ago, a person I know (named H) had a party. It was particularly in a ghetto location, and lots of drug busts and gang activity goes on there, so I opted not to join obviously. Plus, my close friend, who I’ll call B, was having his own party at his own house, therefore I was set to go to that. 

Now, I have a female friend (we’ll call her E) who I am very close to. She’s always been very popular (keep in mind we’re at a D1 USA university), so naturally she’s inclined to party a lot. On this particular night, she was all looking forward to going to H’s party, staying how it was going to be “off the hook” and “wild”. She then asked if I would drive her there, since I said I wouldn’t be attending. 

I had already planned to go to B’s party, so therefore I said no. She got a little upset, and made a morbid joke saying “I’m going to die, and it’s going to be your fault.” Later, E informed me she found a ride, therefore I was satisfied. I made her promise she’d be safe, and that was that.

I went over to B’s house, and party picked up around 10. Was fairly normal - beer pong, weed in the back, guys hitting on girls, all that stuff. Around 2:30 AM, I text E to see how she’s doing. No response, I thought that was fine. Party continues, I make out with some girl, and pass out around 4AM. 

Now, 6:13AM (I remember the time vividly) comes, and B is shaking me awake. I look around, confused, and see everyone looks kind of nervous, and they also appear to look sick to their stomach. B tells me to check my phone, and as I do I see about 90ish texts from my friends and random numbers....all asking me about E, however no texts from E herself. 

After reading the text messages with panic, I gathered that E had lied to me, drove home by herself, and crashed about 3 miles from the party. Her body was ripped apart, and she was in critical condition at the hospital, after being found by an old couple who heard the noise. 

I rushed to the hospital, furious and scared at the same time. When I arrived, the nurse told me she had died. I remember simply feeling numb and confused, and then drove back home. 

Wasn’t really until the end of the day until it hit me. I was watching ESPN (yes...watching TV after my friend died) when it all came rushing in, and I screamed for that entire night. 

That was three weeks ago. Her funeral was a week ago, and the entire time I didn’t say a word. I felt incredibly guilty, and almost didn’t show. I felt like the murderer. 

Every night I asked myself *why?* Why did I not drive her? It wouldn’t have been that hard, I could have skipped the party. The rational part of me tells me it is her fault - she lied and killed her self with her stupidity, but I am angry with her, angry with me, and angry with the world. 

I simply needed to put this into words. This is a throwaway for obvious reasons, but this is the first time I’ve told anyone that she asked me to drive her. Everyone just thinks she died in a car accident, with no correlation to me. 

I have not seen a therapist yet; I am a college student and can not afford one. I simply wanted any advice the Reddit community might have.

213,"Hi, so there's this girl I've been friends with since I was 14, but we never got that close until the past two years since we go to the same college. We've also gotten a lot closer because she helped me get through my breakup with my ex boyfriend of over five years who was my first and only lover, which I appreciate so much. I've never had any feelings for her until the friendship became more intimate and affectionate. Honestly I was oblivious and I guess in denial about my feelings for her; I kind of just swept it under the rug and self-proclaimed my feelings as a strong, platonic friendship. 


Recently I've come to the realization that I truly do have feelings for her, and I've known for a while now - even before I felt anything romantic for her - that she has feelings for me. She never specifically told me, but I found out through another friend. However, she's always been confident that her feelings would never be reciprocated. 


I don't know if I should just follow my heart and pursue a romantic relationship with her because 

1. I'm afraid of losing her if something goes wrong at some point. She's my best friend, so I don't know if I should just keep it that way or risk the chances of dating her.
2. I don't want to hurt her. My ex boyfriend broke up with me more than once before because he had an issue with me. No matter how hard I try, I feel like I can never really completely live up to the expectations of my loved ones. If I hurt my ex before, who's to say I can't hurt her too? She's such an amazing, beautiful girl with a heart of gold. The thought of ever possibly hurting her just kills me. 
3. My dad's quite traditional and conservative. He isn't the most open-minded person, so I know he'll be upset if he were to ever find out I'm with a girl. Maybe some day he'll come to accept it, but not for a while at least. 
4. Coming out and being open about my sexual orientation is going to be a struggle because for so many years, everyone including myself thought I was straight. I'm also a really private person, so coming out to my loved ones will be even harder. 
5. I don't care for this one as much, but I know there's going to be judgment from at least some people. I love that society's more accepting of the LGBTQ community now, but there are still some people who look down on and shun individuals of the community. 
6. No biological children. Honestly I've always leaned towards not wanting to have any children to begin with, but if I were to date her and she ends up becoming the love of my life who I spend forever with, we for sure wouldn't be able to have biological children. 

But at the same time, my feelings for her are so strong. She's truly has one of the most beautiful souls ever, and has done so much for me without me even asking. She's gorgeous, her personality is basically flawless, and I just love spending time with her. 

Sorry this post is so long, but I've just been conflicted for the longest time now and would love some advice as to whether or not I should follow my heart or if I should resist pursuing a relationship with her due to my concerns above. I'd appreciate any advice and opinions!


Thank you!",31Dec2017,4
214,"I’m a 19 years old girl living in austria. 2017 was really the worst year of my life, I went through abusive relationships to toxic friendships to losing someone I loved to suicide. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and other mental health problems a long time ago but I never really was suicidal until may. Because of my depressions I couldn’t really concentrate on school so I have to repeat my 4th year (out of 5) that’s also why I have lost all my old friends. It took me 4 years to really find friends in my class since I have social anxiety and it’s really torturing for me to find a new group of friends who also would do all the projects we have to do together with me. I’m in so much stress right now that the only thing I can think about is to end it all. I’ve told my mother many times that I need a therapist because I want to die and I’ve told her many times that the school would end up killing me but she just doesn’t care. I don’t hate life, in fact there’s so many things I love and I want to do such as drawing, music etc but my mother has different expectations of my life. All she cares about is money whereas I would be happy just making enough money to live. After my friend committed suicide last month I thought “that’s it” and that I would commit suicide before the christmas holidays end and eventhough I’m getting better now the first thing I want to do when I think about going back to school is that I just want to commit suicide. My mother is also a strict muslim, eventhough I love her she’s just toxic the whole time. She tells me I’m possessed because I’m an atheist, she screams the whole time without any reason and I want to cry everytime because living in this house is just painful and she would never allow me to move out no matter how old I am. But recently I’ve been thinking why not just run away from home? My best friend lives in Germany and she has told me many times that she and her father would be okay with me living there. Should I really consider it? I would save up money from part time jobs and just live at hers for a few months until I find a job and live on my own. What do you guys think? Is this idea too irrational? Do you know anyone who’s done that? I really just don’t want to feel like dying every day.",31Dec2017,10

I didn’t, but I’m one of the newer guys in the kitchen, and I’m patient, so it didn’t bother me much. I think the quality of my work speaks for itself, but I don’t feel great walking into my bosses’ office with just that. Any tips that could help me get one would be greatly appreciated.",31Dec2017,1
221,Recently a coworker asked if I care about someone and my face got hot and I couldn't really answer their question(I just said sure). I have no idea why.

222,"I'm a senior in college and I was originally assuming I would go back to the city I grew up in.  But more and more, I'm (dramatically) losing friends (stories for another time) or simply growing apart from them, and especially while I've been home for the holidays this year, the city keeps bringing up memories that I don't exactly want to be constantly reminded of.

It seems like this would be the time if I wanted to leave.  I have several friends doing just this - they are moving to D.C. first, then figuring out where to work and live once they get there.

Where should I go?  What is the best city or type of city for a recent college graduate?  If you had the option of moving wherever you wanted, where would it be?",31Dec2017,1

224,"Personally, I would never kill anyone. I’d rather die than kill someone. I also hate the devil. This is important.

Anyway, I’m sorta head over heels for a guy who kills people (he’s forced to because he’s in a gang) and he has no control over who. He hates having to hurt and kill people. He also worships the devil, he said because he sold his soul. I love him so much and he loves me back. But I’m worried that I’m committing a sin by not doing anything? I pray for him, and I repent not going to the police; I’m never going to go to the police. I never will. I don’t want him arrested. Am I committing a sin by knowing evil is being done and not doing anything to stop it?",31Dec2017,0
226,So since I was in 7th grade (now in 10th) I realized I was sexually attracted to guys and my girlfriend is constantly saying how I should open up to being bi. But I’m not ready for it yet. How can I gain more confidence to be open?,31Dec2017,2

228,Hello I have some issues with my cousins.  I don't know the issue they just stopped talking to me completely.  They are both my age and since my family is really close I see them very often.  The issue is that my parents don't know about the issue and expect me to get along with them.  I try to talk to them but they just avoid me completely.  I would talk to my parents or someone older than me but then it would become a huge issue.  I don't know what even started this in the first place.  What should I do right now?,31Dec2017,2
229,"So this girl started working at my office about 2 months ago, despite the fact that we are only about 40 ft away form each other we didn’t really interact mainly because I was so busy.  But when we had to start working on a few things together I found out we got along really well.  She started messaging me for work but using emojis and making jokes.  We joke a lot with each other and she pretends to hit me.  

She’s also new in town and shy, shyer than I am, and I tend to be fairly shy.  I was thinking about asking her out to do something, but thought that it would be a bad idea.   I’m just getting fed up with passing up opportunities for romance.  I’ve passed on asking so many people out because I worked with them or got to school with them or work/go to school with them.  

I have almost know time to go out and meet people.  I’m on the verge of asking one of my platonic girl-friend to help me set up a tinder profile (she’s offered a number of times to help me  but I’ve never taken her up on it, because I didn’t think it was for me.

TL;DR:  I’m sort of interested in this one girl at work, we get along, and don’t know each other well enough that we buddy-buddy friends, but I don’t know that I should ask her out? Also, I’m just so tired of going to work and going to school and having no real romantic outlet, and was thinking of getting on tinder.  Is it worth a go?",31Dec2017,2

Although I’m not as ecstatic as I was as a little kid about them, I still very much enjoy playing with Jurassic Park and LEGO sets. Am I too old for that? I feel kind of childish but I really enjoy collecting and making stories with figures. I just don’t know how to judge on this.

233,"It all started with a boy. Which is the most ridiculous thing.
Basically, this boy and I had a romantic relationship and I ended up pregnant. Due to circumstances I ended up having a miscarriage and he wasn't there for me. I sort of ended things with him. It was in the ""its complicated"" stage.

Throughout our entire relationship my friend would always be very touchy with him. I called her out on multiple occasions and she seemed to have finally understood what she was doing. Keep in mind that this friend has a boyfriend of her own.
She was there for me throughout the post-miscarriage and even talked so much shit about him. Things like: ""I hate him so much."" ""He's an asshole"" etc.
2 days ago we had a small get together and he showed up. She ended up locking herself in her room with him and another girl that I know.
My friend was complaining about ""how her boobs don't look as good"" and all this stuff. She basically took her shirt and bra off and was asking him what he thought. She then leaned over her desk and asked ""what about my butt"" and grabbed his hand to grab her ass.
I happened to have walk in after all that had happened but she didn't tell me anything. According to the other girl that was there they both told her not to tell me.
I know that he is an asshole and I am going to forget about him. I also know that it takes two to tango and they are both in the wrong. 

But I really do value my friendship with this girl but I don't know if I can forgive her. It isn't really about the guy. It's more about the fact that she was there through it all and saw how much I suffered but she still went around and did this. She knew I wasn't over him at all. What hurts is that she betrayed my trust. I tried to talk to her about it but she left back home before I could.

Should I forgive her? It obviously won't be the same but I can try or do you think I'm overreacting. 

TLDR: Friend threw herself multiple times at my boyfriend. The last time was the final straw. She betrayed my trust. Won't talk to me about it and I don't know if I should forgive her.",31Dec2017,2
235,"To give a little background info: she's 19 and plans to start college next year. She used to get bullied in school, up until about her freshman or sophomore year of high school. She also struggled in some classes (math was the biggest obstacle, she was constantly on the brink of failing). 

I'm 16, and, I attended a private school until my sophomore year of HS. I've pretty much always been an ""excellent"" student (I regularly get scholar roll). Maybe this, along with the bullying, made her feel like she isn't good enough. 

She has poor hygiene and is slightly overweight. She says she wants to lose weight, but doesn't want to put the work in. She just sits at home on her laptop all day.

I hope I didn't sound too harsh, but I want her to be happy in her own skin. What are some things I can do to help her build her self-esteem back up?",31Dec2017,3

242,"So this is just scratching the surface but I started working for a small company a little over a year ago. There is a guy who works there who I became friends with in the fact that we would take smoke breaks together and shoot the shit. I found him harmless and still kind of do. I first accepted his friend request on Facebook and he asked me for my phone number, which I gave him, thinking it was harmless again because we were friends. 

He started messaging me non-stop, and I mean non-stop. Over and over again. I stopped answering him and then he'd get mad and slam doors in the office and make a point of ""ignoring"" me, send me nasty messages. (Let me just say he was in court ordered anger management when I met him and he is very emotionally immature and paranoid). He went on my pictures and did the laugh reaction to pics of me and my bf. I finally blocked him on everything and he begged me for months to unblock him.

So I unblocked him on texting bc I just got so fed up w the environment he created for me at work. It was very uncomfortable and I figured I could just ignore his incessant texting. It still continues and then a few weeks ago I got in my car to go to lunch and there was two brownies on my seat with a note saying ""don't worry I didn't put any drugs in them"" with a wink face and a heart.

I was already fed up and this made me so angry so I went to him and calmly told him I felt like that was a violation of my personal space and to please not do that again. He got angry and didn't talk to me, did the tantrum thing I hate and just generally made me wish he would just never come into the office. 

So like 2 weeks later was xmas and I go to my car and there's a present and a card on the driver's seat. He wrote a note in the card that wasn't inappropriate but just fucking creepy and the whole thing made me angry. I didn't say anything this time.

Now, he has had multiple complaints about his behavior from other coworkers of mine and I know what I should do is talk to my boss but I'm apprehensive. I don't want to get him fired even though I hate working with him but more so I'm not sure if he will retaliate. I haven't told anyone at work but I have pictures and text messages to prove everything which I can screen shot if you guys need me to to tell me if I'm being too sensitive.

What do I do?",31Dec2017,3
243,"I didn't even cry when it happened, I felt the pain inside and wanted to, but the tears wouldn't  even come. I don't know what to do anymore. I even have to get rid of my dog.

245,"Last New Years I went through a nasty break up and spent it alone. I was miserable the whole time.

Fast forward to last week. My best friend of 7 years (who has been flaking on plans here and there), tells me that him, his girlfriend, and three others are going to a bar for New Years and he wants me to go. I agree.

He tells me throughout the week to not make any other plans and to not forget. I'm looking forward to it and tell others that I already have plans when they ask if I want to go to a party in the city (2 1/2hr drive). 

Today comes and I get a text at 2PM saying that the other three people cancelled and now it's just me, him, and his girlfriend and he asks if I want to do something else (also calls off the plans for the bar). I suggest we go to another bar where a lot of people usually go (I just turned 21 two weeks ago so I haven't really been to many) and he just tells me that him and his girlfriend are just going to stay in tonight.

I'm mad because he told me to not forget and to not make any other plans. I didn't and missed the chance to go to some New Years parties tonight in the city, but now it's too late to drive because it's snowing and the roads are nasty to get to the city.

Should I cut him off for a bit? He's been flaking here and there but we do talk over the phone mostly every other night. I now have nothing to do for New Years.. again.",31Dec2017,8
246,"I feel constantly and heart xcrushingly alone. Every day I struggle with these terrible feelings of being alone in the world and no one caring about me. I’m 20 years old yet I feel like every day just drags on in sadness and depression. What’s wrong with me? 
I text my friends not daily but every once in a while and I usually go see them, especially if I’m feeling particularly depressed. I am currently broken over a girl that I keep seeing on and off even though she’s dating another girl. My parents kicked me out when I was 17, and I live with some friends now, who do treat me like family, but we butt heads a lot becaus they are very Christian and I have a distaste for it (though I do respect it). I just feel I like I never have anyone to lean on except myself, and it hurts so much. Why do I feel like this?

247,"This may be an easy task for some people, but I suffer from a bit of anxiety, which makes me question how to do this, or even if I'm doing the right thing at all.

At work, we have a vendor who is new on the job.  He is overwhelmed with all the responsibility, and he is not getting his work done on time.  He says he will have it done by the end of the day, but of course, it is not done.  So, I approached him for 3 days in a row.  Each day, there is a new excuse, and another promise that he will get it done by the end of the day.

It has  reached a point where this needs to be reported to his supervisor.   But how?  How do I introduce this problem to the supervisor, who previously knew nothing about it.  My fear is that I will look like a complainer, when in fact, I've been as patient as I can afford to be.",31Dec2017,3
