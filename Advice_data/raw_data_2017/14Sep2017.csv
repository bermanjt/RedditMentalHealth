0,"My dad, a 41 year old man who's cheated on my mother for 4 consecutive years and gave her an STD that he got from the woman he was going to abandon our family for, has now decided that I'm literally the devil because I didn't do the dishes fast enough because I'm not a full time medical employee like he is. He and my obviously brain damaged mother are now kicking me out because of this minuscule incident and I'll be homeless. 

I really just want to fuck their day up. ",14Sep2017,11
1,"I asked my dad to look over my essay for my college apps, and he said that I sounded too ""egotistical"" by using too many ""I's"" 

when I looked over the changes he made, he basically deleted a majority of my ""I's"" and as a result, all of my sentences were fragments and sounded incomplete. He even went to the extent to change things from ""my mother"" to just ""Mother."" 

When I went on to explain to him how the common application is a personal essay, and not a technical writing, therefore I have to use first person to write the essay, he got all frustrated at me, saying that I came off as ""selfish"" and ""egotistical."" I argued, saying that this was just how you form coherent sentences in writing a PERSONAL essay. I'm the subject of the essay, so it's absolutely necessary that I should use first person. Also, to justify to him why ""My mother"" was right over just ""mother,"" I gave him examples of essays from published examples. (Doesn't ""mother"" just sound so informal? it's HIS mother, OUR mother, etc. Mother is relative, and it's just general english convention to specify whose mother you're talking about) 

However, he just refuses to accept that I'm right. He then rambled about how he got a perfect score on the writing section on his TOEFL and yada yada yada. Basically ""Im right, you're wrong, and I'm smarter than you"" 

I'm an ABC (American born chinese) and he's a first generation immigrant. His first language is Chinese, so obviously I have a better understanding of english conventions and grammar than he does.  it just baffles me how he thinks he HAS to be right about everything, even when english isn't particularly his area of expertise. 

To clarify, I'm not frustrated about his lack of knowledge about English. I am, however, frustrated that he just cannot accept that he is wrong about his lack of knowledge about English and must put others down in order to justify himself. I would gladly teach anyone about anything, given that they can accept constructive criticism. 

So my question is the same as the title states: How do I go about dealing with ignorant people who are intent on thinking they're right? ",14Sep2017,3
2,"I'm 17 years old and since the age of 12 or so, I've had the dream of either being an author or television / film producer of some kind. I know, the chances of it coming true are astronomically low. But it's always been a dream.  
But in the past 6 months, I've lost all my motivation to try achieve this dream. I've lost all my confidence. I'm miserable. I just don't know why that is. Nothing drastic or terrible has happened to me in these 6 months to put me off it. I still want to chase the dream but I just feel like I can't. Any suggestions as to why this may be?

Just to be clear, I'm not trying to be a cringy, attention-seeking teen ( although I probably am coming across that way ) and I feel so childish for asking for advice. I just feel so unmotivated and as if I'm not good enough to even attempt to succeed. ",14Sep2017,1
3,"Long story short my sister has dropped out of college once right before my Mother's second bout of cancer ... Coincidental timing and now cancer has sprung up again with my sister saying she isn't even gonna attend college this semester making her a 2 time drop out. She threatens to commit suicide all the time and when we attempt to get her counseling she doesn't even go. The worst part is she tells my mother ""either give me a lethal injection or fuck you because I never was asked to be born and I'm your responsibility."" We ask her what her plan is and she always answers with fucking ""I don't know."" We tell my mother to kick her to the curb but she doesn't want to do that. Honestly I'm worried this time the stress will actually kill my mother because we have a terrorist living in our household. How do we deal with this in a civil manor?

Edit 1: Probably relevant but my sister broke up with boyfriends around both these times and we grew up in an affluent neighborhood full of female children who have an abundance of self-esteem/social issues.

Edit 2: Apparently wasn't clear but my sister is very, very, very emotionally abusive towards every one. She literally has the vocabulary of a swearing sailor and treats everyone the same.",14Sep2017,45
4,"I always start some half assed exercise routine, and end up stopping after a month or three. Then to start again later because I wanna be in shape, but I honestly hate the feeling of it. Pushups hurt and I can barely do 20 (on knee position; I'm not strong). Squats and lunges aren't as bad, but still. I have the easiest routines, but I still hate it and fall back to bad habits (ie not exercising because it just feels better to not do a thing). Depression doesn't help my cause, of course.

7,"My grandma is 90 years old with Alzheimer's. She requires full time care. This has fallen on my mother the past year or so. My mom has 2 siblings, one of which is a piece of shit so that's out of the question and the other provides help when he can but he doesn't live terribly close (about an hour away). My brother and I both live in other states so we can't help her directly.

My grandma doesn't have enough money for nursing home care and neither does my mom or uncle, so they've been relying on in-home caretakers from companies like Visiting Angels and others. The problem with this is the lack of caregivers. My mom lives in a very rural area about 45 minutes from the nearest town of any note. Very few caregivers will come out to her house. The ones that do have not been working out. She's had to fire multiple caretakers after repeated no-call no-shows causing my mom to have to miss work. She finally found another but just last night she discovered that this one has been stealing from her and my grandma.

As if this wasn't enough stress for her, I haven't even mentioned that my dad passed away about a year ago so this all started soon after that. And she's struggling at work, she's a co-owner at a small business that isn't doing well.

Average height, build, etc. I am introverted like crazy (very shy) but lately I have been really pushing myself as uncomfortable as it is ... and NOPE. NOTHING. This is really starting to get retarded. People always say ""take risks"" ""ask her out"", ""talk to her""...but it seems like the past few weeks when I have been taking huge risks and doing that stuff I'm still getting rejected. Rejected meaning getting no call backs or no responses. Do I have to really lower my standards.. and or start to go after prostitutes?  It's like I'm a hurt hopeless man and just want to give up and live my life on my own. Atleast I won't ever feel like a piece of shit.

9,"I was homeschooled since 5th grade, now i should be in 11th grade but i took an 8th grade math test and got a below 40 on it (my mom won't actually tell me my real grade though so its probably pretty bad) and like a 20 on the English.

I was in a small room with like 3 more students, my sister and a teacher when I had my panic attack (I have an anxiety disorder + other things). I'm so embarrassed now like wtf is wrong with me?

Anyway, the school counselor told us we had 3 options. 1: drop out and get a GED, 2: stay in school BUT only be in special classes and we'll probably graduate when we're 19-20, 3: just go to normal classes.
She kept talking about the GED though and basically told us that was our best option.

Once we got home a different teacher called my mom and told her that the counselor should've never said that and that i should be put in special Ed, which honesty kinda pissed me off. I don't wanna be put in a class full of disabled people? 


What should I do? I don't know if I would work hard enough on my own to get my GED but being around so many people gives me anxiety?

So should i drop out and work towards my GED or should i do the special classes?

17,"I work in the banking industry and have spent the last two days in training and was supposed to be in training tomorrow as well. We had a tournament competition among all the class attendees and I made it to round 2 out of 3. At the end of round 2, the observes (people that didn't go past round 1) picked the winners from round 2. I was surprised at who was picked and in a comment to a coworker I stated that I was surprised Ally (not the real name) wasn't picked as I thought she had done a really good job. The girl in our tournament section overheard and got upset with me, apparently thinking I was slighting her, then tried to involve other people standing nearby saying ""can you believe she's getting upset that I was picked?"" To which I interjected that ""No, I'm not upset, I just was surprised that Ally wasn't picked."" I left the conversation, thinking it was done and over with. Well, apparently it wasn't because I got a call from my manager on my way home from the training telling me not to attend the training tomorrow, that he had received a call from one of the instructors and that I just needed to come to the branch and work tomorrow instead. When I pressed him for details, all he would tell me is that his manager, so my boss' boss, would be speaking with me on Monday and also with the girl that I made the initial comment to about being surprised who was picked. So now I've been excluded from mandatory training because apparently this girl went to an instructor and complained and instead of getting my side of the story they took her at her word and apparently I'm now in trouble.

21,"This one is going to be kind of long, but I tried to only include information that was vital to the situation and keep it straightforward and to the point, thanks in advance if you read until the end.

My girlfriend at the time had planned an outing that day, one that took us from her apartment from the early morning until some time in the evening. We both go to the University nearby, and I'm pretty much always at her apartment. Her neighbours, a boy and a girl at the time were also students, at least that what we thought at the time, and we were all going to be staying in town over the Summer, so we decided we should try and reach out to them. They were awkward, but a bit more than awkward. Something seemed off about them, but we are both awkward as well, and they were just a bit younger than us, so I personally (I'm not sure how she rationalized it in her own mind) believed that they were just younger and more awkward, but that it would pass once we all started to hang out and get to know each other. Basically we were trying to be nice and maybe make some new friend that summer. Anyway, that was just a little background the premise our relationship with these neighbours. 

So, the day that she and I went on the outing we were also planning to hang out with them once we got back, and I was texting the boyfriend. I didn't say explicitly when we would be getting back, but an indication could be taken from the language I was using, fool that I was, thinking nothing of it at the time. 

She and I got back to her apartment early, and I pulled into the garage, and began unpacking and laying out the Kayak (part of what we has been doing) so that it wouldn't smell like shite the next time we wanted to use it. As I'm doing so I hear her yelp from upstairs, and immediately make my way up the stairs towards our apartment, and while I'm climbing the stairs I hear talking and laughing, and assume that he was in her apartment. This gave me a bad feeling, but we have a few friends who let themselves into our apartment before (something that I would never do, but its a college town and it is something that a lot of people that I know do). When I get up the stairs there is this weird tension in the air, and he tells me that we had left the backdoor wide open, which is a total lie, and that he had only just arrived when my girlfriend came in. 

I told him to join me in her living room, and just to be sure my girlfriend searched our bedroom to see if anything was missing. She came back out and discreetly told me that there was a bunch of cash and maybe some jewellery missing. At this point I start seeing red, and the only thing that stopped me from tuning this kid up was that I knew that he would call the police (there was some altercation months passed at their house and the cops were called, though I never got a chance to find out the details), and my thinking was this:

1) I could confront him, ask him about the money/tell him to empty his pockets. He would deny it, and if he did, short of beating his ass and running his pockets, I didn't see any way for it to end without me doing just that. I'm black, and if I tuned him up there is no doubt that he would have called the cops, and if he didn't have the cash on him (I didn't know how long he had been in our apartment since we weren't there) he wouldn't have been charged with anything, but my assault (which it would have been, its degree based on how well he could defend himself against me or how far he wanted to take it) would have been plainly visible. I have taken and do take self defence courses in my spare time (three summers ago I took a Krav Maga course for the first time, though the Summer before that on I took a Muay Thai course that was more advanced as I've taken the course with the same instructor before), not to brag but I know how to handle myself and I had him by at least 20lbs and he is generally...wimpy. If it had turned into a fight I had no doubt that I would win, but if I really beat his ass out of rage, or because he would rather fight me than hand it over, if he had it on him, I would certainly have gone to jail. Even if he did have it on him, he might get Burglary and an assault charge as well. Like I said, my girlfriend and I were and still are going to University, and the last thing I wanted was to beat this guy to a pulp and have an Assault charge on my record, so that didn't seem like an outcome I wanted. 

2) Tell him to leave. 

I chose option two. She then tells me that when she opened her door she wasn't sure at the time, but that she was now sure when she though she saw him making his way from the area of her bedroom as a blur, and that he turned around in her kitchen, which is where the backdoor is, and started smiling and said he just came in to see if we were home. We also look to see how he got in, and we see that the window next to our backdoor is unlocked, and (I knew this already, and I've even remarked on it to her) the kitten window is so close to the backdoor that, if we left it unlocked, one could open it and easily unlock the backdoor. We also see, at this point, that things like the dish washing liquid and things like that were knocked from that window seal into the sink, like someone did just that. My girlfriend didn't want to confront him or press charges, and I couldn't press any charges (my family doesn't have the resources that hers does, and it was her apartment)I said fuck that; that I would at least go and confront him at their house - I did not want him to think that he had gotten away with anything or that we didn't know. I went over, told him to give back the money, and when he refused I told him not to contact us or come around anymore.

The next morning, however, I heard his car speeding off and his girlfriend yelling after him. At this point she knows that he stole the money, I was sure, so I went outside to confront her and tell her that he needs to give it back. While I'm talking to her she tells me that she/he/they we scared that we were planning on calling the police, and I assumed that he was moving stuff out of his apartment that he wouldn't want to be there if we did so. My girlfriend is next to me infront of her apartment at this point, and the boyfriend comes from the direction of their backyard, having parked his car elsewhere, and has a chain wrapped around his fist. He started threatening us with the chain on his fist, and in less than 5 minutes the cops pull up (we lived across from the local fire station). Now, with everything that was happening, she decides that she should file a report and press charges. We believed that, with the fact that we came back to find him in her apartment, with the missing cash and jewellery, and the fact that he was outside in broad daylight threatening us with a chain that he had wrapped around his fist, that something would come of it. 

Also, in the course of all of this, I find out by calling the University that the boyfriend is not going to school at all, only his girlfriend is, and that he hasn't gone to the University for years. He literally lives with his girlfriend, works at Ihop 8 hours a day, and steals from his neighbour. That's when I understand that we were completely different couples, and I start to really understand the weird feeling that we both got from them. 

But I wouldn't be posting here if anything did. The police report says nothing about the chain wrapped around his hand very obviously when they pulled up, he was in a pseudo fighting stance when they pulled up, and the fireman that called it in said there was an altercation in progress. Mind you, all of this is happening right in front of her apartment, and they refused to leave until the cops showed up. But, like I said, literally none of that was in the police report (I later asked the first responding officer why it hadn't been included, and he started to stammer and stumble and mumble his way through some bullshit about not having seen it, but also said that the chain did not seem like a big one/real threat or something along those lines. Obviously he couldn't have not seen it, but also know what it looked like, but this was at his court date and I didn't think that arguing with the officer about it would do any good), which still baffles me if someone with some experience or knowledge would like to fill me in as to why. At this point, I'm just chalking it up to him being god damned lazy and too long in the tooth. He was arrested and taken to jail in handcuffs (which was a great thing to see), but was bailed out the next day - part of me hopes that he had to use the money he stole from us to pay part of it. The charge that ended up going to a Court Date was Burglary. 

I thought he might have at least had to do community service, he had to pay his bail so he didn't get to keep the money he stole (hopefully), he was taken away in handcuffs, and he would have the Burglary charge on his record. Fine, I said, that will have to serve in the place of me stomping him. But, the court date arrived, and we are told by the DA (or whomever represented us as the prosecution) that it is just he-said-she-said, and that it would have to go to trail if he wanted to fight it (this is out last semester in this town at this university, so we didn't want to commit to that, and that even if it did we might not have a change - since it was all, apparently, hear-say. I thought that since she and I got back to her apartment, that he was there, and that the money was stolen, that he would at least get something. But, we ended up having to drop the charges, since we didn't know how long that kind of this would take (neither did the DA apparently) and we are going to be moving once we graduate. 

My question, reddit is this:

What should I have done? 

Looking back, I guess I could have started recording with my phone or something as soon as I learned he had let himself in. Short of that I'm at a loss. At this point I'm frustrated because it seems to me that we would have had to literally catch him in the act of stealing, and that we must have recorded him doing so for it to be anything except for he-said-she-said. 

This was really shitty, but I want to hear what other people think I should have done so that I can sort of, you know...maybe have a better reaction than I did this time if something like this ever happens again.

* There are less than 20 clubs on campus. All but 2 of them are for those in specific degrees (AKA there is a Medical Assisting Club, a Dental Hygienists Club), so I can't fit in any of them. The other 2 are honor societies, but the deadlines to join have already passed.

* My local MeetUps are only for those 21+. Many MeetUp groups involve going to bars every week. Some others have age restrictions (Ex. XXX City 21-30 MeetUp).

* I used to volunteer at my local animal shelter. Usually only one or two people volunteer at a time... and it's never people my age, usually just older adults and young kids (since, you know, animals).

* I do work. I am one of the oldest workers at my job (everyone but the managers are in high school), and I don't feel very connected to them. It feels like we're in separate stages of life, and I don't have much to talk to them about. Gossip? I don't know the people they do. Classes? We're taking totally different ones. 

I feel lost. My boyfriend has had his friends since the beginning of high school, so about six years now. They're all great friends. And I really have... no one. He's mentioned that he wants to meet my friends sometime, but I don't have any.

It's not just for him, though. I want friends for myself. I don't want to have to see movies or walk downtown all by myself when I don't have plans. I want to gossip and have sleepovers and have fun with other people. But I guess it's too late for sleepovers now.

And I guess I'm coming to the realization that my birthday is in a month and I will have absolutely no one (except the BF and family) tell me ""happy birthday."" No one texts me. No one bothers to look at my Facebook or message me. Hell, not even my classmates will bother with me since I'm quiet and not as smart as all of them.

32,"I want to get up and do something about it, I'm so sick of feeling like I'm not good enough for anything. 

I'm 16, my grandpa is an asshole, I was taught not to question anything, I don't know what to do, and I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

But I've thought long and hard about what it is that has been holding me back, and I've written them all down in my journal. I'll go ahead and leave them here for everyone else to read, also. 
But first, let me just say this is pretty big for me personally. I never wanted to admit I had self esteem issues because it made me feel like I was pathetic. Maybe admitting it to people I don't know will help a little? Either way, they run pretty deep and affect my life in such a negative way I'm always afraid. 

First, I feel like nothing is real. I feel like everyone who says anything good about me is lying because they feel sorry for me, even without a reason too.

I feel like I'm always wrong, even if I'm right. I have no confidence in my own thinking ability, and have always depended on adults to tell me what was right and wrong, even as a young child. 

I'm afraid to say how I feel in fear that others will get angry, upset, or will somehow verbally attack me for it, which feeds into me thinking I'm always wrong.

I feel like I have no authority or right to speak up. 

It doesn't help that everyone else has told me there was never anything wrong with me, so I've been in denial for so many years, while simulataneously feeling like something was wrong with me and the way I think. 

I have a counselor, I just don't know how to express how I feel out loud in words. It also doesn't help that my grandpa is an emotionally abusive asshole, and i keep falling farther into the pit. 

Would the best course of action be to tell my counsellor? What about my doctor? I just, don't know. Nothing feels safe.  Also, I'm sorry for such a messy post, I just want to get straight to the point. I didn't want any mundane details that don't help.

35,"I've always thought that using the internet or using apps to find a partner was the epitome of being a loser. Recently, after a couple of years of using tinder as way to entertain myself and having fun talking stupid stuff with strangers, one girl convinced me to meet each other on person (yes, she was the one who convinced me).

To make the story short, I feel that we clicked, we had a great time together and I feel there's a good chance that something can come out of this if I just try, the problem is that the way we met bugs me to no end. I know that I will never be able to fully commit to something genuine with her because deep in my heart I feel like a loser for finding her on tinder.

I like her a lot, both physically and her personality and she knows it since I am pretty straightforward with girls about those things.

36,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about six months now. At the beginning everything was fresh and fun just like every new relationship is, but the fire kinda started to die as the months went on.

I now find it hard to be excited when I see her and I don't find myself seeking out her attention. She is super into me but I just don't feel the same. 

I know when I break up with her, she is going to be absolutely crushed and I can't help but feel sad at the thought of that. For that reason, I have been putting it off for a while now, and I know that is totally unfair to her. 

I don't want to prolong an empty relationship, especially when she is unaware of the fact that the relationship is that way. She is genuinely a wonderful person, but I just don't see her in the romantic way anymore. 

How do I go about breaking up with her without crushing her? Or is there not a way to do that? And if that is the case, how do I go about breaking up with her in general?

37,"Hi all, on September 13th, around 9pm eastern time (us and canada), I've received an email stating that someone has or rather, attempted to, buy something worth $460 (or multiple things that add up to $460). Paypal, being the service it is, declined the transaction when it detected that someone was making the transaction in a suspicious area or on a suspicious device. This could be the result after losing my wallet two some months ago. My wallet contained EVERY thing at the time, my bank cards, drivers license, social insurance number, cash, everything. I had everything on me at the wrong time unfortunately.
Here are my questions: What should I do? Is it safe to assume that whoever attempted the transaction is in possession of my wallet? This is the first time I've ever lost my wallet so I really don't know what to do in a situation like this. If the community is willing to provide some advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

40,"So I've decided to move out (probably temporarily). We've got some really shitty people staying at our house and I need a break, plus I'm 21 and I feel like I should try my hand at being an adult. 

How does this plan sound to you guys?

I'm going to book the cheapest hostel I can find in downtown Toronto ($45 a night). I have enough saved for a while and the very day I get there I'm gonna head out and look for jobs in the service industry. 

If I find a job before I've spent too much money on the hostel, then I stay in Toronto and keep working there. If not, then I move back home, refreshed from my break, and hopefully our guests are gone by then. 

Does this sound reasonable/ well-planned out? The hostel is in a great location with a library nearby for when I need to print resumes, there's job hunting and museums and stuff to keep me busy, and I can always see friends/ meet new people too. 

What do you guys think? Any advice for someone attempting to do this?",14Sep2017,3

1.	I have a bachelors in civil in engineering ( from India)and in June I will finish my masters in construction management in Melbourne 
2.	I don’t like what I’ve studied and think I’ll be any good in this field but this could be e just giving up before trying
3.	I really wanted to do interior design but given the fact that I invested so much time in civil I don’t feel I should abandon it
4.	I can stop studying construction management this semester i.e. my 3rd sem and get a graduate diploma and maybe enroll into a diploma course for design

What would you guys advise me to do? Continue, learn and stick to the civil field.. Or maybe work for a bit and then pursue interiors. Also, I am 25 at the moment.. don’t know if that matters much.

Recently, school started again for one other person of our group, and suddenly that's when everything changed.

No longer do we play or chill together and when we ask him where he's been, he tell's us ""School made me feel the change, and hanging out on discord and playing games together just isn't good anymore. There are more better things to do with time such as socializing and etc (which I agree, playing games repeatedly is definitely not a good use of time).

From then on, he rarely comes on Discord (a online social platform), and we rarely play any games together.

I'm 21 years old, and our group of friends range from 20-24.

Is it me that is not accustomed to change, not accustomed to difference, not accustomed to people moving on.

45,"Disclaimer: Yes, this will make me sound like an asshole.  I'm kind of getting down to the wire though and honestly, it's bad manners that I don't want to continue enabling.  He's a good kid, I would like to continue trying to be a good person.  I don't want to be bad or a jerk.

Here's the scenario: I have a family, a wife and two kids.  We have a neighbor who is a single mom with a 6 year old, same age as my oldest.  My daughter plays with him all the time, they are awesome friends and I'm glad they have eachother.  Love seeing them pretend and whatnot.  We've been neighbors for about four years.

For the past year and a half, he is constantly butting in our business.  It was cute for a little while, but I'm honestly tired of answering to him.  Whenever we go somewhere, he always opens up his door and asks us where we're going.  What we're going to do and so on.  It's in a way that comes off like we have to answer to him.

If he ever hears us or sees us doing *anything*, he walks right into the middle of our activity and asks us what we're doing, and follows up with more questions.  Last week we were eating lunch at a table on our back porch and he walked up the steps right up to our table and started asking us all these questions.  

Today, my daughter was crying because I found her doing something very dangerous and I yelled out of surprise, which scared her.  Parenting is hard, and by 8 p.m. I'm running on fumes.  So she was crying and I was calmly trying to talk to her.  The neighbor kid comes POUNDING on our back glass door.  I ignored it and kept talking to her.  We were visible to him, he could see that no one was hurt.  He just kept knocking, knocking, knocking, knocking, pounding, and when I finally opened the door and said (a bit irritated), ""Hey man what's going on?""  He replied, ""Umm why is (my kid) crying?""  I said, ""Because she's in trouble and that's all you need to know.""

I felt like a dick, but it's wearing me thin.  I don't want him or his mom to think I'm a jerk to her kid.  She knows he's very nosey and is trying to get him to stop on her own accord, but I'm running out of patience.  

How do I tell this kid to mind his own damn business.  I think he wants to be a part of our family or something, he asked his mom in front of us if he could live with us.  Really uncomfortable situation for everyone.  I was raised by a single parent, I was very similar to him when I was his age.  

I want to be a positive role-model, I'm the only adult male between our two families and I feel like I need to set a good example for him.  He doesn't have a dad, due to some choices his biological father made.  

Maybe I'm a dickhead for even thinking to ask him to mind his own business.  Maybe I should embrace the opportunity to let him be involved.  But it's really bad manners to insert yourself into other people's affairs and business, I don't want to condone it.  I'm getting emotionally charged when I think about it that I might really snap at him one of these days.  I haven't said the words, ""It's none of your business,"" or ""Mind your own business,"" ever to him.  I feel like that's the line where I am officially an asshole and I haven't crossed it yet.

It's like, I care and understand that he is very interested in us.  I feel like how I handle this will have a very lasting impression on his outlook on life, and I have to be mindful about that.  I don't want him hating the world because that family he grew up next door that he wanted to be a part of rejected him.  That shit can fuck kids up.  I know.

46,"I've worked with this guy everyday for 3 months. Nice dude, very political but not in your face. Got a strong opinion on everything, the kind of strong opinion you can respect even if you whole heartedly disagree. 

For months he's talked about his old wrestling career, how he used to be one of Canada's top wrestlers in the late 90s and early 00s.

Tonight I decided to Google him, see if he's got any old matches on youtube or something, see some old stats he had, or something.

I found one mention of his wrestling among articles and articles of a child pornography conviction. He was sentenced 5 years for possession and selling child porn in 2002. 

Now I don't know what to do, I know he's probably turned his life around, I can't find anything besides a news update he was released from prison in 4 years.

 I'm willing to bet he's turned his life around and doesn't want to talk about this with anyone. However, he shouldn't be talking about his old wrestling career like he does if he really wants to try and move on. 

How should I go about this? Tell him I know and what my advice is? Pretend I don't know?

What if one of my old college buddies wants to reconnect one day, and they can't find me? The only social media I have are reddit, neopets (lol), and snapchat.

51,"Hey everyone sorry if i shouldnt be asking this here. I had never used an account to ask for advice about anything serious here in reddit. 

I (17M) and my girlfriend (16F) have been in a long-distance relationship for about 6 months. We are both from Venezuela. She moved to Chile around March 15th. I have plans to move to Chile too (with my family) before the year ends but it has been delayed cause the tickets are too expensive and we are having some bad luck.

So we only talk online and we havent seen each other since she left. I have known her and her family for 4 years now (she was in my school, same year as me). Her mother and her father got divorced and she now lives with her mother and her step-father (whom her mother had another son with).

Today we were talking late at night as usual, and she confessed me this. Now keep in mind this is a rough translation and it wasnt written in a single paragraph but you'll hopefully understand.

&gt;about 4 years ago [she was around 12] I was with Cesar [step-father], and I was massaging him or he was massaging me, i dont remember. Thing is, i fell asleep, and i know he started tickling my belly then he started going up and he grabbed my boobs, and he stared at me like..    
-But i was pretending to be asleep. then like i started moving and he left.    
And you remember in my house - at mom's, there was this little window to my room. well idk but when i was getting dressed, well he watched me from the outside. and when i got out of the room, he said to me ""Look, i want to ask you something. When can i see you naked again?"" even worse mom came in after that and was like whats going on? and i said nothing and left.    
i told mom one day. she was arguing with me, and i told her. but she never believed me. She said ""how is he gonna grab your boobs when he has mine?""    
at some point mom confronted him, and he obviously told mom it was a lie.    
god i still remember when i told mom about he touching me and she told me i was crazy and stuff.    
And one day, we were in the elevator here. and he kissed me in the neck... I was in shock I swear... since that day I've been shaking like crazy for everything.    
and i even remember some time after mom confronted him he apologised to me

We were talking and I was in such a fucking shock, well i was asking her if she has tried doing anything about it other than reaching her mom. After that she asked me ""can we stop this?"" and told me she was shaking so much again.. so i tried not to keep touching the subject.

This happened about 2 hours ago. She just went to bed and I cant stop thinking about this my mind is a clusterfuck and even though i feel like something must be done, I dont know what or who to reach.

If this shouldnt be here then please redirect me to the correct sub asap. If anyone has any questions needed to help me out more i'll try to answer just please tell me what i can do.

53,"So my boyfriend (25) and I (25f) have been together for a little over three years, living together for half of our relationship.  Long story short, I've been in and out of relationships since high school and never really made any time for me. Recently I've been (obsessively) thinking about moving somewhere new, where I know absolutely no one so I can have a fresh start. Only problem is I don't want to force my bf to go, and he doesn't seem interested in the idea to move away either. He has a great career here and his family is near by. I, on the other hand, hate my job and where we live, and quite frankly, am only staying here for him.

Lately, I've been feeling like over the past 3 years, I have sacrificed my happiness to be with him. And don't get me wrong, he's great and I love him, but I don't love me and I think that's a HUGE problem. I know ""running away"" isn't the answer, but I feel like if I put myself in a situation where I'm forced out of my comfort zone, then I'll be able to learn a lot about myself. 

ANYWAYS, even though my bf is supportive of my decision, but doesn't ask questions about where I want to go/why I want to go/when I'll be back. I basically said I want to do this and he said ""okay"". There really wasn't a discussion after and it's been bugging me. He tends to be pretty passive aggressive so I'm thinking him not saying anything is basically showing me that he's upset and angry. 

Am I wrong to want to do this for me? Has anyone done this before? Should we break up or is a LDR worth it? ",14Sep2017,1
55,"I'll say this up top, I kind of suck at keeping things short, you could skip to the final paragraph at the bottom and pretty much get the gist of it.

--

I like to think of myself as a creative person. I've written stories all my life and am pretty good at coming up with things on the spot, even making up some lore to go with these things off the top of my head. It's not deep engaging stuff since I'm just saying whatever comes to mind, but it helped me out a lot in school for presentations and debates and the like.  

As I got older I wanted to find new avenues to express myself in a creative way so I started learning computer programs. 

I started with Photoshop and learned how to draw, edit photos and pretty much everything that goes into the program.

After I learned that I moved on to music, I've played the piano and violin a lot growing up but stopped some time around high school. Now that I am post-college I wanted to try my hand at composing my own music as apposed to learning how to play other people's. So I learned how to use FL Studio.

After I learned how to use that I found myself wanting to know more. Since I've learned how to work well with sound and still images, the next step seemed to be video editing. So I started to learn how to use Sony Vegas. 

Throughout learning Photoshop, FL Studio and Sony Vegas something I've realized is that I'm great at coming up with these ideas in my head. I could think up a million and one things in a second and even plot out a detailed strategy as to how I can go about it and in what order I should complete these tasks, making little tweaks along the way or changing out segments to something else. Actually **finishing** the project and being happy with it seems to be impossible for me however. 

One of these three things seems to happen every time I'm working on something. Either I get tired of working on the project at hand and bail on it. Or I've watched/looked at/listened to it so many times that I grow sick of it and convince myself it's not good enough and stop. Or I just turn my brain off, stick to my original road map I drew up at the beginning and just complete it feeling dissatisfied. It seems that for every one thing I put out there, there's another 100 things in my W.I.P. folder that I'm not going back to. ",14Sep2017,1
56,"I'm really insecure when it comes to relationships. As a teenager, I was the crazy girlfriend who controlled everything my boyfriend did. My boyfriend at the time was the same way, so it felt justified. When we broke up, I vowed never to be that person again. Now I struggle with expressing my emotions/insecurities and don't know when it is appropriate. I'm always afraid I'm just acting like the crazy girlfriend.  


Now I'm dating this guy who I think is really sweet. It has only been about 2 months since we actually started dating, but I've known him for a few years. He's my neighbor, but we never really got close until recently. I know his family (they live next door too), and they all say that we're great together and that he likes me a lot. He's introduced me to his extended family and his friends too, and has told me he wants something serious.  


I didn't start feeling insecure until recently. Last week, I was looking through his snapchat (he was right there and gave me permission) and saw him talking to this *really* pretty girl. She sent him something I couldn't see anymore (he said it was her in a homecoming dress), and he told her she looked amazing. This bothered me a lot but I didn't say much except I didn't like him telling other girls that. I was really calm about it. I feel like this sort of thing would be nothing to most people. Before he and I started dating, he was trying to date this girl. He told me about this when we first got together, but said he didn't really talk to her anymore. Now I've noticed him talking to her a few times (her name pops up on his phone). I don't want to ask to go through his messages all the time, but he said I'm welcome to whenever I wanted. He also had a picture of her saved to his phone, but I think he's deleted it since.  


I haven't seen him much this past week and a half because he has been housesitting for his brother during the day. But I've noticed he doesn't make as much of an effort to see me or talk to me recently. The only times I've seen him were really briefly because he had to leave or something, or if a couple of times when he needed me to give him a ride somewhere. I'm the type of person who wants to spend at least a small amount of time almost daily with their significant other. I don't know if this is overly clingy of me, but it's how I feel.  


I've been used in the past and spent my time around some bad people. My closest friend (who I am no longer friends with) would take advantage of people practically every opportunity he got. At first he didn't do it to me, but slowly I noticed him doing it more and more. It hurt me a lot, but I won't go into details right now. My past experiences make me paranoid other people are taking advantage of me or using me in some way, and I don't know how to tell whether they are or not. I worry my new boyfriend is doing it to me.  


I don't know. I really don't have anyone to talk to about this stuff, so I appreciate anything that anyone has to say. I know this is a very new relationship, but I like this guy a lot and I'm afraid I'm going to mess it up with my insecurities.   


Edit: For context I am 25, and he is 20. His age is another thing that makes me worry.

60,So very recently Ive been quite bored.  I just graduated and im taking online courses in college and I dont have a job. Ive been applying all over the place but for now I have nothing to do. I used to be really into video games but now I havent been recently. Also all my friends have left for either the army or college. So most of my time im sitting in my room bored out of my mind. Anything advice? thank you. ,14Sep2017,1
61,"On the surface if you were to meet me you wouldn't think anything, I'm not bad looking, can communicate fairly well, the problem is my core personality.

A lot of this I didn't realize but in retrospect, I've always been off beat. As a kid I hated hot wheels and sports and instead wanted to play with bugs and liked stuffed toys over action figures and nature in general. As an adult, I'm a straight male that coincidentally is only good at things associated with women.

I'm bad with tools, cars, woodwork, etc. and yet I excel at things like seeing, growing plants, art, fashion sense, etc. but from a relationship perspective women just don't want that, they want a more standard man that can work on cars and likes sports and stuff. I don't know why I ended up this way, but my whole life I've just always liked those things. 

From a career perspective, why I like also doesn't work. None of what I mentioned pays, even sewing. I made dog clothes for a few months for a lock pet store before the owner got arrested but outside of that, I couldn't even be a sweatshop worker because I'm not bilingual.

When I see both sides failing tremendously bad, I feel like I'm never going to belong anywhere, why I like and what I'm good at isn't useful for finding women or making money. How do you change your personality?",14Sep2017,9
62,"Here's the story : My father was married, had an affair with my mom, they fell out but she found out she was pregnant soon after, he left the area for work at the same time, and she kept the baby. He had already two daughters, they are 8 and 3 years older than me I believe.

I grew up with a single mom and I have not even seen a picture of my father. I'm not sure he knows I exist. When I graduated highschool I decided to look for him, but so far he has been pretty much not findable on the internet. Besides a thesis record from 1995 and some justice record from 10 years ago (in which I learned that he is divorced from his wife and did not have his daughters custody), there is nothing, not a clue as to where he is or how to contact him now. I'm wondering if he's dead. I found my half-sisters pretty easily, and have had their contact info for years.

I'm 23 and they are 26 and 31. They live 3 hours away from each other and did pretty well in life.

Because I didn't know their exact current family situation, I decided it was not wise to contact my half sisters first. I did not want to barge in and ruin their possibly fragile relationship. I do not know if my father knows I exist, I don't want to come in like a wrecking ball. The plan was to contact my father, then meet them through him. So, for 7 long years I have waited for a sign of life of him on the web. Searched and searched. Procrastinated a bit, too. But I've had enough, time is running, and I have decided to contact my two half sisters.

Ideally, I'd like to get to know them, meet them at least once, and if we get along, have some kind of relationship. I would also like for them to give me a way to contact my father.

The problem is that I am not sure at all how to proceed. I have their professional email adresses and professional phone numbers (they have office jobs). I reckon email is best. I wrote some drafts but I am not sure what to say. Basically for now, I'm saying I exist, explain in a sentence how I happened, that I have waited for years to contact them because I wanted to find my father first but I have exhausted my options and I regret barging into their lives like that. I try to present myself a bit (it's hard, how do you resume your life to unknown family in a few sentences ? It's worst than an interview...) and attach some photos. Tell them I would like to get to know them and have a way of contacting my father.

Is there something else I should say ? A way of making things go smoothly ? Should I make a long email or should I keep it short ? Something I should avoid ? What should I say about me ? How do I ensure maximum probability of them being interested and not run away ? If they did not reply or did not want to know and meet me, I would honestly be extremely disappointed.

Basically I'm taking any advice at this point. Thanks for reading.

PS : I am 100% sure they're my half sisters, we really look alike, my father's last name is extremely rare and specific from a small island, and genetic testing indicates I'm from there.",14Sep2017,2

69,"I am currently in my third year at college, in a small town in the Southern United States. I have lived my whole life in this small town. The majority of my friends moved out of state after we had graduated from high school. I've been continually trying to make friends with classmates or social clubs located at my university or on Meetup but I haven't been successful yet. The friends I still have that live in this state I rarely see either due to: a) flaking out or b) I've had to cut them out of my life due to developing drug addictions. My family lives in town but I have had to severely limit my interactions with them due to manipulative behaviors. I was in a relationship for five years with someone who would often: threaten suicide, have a mental breakdown if I did not respond to any call or message with five minutes and accuse me of infidelity with any other women. I finally dumped her in January of this year and blocked her phone after she started messaging me every time she saw me in public. I started using dating sites after I felt ready to start dating again and it has only led to some disappointing dates and one night stands. I have been severely depressed since last year and have worked on slowly digging myself at that hole this year through therapy, trying different antidepressants/anxiety medication, and no longer using marijuana and alcohol to cope. Even though I am doing better right now, I want to take a semester off from college because I'm uninterested in the degree my parents brainwashed me to study at the college they compelled me to attend. The only issue I have with that, is if I take a semester off it will be highly unlike I will finish college due to financial insecurity. I also have high functioning Asperger's which while most people don't believe me when I admit it, makes life inevitably harder. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",14Sep2017,1

71,"I'm currently having a very hard time attempting doing this. Without going into much detail... I originate from very bad stock. Father is barely literate (I've never seen him read anything in my entire life and he regularly mispells simple words) Mother seems slighlty more functional but is still kinda dull and dim witted. The things I have an interest in pursuing academically I simply lack the intelligence to actually pursue (IT, CS). I've struggled with basic math my entire life. (I'm convinced I probably suffer from dyscalculia if not simply just overall low IQ) On top of all that I have severe social anxiety and have the social skills of a 10 year old. I also know this has to be genetic because I have siblings (and cousins, uncle's) who also aren't doing that much better than I am at the moment and we all were made from the same ingredients.

I see no way out besides winning the Lottery or ending it all with a quick suicide.

What's sadder is that I know I'm probably not alone.

73,"I've always identified as straight. 100%. But lately I've been thinking what the hell, why not try to date a girl. See how it goes. My friend at work swears I'm bi and always teases me about when I'm gonna come out the closet and I've been very adamant that I'm straight. 

I've always found women to be attractive. And I'll admit I've looked at other women before and thought they were hot and even had a few girl crushes. I never thought twice about it at all.

But for some reason, I had a lesbian dream about 2 weeks ago. In my dream some girl kept flirting with me and for some reason I'd flirt back and would go places I never do, like church, just so I could see her. It was weird because we never did anything physical, just harmless flirting. And when I woke up I was very confused but it was like something in me just changed. I actually decided to check out some lesbo porn and it wasn't actually bad and I wasn't like grosses out or anything like I thought I would be. 

And just last night I had another lesbian dream. But this time i went on a date with a girl and we went to the beach. She was cute but she was kind of an asshole so it wasn't a good date lol I just find it weird that I've now had 2 lesbian dreams.

It's weird because now that I'm thinking about it, if i did date a girl I'd want to be the provider, and work, and have basically like a house wife. Some cute petite girl I can come home to and have my house kept nice and good dinner and when I get paid I can give her a couple hundred bucks and spoil her. That type of life does really appeal to me.

At the same time though, I find that I like real manly men, with beards and muscles and be more dominant. But if I were with a girl, I'd want to be the ""guy"". 

None of it makes any sense to me and I don't even know if I ever could actually bring myself to be intimate with a girl.

I do have the natural protector and provider instinct though.

75,"OK, first off please forgive me if I'm posting in the wrong place; this is my first time posting on Reddit. Also I'm sorry for the ramble-y nature of this post, my head is just really spinning right now and I need some help. Thank you so much in advance for anyone who can offer any information or advice.

So first a little backstory. I have a music YouTube channel with 1k subs (not a huge following, but I've uploaded over 100 videos over the last 6 years and the engagement is pretty consistent). 

Last week I did something really crazy. I emailed the president, vice president and a few other higher-ups in the company I would most want to be sponsored by. I mean like, this would be my lifelong dream come true. I don't want to be too specific, but its a cruise line company that owns multiple ships. Basically, I sent them a video introducing myself and telling my story as a musician, and explaining why I would want to be sponsored by their company. At the end of the whole spiel, I said something along these lines: ""I hope you'll consider creating a position for me as a sort of 'songwriting ambassador' for your cruise line, filming music videos and vlogs for my channel from various locations on the ship and the different locations you take your passengers to"". Cheesy-sounding wording, I know. And I know I was also a bit vague, not like super specific on what I'd want the arrangement to look like. 

Well, within 3 days I received an email that went something like this:

Dear ___,
Allow me to introduce myself. I am _____, VP of entertainment on _____, and I report directly to (insert the name of the president of the cruise line here). I would like to work with my assistant to get us together on a call as soon as we maneuver through the hurricane. Talk Soon!

So as you can see, he expressed interest in the video/email I sent, but didn't provide any details really beyond that. So I guess what I'm asking you all is, does anyone have experience with this kind of thing or know someone who does? Do you think this has the potential to be a legitimate sponsorship opportunity or am I overthinking things and jumping the gun here by getting excited? 

Thank you so much for any help or information you can provide. :)",14Sep2017,1
76,"I am currently employed working retail. I absolutely love who I work with as well as my direct manager. It's the rest of the job that sucks ass. Corporate has been dicking me around for the past two months about a promotion I applied for (they reposted the position to the rest of the company after I applied) and despite my rave review, they declined to give me a raise because I had been late. 


Additionally, despite being told that I am doing well, they took away the additional responsibilites that I had and gave it to my coworker (while my manager is on vacation) and then my manager will ""take over"" aka have my coworker do all of it.

So esentially I have been feeling very disrespected and extremely unapprciated. 

Now, I have all but been offered a job (took a drug test today for them) that pays better is closer to my work and seems more suited to my strengths.

79,"I'm a freshman at my university, and I'm currently taking Principles of Programming, and I'm learning C#.

I have been doing well in class, and in the labs. Everything has been going well. Until tonight. I was working on my homework assignment to code some simple math expressions and equations when it hit me: I have no idea what I'm doing. I've been in the class almost a half a semester, gotten 100s on all of the labs, impressed the professor a little bit with some of my code, but I don't know how I managed to make it this far.

I sat at the computer for an hour with zero idea how to do any of it. The worst part is it's entirely my fault, I understand that. I've had 2 weeks to do this assignment, but I've been putting it off. It's currently 1:00 am and I have to have the code and output (that I couldn't even get because visual studio wouldn't let me debug my code) printed out and submitted in class in 8 hours. And I can't afford to just skip the class because the first test is next Tuesday and we'll be reviewing everything we've learned so I have to go.

I feel like I'm not cut out to be a programmer. I hate everything about what happened tonight and it makes me so fucking annoyed and angry that I've wasted my time, and I don't know what else I can do even if I make it through the semester. My major is Computer Game Design and Development, but I can't even code. To make matters worse, I feel like my entire teenage/ young adult life, I've been shoehorned into being the computer guy despite me never touching any form of script. I feel useless.

88,"Hi, I dont know if this is the right place to talk about this but I just need to vent out, I currently have no one to talk to and need some opinions and adivice about this...


First I want to introduce myself:


I just turned 19 a few months ago, I am currently studying in university and I live in Mexico, I come from a medium class family (I don't know if thats the right term for that). My passion since I was a kid was creating things in general: drawings, comics, sculpture, stencil, crafting stuff, photography and video making, the one that really stuck on me and changed my life and the way I see it. I have never really put any attention of what I wanted to be ""when I grow up"" until in recent years, where it has pretty much overtaken my life.


I showed interest in audiovisual content since then and I still do, it's my passion. I have always been a very lazy person but when it comes to the stuff i'm passionate about, theres not a limit for me. I put all my energy on it.


Okay that is the context of who I am and what I like, I will try to go straight to the explenation: In the summer of 2014, I started experimenting more than usual on this video creation thing, and long story short, I was able to monetize my work. I am very proud of what I have accomplished but I think I have a new set of problems right now and it has pretty much changed my whole personality (I believe). I started my video making ""career"" since then and I have enjoyed it a lot, I have met tons of cool people and I have learned so much. I feel very strong with all these advantages i'm lucky to have at this point in my life, but its getting under my skin. 

This is my problem:

I have this strange opinion about success in life, about making money, earning a living etc. I don't talk much about it with my parents but I have made the decision that I don't want to be like them. It's so weird to think about it and say it but my goal in life right now is to ""leave the nest"" as soon I can, I want to simply go and start my independent life. My skills and all the knowledge ive gotten these past 3 years (thanks to the people ive met and the life my parents gave to me) have let me to recieve legit job offers, freelance offers etc. with a very good monetary reward. It is worth mentioning that 1 dolar = 18 pesos, which is why getting paid in dollars is such an advantage in countries like mine.

The point i'm trying to make here is not that with these job offers I can make a living, what i'm saying is that all this work i'm doing has let me to reducing my social skills, making less friends, being more awkward around people simply because I have some weird ass goals in my life right now. I also get this constant urge to just drop out of school but I don't think I have the balls to do it. My question is, should I continue my life the way i'm doing it right now or should I push the break just a moment and try to think more about the situation.

I work too much, I go to school, and at the moment I have 4 pending projects to do I legit feel like i'm going insane. I don't know if I should continue this over worked life to try and reach my goals when i'm older or return to my normal life where making videos was just a hobby.

92,"I am a straight male. I have been attracted to my cousin since I was very little. I know on some level that it's wrong -- at least, that's what most people would say. For my entire life, I have never spoken about this attraction to her, mostly because it is taboo and I don't want our family to find out. As a result, I have kept my distance over the years, only having the briefest of conversations at annual family gatherings. I always assumed that it was only me who felt this way, but recently I got some strong indications that it wasn't.

Just for a little perspective, despite the fact that I have generally kept my distance from her family, I have always felt a stronger connection to her than the rest of them. She's a really cool person, and we just click. It was only within the last couple of years that I finally clued into that. Our relationship has grown stronger as we've built up trust.

Last week, I was visiting friends and family in a different city. My cousin lives with her girlfriend there, and they were among the people whose places I couchsurfed at. As it turned out, they were the most hospitable out of all my other friends. Go figure.

I stayed at their place for two nights. It didn't take long for things to get really interesting.

The first night I was there, the three of us just hung out for a little while, listened to music, talked, drank. Usual stuff. Then my cousin went to her room to change, except she came back out into the living room with only underwear and a t-shirt on. She had no inhibitions whatsoever about giving me a little more to look at, and I think she knew that I liked what I saw.

(Now, bear in mind, the two of them are absolutely drop-dead gorgeous, inside and out. Just two of the best people you will ever meet in your whole lives.)

This got me really fired up, so, of course, I had to go rub one out in their bathroom.

The next day, when they got done with work, we all went out for dinner. Food was great, and so was the mood. At some point, I started to feel my cousin's g/f lightly caressing my leg with her foot. The first time, I thought it was by accident, but then she did it again. The whole time, she was smiling at me.

After we got done with our outings for the day, we headed back to their place. We were all just about to go to bed, when she peeked halfway out from her bedroom (again, only wearing underwear and a t-shirt), and asked me, plainly:

""Is there anything else you need?""

Of course I responded by politely declining, but on the inside, I was firing on all cylinders. They then proceeded to have sex in there, not fifteen feet away from me on the other side of the wall. They didn't try especially hard to keep quiet, either.

It's only been a couple days since I left town, but my mind's still racing. Were those invitations I was receiving? What stopped me?

This is totally uncharted territory. I don't have anyone I can talk to, and I'm at an almost total loss as to how to proceed. I have it nailed down to three choices:

1. I message her now and ask her to clarify their intentions.
2. I wait until they're in town, and out of earshot from family.
3. I wait until I'm back in their city.

I don't want to wait to find out, but I have a feeling that, whatever I do, I need to tread very carefully. This is potentially life-changing stuff. Either way, I don't want to live the rest of my life not knowing how they feel. The problem I face is that I'm too scared to even *ask*; I fear that, at best, I would get rejected and that things between us would be more awkward for a while; at worst, that I would simultaneously ruin two friendships and strain or even break family ties, all just for the sake of having lived out a fantasy.

This is almost all I can think about right now. I'm losing sleep over it. I'm doing just about everything I can to keep myself distracted, but it's not working. I know I have to do *something*, but this indecision is what's killing me. Please help me, Reddit. DMs are fine.

**TL;DR:** I have the hots for my cousin and her g/f. I recently got some signals which I interpreted as invitations of a sexual nature from both of them. Out of fear, I chose not to see where they may have led. Now I'm trying to figure out what to do, but I have nobody I can talk about it with in real life.",14Sep2017,0
94,"For context: South African universities don't allow you to take random subjects and choose a major as you go. Here you have to register for one specific degree/diploma and take all the subjects specified in the syllabus. So I have to choose between the one or the other. 


Pros and cons of each:


Botany pros: Mostly free, as my husband works at the university where it is offered. The qualification is a BSc Degree, which is one ""level"" higher than a diploma. There are more options for post-graduate studies and specialization. 


Botany cons: Very scientific information (I want to be able to run my own nursery/greenhouse, so would prefer practical, usable information). I would have to be a full-time student, which will not really allow me to do all the ""wifey"" things I like doing like cooking and gardening, etc. 


Horticulture pros: Part-time, online studies (I can then still be a full-time wife or work to help pay for the diploma). Practical, usable knowledge (I have scanned the modules and all of them look like things I am interested in- plant propagation, landscape design, nursery management, etc). 


Horticulture cons: Diploma. Not free as it is offered at a different university (the one where my husband works doesn't offer horticulture). Very narrow field of work and does not offer much other work/post-grad study options.


That's basically it for the pros and cons. My main dilemma is that I want to do horticulture more than botany, but the fact that I can study botany for free and still do the same work afterwards is making it hard to decide. But the botany subjects are VERY scientific (like plant biology, eew), and won't really teach me anything. It will basically just give me a nice certificate that can get me jobs at nurseries or botanical gardens, but no actual usable knowledge. 
...But it's free... So I am really, really struggling to decide.

Also, this will be my second degree, (I already have a degree and honours degree in English and Mathematics education that I'm not using) so I don't want to do another degree that will just go to waste or that I just have to force my way through to get a qualification. I actually want to learn something this time.",14Sep2017,1

98,"I'm a freshman in high school, and I was faced with a wide choice of language lessons, from which I was to choose two, one with four hours a week, and the other one with two. So, I chose to have four hours of English, and two hours of German (I'm in Europe).

The thing is: I'm already good at English, and the German lessons are an exception, so there are six hours of them instead of four. A simple choice, right? Well, the additional German starts at 7 AM on Friday, so I'd need to get up at 5, which is not great. Also, not to boast, but this is the best school in the city, which makes me pretty scared.

I feel like choosing German would be tough... and better. What do you think? Thank you for any thoughts.",14Sep2017,1
99,"Hello kind wonderful people,


I have finally decided that I want to go back to school and eventually get my Ph.D in Cognitive Neuroscience, so I may be able to study and understand the human mind. After years of researching different techniques and models to study consciousness, from all cultures and philosophies, I found mindfulness meditation being the best tool we humans have to explore and understand our conscious mind. To be able to train your brain so you're mindful and completely aware of yourself at all times, is what I hope to spend many years researching and being able to teach that to others.
To help understand the human mind and brain in more depth, I realized going back to school to eventually get my Ph.D will help me contribute to ""solving"" the hard problem of consciousness through my research. I also plan to help spread mindfulness meditation to all public schools in the nation, teaching both teachers and students. I see mindfulness as a tool to optimize human health and performance, by allowing us to be completely present and not irrationally reacting to our surroundings. Which is why I recently became certified as a Mindfulness meditation practitioner taught by Dr. Deborah Norris and in the process of opening a wellness center in my area this fall.
Do you guys think it is worth the time, money, and energy in getting a Phd so I may educate the public and scientific community about the importance of mindfulness meditation? Will going down this path help me understand the human brain and consciousness in a way that I may be able to help educate our entire society to live a more enriched life? Any advice or tips I would greatly appreciate. Thank you for your time!",14Sep2017,1
101,"So i have a cousin who will be going to the same uni i'm going to. She's two years younger, we're not super close but we hang out a lot at family parties, we get along well, better with each other than our other cousins our age, and have things in common, but i've never been with her and with people outside our family.

I'm not going to be protective of her or anything, like she makes her adult decisions i make mine, but should i be somewhat responsible for her, like making sure she's safe? Our family knows we're going to the same uni so i feel kind of obligated to watch out for her. If she parties too hard or drinks/smokes i won't say anything.

I might be one of the few people she knows and can easily reach out to at uni. We're at different ages, so i'd think the maturity level would be different too, i'm in my 3rd year of college, she's entering her first. I personally wouldn't want to hang out all the time but since she's family i feel like i have to be there if she needs me. I doubt she does, i hope she won't need me, but she's young.

103,"This is my first time posting something like this and i'm also on mobile, so I apologize in advance for any spelling or grammar mistakes.

Here's a little back story; my dad passed away in 2007 from cancer. He was the only man my mom has ever loved as deeply as she did and  after 10 years the pain is still there and I don't believe that will ever change. When my mom and dad got together and had me, she was 20 and very VERY thin, like 25"" waist and 5'8, gorgeous. She hated how thin she was, and after having me, and then my brother 5 1/2 years later, she gained quite a bit of weight. My visual memory of her back then is a bit blurry, but she wasn't as big as she is now. After my dad passed, there were a few gray years that none of us can really remember. I was having my own eating issues and was hovering around 105 for a long time- but this isn't about me. 

My mother has had a lot of health complications since my dad passed. She developed a tumor in her uterus that had made her gain a tremendous amount of weight and we had all just thought it was from grief. The tumor was the size of a keyboard and the thickness of a thanksgiving ham, if I could find the photo and knew how to post it, I would. So after the surgery to remove the tumor, mom shrunk down a bit. Around 2014 she started seeing an old highschool sweetheart and that didn't really work out because he was a dick. She hasn't really dated since. Over the next few years my mom has cared less and less about her social life and the way she looks outside of home and work. 

Now we get to where I need advice. 

This coming friday, is my cousins 21st birthday, it's a pretty big deal, all the women in our family are all getting together and going out for drinks. There will be a photographer and everyone will be dressed in their sexiest outfits. Today I went shopping with my mom (which she absolutely hates doing but she agreed to come even though I wasn't forcing her) and I could see my moms spirit die after she would try on clothes. She didn't like how the clothes made her body look, or she would say that she was ""too old"" for a certain top. (She's 42.) 

She didn't even like the simple black open toed flats she tried on because her toes point the opposite direction of the curve of the shoe. My mom was looking THAT closely at her imperfections. My mom has a beautiful smile and a beautiful figure when she carries herself with confidence. But as of the last few years, my mom hasn't been herself. It feels like she's gone and I have no idea how to get her back.

As her daughter, how do I help my mom love herself again without the standard ""lose weight"" approach? This goes deeper. She's ok with her size... she just doesn't feel like who she use to be. ",14Sep2017,2

106,"Long story long, i've been living in a shared house with 4 other people for 6 months. Someone (lets call them Tyler) who is on the lease, has a partner (lets call them Cam). Cam has lived there since the day we moved in because they were between places and jobs. No probs. I can be generous, I understand life's tough. Especially when work is hard to come by these days

Its been 6 months and they are still living there rent free. From what I understand, this person has had a job for months.
They have not contributed $1 to the household.

I've asked that they contribute to the rent and bills. Tyler said, Cam  will start contributing to bills, but cam and I will not be paying any extra rent.

Their room, which is an ensuite, and the biggest in the house, is at a price of $210. 

The rest of ours teir down $20 from that each (lowest being $150)

The house is large and we have a lot of spare space + and empty room and study - the guy in the smallest room uses one of them as a sort of wardrobe and study. I have no drama with this as his room is the smallest, and he can only fit a bed in there. 

I personally think that their master room shoud be upped by 30-40$ and the rest of our rent adjusted accordingly. Tyler disagrees and thinks its unfair, as other people have use of several other rooms in the house, and no one has an issue. 


For a bit of extra info. Cam is home a lot. Tyler and cam have friends over all the time -- I have no problem with this one bit, just trying to explain that they definitely have a presence in the house.

Is it completely unreasonable to ask that they pay a little extra - as in do you think that the price is fair for their room. Obviously its hard to say without photos, but they definitely have the nicest room in the place, with a walk in ward robe, ensuite bathroom and shower. 

Im not good at confrontation and sometimes I feel like I dont really have a good gauge at whats fair or not as I can tend to be the first guy to stick my hand up and say ""thats not fair!""

My roommate has been using my spices, cooking oil, and condiments. I do not care about those things. However, it bugs me to no end that she's never asked for permission, even just generally. I feel slightly violated every time I notice. 

I'm also completely averse to confrontation – to the point where I'd usually rather suffer in silence than bring up almost anything. I can elaborate more on this if desired. 

I'd like to find a middle ground between something passive aggressive like hiding things, and something confrontational like sitting down with her and having a conversation about personal effects and space and whatnot. The former is childish and the latter fills me with anxiety, and I don't want to foster resentment or invite retaliation or generally increase the amount of scrupulizing in the house.

The next obstacle is the college close to me (30 min drive) does not have the major I am interested in, the one I want to go to is an hour away

118,"I think our first suspicions arose when her band teacher came by our house around 10pm to drop something off to my sister. My sister never told anyone he was coming or how long he was here, my mom found out later. 

Since then my sister has texted him a lot. I told her at one point that it's pretty unprofessional and she should be careful. I didn't accuse her of wrong doing. I was just pointing out that it's not common and if the school found out it would be questioned. 

She graduated this year and turned 18 in the summer. 

My mom found her old phone and read her old text messages. Theres a bunch of messages and calls to him. He flatters her, they talk about wanting to kiss, and 'be together.' There's other stuff about 'wrestling.' All of it makes me uncomfortable and kind of angry at both of them. 

My mom mentioned he might have causes her and her long time boyfriend to break up a while back. And that during the summer my sister had been worried about her periods being late. Saying it wasn't stress related, but never confirming or denying it could be sex related. From reading the texts it seems like their relationship ended up being sexual. But I really am not sure. Maybe it was only kissing. 

This is the second year he's been at our school. He is married and they're expecting a baby. He's I think 25 or 26, fairly young. 

My mom wants to go straight to the school and take all legal action. My dad wants to murder him. They both feel like they failed as parents. 

As of right now I don't think my sister knows that we know. I don't know if anyone else knows. Or if he has similar relationships with other students. They hinted at his wife suspecting or knowing. But it was unclear, some of their conversations are deleted. 

I was telling my mom we should talk to my sister first. We should drive up and hear hear side of the story and not blindside her. She's in college a few hours away. My mom said something along the lines of if we tell her she might warn (?) him. So as of right now my mom and I are going straight to the school district to start the process of an investigation I guess, I'm not really sure what happens after such evidence is presented. 

I'm just looking for advice on if this is the right course of action. If not what should we do?

He asked what job I was applying for so I told him thinking nothing of it, but he then came back to me a couple of days later saying that he had also applied for the job. At first I was thinking it was fair enough seeing as there aren't many good jobs going around at the moment, but we both ended up getting interviews and he has been asked back for a medical which basically means he has landed the job over me.

I feel like I'm not good enough for you, like I can't help you at all, like you'll never be happy with me. 

The truth is that as much as I want to help, you're the only one who can make yourself do things and try to get better. I can't keep trying without your help. It's taking a toll on me mentally. 
It's not your fault, I'm just not strong enough to stick around. You can always call and I'm happy to stay friends but I can't stay in a relationship that is doing nothing but making me sad.

128,"Um... where do I begin? Sorry, but this is gonna be a long one. 

TLDR: Mother's boyfriend is a drug abusing asshole with full custody of a two year old, Father is crazy enough to send 5k over to the Philippines to a woman who doesn't even exist, we have brave fucking rats in our home and they're driving me crazy, and Mother doesn't want me to call the cops because she's too fucking nice. My boyfriend wants me to call them instead, but I don't even know what I'd tell them, and Mother has told me several times that she really doesn't want to call the cops. Should I do it anyways? What would I even say??

Super duper long version: 

Well, things at home are pretty bad right now. I'm pretty sure my mother's boyfriend is abusing drugs, which isn't all too great considering he just fought for full custody of his two year old daughter and won. The environment here where he's raising the child isn't a good environment for her, and he barely watches her as it is. On top of that, he abuses his poor dog, has tried to put his name on the house we're all living in, and somewhat emotionally abuses my mother. So yeah. Not a great person. 

My father definitely has several screws loose and is probably a classic narcissistic parent, so there's that. However, he fell for the classic ""Nigerian Prince"" scheme, except in the Philippines and female, which resulted in him getting 5k from who knows where and sending it off in that direction. Honestly, probably from my mother and our insurance company, soooo... I don't want to say that he's a bad person, but he's kind of a dick. 

Besides those two, the house itself also has a major rat problem (probably caused by him messing up the land behind our house), and the rats are fucking brave little shits. One person has had a rat crawl up his leg in the middle of the night, and I've woken up to what was probably a rat tugging on my hair, considering that when I immediately went to wash my hair, I found a piece of rat poop in my hair. Fucking little brave pieces of shit. Five pairs of my underwear have been stolen by the rats and chewed up as well. I wish I was joking. 

The thing that is stressing me out the most is the rats, although everything else is definitely stressing me out badly. We don't have the money for an exterminator, otherwise we would've probably taken care of that by now. I ended up reaching my breaking point two days ago, and basically called my S/O sobbing. He's obviously worried for me, and told me that I should call the police. I confided in my best friend, and she said the same. 

The issue here is that my mother has let me know several times that she does not want to call the police. Her reasoning was that 1) even though both my father and her boyfriend are pieces of shit and deserve to have the cops called on them for various reasons, including emotional abuse and taking advantage of her, they still did something good for her and she'd feel guilty and 2) that she's worried that if she puts her boyfriend in jail, that he'll come back a month later and basically fuck shit up for her. Which would be bad, considering we're trying to get the house suitable for selling. 

I want to call the police. Logically, I know I should. I just don't want it to be traced back to me and I don't want to make my mother even more stressed out and worried. I don't really even know what to say when I do call them. 

I'm not really sure what I'm asking exactly, but I just really need some advice, and I figured that this was a good subreddit for it. I'd really appreciate an outside POV on this whole thing.

129,"Hey guys,

I am a senior in high school, and just recently I feel as if I am being targeted by seemingly many girls.

I am a bit weird I guess. My hair is grown out long to hide my ears so people don't see when I blush, and I've been described as effeminate. Also, I wear long pants and long shirts throughout all the seasons since I'm not a big fan of exposing my skin. Funnily enough, due to girls bullying me in previous schools, I also lock up and blush around virtually all girls my age. Yes, I guess you could say I'm insecure, but since I've done this for many years the aesthetic has kind of woven itself into my identity.

Anyhow, recently, I've found that suddenly a huge portion of the girls in my grade (about 40-50% of them) will laugh at me, especially when they think I can't hear them. I suspect this development occurred because the previous target of the girls was expelled from the school. (Today, when I talked to a girl that was a facilitator of the bullying of the previous guy, she even gave me the same ""vulnerable and innocent"" facial expression she used with him.)

I'm not too worried about this though. The ridicule hurts, but it's not my main concern. What I am afraid of is how this might spiral out of control.  I'm a fairly frail individual. I can easily foresee some boys, especially the boyfriends of some of the girls, escalating the conflict to physical levels. Also, I'm worried that they might be spreading rumors about me - something that is particularly dangerous to not only me but the well-being of a charity group I run at the school. It can also potentially affect my college application process if any of the girls start e-mailing the schools I want to gain admittance to or sabotage me in any other way.

Well, that's a summary of my situation. Thanks for reading up to here! What do you guys recommend me do from here on out? I can cope with the pain, it's only one year. I just don't want this to affect my future prospects.

131,"I'm 18 and a half, I just graduated secondary school about 4 months ago. I'm an aspiring footballer (soccer), but obviously will go to school if this doesn't work out. I've realized that this is something I really want. It's honestly the only thing I want right now. So I'm going to postpone going to school and focus on this for a little while. There's a few reasons why.

I no longer have support from family, friends, anyone. I'm completely on my own. So money limits much of what I can do at one time. My plan is to work right now, and use this money for training, recording, diet, etc etc. I will (well already am basically) be fully focused on this goal. 

After this, if it doesn't work out then I'll go to school and study whatever I choose. Maybe something will happen there and it'll still work out. My question is, how long would be too long? Obviously I can go to school whenever but realistically I think there's a limit to how long I should wait.

As I said money limits me. If I could I'd go to school and focus on this instead of work. But I have dental procedures I *must* get done (e.g. wisdom teeth extraction), I have trouble with my mental health so I need to see a therapist. Where I live is extremely, extremely, super duper expensive. Bills to pay, no money is the tldr on that.

The basic question, is after how long should I ""give up"" on this dream? Two years is what I've figured is acceptable. That would mean I send in whatever I need to send in to the schools December of 2019, and start during the 2020/21 year. I would be 21 and a half at that point. Though something is telling me to stop trying at the end of next up and send stuff in December next year, starting school at 20 and a half.

134,"*Sorry this is a little all over the place, I'm running on like no sleep currently and have work in an hour or so.*

Okay, so, I have a serious issue maintaining a consistent sleeping pattern and it doesn't help that my mom thinks I'm some sort of drug addict because I never sleep. 

I go to sleep anywhere between 4am and 7am. I really can't ""force"" myself to sleep no matter what I do. I know how it feels to actually be tired and go to sleep and when I go to bed I rarely ever feel that. I do watch Netflix/YouTube when I go to sleep and if I don't then I get extremely bored just laying in bed. I've tried podcasts and that worked for a couple nights but didn't last after that; I lost interest in what I was listening to I guess. Sometimes I can go to sleep at a reasonable time before midnight and naturally wake up early, which is my absolute favorite, but that usually only lasts a couple of days. I can wake up at 8am naturally, be active all day, and yet I somehow manage to be up until 4am. 

A random example: last night I went to sleep at around 9pm (I knew it was just going to be a nap but I just love the feeling of actually being tired and embracing it) and woke up around 1am. I had work at 9am with an hour drive so I had to be up around 7:30am but I couldn't sleep and I'm still up. I still probably wouldn't be able to fall asleep until around 9am (just a prediction according to how I feel) but there's no reason for this because the night before I only got around 6 hours of sleep. 

My mom thinks it's due to my habits but never gives any logical reasoning for anything after I debunk her theories with evidence. She says I'm not active enough and I don't do anything with my day to make me tired, but I worked out for 3 or so years, every day, when I was still in school. So I'd wake up at 7:30am on weekdays and immediately after school I'd work out, then get home around 5pm-6pm, do whatever and end up staying up all night still. *I also went to college for a semester and had to chug NyQuil to sleep but I know my mom wouldn't be okay with that.*

My current day to day life is really simple. I'm 19yo starting my real estate career and currently only have to work one day a week, for a couple hours. So, I have 6 days to wake up and sleep however I want and I take full advantage of staying up late (although I would actually prefer to just go to bed early and wake up early). 


And if this wasn't a big enough problem on its own, I'm such a heavy sleeper, when I sleep, that alarms don't even wake me up. I literally have to have my mom wake me up like a middle schooler, to this day. I had a 12:30pm class in college (my first class of the day) and sometimes I literally couldn't even wake up for that. 

What the hell am I doing wrong? I need some help maintaining a proper sleeping schedule and somehow need to learn how to wake up with an alarm.
Also, I've tried staying up all night one night and go to sleep early the next and then again the next night, and I feel like I fix it but it only lasts a day or two. Disappointing. 

**TL;DR**: I literally cannot sleep, no matter how active I am or how much sleep I got the night before. Also, when I need to be up early, alarms don't wake me up so I have to get my mom to (which is kind of ridiculous). 

**Edit**: Before anyone says anything, I know people with insomnia and I'd argue I'm not at that level. If you think I am, it's probably from lack of information on my side and I apologize.  I'm just highly doubtful that I have insomnia. ",14Sep2017,1
136,"&gt;I am contemplating on taking a long break from work for the following reasons:

Have accomplished more then I had initially hoped for when I started my career. I have traveled and worked in more than half a dozen countries and getting a humble feeling that I have kind of seen it all in my line of profession. Have reached middle age and by God's grace my investments have come off really well. My kid is being sponsored for her education by her uncle/aunt as they are filthy rich and have no kids (bequeathing a lot of wealth for sure by will). In this context, there is a polite inner voice that keeps popping over asking me to take a long break to enjoy benefits of my hard work over many years

&gt;Dragging my feet out of fear and reasons for fear to breakaway from job:

Conscience keeps questioning if throwing away a good job smacks of some form of arrogance when more and more middle aged people are loosing their job and not able to get another! Having mentored hundreds of youngsters by working with them, cannot continue to do that on-job training anymore to positively impact lives of next generation. Have a feeling that if I break now, unlikely I will ever come back and the usual psychological fear of hitting an one way street!",14Sep2017,1

But with a millennial age on the uprise, I'm not sure at all how to apply this Writing into a career path, when the age of technology and information is on its way to peaking, and not a lot of people are not into books and poetry anymore, rather I see everyone indulging in social media or on their smartphone.

146,"Four days after 2017 started I had a breakdown of sorts. I saw a therapist that same day and was told I'd be visiting her every Wednesday at Four. I couldn't make any other day because she works another job and Wednesday was her only day she worked at her office. 

That of course didn't happen for whatever reason, meaning I kept trying to tell me parents every Wednesday I have to go to therapy they'd say ""You don't have an appointment today"" even though that day would clearly say ""therapy appointment"" on the calendar. 

I didn't see my therapist again until late February. Why they suddenly chose then to take me rather then taking me all those Wednesdays I missed I don't know. 

It's been almost seven months now and I haven't seen my therapist since. I feel like they wouldn't take me to therapy because they didn't feel like it, but their excuse was that my dad's work schedule MIGHT change to overlapping with my appointments, we only have one car and my dad would need it or because our insurance was constantly changing because my dad's job losses. I just told them I'm fine I don't need to go back to therapy because I can tell based on the tone of my stepmothers voice when she asked, it sounded like they would have been annoyed had I said yes I want to continue therapy. Also another reason stopping me from going to therapy was afterwards I'd constantly be prodded by my stepmother about what was talked about because she wasn't allowed in and she would constantly say my dad is going to ask.

147,"So, I recently moved into a house-share in a new city, with people I don't know. There is one guy in the house who has been confusing me as I don't know if he fancies me or if he is just being super friendly. Here are a few incidences that have lead to my confusing:

Firstly, about a month ago, we all went to a house party together. It was pretty normal until near the end, when this guy walked over to me and gave me one of his beers before leaving shortly afterwards. I found this strange as he had spent modt of the night with another group of his friends, however I was the only person he gave one of his drinks to.

About a week after that, I was feeling quite unwell as I was reacting to my allergys, he stayed up with me for around an hour, until I felt better. I found out later that he had a big test the next day and probably should have been studying.

A few days ago I arrived back at the house after being away for two weeks, he seemed super excited to see me and chatted to me for a good while before saying goodbye. As he was walking to leave he stopped and stared deeply into my eyes for about five seconds(which felt like a very long time), without saying anything but just smiling. He then left without saying anything else.

However, whenever we are in a group he will act completely normal.

Do you think he is just being friendly? Thanks for your help :) tl;dr Flatmate has done a few things that make me question whether he fancies me or is just super friendly",14Sep2017,1
149,"tl;dr- Was sexually abused on many occasions as a child, never really got help. Mental health has gone to shit over the years. Am finally getting help and want to take the semester off for myself, but am scared of being a disappointment/ fear I'm simply being lazy.


When I was 9, I was molested by my godfather, no one believed me. When I was 12, a 21 year old man pursued a sexual relationship with me. I saw him over the span of a few months, we eventually got caught, and he went to prison. When I was around 13, many of my cousins sexually assaulted me at once. I never told anyone about this incident because I was embarrassed that these type of events kept happening go to me, and because it would have broken up the family. 


I partially got help for it by going to therapy for a few months when I was 14, but I stopped going and no one convinced me it was in my best interest to continue going. My mental health has gotten worse and worse over the years. Around sophomore year of high school, I began having migraines and went to see a neurologist. Once I told her my experiences, she explained to me the migraines could be triggered by bad memories that come about when I am stressed. I missed so much school because of these headaches, and some days it wasn't the headaches that caused my absences, I just couldn't handle getting up. I'd lay in and cry my lungs out. 


That same year of high school(sophomore), the older man I had a relationship with was released from prison, and I unfortunately only found out when I saw him in town randomly one day. Since then, I see him constantly, and it hasn't helped at all. I cry every time I see him. 


I can't sleep at night, I'm exhausted. I've noticed myself become increasingly abusive to people that I love, including my boyfriend, who only has taken care of me during my times of need. I notice mood swings. One second I'll feel alright, but out of no where I become very angry, or very distraught and I'll begin crying. At work or in public, I'll have these mood swings as well, and I'll have to hold back tears because it's not an appropriate time to be emotional. I'm truly so exhausted, there's a lot of strange behavior I see in myself that I can't type out because this would be too long. 


I'm going to college now, right out of high school. My mental health is continuously going to shit, and I've finally taken the steps I need to get help. I have a few appointments this week to be evaluated/start seeing a therapist. I wish I had taken this semester off for myself, to get help and give myself some time to adjust before going to back to school. It's still early in the semester so I could drop, but I don't want to be a disappointment to my parents, and they don't exactly understand what I'm going through, they usually blame it on my failure to ""distract myself"" from the bad memories. 


Is it too late to take some time for myself?  Am I just being lazy?",14Sep2017,1

I have no idea how to talk to people - I try to avoid it as much as possible outside of work, and when in work if people do talk to me all I can think of to say is ""haha yeah"" or just stuttering and mumbling at them.

I work a route-based job currently, position isn't terrific but it pays the bills. Any way so I have made a number of specialty requests related to my schedule (I asked if this was allowed during the interview process and management universally said ""yes""), including so I don't miss a weekly appointment that I pay for regardless of if I go or not and a later start time on certain days (have to take younger brother to school). My boss knows the reasons behind both these requests and approved them, but repeatedly they don't honor the approved requests and usually that just means one phone call and it is back to how it should be, but now they have started saying ""no"" without even looking at the schedule and right after I call our scheduling manager, the branch manager (the one who approced the requests and ultimate authority for our office) will dodge my calls right after and will pretend he had no idea I called when I eventually do get ahold of him (usually from him calling me hours later).

I am a final year University student in my last two months of University. I am starting to feel depressed about the whole thing.

161,"**TLDR: I've got very good reasons to suspect my old neighbor photographed me naked through my bathroom window when I was a kid. I have no evidence, it was a long time ago, but this guy also recently got arrested for seriously assaulting his wife. I want to tell the police what I know just so they have the information. Like what if he's done this to other kids? Or worse? Or involved with CP? I just don't know how I should do this.**

I'm most likely going to take this to the police, but I don't really know the best way to go about this. This guy I suspect recently got charged with assault, too. He tried to strangle his wife. If I'm right about him being the person who photographed me, he's a paedophile who is stalking and taking pics of naked children. I have no evidence, but a lot of very solid reasoning for why I suspect him. This also happened a long time ago. Though his recent assault charge happened just this year. So this isn't really a simple situation and I'd love some advice. I don't live in the US, I'd rather not say where though.

I can't really share all the details just in case it gives me away or interferes with anything. But I'll try to explain. 

When I was growing up we lived in a very very small, quiet, sleepy old neighborhood mostly populated by elderly people, poor people, friendly and peaceful people. At the end of a quiet street was our house, and our neighbors house. Very close to each other but private enough that you couldn't see into each other's houses unless you walked down this dirt path that started at the end of our street and ran along the side of our tall hedge. Our properties were quite open though and it was easy to wander around.

The husband was scary. He went psycho on my siblings once because they were exploring some trees that were right on the edge of their property, even though they weren't harming anything or being disrespectful. He just fucking lost it, tried to physically hurt them. My parents were pissed about that but we were still friends with the wife. This guy was also very weird around me whenever my parents and I would visit. he Ignored me completely, even if I asked him something. I thought he hated me. He wouldn't even look at me. His wife on the other hand was fucking lovely. She was always very kind and friendly to me. 

So parallel to the dirt path between our properties was our hedge, and on our side- a limestone path. One story above this was our bathroom. Because it was so private, our bathroom had a big unfrosted window and we'd often bathe/shower without closing the blinds. We also usually had the window open a crack to let the air in. 

So one night when I was 7-9 years old (I'm a girl btw, now in my 20s) I was getting in the shower, blinds open. And I heard a camera shutter. A DSLR taking 3-5 photos, from outside the window. It was completely dark out. My family was all out elsewhere, except for dad who was working in another part of the house. The only lights on at my side of the house was the bathroom, and you could've clearly seen inside. I was familiar with the sound of a DSLR. My family had one. Even though we lived in a poor neighborhood we were pretty well off. So were our neighbors: angry man and friendly lady. We were the only people within a few streets who had much money, all our other neighbors were all low income. If anyone had a camera it definitely wouldn't have been a DSLR.

After hearing the camera I freaked out. I heard it clear as day. I grabbed my towel, covered myself, and ran down to tell dad. He was busy working in the other part of the house. He dismissed me and didn't believe me but said he'd go check it out. He wasn't the most attentive father. He told me to go back and get in the shower. I went back up to the bathroom and closed the window and the blinds. I heard someone walking across the limestone path. It was super audible. I assumed it was dad, showered quickly in my underwear and went back downstairs. I asked dad if he found anything. He was like ""huh? Oh right. No I haven't gone out yet."" Like he just totally forgot and didn't care. I guess he just thought I was imagining things. Either way he seemed unphased. Despite being seriously unsettled I followed his example and tried to forget about it. 

Thanks to some much worse experiences and life events later on, I did forget about it. I had PTSD from these other events and I had no emotional energy to even think into the whole thing. It was just a mystery stranger who took some photos of me one night. I never really let myself dwell on it.

Recently I remembered it and was like... What the actual fuck. And it kept bothering me. I started thinking about it and trying to figure out who it would've been.

This was roughly 15 years ago. It wasn't common to have a DSLR. Especially in our area. Then it hit me and it was so fucking obvious I don't know how I missed it. Creepy neighbor guy was a photographer. It was his job. He had a lot of fancy cameras. 

He was a photographer. He behaved very strangely around me. He recently got arrested for seriously assaulting his wife. He went into a rage at my young siblings for no good reason. He knew how to be very charming around my parents and other adults. I went back to their house a few years ago to visit his wife and he was there but very clearly avoiding me. 

I was doing some Facebook investigating today. I can't say what exactly I found but there was an oddly passionate post regarding a young (legal but young) daughter of a public figure being very publicly sexual. He had a lot to say about her. It was a weird post. 

I feel like I'm giving away too much here but there's one more thing I can't ignore. There was an article about his assault. There was a quote from him about ""playing the good guy"". As in, his charm is just an act. 

God the more I think about it all, the more disturbed I am. 

I think have to tell the police. But I'm worried about not having evidence and it being so long ago. I don't want to prosecute him I just want to let the cops know. Photographing naked kids is a serious crime. 

Because I have a relationship with his wife, maybe I should talk to her first. Maybe she has important information. She might appreciate me going to her first, she might not, I don't know. I really don't know how to go about this. I don't want to cause her any more stress. Her assault happened a while ago now but still. I do know she's strong and has a lot of support. 

I just don't know. Please, if anyone has any advice or insight or experience I'd love to hear it. I'm very conflicted.",14Sep2017,2
162,So here's a little embarrassing story. I meant to send a slightly suggestive snap to an old friend/hookup buddy way back in my home state.

165,"This is a long one. There's a TL;DR at the end. I've been friends with this girl (let's call her Katie) for a long time now. I'm 25, she was the school year below most of our mutual friends and is 24. In recent years, she has struggled with depression and anxiety, and I have tried hard to be there for her. This was mainly through whatsapp, we don't see each other too often in person but I've sent her a few little pick me ups, and I think I have managed to help her when she has struggled. It has always been a fairly one sided friendship, but as I've struggled with my own mental health I know how hard it can be and given her allowances for not being in the best place mentally. My view is always to be the kind of friend I would want, and that means offering whatever help is needed, whenever it is needed. I brought her into a group of my friends, some of whom were already her friends too, as we are very close and generally very supportive of each other, thinking it would help her.

About a month or so ago, my husband and a bunch of mutual friends camped overnight at a hockey tournament/beer festival, including Katie, our mutual friend ""Elizabeth"" (who becomes relevant soon) and Elizabeth's brother ""James"". (I wasn't at this event but have separately spoken to people that were there and this is the consistent picture from everyone). Obviously lots of drinking takes place in the evening, and Katie and James disappear into a field for about an hour at about midnight, then return to James' tent, which is right next to his sister's, and have very loud, drunken sex. Elizabeth can hear *everything*, and was very angry and upset at the both of them for it. It was out of the blue, it was just a one night stand, and she really didn't need to hear it. The next morning she doesn't speak to Katie and can't even look at her brother, so their ride home was awkward. 

Later on that day, Katie messages me to tell me what happened, saying ""I sent Elizabeth a text to say sorry because she seemed pissed off with me but she hasn't replied. What do i do?"" She doesn't know I know anything at this point. I asked her what the hell she was thinking, how did she not think that Elizabeth would be upset by this, we've known her for years and I could've told you that this situation would hurt her. Katie gets incredibly defensive saying ""this is what you should expect from camping"" and how she wouldn't be mad if it was a friend and her sister, ""this is how people meet"" (they had met before!), Elizabeth wouldn't be mad at James so why is it all on her, and that she would do it again if the situation arose. I found out that her apology text was a ""sorrrryyyyyyy"" and nothing else, which is pretty insulting if you've genuinely hurt one of your friends. Eventually, after a few days of back and forth, I gave up and didn't want to talk about it anymore. 

Then the social media attacks begin. We get ""four days on and everyone still hates me #mountains #molehills"". Elizabeth has at this point told Katie that she doesn't hate her but she's hurt and disappointed that their friendship didn't mean more to her. Enraged, I tweet ""there's a big difference between hate and disappointment"" which earns me a sarcastic thumbs up in response then a whatsapp message saying why did I do that, she's having a hard enough time as it is, essentially telling me I'm being mean. After much back and forth again, I got it through to her that Elizabeth couldn't even look at her brother and is equally hurt by his part in this, which seemed to get through to her a bit. She agreed to apologise for hurting Elizabeth's feelings but refused to apologise for her actions.

Katie's phone then goes into Apple for about 2 weeks and she told me beforehand she was doing a total social media detox, since she would be without a phone anyway. I regularly checked her whatsapp last checked date to see if she had her phone back. She tweeted in this time about how ""you know your social life is a bit shit when your parents have more friends than you"" - our parents our friends, and my parents were round hers. She hadn't attempted to contact me at any point. When she gets her phone back, she takes the fact that I whatsapped a silly picture of our mutual friends on a friday night and another friend sharing some school pictures (Katie went to a different school so wasn't in them) as an attack on her and that we all hate her and don't want to see her. I told her that we thought we had no way of contacting her, if she couldn't access whatsapp for our group chat, she could have posted to our group facebook page, or messaged me on social media, or got my number from her mum, or any number of things. 

She shares some social media posts about how she wishes she was still travelling in Australia, and how she has no social life, followed by a tweet directed at our whatsapp group saying ""when you get 100+ irrelevant messages from a group a day but won't want to leave and look like a bitch"". She's told me several times that she mutes the group, which is fine, but she's been complaining about not having any friends on twitter. She never tries to arrange anything, barely ever replies to our messages, but calls us out for being bad friends, quoting ""expectation is the root of all heartache #friends"" on twitter again. 

I've tried to whatsapp her and offer her helpful advice, but all that happens is she plays the victim and says how everyone is mad at her still when she didn't do anything wrong. No-one has mentioned it in weeks, and she has distanced herself from the group even moreso than before the event. It's at the point where everything she posts and says is pissing me off now, and I really don't want to be that kind of person. I like to think I'm not that person, but this is really getting on my nerves. 

Cutting all ties with her will be near impossible because our parents are good friends, and we aren't in school, we aren't going to kick her out of the whatsapp group. I feel too old for this kind of drama, but every time I try to help she just plays the victim and it's like the world should revolve around her. However, walking away and leaving her to deal with her issues is not really in my nature. What if she does something stupid and I could've stopped her? What am I supposed to do? Thanks for reading, and well done if you made it this far. I hope everything makes sense.



**TL;DR** a friend of mine had a loud drunken shag with a mutual friend's brother in the tent right next to her. Refuses to admit she's done anything wrong despite making it clear how much our mutual friend is hurt. Complains about how bad her social life is, and what bad friends we are, on Twitter, despite our efforts with her. Thinks everything revolves around her. Have tried to help her but she just thinks we are all being mean to her. Don't see how I can help her and it's causing a lot of stress, but also don't want to give up on her. ",14Sep2017,5

I have never had a cold sore before so new guy is the only possible way I could have contracted it. I am freaking out a little bit seeing as it could be herpes (which is the same as a cold sore I think) I am going to the Doctors tomorrow to see what it is for sure, but I am 90% sure it's Herpes. Seeing as it is still so new in the relationship, I am not sure how to handle this. I could be freaking out over nothing, but I also feel that I should talk to him about it. I see potential in our relationship and just don't know what to do. Do I talk to him about it? Is it a big deal? Do I stop seeing him? Help!


Thank you all for the advice. I will say that I am a little less freaked out about it. I am definitely going to talk to him about it, but he is on a fishing trip with his buddies for the weekend and I won't see him until Monday, even though we'll be texting and such, I think I should wait and talk to him in person.

169,"So a while back, my family adopted a Cane Corso/Lab mix. Her name is Luna, and she's a real sweetheart. The few problems we have with her are things that I feel can be blamed on us, such as her needing much more attention than she's getting, or her being afraid of most things. My grandparents are talking about re-homing her. I do not want this to happen.

I'd like to make it clear that I do still live at home and am not seen as an adult by the people I live with. When they set rules I do have to follow them, even if they're stupid rules and they're actively making the situation worse. Additionally, although the dog in question was originally supposed to be a graduation present for me, within days of getting her she transitioned into being the family dog, and then purely my grandmother's dog.

I feel very guilty about the situation Luna is in. I specifically chose her because she liked me more than her siblings did, and now she might not get to stay  here. But I'm not even sure if here is where she needs to be.

* For most of the day my grandma has her shut up in our living room in her crate. My grandmother doesn't like leaving her outside for too long, but also doesn't want to pay attention to her while she's in the house. She spends hours every day locked up in our living room.

* She's a pretty big dog, so she has a little trouble navigating our relatively small and crowded house. Despite this, she prefers being inside to being outside.

* She's lonely and full of energy. Because I work I often can't go and play with her, and even when I can she usually would rather play inside, where there is much less room for either of us to maneuver. Adding to that, I don't have a lot of energy (it's a side-effect of some health problems I have) and I can't keep up with her.

* She's not at all well trained and rarely listens to anyone but my grandparents. When we first got her my brother and I attempted to train her, but my grandmother insisted we were being mean to her and demanded we leave her alone until we could be nice. Because of this, she's house trained but otherwise pretty much does what she wants.

* (I think this is because my grandfather used to hit our old dogs and she feels guilty for letting him do it. He's tried to hit Luna all of once, but he's much older than he used to be and she's a lot stronger than our other dogs. She basically thought he was playing. He refuses to interact with her because he's afraid of her. Besides that, now that I'm much older, I'm not going to put up with him treating our animals badly and he knows it.)

* She's afraid of everything. Wind blowing, rain, loud noises, garbage cans, and basically anything she doesn't recognize. She has a habit of trying to hide under things. This could range anywhere from hiding underneath someone's legs to hiding from fireworks underneath the porch (something I understand that other dogs apparently do but none of our previous dogs had done. it's been dog proofed since then), to hiding from basically anything under the car in our back yard (long story. But the car has also been dog proofed.). Because of that fear, she also won't go for walks, meaning it's that much harder for me to get her to exercise.

I love this dog. I really do, with all my heart. It's just very hard for me to admit that our home isn't right for her and that she may be happier somewhere else, because I know that this is really not an ideal situation for a dog. I've cried several times this morning alone because I do love her and I want her to be happy, but I don't want to lose her.

The best solution I can think of that would keep her here would be to transition her into being an outside dog while also getting her a companion. But I'm pretty sure that would just be putting a band-aid on the problem. Right now I'm trying to look for someone I know that could take her so that she wouldn't just disappear from my life forever.",14Sep2017,1

172,"My son is being raised to be nice. When he posts online it is a feel good post that makes people laugh or go aww. My wife wanted to raise him to be a gentleman and have good manners and good ettiquete so I agreed. The thing is, his inbox is dry and his comments are lame. A few girls showed interest in him but I think they did it because they thought he was just covering up his bad boyness because as soon as they realized there's no gossip or bad blood or anger they just lose interest and go date a guy that tries to rape them (no joke). So what's the deal here?

Lately I've been trying to make my son take chances and be more opinionated, more firm, speak with more vigor/certainty, and single out a group of people someone can claim is a common enemy. It's not natural to him, but he gets way more responses and interesting conversations when he pushes his weight around (funny idiom considering he is skinny) than he does respecting everyone and treating everyone well. I seriously dont get it?!?

Someone said its the feminine and masculine game that is indoctrinated in kids from movies, music, shows, sports, commercials, ads, and other forms of media. They are only interested in boys who act like the stereotypical man according to their beliefs... So does that mean being a gentleman is a waste of time since girls want an edgy and angsty teen boy to prove dominance?

175,"My wife and I have a daycare that has been open for 10 years and has been very successful. To the point where we are building a new and bigger location. We are currently under construction of our new facility and getting that loan was nothing short of one of the hardest things my wife and I have done together. 

One of the requirements to get the loan was to buy a Business Interruption Insurance policy. When I got the policy from my insurance agent I asked if we would be covered if we were closed in case of a hurricane. 

Last year Hurricane Mathew we had to close for 2 days and I thought ""I know this insurance is expensive but it would be good to have something if we were to close for an extended period of time"". I read over the policy to see what type of income could be recovered and the policy looked good to me. We could pay our employees, pay bills, and even have some left over to pay rent. 

I got the feeling on Thursday when parents stopped making payments and evacuating that I might have to use my business interruption insurance. I was so thankful through the storm and the few days after we had an alternative to have income for our business even we cannot open. 

After Irma had past and my insurance agent was open I called and they told me on the phone that I am covered on Tuesday. I woke up first thing Wednesday morning went to their office and filled out the claim.

I get a call from the company that handles that claim and he floors me and tells me that we are not covered from wind damage. I have been driving by 5 times a day to check on the power.

Our daycare did not suffer any physical damage but continues to be out of power. The cause of the power loss is not even on our property.

177,"I'm a 24 y/o woman who has GAD. I'd been job hunting for months but never found anything in my area that was the right fit. My anxiety had been doing better lately and so I went out on a whim and applied for a job I knew was out of my comfort zone, an office job where I'd be answering phone calls all day. Phone calls are one of the biggest anxiety triggers and so I was pretty hesitant to apply but did it anyway with the encouragement from my friends. This was my first mistake. I heard back for an interview the same day, and of course, as happy as I was, I was also scared out of my mind. The interview went great and I ended up getting the job right there. First training day came by and I was pretty nervous but not too bad as I was only really learning the in-and-outs of the computer work and the filing and such. My co-workers were nice, and the boss was very kind. My first full day comes along and it's going great until my boss asks me to respond to a voicemail and all of a sudden I can't breathe. I can't move, can't talk, and my eyes are frozen on the desktop. My coworker asks if I'm okay and I manage to tell her no through streams of tears. Long story short, the boss came over and noticed I hadn't made the call, she told me that if I can't do the job that I don't need to be there and so I quit. The job was not right for me and I should've just listened to my gut in the first place, but now I'm in a very uncomfortable position. How do I tell the people that I love who were rooting for me, and proud of me for getting this job, that I quit? They're going to be so disappointed and maybe even angry that I've been looking so long and quit just like that. I really just felt like my mental health was worth more than $15/hour.

188,"Hi all,

I've been living with my girlfriend for nearly 3 and a half years throughout college, and we're committed long-term. In two weeks we're moving to another city together, where she's beginning her Ph.D. I'm trying to break into a niche field, but don't yet have a strong background in it, so I had planned to spend some months working on my portfolio before looking for employment. There aren't many relevant positions for me in this new city, so I don't yet know what prospects I have there. Ultimately, we plan on moving back to our home city after she graduates in 4 years time.


Right as we finished the paperwork for our new house, I got a call back from a company I interviewed with in April, saying they had a role for me. These are the global leaders in my niche field, and since I'm lacking experience and I hadn't expected to have an opportunity like this for a long time. The only problem is that it would mean I have to stay in our home city away from my girlfriend; we'd be lonely, unable to effectively support one another, and I would have to pay two lots of rent (the offered salary covers it, just). It's entirely possible that I could spend each weekend with her; it's a 4-hour journey.


It would be gruelling and stressful due to the living situation, but I can't match the career prospects anywhere else. Taking the bullet now and suffering for a couple of years would bring a huge boost to my career, but it's quite a costly investment. What might be best?

**tl;dr:** I've been offered my dream job straight out of college, when I had expected it would take an extra degree and half a decade to get here. The only problem is it means living in a city 400 miles from my girlfriend of over 3 years, as she's about to begin her 4 year Ph.D. What should I do?

---

Other details:

 * There are no remote working options, though they are flexible on hours (provided I fulfill 40 hours/week)
 * My girlfriend and I survived long-distance whilst I was studying abroad for a year; that worked out okay, but was difficult. The difference here is that she'd be a 4 hour train journey away, rather than a 10 hour flight.
 * I've negotiated the start-date of the job back as far as they can go
 * The team is small (8 people) and there's no guarantee about positions opening next year
 * They were quite clear that the position is a long-term hire; they would like me to commit to it, and not back out after a few months
 * It is affordable for us, but barely; there might not be much room for buying things like train/plane tickets to visit

196,"Sorry in advance for the long story, but I wanted to lay out the events just to give a better understanding.
I’ll also be adding milestones on some parts in case you don’t feel like reading certain portions.
If you read my post history, it’ll show various post about this same girl during the time I was emotionally unstable/distraught. My state of mind was a mess, but to me there’s a big difference emotionally. You can read it to get a better understanding of how I was then to now.

Over the summer I dated a girl for about 2 weeks and things went great until I made a huge mistake while I was on vacation. I freaked out one night when she didn’t answer me back. I had called her prior and she told me she was going out to dinner with some friends that I am familiar with and that she would call me back. After about 1.5 to 2 hours I didn’t get a call so I decided to text her to see if she was still out to dinner. She didn’t respond to me and within 10 minutes of sending the text I started to freak out. I send her like 2 more texts, called her and then I proceeded to call and message some friends who in turn bombarded her with text messages. She was pissed and freaked out on me over text. I didn’t do this out of ill will by any means, I was just concerned and I wanted to make sure she was safe (**later I learned that I was also emotionally attached/dependent on her which caused me to freak out prematurely through some time and thought**). Once I returned from vacation I tried to contact her and meet face to face to apologize for what I did. She then sent me a text basically saying why did I do what a did and why did I think it was okay to do so, she didn’t want an answer now, but for me to think about it so that when we talked she could get her answer. Afterwards, she was very unresponsive or just sent short responses. After 2 days of trying I tried the NC method since my brother said I was being to **“pushy”** and bothersome as I tried texting her once a day to apologize. I know the NC method isn’t the best and I should have just texted her to try and talk over the phone. That was about the hardest week I’ve had to deal with in a while. I was not able to focus on work and life became rough since I couldn’t talk to her. 

**EVERYTHING BEGAN TO FALL APART**

My birthday approached a week in and I finally got to talk to her. I didn’t bring up anything about what happened and just talked to her about life, what she was up, and just basically catching up. I enjoyed the call and I thought it went well. The day was when it hit me. I had purchased a piano and received the day after my birthday. I sent out a snap and I figured I would send it to her thinking that our relationship was “okay”. She read it and then she posted a snap on her story that I saw. After about 20 minutes of her posting the snap she removed me from her friends list on snapchat. That was when something inside me fell apart, a realization came to me, and a sort of weight was lifted/put on my shoulders. It was quite an interesting emotional rollercoaster at that moment. I started to vent to my friends and family about what happened and just seeking comfort for what I went through. I got various things from **“are you okay?”** to **“I knew I didn’t like her. Don’t talk to her again and just live your life”**. I had gone through more than I wanted and it hurt so much because I was too emotionally attached to her way too early into our relationship without just enjoying it. I talked to several people and I was able to calm down a little bit.

I REALIZED MY EMOTIONAL WEAKNESS

I sat in my room and started to contemplate about what I did and I tried to fully understand why I reacted the way I did. At first, I thought that I reacted to the situation because I was scared about a certain individual who might have hurt her in some way, shape, or form. An interesting argument occurred between her and said individual’s family prior to me leaving for vacation. I began to dig deeper to see if that was the true trigger and I came to realize that it was because I was too emotional dependent on her and I sought out happiness and validation from her to fill in a void that I couldn’t fill in myself. After this realization, I started to read more into EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCY, EMOTIONAL INDEPENDENCE, AND BASICALLY JUST ANY RESOURCE FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND MY SITUATION. After some research, I came to understand that I didn’t love myself enough to be emotionally dependent, I relied too much on validation from other to feel good about myself (**explained why I had such a “show-off” nature at such a young age**), and I lost myself and dropped all my hobbies to be with her 4-5 days a week just to gain happiness (**there’s probably a few other things, but this is what stood out the most to me**). In understanding this, I began to write in a self-reflection journal and I just wrote how I felt whenever I thought about her. I also started to read **“13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do”** by Amy Morin and just random reddit post, online articles, and videos about emotional independence to better understand how to control my emotions and develop my mental strength.

**FINALLY MEET FACE-TO-FACE**

After about half a week I finally got to see her in person and we talked a little. I asked her if she wanted the answer and she said yes. She basically guessed that I did it because I wanted to make sure she was safe and I verified that. I then proceeded to say that I was also emotionally dependent on her and that I was seeking validation and happiness from her and that’s why I freaked out. She said that I reminded her of one of her EX’s who did the same thing in a sense and it scared her. As school was about to come again she said she doesn’t think she was ready to have a relationship with me cause with the stress from school and then trying to support someone else emotionally would be too much for her to handle and push her over the edge. She said she would rather be friends/close friends instead of dating again and potentially losing each other. She said that I should focus on myself and get my emotional shit together and go through some more break ups so that it wouldn’t be so hard after a while and what not. I agreed and didn’t pursue talking about us anymore. We then went out to dinner and hung out for a little bit and then talked over the phone as I drove home.

**POST MEETING**

So, after we met I stayed in contact with hers **(people usually say cut off all ties to her to let yourself heal, but I couldn’t let go because I was emotionally weak and I guess you can still say I am now)**. We didn’t talk as often obviously, but we still texted random stuff. I also saw her on the following Sundays a week and a half after talking face-to-face. She held private lessons for volleyball and I went to her because she was the first to teach me form and technique and I figured I would still ask her for help since we were still friends. As time goes on it is becoming a little easier to talk to her, she’s more responsive and we sometimes talk on the phone. I still do like her and in the back of mind I am hoping to get back with her **(not healthy, I know. I say why at the end)**. I did **“flirt”** with her during one of the private lessons and I am hoping that she gets the signal that I still like her. It did seem that she was still interested by what she said/did, but that might just be her personality and I’m just reading to into it. I know she is talking to other guys and I get scared of the thought of potentially losing her to someone else. It’s also a little hard for me to believe her when she says she’s going out to dinner with family or something cause in the back of my mind something always says she may be meeting with some other guy. She’s done nothing for me to not trust/believe her, but again it’s just my emotions taking control. I also shouldn’t care if she’s seeing another guy cause I’m dating her anymore and I’m trying to get myself to realize that and stop reacting with my emotions and just think rationally.

Now some might say cut her off, but I can’t get myself to do that. It is still emotionally hard at times for me to deal with, but I want to stay in contact with her. I am not doing this only to see her, but also to challenge myself and teach/force myself to overcome my emotions and be emotionally/mentally strong and independent. It’s torture, but if I can’t go through the pain and deal with it then when am I going to learn. I want to learn now so that I can make rational decisions and prevent my emotions from taking control all the time. I know this isn’t the most practical method or most sane method, but it’s a method I would like to use to better myself. If I don’t struggle to learn something then I won’t learn it. Compared to before, I am not anywhere close to being emotionally destructive and I can say I have a **“better”** handle of my emotions. I’ve also gotten back into my hobbies that I’ve lost touch with during my time with her so it’s becoming easier to deal with my emotions. I’ve also gotten back into hobbies I haven’t done it a while as well. I also didn’t add her back on snapchat until I know I am emotionally ready to get to that point as she rarely uses the other forms of social media.

I’d like to know what you think, tips, advice, or just anything in general.
I already know that I won’t like what some people have to say and I know that, but it’s all to better myself as an individual.


TL;DR


I’m still interested in a girl I used to date not too long ago. We still talk to each other through text and over the phone at times. We have been together at her private lessons she gives for volleyball and I’ve flirted with her at one hoping she’ll notice that I still like her. I know she is talking to other guys so I get scared that I might lose her to someone else. It’s also hard for me to believe her when she says she’s going out with friends/family cause in the back of my mind somethings telling me she’s seeing another guy. I know I shouldn’t care if she is since we aren’t dating anymore and I’m trying to learn to better control my emotions so that it won’t bother me as much. She also hasn’t done anything that would lead me to not trust her, but that’s probably my emotions taking over.

Every day I get up at 6 am and spend 2 to 3 hours learning to write code and design websites. After having done this for an entire year, I am really no good at it. My hobby is jujitsu, every day I go to a jujitsu class. I work my ass off, I am barely average at jujitsu.

It's like I am smart enough to know I want more from my life, but I am not smart enough to actually have more, or be able to accomplish anything. The only thing going for me is my work ethic and I have to work twice as hard as the average person to get half the results. I am tired, I am exhausted and I am ready to give up I guess. I will never be happy, I will always have to deal with the suffering of knowing I want more but not being able to have it.

This is my first time posting something on Reddit but i really needed advice. 
I have known my best friend for 8 years now and we've been best friends from the start. The thing is her grandfather and mother died 1 year ago and her father has become an alcoholist, so she is having a really rough time. In this year i've always been there for her, i've been to her mothers funeral because i knew her very well, when she wanted to talk about her mother etc. we would talk for more than two hours and when she was having trouble with her dad i always invited her to my house and said she could always could sleep over and that my door is always open for her, i tell her i'm here for her a lot etc etc etc. But a few days ago here mother had died one year ago so she asked me if i could go with her to her grave but i really didn't have time so i proposed to her that we could go on the weekend and at her birthday but she didn't want to go at the weekend so i even asked if she wanted my mom to bring her to the cemetery ( my mom always has her back as well and they have a good relationship) but she didn't want this. 

After this she started to act weird with her friends towards me and my other best friend, she even got pissed because i didn't said hi when i saw her at school but she didn't even said anything herself, they were ignoring my other best friend in class the whole day (i'm not in the same class). The next day a friend of mine told me she has said a lot of awful things about me:

• That i treat her like shit. (which is such bullshit because i've had her back and helped her so much this whole year.)

• She is telling everyone that i didn't WANT to go to her mothers grave but i was just busy and even asked her if she wanted to go on the weekend and 2 weeks later on her mother's birthday

• That she's getting sick of me.

• That because of my other best friend i ignore her which is so much bullshit because we talk a lot everyday.

• She's (me) acting so weird.

• She always runs out on me.

• I can't take her anymore, i'm so fucking sick of her.

And she has said a lot more of these thing and is making me seem bad telling a lot of people i didn't want to go to her mothers grave. She doesn't know i know that she said all of these things on a voice message but now that she has said these things i really don't know what to do anymore because personally i don't think it's my fault. Could you guys give me some advice? 

Thank you",14Sep2017,2
202,"I was friends with a guy in my school who was like me, introvert, a bit antisocial and has my same interests, he slept at my house lots of times, dined with my family, came with me everywhere, basically he was kinda my soulmate. 

One day I was waiting for him to give him some papers to fill, when he arrived I saw him going to the bathrooms. I thought he was just peeing but after 15 minutes I decided to check him. I entered the bathrooms (it's a bathroom nobody ever uses so it's mixed) and climbed on top of the toilet next to his to see what the hell he was doing (yeah, I don't give a shit if he's peeing or pooping or fapping, even if we weren't in a relationship, we were close enough to don't care about that) and saw him sitting on the toilet (with his pants on btw) and a notebook next to him. When he saw me he just took something very sharp and cutted my fingers, I started to bleed and feeling dizzy and I had to be taken to the hospital. 

Since then I didn't talk to him, not only my parents didn't want me to, but some acquaintances told me not to, some went as far as warning me to take care of myself since who knows if he could rape or kill me since he has some mental problems, which was later confirmed by my school's headmaster (she was talking to me about this)

Anyways, I spent the rest of the grade without even looking at him (I think it was May when this happened) but one day during summer I, suddenly, decided to say 'Hi' to him through chat, I think he got happy and invited me to his pool (and sleep too but my mother didn't let me) I said yes and decided to forgive him, I guess I just couldn't hate him, even if he sent me to the hospital and did some bad things, he did good things for me too. He broke his leg and we had to cancel our plans, to which I was quite relieved to be honest. We kept talking through chat but didn't meet in person. 

Summer passed by and just today he called me at 7 AM to ask me if I would want him to accompany me to my new school so I could feel more confident (I was pretty anxious about it and he knew that) to which I replied yes. We were heading towards this school when he asked me to take his phone from his bag, I found there lot of blades but decided to don't ask him about it, I just took the phone and remained silent. When we arrived he asked me if I wanted him to come for me when the presentation was over, I was trying to avoid him after seeing that, so I told him to go to his home. When the presentation was over I headed towards my house when I saw him coming in front of me. He yelled at me for not called him when it was over, he just followed me all the morning until I decided to go to my grandmother's house to lose him. 

Now I'm really regretting this, everyone told me to not approach to him, that who knows what he can do and yet I forgave him because I thought he changed for the better, but it wasn't the case. It's not only the fact that he cutted me, he did some other things too, for example, he's pretty much an attention whore, the bad ones, I remember lot of times he would come to me and hug me and then minutes after he would just make a sad face and whenever I asked him what's wrong, he just told me 'NOTHING! LEAVE ME ALONE! It was always me, he did this lot of times only to me, he faked being sad for no apparent reason so he would be the 'victim' He also used to hit me whenever he wanted, like just punch me in the stomach out of nowhere, then he would just laugh and hug me telling it was a prank, also he apparently loved to hummiliate me in front of everyone, since we were very close I did private things in front of him (not what you're thinking about) and told him some secrets that he later started to tell out loud in front of everyone as a question, like 'Hey Airiah, why do you do 'x' thing?' so everyone could hear. I told him to stop lot of times but he just kept doing this telling me it was a 'friendly joke'

Argh, why did I have to forgive him?? I have other friends, I could just have moved on but nooo, I had to be friends with him again. Now he's expecting me to hang out with him like before, I just regret this and want to end this friendship but I don't know how, I just can't tell him this to his face, I need some excuse.

203,"I love Rachel* so much. I would literally do anything for her and her sister, Megan*. I have known these girls for at least 10 years. they helped me through so much and my family has seen them through their hardest times. They lost their dad to Breast cancer 2 years ago. Rachel was in a relationship at that time that had turned sour after her dad passed because I guess the threat of a fatherly figure was gone. Rachel is headstrong but sat by while the relationship turned demanding and abusive. She finally got out of the relationship with my help. She would text me instead of returning to the man who abused her. I pulled her out of her depression. I sat by while she bounced from guy to guy within a couple months as if she could never be happy. Eventually she found her now fiance. He's a super nice guy but they're rushing into it imo. They just celebrated their one year anniversary early this month. They got engaged about 4 months ago. I understand that if you find that one person, you'll know that you want to spend the rest of your life with them but shes still in college and its way too early to know how compatible two people can be. From watching my cousin through her marriage after 6 months of dating, I can see and tell that she regrets getting married to soon. I just don't want to see my best friend go through that. Her family is super supportive of the news and the couple but I can sense some doubts with her sister.

I don't know what to do. I haven't shared my thoughts with her because when I voiced my opinion about her abusive relationship she claimed ""You don't understand because you've never been in love.""

I wasn't able to take the MCAT successfully this summer because I was nowhere near my target score. My parents freaked out, and my dad especially called me stupid for not being able to do well. I deeply regretted it, and I dropped a course this Fall to study for the MCAT course. Now, I'm in the position where I think I need to take two gap years. I'm terrified to talk to the premed advisors at my school, largely because they look at my transcript and don't see me as a viable candidate for anything really. I retook one class during my time there, but I kept going. Unfortunately, I've had little to none research experience, and I'm still gaining clinical experience. 

I think my GPA is okay for medical school, but I feel an urgency to apply to DO schools- my dad lost his job four months ago and it's unlikely he'll be hired due to age discrimination in the IT industry. My mom doesn't work, and my older sister is an Econ major yet to get an internship or a job. Moral of the story is- I feel like I have to provide for my family sooner than later, and taking two gap years to complete a Master's Program (another $30k in debt), work as a medical scribe/gain clinical experience, on the off chance i might never get into medical school

His mother does have challenges when she's switching meds but is for the most part stabile and only annoying in that very average mother in law kind of way. The only concern I have about her is that her mobility is very limited (on a walker) and she smokes. I am concerned she will smoke in the house which would really suck because my husband either has an allergy or extreme sensitivity because it will be ""too cold outside"" or too hard to get there for her before she needs her next fix.

Last time he was here he faked a seizure on a popular outdoor pedestrian mall leaving my husband and me to try to scramble to get the car and get him in it before the police sent him to a 72 hour psych hold (which he would have missed his flight.)

About 1 month ago I came home 2 hours early from school without my mom knowing and I walked in on her smoking a cigarette on the balcony. I got absolutely furious and started shouting and crying. You probably think it was an overreaction, but I love her so much and I didn't want her to get addicted/get lung cancer or whatever terrible things smoking does to you. 
She told me she had only been doing it for a week due to stress at work and that she would immediatly quit and that she was sorry. 
Since that time I haven't seen her smoking ever since, nor have I found cigarettes or something so I think she told me the truth when she said she quit, but I'm still not sure.
I'm really worried because there's still a chance she still smokes. I don't want her to smoke. I don't want her to get addicted or die.

I don't know what to do/what to think of all this. 
If you have any advice, please tell me. I really don't know what to do and I'm really worried.

Thanks.",14Sep2017,1
230,"Forgive me for the formatting, I'm on mobile. TL;DR at the end.


Background info: I am a woman and a former makeup artist that will sometimes take one off makeup appointments when the mood strikes. I recently agreed to an appointment at the suggestion of my long time girlfriend/partner to help an acquaintance of her's who wants to discreetly get in touch with his feminine side. I am all about helping other's explore gender, but I'm starting to get an uncomfortable feeling about it. 

When my gf first told me about the guy and gave me his contact info, I assumed this was a friend of her's. I didn't know it was some random guy who randomly selected her and messaged her after seeing her on a local group's Facebook page. 

I ended up giving him our address to meet up for our appointment this upcoming Monday. My gf told me that she wished I hadn't done that because she doesn't know the dude. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Now, at first, this guy seemed like someone you expect to discreetly want to explore makeup. I agreed to helping him with makeup at a discount price since he's a student. He asked for help styling his hair and asked to possibly borrow some clothes. I was cool with that, I wanted to help out a person questioning gender. I'm part of the LGBT myself, so I like to help where possible.

Now this guy won't quit texting me. I'm talking 2-5 messages in a row asking me questions I've already answered. This is turning from a simple appointment to a full evening of playing dress up. He keeps asking us to hang out outside of the appointment too, which I was cool with, if I had time during the week. (I haven't had time because I work a regular job and deal with an ongoing illness.)

Now, I don't mind him being eager, I mean, maybe he's wanted this for a long time and is just excited to finally get a chance to do this.

HOWEVER, this is where the uneasiness I feel comes in: He asked if I drink, which I do, and he asked if we could drink during the appointment. I was cool with that, thinking he was going to provide the alcohol. But now he's expecting me to use my own, which I don't normally mind, but usually you're not suppose to just assume you can drink my liquor without contributing anything. It's bad manners.

I could even possibly look past that, BUT he then told me to ""not worry if he gets too touchy or too cuddly."" I told him straight up that I am not a touchy person, and he dropped it.Later he asked if I had lingerie he could wear and I lied and said I don't own any. 

The guy is well aware that I'm a lesbian in a committed relationship, but I am starting to worry that these signs are pointing to him not really wanting to explore gender so much as make me an unwilling participant to a sexual fetish.

He isn't explicitly saying things like that, but I had an abusive ex who would use the same language this guy is and manipulate me into playing along with his fetishes I was not comfortable with.

So, my question is, how do I politely and professionally end this? 

At this point, I've stopped responding to his texts, and my gf says I should ghost him and block him. However, I am nervous that he has our address and feel like, on one hand, maybe I should give him an explanation for why I need to cancel, but on the other hand, I am creeped out and do not want to deal with a possible stalker situation.

How should I handle this?

Thanks everyone.

TL;DR: Guy I'm suppose to have an appointment with is giving me the creeps. How do I responsibly handle this and tell him the appointment is cancelled and I don't want to hang out?

And is it really possible to wake up every morning feeling the burn inside your heart to go and get what you want to go and do what you need in order to become? Because some days I do have that burn, but that's when I don't have a lot of things to study. For example I have only physics to study for the day I feel more motivated, but when I have a lot of things to study for the day for example Math, Physics, Programming then I feel the need of looking for motivation and forget about my inner motivation.

233,"I am an adult man, a university graduate, but on many milestones and character traits I am behind the curve.

For over a year I have been moldering in my family home. I have held no jobs in my life, but I lack any skills, qualifications, or experiences toward any occupation, whether it be strength and endurance (I am very weak and unfit), sociability (No), technical knowledge (none)...and for any menial position in the service industry, I lack those native talents that are the understood minimum to perform their duties. I lack the discipline or motivation for diligence. Mentally and physically, I am excruciatingly slow. I have great difficulty learning anything, much less applying or doing it. In particular, my visual and spatial cognition is at a low level, despite lacking any formal impairment. I'm not good with words in speaking, writing, or reading, and if you think you have come to a different impression let me point out that this is my inflexible pinnacle, and this is just rambling about personal shit, not an essay or a literary work. 

All these things I claim to lack also apply to the mundane aspects of living, where I have never had to maintain my own finances or be familiar with the corresponding structures, I do not know the basic mechanics of household systems nor how to maintain them, I have never used my hands to make or fix something for myself, I can't cook beyond ""boil/fry ingredients to safety"", I do not know how to shop for my own provisions and necessities, and I am barely able to maintain personal hygiene (my skin and teeth have been in terrible condition for a long time). In other words, I have no experience with or preparation for survival. 

My immediate family is not able to support my development other than materially *(again, I've always lived ""at home"")*. I have pursued a variety of mental health services for some years, and am currently, but these haven't proved helpful in any way. The Labor Dept. reps and social workers in my city pointed out that I need myself sorted for their services to be of any use. I have no friends or acquaintances to rely on. I have no interests or hobbies to motivate myself with or to develop. 

And worst of all, I don't really care about any of it more than superficially. I don't have any ambitions our outlook, or anything I want to see or do in the future. There's nothing I want to achieve for myself or for anyone else. I don't have any commitment to life. I don't want to deal with subsistence or people or myself. There's nothing I want out of life, and I wouldn't mind dying, though I don't have enough drive or self-efficacy to consider suicide an option. If it weren't for my family making existence relatively easy, I would do nothing to avert my own death by neglect. **So far I have spent my time anesthetizing myself on the Internet/computer, flitting between activities I least dislike at any given moment.**

**And I've always been like this, but in my hedonistic youth I figured everything would sort itself out in its own time. It's just more visible and urgent than ever, because of my life-stage.**

**So most generally my question is, what do I do?**

Here's a more specific question on something I'd like help with, and it should illustrate some of my deficits. Would it be possible to find free communal/volunteer support to assist me on learning the following skills, and if so what advice or suggestions do you have? 

For example: 

*tying shoelaces

*tucking and wearing collared shirts, pants

*wearing belts

*ironing clothes

*folding clothes

Problem is, I'm now less productive because I'm thinking about her so much. I can do uni work just fine, I can do everything I have to do, but I used to write and play the piano a lot in my free time, and things like that. Draw a little, got a couple of commissions. But ever since this started, and a bit in the run-up, I've been less interested in working and more interested in her, and it'd be great to have that productiveness back.

Is that pretty standard honeymoon phase stuff and will it likely go away as we settle into the relationship? Or is that a bit unusual?

239,"New account, looking to masses for advice.

tl;dr Theft caught on video (after housekeeping staff cleaned room) resulting in police arrests.  Hotel offers 60% of my loss claim.

Longer version. Travel to California, and stay at a Motel 6 for five nights while getting my daughter moved into a new town.  It's fine, I'm just there to sleep and shower in the morning, I have some minor issues the first two days ( no towels, then no soap) and on the last night I return to find the door ajar, and the inside light burning (thank you Tom Bodett).  Entering i find the room gone through, my suitcase opened, and almost all of my items missing.  I call the front desk, someone comes up, i explain what happened and we go back to review the cameras.

Fast forward through three hours of working the video system, and they are able to see someone walk in/out with my suitcase in the afternoon and take it into their room.  Then later they return the suitcase to the room.  Then several people go in and out of that persons room.  Then later there are more people seen going in and out of my room carrying items, but cant see clearly.

Police are called, i make a list of items, and the police find three of them in this room (along with other illegal items), and arrest the individuals.  I let the staff know i'm not staying there tonight, and ask that the manager call me in the morning (as i was catching the flight back home).

The manager calls the next morning, and is apologetic.  Asks for a list of the items stolen, and that he will work with their Risk Management division.  He also offered to reimburse the hotel stay because of the bad experience.  I thanked him for the gesture, and would get him a detailed list.  I compiled the list while waiting in the airport, and emailed him the list.  He confirmed receipt and that i would here from Risk Management(RM).

A week later (8/31) I'm contacted by RM and told they are reviewing the case.  Asked a few questions, and if i had reciepts for the items on my list.  I said probably not, i might be able to go through old Amazon order for things like cables or a multi charger, but not for t-shirts or pants.  She said not a problem, and she needed a few days to review the evidence and would call me back.

I waited a few days, and contacted the manager, as i had not seen the refund to the room processed.  He said he was unable to do that, and it would need to be handled by Risk Management.  I explained that was not the way he originally made it sound, but i would follow-up with her (RM).

Today, 2 weeks after the initial call, I contacted RM again.  She started saying that she was actually looking at the video now, and that she would not be able to reimburse my items without receipts.  We went round and round, and she attempted to negotiate settling the claim for $300.   I asked her to please send me something in writing denying my claim, and instead a settlement of an arbitrary $300.  She said that was not possible.  When i asked to speak with a supervisor or manger, the same result.  Not possible, not the way we handle things.  Then i asked for any type of customer complaint number, again refused.  The final straw, when i asked about the room reimbursement, she said that needed to be handled by the manger.  Not Risk Management, she does not handle that type of thing.

So I've stewed on this, and emailed a customer service address i found online (guestrelations@g6hospitality.com).  I'm not sure where else to turn, or what actions to take or rights i may have.

240,"I’m a 21 year old girl that was completely lost in life. I got a great chance at a great small company. It was given me a job at my area of interest. I’m well paid and my boss is really good to me.
 
I work in this good, but with some issues (like all) company. I’m going to be opened about my salary. They pay me about R$1600 (BRL). In that amount, I include benefits such as transportation and a meal card. Usual benefits from a Brazilian employee.  

**It’s been great working here, because:**

* I have money 
* I’m being recognized as an adult from my family
* I discovered the value of time 
* I’m able to go out on weekends, buy things, make small trips
* I have friends and is nice to see people, interact and be with them in lunches and stuff. 

**If this is so great, so why am I complaining? Well..** 

* I leave my house at 6:50 am and return only 19:20. I work 8:48 hours, lunch break 1:12. The rest is commute. 
* The buses are extremely crowded. Is a fight to get the bus to go to work and to go back home. 
* My company is familiar, sexist and conservative. 
* I can’t be out of my desk too much, I can’t miss a minute. If I do, they will complaint and discount me. 
* They will also complaint about: earphones, clothes, appearance, eating anything at my desk, etc. 
* I’ve gaines wheight, because: I ate to compensate (but I stopped); I sit on my butt all day and I have a severe intestine problem, I should be more active or, at least, work standing; I have not much time left to exercise, although I try to work out an hour a day. 

**This things have caused me to:**

* Start disliking my job more and more, which led to:
* Anxiety and procrastination.
* Feeling that I’m a fraud and soon enough they’ll find out I’m not actually giving my best at all. I’m just doing the basics and sometimes I still fail at it. 
* Worsen my intestine problem, which causes more anxiety. 
* Panic attack during a day job because of hating to be here. 

**Other info:**

* I freelance and I make about R$ 500 (BRL) a month. I have to freelance at night. 
* My nights are: get home, prepare food, freelance, exercise, shower, sleep or do something and sleep late (it would made me tired the next day).
* Spending the whole day procrastinating makes me sick about myself. I can’t help but think about all of these hours I’m wasting when I could be doing things with guts and true desire to do it.  
* I love to work hard. I love me freelances because they are the very first beginning of my home office dream.
* My dream is: work as a freelancer and enterprise. 
* I feel like there’s no way I could motivate myself again at this job
* I know how to do shit and I’m good at it. I’m competent. 
* I’ve developed a kind of fancy lifestyle. 
* Everyone in the company is getting vacations at 15 December until 02 January. 

**I’m afraid of:** 


* Leaving my job and not enjoying the time I get. 
* Work hard, but still don’t make enough money. 
* Judgments of my family.

248,"Ok so I'm not sure what to do anymore and really need help from you guys. Girlfriend of 3 years has been getting depressed and it's Getting worse last night she tried to cut herself. 

When we hangout she's happy but when I leave I'm always getting upset phone calls. She tells me I'm the only thing that makes her truly happy. 

My problem is I just don't know how to help her, every time I give advice I sound like a broken record, either I need better advice or she needs more than advice

Background on Her two problems 

1) body insecurity. Would love female opinion because I know a ton of females have this issue too. Yes she is attractive but constantly compares herself to others, and very often she will get into a bad thought pattern or see some advertisement on social media with some perfect 10 girl, and that makes her upset and completely throws off her day where she doesn't feel like doing anything productive 

2). Being lost in her career. She is 21, just left college because she doesn't know what major she wants so is wasting time. She is very unique, she's not the kind of girl that would sit in an office or work at Starbucks, she's very creative and unconventially talented (great at things like writing etc) which makes it really hard to find your place in college and in the convential world. What makes this harder is everybody around her in her family is the opposite, all tell her go to college, get a normal job  just  stupid shit that shows they clearly don't know a thing about her. 

She's very smart but can't find her place or just where to start. Sitting around all day not doing anything just makes her problems 10x worse because she is left with her thoughts all day. I feel if she found a job that fulfilled her or found a tangible way to start making money writing or doing what she loves, she would feel more confident and positive, and probably the body insecurities would set themselves aside, I believe the main cause of her depression around that issue is the fact she sits around all day and is stuck in her thoughts.

I've told her to find something to do right now to make money because it will improve her self worth and at least get her out of bed and feeling productive, and even if it's a meaningless job as a waitress just consider it a stepping stone into your next thing. She only wants to do what she's passionate about but can't find any one to pay her. Currently she works once a week as an art model but that leaves way too much free time and little income.


What can I do to help her ? What advice do any of you have about either of the issues she's having? Many thanks Reddit! 

Also, have any  been in same situation with significant other ? As shitty as it sounds there are some times where I almost don't want to hangout with her because Sometimes the whole time is spent listening to her sob and talk about problems the whole time and even brings down my mood ...  I still be there for her all the time because obviously now she needs me more than ever but sometimes I feel like her issues put a huge weight on me and our relationship

250,"And I'm stuck. I really can't figure out if she likes me or not. This is like the first time I really invested my time into a girl (I'm 17) and it's putting me some weird moods not going to lie. I was talking to her for the past three days (Texting) but I know her a lot longer than that. I'll start from here - I was a really messed up kid. Years of depression and I never really talked to her. The girl is best friends with my sister, but she always tried to talk to me, but I never said much. My grandmother went in for surgery not too long ago and my sister stayed at my house. For three days in a row the girl came to my house to talk to my sister. This is where I started to gather feelings for her. Advance a few weeks and I told my mother about it. My mother just recently moved house and the girl in question goes to her house sometimes. I would've been at my mother's house quite a bit and one day the girl walks in. She doesn't say much to me since I was playing with my little brother, but she left with my mother to go to the store. This is where my mother told her I liked her (Yeah....I know), but the funny thing is the girl came back to the house and we talked for so many hours. Maybe like 5 PM to 11 PM or something. She left in the middle of it and came back. I didn't know she knew by the way. 


So my mother told me she knew and I was a little upset not going to lie. Anyway my sister kept bringing us together in a way. A trip to the cinema here and a walk down town there. Honestly just normal stuff and me being silly. The last time I went out with her was to watch IT (Fun movie), but we parted ways outside since my sister wanted to meet her boyfriend (We don't like each other), but I looked back and saw the girl's face. I even heard her ask my sister ""We'll walk him home"", but my sister wanted to meet her boyfriend so they left, but honestly I believe she wanted to walk home with me and my sister (It's getting hard to understand now) and honestly all of this has been great fun for me. I'm loving it after years of depression and not getting out there. 


Anyway, I made Instagram three days ago and she followed me. Not a big deal since follow for follow are big there. I added a pic and she clicked like. I did enjoy that she liked it, but not going to make a big deal out of it. So I got the balls and decided to text her. We talked for a little while and she told me to get Snapchat since she hardly uses Instagram. So I did and I told her I'm going to bed now. 


The next about 12 PM I would say she text me first. It was a simple group snap thing and then she said hi to me. We talked until she said she had to go (Maybe half an hour of texting)

I text her that night and she seemed a little out of it. Not sure if she was tried or whatever, but I think I cut it short a little. The next day around 12 she text me again saying hi. We talked for a bit until she ended the conversation. Later that day I got another text from her. It was a snap and it had my mother in it. It was titled ""Chats"" and she said hi under it. We talked and she said she was in my mother's house. I felt like she wanted me to go over but didn't say ""come over I'm here!"" so I just did other things. My mother called me that night and said she was over there quite a long time. At this time it clicked ""I think she wanted me to go over"" but I honestly didn't pick up on it since I didn't know she would stay there so long. She even came back a second time so yea I might've messed up there. 


Later that same day I opened the texting and she seemed out of it again. Same thing as the other night, but I didn't really want to continue the texting since she didn't seem in it. One words texts etc so I just said ""cool"" and she didn't reply. Honestly I'm getting the feeling she's pissed at me for the reason above. And she didn't even text me today, but she did like a photo of mine while I liked two of hers I believe. I only have two photos on Instagram so yea. 


Another big thing here is the fact she talks to another guy she had talked to before me, but he lives far away from her. To me it's probably the same deal with me but I can get the face to face talking with her. However he does talk to over the phone, but again everyone I tell says she likes you. Like they say most girls won't text first and she laughs at me quite a bit. Bloody hell we even insult each other's flaws as well. So yeah, I'm stuck not going to lie. She seems pissed and the other guy she talks to isn't helping me, but I still can't get passed the fact that I fell for her. It's something I honestly don't want to give up on at all. 

So, what do you guys think I should do here? I would like advice from the outside since you guys can have an unbiased opinion which will help. 


Overview

- We see each other three days in a row I start to get feelings

- My mother tells her I like her and she talks to me for hours

- My sister arranges places where we meet and I believe she tries to get me to admit I like her without saying Asking stuff ""We always meet these days"" etc. 100% trying to get it out of me. 

- She laughs at me quite a bit. Although I'm quite silly when I get to know people. 

- She gets a little shy around the later meet up. 

- She likes my photo and follows me on Instagram

- I text her and we go back and forth

- She texts me first 3 times (During the course of two days. I text her at night so probably 3 times)

- I felt she wanted me to go over and talk to her at my mother's house, but I didn't get the hint until my mother said she was over there for quite a while WITHOUT MY SISTER

- She seems pissed and didn't text at all today while the texts last night were anti climatic. I made her laugh at one point but that was about it

- She talks to a different boy on the phone. He lives miles away and is in school. 

So yea that's honestly what I got. It's a long ass post, but I would like some opinions if anyone did read it all. Thanks,

The school year is 3-4 weeks in and I have As in every class with one B- and one B+,  mostly because of the fact that since the semester is in the beginning, if you mess up on one test your grade goes down a lot. My father took away my computer just because I had 2 Bs. I always do my homework first, and usually end with all As. Do I deserve this or am I just being spoilt?

256,"So we're never really been friends in elementary school. She has her own group, and I had mine. We talked sometimes but we never really clicked, and we often fought over petty things. 

Once high school started, things got really weird. High school started two weeks ago and we have the same classes. Every single class she would sit next to me and only talk to me, constantly. She's quite abrasive, and scares a lot of people away. 

Whenever I get up during class or talk to someone else, she always joins, and awkwardly tries to jump into the conversation. I know she doesn't like me too much, and we honestly don't get along all that well. 

Now here comes the weird part:

Her group of friends go to the same school as us, and have some classes with her, yet she chooses to cling to me. I know that she didn't have a big fight with her friends or anything, but she sits with me at lunch instead of them. She follows me everywhere I go, and everyone assumes I'm one of those people who only has one best friend. Most people I talk to have to awkwardly deal with her and try to include her in the conversation. She makes really mean ""jokes"" to those people, about those people, and makes everyone uncomfortable. She gets mad at people over little things and will not hesitate to fight people physically. 

I'm finding it incredibly hard to make new friends because of her, and many of my old friends stay away from me when she's with me, which is all the time. It's very difficult to drift away from her.

How can I break her off without seeming mean? ",14Sep2017,1

259,"I don't know what or why this happened but ever since I got into college I lost my personality. Back in High School I was confident, funny, charming, energetic, social, and full of life. In my school, there are special awards for the seniors and I won three awards: Most Diplomatic, Funniest, and most likely to be successful. And 2 years later I am so far away from who I used to be and in a negative way. 
I don't know why but now I am not funny at all, I can't hold a conversation, I can't even talk to people. I've become extremely introverted, which I've always been, but the difference is that now I am painfully shy. Back in high school I considered myself an introvert, but I was not shy at all.  Every time I try to talk to people or participate in class, my mind goes blank and feels like it is trapped in a box. This problem is affecting me negatively not only in my social life but also in my academic life since I don't participate in class. Whats weird is that every time I see friends from High School I return to my old self! So I still have it in me which gives me hope.

How can I get my personality back and how can I avoid my mind to go blank or stop it from feeling like it is in a box. 

PS - I am new to reddit so I'm not sure if this is the subreddit I should be posting this, if its not can you please tell me where can I post this and find some help! Thanks!


Thanks everyone for answering, I will go to a counselor here at my university on Monday. Hopefully that will help me get better. ",14Sep2017,5
260,"Hey.

First some background.  I'm a 19 y/o trans girl living at home and going to community college.  I've recently started using the transit system around my college (I can't drive for a few reasons), and today, for the first time, I spent an entire day transporting myself place to place independently.  After class, I went to the mall near my college to watch a movie and led go home.

After my movie, while I was waiting for the bus, I got overwhelmed with dysphoria, existentialism, sadness over an acquaintance who's passed away, and mourning for my lost childhood.  All at once.  To say I was in a negative mindset would be an understatement.

The majority of the campus at a college I used to go to (I dropped out after being sexually assaulted) smoke.  I always saw that as a solution, although I never did it myself.  Today, as I waited for the bus, I waited til I saw a man smoking and asked him for a cigarette.  He thought I was too young and got mad (I was in boy mode for safety reasons, so with my appearance and voice halted by hormones I come across as WAY younger than I am), but I insisted I had an ID, showed him my permit (again, can't drive, but I am learning so I have a permit), he quizzed me on my birthday, then he let me have one.  I did three hits on it before getting overwhelmed and ashamed and then I went on the bus and went home.

I'm scared for several reasons.  My parents are incredibly anti-smoking.  If my parents were to ever find out, they'd be really mad and I'm scared of that.  I'm scared someone at the mall might've known one of them and might tell them.  I'm scared of health complications- I'm getting a broken tooth fixed in five days and I don't want this to have fucked it up. I'm scared that I'll do it again, and get hooked.  I'm scared that the man who saw my ID (full name and b-day) might not be a trustworthy person and might use my information to harm me in some way, or might have doubts, think the ID is fake, and call authorities, which will lead to my parents finding out.  I'm scared that I'll never be trusted again, and I'm scared that maybe I'm really not trustworthy.  What if they buckle down, stop paying me for housework, and I can never go out and see a movie again?  I'm not able to get a job at the moment, what if I'll never get to do anything again?  Or alternatively, what if I become hooked? Or, what if a man who has my information uses it to hurt me or destroy my life?

My parents keep talking about how proud they are that I was independent today.  I couldn't feel more ashamed if I tried.

What the fuck can I possibly do?",14Sep2017,3
265,"Had girlfriends before that I was really committed to, but ultimately those relationships ended. After my last (amicable) breakup, I decided to put everything into my career. Fast forward a few years, and I've got a strong career (though I'll be married to it for at least 2 years before I can exit), and intense sexual frustration. I've thought about getting a girlfriend, but decided against it because I'm unable to commit at the same level as I did before. I find it deeply ironic (and hilarious) that I've gone from wanting to wait till marriage as a gesture of commitment to seriously considering losing it with a professional. But I guess that's what happens when you officially become a wizard.

From my perspective, here are my choices: 

1. Have a ONS: (+) This is what everyone does, no stigma! (-) IMHO many girls go along hoping for something more down the road; I'd feel guilty if I had to ignore her texts the next day. Also, this route looks really time consuming unless you're super good looking.

2. Hire a Prostitute: (+) Completely honest, no mind games/ bullshit, both sides profit. This is legal in my country, and I've even found a college student who's using it to fund her travel habit and not out of financial distress (-) Probably get dumped by my future SO if I tell her / face guilt if I don't. Also, I doubt that normal women would be as good as a professional (given that it's her job) and I may be stuck with unrealistic exectations.

3. Remain sexually frustrated

266,"I used to admire people who were smart. I wanted to be like them. I wanted to get good grades and was very ambitious. I was never successful, however. I kept worshiping smart people, and surrounding myself with them. Yes, it fueled my ambition and gave me energy, but it has turned me into a monster who wants to constantly outdo himself.
Then, I met you. I found out all about your past achievements and spent time with you. You are fast, and extremely knowledgeable and capable. I've seen you in action; how you can switch from one task to another almost seamlessly. I learned how you were valedictorian, how you were able to swim for 6 hours a day, and still had time for boyfriends and 7 AP classes. I questioned myself. HOW? How can you do so much with your time, and still come out on top? Especially when I'm over here having attention problems and can't even handle high school. Then I found out you had an eidetic memory. How can I even match up to that level? I wished I wasn't such an ambitious person. Maybe then, I wouldn't be so hurt that what I want to achieve is so out of my grasp. What do I do? It's like comparing myself to a god. It just isn't fair. I wanted to go to get amazing grades and handle extracurricular as well, but I just can't learn as fast as you. It feels like you're not even a human being.",14Sep2017,1
267,"About a week ago, my best friend told me he's getting married, because he got his girlfriend of <1 year pregnant. I'm his friend and I'll accept whatever choice he makes, but I want what's best for him, and frankly, I think this could be the worst decision of his life.  I think in some ways, having the kid be the reason for the marriage would be more damaging than not getting married at all. He's fairly conservative, but I want him to be absolutely clear on the full range of options. This brings me to my questions:
* What are **all** his options, and how do I articulate them to him?
* Should I just let him live his life, and not interfere?
* if not, how do I bring this up with him in the least confrontational way?

Again, I want to reiterate that I want what's best for him, and if that means biting the bullet and letting him live his life, so be it. Sorry if formatting is bad; I'm pretty new to reddit.",14Sep2017,0
269,"Really don't know where to turn here, so I'm using a throwaway account to ask reddit for advice. 

I'll try to keep this short. I'm 26, my father and I have never gotten along. All my life he's been disrespectful to everyone in my family, alienated any friends he's had (he's never had a single friend come to our home in my life), and sets a horrible example for my sister and I. I'm at wits end with his constant disrespect, talking down to, and mental instability. I want to remove him from my life, but my mom keeps trying to get us to work out our differences and start fresh. Problem is, we've tried that 50+ times in my life.

My issues with my father are long, very long, but I'll name off a few to hopefully help reddit understand my disdain for my father. Foremost, he treats my mom like shit. Disrespects her all the time, has held a gun to her head when she tried to divorce him, and flew to arizona to lounge by the pool when my mothers mom (my grandma) was on her death bed. For two weeks in home hospice. Wasn't there at all, just left and abandon her and my family. He came back 12 hours before the funeral. 

He has never apologized to me in my life, always talks down to me, and it's a vicious cycle that I can't take anymore. I wouldn't let any of my friends treat me the way he treats me, or anywhere close to it for that matter, so I don't want to put up with it from him. 

The flipside is that my mom just wants the peace. She's never one for confrontation, so when my dad wrongs her, she brushes it under the wrong and tomorrow is a new day. The problem is, I'm not okay with that on my end, because he will never correct his wrongdoings if there is not light shined upon them or repercussions for his actions. 

I just want out. I don't want to call him, text him, see him, ever. Nothing. I tried it for the last two months after he was absent for my grandmas passing and it was wonderful. But it ended up turning ugly in group family ""iMessage chats"" when my dad and his mom decided to say hateful things about me non-stop while i'm in the message simply because I wouldn't respond. 

I just want out. What should I do?

270,"This is not for me, but for my boyfriend. 

Description:
Male 
Caucasian
6ft tall
23 years old


He has a pilonidal cyst diagnosed 3 days ago. 

He started antibiotics given by the doctor and he has to take them for 7 days. 

After the first 2 days, the wound closed. Now it almost looks fully healed - i mean there's no wound anymore- the skin is a bit red in that area but it heals nicely. 

The only reason I'm asking for help here is that my bf forgot to ask the doctor about this and now doctor left the country for a few weeks and we are left with no answer for this. 

We are both swimmers and his problem put us both on pause (because he drives with me a few miles to the place we train. Because of his problem, we postponed training this week and I only do cardio for now, but I really want to go back to swimming and He wants too. 

My question:

Can he swim with a pilonidal cyst?
As I said, the wound is closed now. 

He has a scheduled surgery at the end of october!!! Apparently there was no room available to make it sooner and also the doctor said it is not that bad. 

We really want to swim together again but he is afraid now. 

Anyone went through this? Can we get some help? Thank you. ",14Sep2017,1

272,"Right before the semester started, I went on a date with this girl from tinder. It seemed to go well, and she even suggested we go get sushi next time. So the next week, I'm trying to set up a time, and she's kind of reluctant to confirm anything. She does finally agree to go on that Saturday, but then cancels the morning of, because she was ""very busy.""

I don't think I said anything to upset her, and I don't have anything come up if you Google me, so I'm assuming she probably found somebody better. 

Would it be a bad idea for me to text her to ask what went wrong, or something? I don't exactly know what to do when this happens, because I don't know for sure why she stopped texting me.

277,"Usually people ask this of their kids... My boyfriend and I have been together for four years and next year I intend to visit my mom overseas. The boyfriend is in his mid-30's.

Historically this boyfriend has been an incredibly picky eater. If we're going to go out for dinner at a Turkish place for instance, he demands we get Taco Bell first. Then when we order he throws a bitch fit if there's nothing he can recognise on the menu.

For my brother's wedding, he made a big deal about the food being served because it was something he didn't even want to try, and then complained how he was starving all day. It did not make a good impression on my family. 

He's a great guy but he's a huge bitch when it comes to new foods and experiences. I'm personally very open about trying new things so I find it really annoying.

I know for a fact that where my mom lives does not have Taco Bell and the usual shitty food he eats, and she has zero patience for his pickiness.

Should I tell my friend? Would it be appropriate to contact the redditor and see if theyll delete it or ask where they got it?
