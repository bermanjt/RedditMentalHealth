0,"Hey everyone, May's rolling in and it feels like Summer with some incredibly humid weather. I have an AC and it's sorta working, but I suspect an air leak somewhere. I've tried to tape up the window holding the ac as much as I can, but I'm suspecting there's something else.

Does anyone know any advice for finding air leaks?",19May2017,1
2,"My father tried to do something very kind (which it was kind) and surprised me with a guitar. I went through a phase when I was 14-15 and then gave it up and have no interest in picking it up again. When I told him that it was very kind but I don't play anymore he seemed very hurt but told me not to worry and do what I want with it.
It can't be returned as it is second hand. I have considered selling it and giving him the money but I'm not sure if that is even more hurtful. What should I do with the guitar? What is the right thing to do? ",19May2017,1

4,"Hi. I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask for advice like this but I hope someone can help. I'm 22 and have never had a job before. And the reason is, at least on the surface, is i'm a very lazy person. I don't like to work. I have a very poor work ethic much to the disdain of my father. And I hate it. The other reason I don't want to get a job is because I don't have ANY self confidence at all. I don't like to attempt to do things because I assume I am going to be bad at it, so I don't want to get fired from any job I may possibly have in the future. This lack of self confidence comes from my experience of screwing up everything I attempted. At home my parents will yell at me for doing chores wrong and missing little common sense things that I guess come naturally to some people. I'm not stupid. I know I'm not, but I do have moderate ADD and i'm sure I have other issues. I am socially awkward and have issues with things like spacial awareness. I am currently in college studying film making and the problem is, I suck at that too. I don't have the self confidence to go out there and make stuff and I'm just okay at the technical aspects. I don't have a passion for it really. I've never really had a passion for anything and therefore I have no real skills in which to market myself with. I am going to be a senior next year so the clock is ticking until I have to join the real world. In order to graduate I have to get an internship, which I am terrified of. My parents hate that I haven't done anything worthwhile with my life. And I do too. I just wish that I had more self confidence. My question basically is. What type of jobs should I look for with my lack of experience and what steps should I take to improve my life. I hate being stagnant while all my friends are doing things with they're lives and I wish I could do. I'm just too scared to",19May2017,2

7,"Hi all,

First of all, I want to thank you guys for reading this. I've been recently introduced to reddit and how comforting it is to post some more personal stories on this site. I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to submit this at, but it is the one that makes the most sense to me.

So I'm 24 years old, graduated with my bachelors degree a year and a half ago. I went into college hoping to get into medical school, but there's been a big thing in my way, the MCAT. 

After finishing my sophomore year of college, I decided that I would start studying for the test. Mid-way into studying for my exam, I tore my ACL, PCL and Meniscus in my left knee, so I elected to do some prehab on my knee before my surgery at the end of the year. This took away from a lot of time I thought I would have to study, so I decided to cancel my exam.

I decided I would take my exam 2 years later, after I had graduated from school, but during this time of prehab and rehab after surgery, my grades suffered. Not being able to run or play sports was something I was never really prepared to face and it really made me sad. During this time, my parents noticed that my grades weren't up to par, so they started to micromanage a lot of what I was doing. I wasn't really receptive to this, often telling them to leave me alone.

I didn't do so well on my second attempt of getting ready for the exam. I actually took the exam, and was ranked in the 45 percentile of the students who took the exam. 

After seeing this score, my parents saw merit in giving me advice, and at this point, I have no choice but to listen to them. 

I decided to cool myself off and give myself a break from studying by working as a research assistant for a year. I did this until 3 months ago, where I decided to start studying to try to study for the MCAT one last time.

This time around, I've decided to try and take their advice. Their advice however, isn't really matching what made me succeed before. I've had a schedule where I stay at home for all day to study. I can only go out for one meal with my friends during the week and I can only go to the gym for an hour and a half each day. Other than that, I am to stay at home and study.

At first, I found that this was a good plan. My scores on my practice exams have been improving way beyond to where I was at when I first took the exam. As time went on, I felt some form of burnout. I wanted to go study at a library nearby, but my parents just tell me I would be wasting my time. That is one example of things they would tell me that I felt like wasn't really the best advice for me to follow. This has been followed with a lot of frustration on my part and it's even taken away from my studies and my relationship with my mom and dad. My mom is even cancelling her vacation plans with my sister (who just graduated college) to make sure I am on task.

At this point, I am sick of this situation. I want to be able to fix this, but it is hard because I know they mean well. I feel like they are doing things the wrong way, but I don't know how to voice my opinion to them. Anytime I try and do so, the conversation ends in how I need to just keep myself focus and ignore moments where I feel weak like this. But the more I do that, the more I find myself into a hole where I feel like I can't get anything done.

So.... what do you think about this, Reddit?

9,"Mine is a month away from 7yo and an only child, I and another parent have witnessed or overheard the other children call him names, or try to hurt him, or break our things to try and get him in trouble. There are about 15 regular kids of varying ages and not one of them doesn't pick on him at some point, and none of them stand up for him, if there is no one else for them to play with they are nice to him and they get along fine. Four of the kids are siblings and have amazing parents who agree that the kids are being awful to mine. We've scolded, removed, or banned the offenders and preached that ""That's not how friends treat each other, you don't need people like that around, tell them off or don't play with them when they are mean to you, you are a good healthy person who doesn't have any need for people who treat you poorly"" I've gone so far as to say no one can play at our house for a whole week and I bought him a whole bunch of cool yard toys to play with because of the ""bully ban"". But I could tell that he felt like he was the one being punished, he absolutely can't stand to be by himself so he allows them to treat him this way because otherwise he feels alone. My husband and I are both also only children and just can't relate to this need, we're perfectly happy to be by ourselves, even as children, and I don't know where to begin to give him a sense of independence, I think if he can enjoy occasionally being by himself then he will be ok with telling mean kids to take a hike. But all of this is out of my depth and I don't even know where to begin and I hate seeing my little guy going through all this, it must feel awful. Please help me help him.",19May2017,2
11,"So about a year ago, I befriended someone (we'll call him T), and since then we've become very close. We talk to each other every day, and get along amazingly. When I met T, he had a very close group of friends... two of them he is especially close with- I'll call them B and S. While T is a kind, and wonderful person, his friends are... less wonderful. S immediately became threatened by me when I befriended T, and B is extremely mistrustful of me. From what I understand, T was back stabbed by a close friend, and as a result of that S and B (along with the rest of this friend group) are extremely aggressive towards new friends. It had made me feel extremely attacked and uncomfortable, on many occasions. 

Anytime I have even a minor disagreement with T, or he vents to them about something I've said or done that may have hurt his feelings, no matter how insignificant, S and B dogpile me with accusations. It's almost like they're waiting for me to make a mistake, so they can pounce on me and turn T against me. 

 A good example- T made an offensive/sexist comment the other day, and I privately commented to him that it had hurt my feelings. He acted respectful to my face, but later on, I got threatening, accusational messages from B and S upset that 'I basically called T an asshole and if I was a real friend I'd just suck it up'. 

It's worth noting that these friends have sort of created an ""echo-chamber"" around T where he feels that any kind of criticism or difference in opinion is a threat. I feel that he isn't rebuffing his friends' inappropriate behavior because their hostility towards me when upset with me is comforting.

Is there any chance that I can maintain a friendship with someone who's friends are hostile towards me for no reason? I feel like I'm constantly walking in the shadow of a completely different person, even though I've never intentionally hurt T and have no intent to. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him and his friends. Should I confront this, or is it better to end the friendship?",19May2017,1
14,"My mom has been an alcoholic for years. I learned of it a couple years ago, and have been at a loss how to help. She refuses rehab. She hasn't worked in years, and her health is so bad now she couldn't possibly at this point. She lived with her dad until he was too sick (and she couldn't take care of him) so she went to live with my sister. That didn't work out, and she moved in with her on/off boyfriend of the last twenty or so years. They fight constantly. It's like a Cops episode over there. I don't think he will let her stay much longer. After that, I don't know. 


I live on the west coast, and my family is in the south east. None of is have much money. My sister is about to move a few states over too. I have a girlfriend and two kids, my sister has a husband and two kids as well. Neither of us can really afford to do much for her. I pay for a phone for her on a family plan, so it's only $20 a month. More than that I can't do much with. I can't pay her rent, and even if I could, I can't afford to fly back there all the time to deal with all the problems. I can't rent a place for her and destroy my own life financially when she wrecks the place. We are struggling to save for a house. My kids want a yard and a dog. It's not fair to them if they can't have a happy childhood because my mom is a fuck up. 


But for all her faults, she raised me (at least partially - she and my dad divorced when I was 5, so she was a weekend mom) to be a good person. I know this isn't my fault or responsibility, but I don't know how I could live knowing she's dead on the street somewhere. 


Are there any social programs for this? Is there any help for her that's free? I can't pay five grand a month for a rehab place. Want to or not, I simply do not have it. And if I did, I don't think she'd go and I can't afford to be responsible for that from the other side of the country. Can she get any kind of help from the government? She's only 57. With help, maybe she could work again. She was once very skilled as a chef. Is there anything I can do without sacrificing my kids lives, happiness, and development? This shit is tearing me up. Any advice is so appreciated. 


EDIT:  Thank you guys so much for your help. Things may be working themselves out here. Well, after a lot of phone calls. I wanted to update in case someone finds this thru Google some day and needs the same kind of help.


My mom and her boyfriend got into a bad fight a couple days ago. He was arrested, but bailed out. My sister went to check on my mom and she was injured. Not bad, but some bruises, which she and the boyfriend both say are mostly from herself - she's been drinking herself into a frenzy and can't control herself. My sister took her to the hospital, and we talked to the doctor. She's okay, but had a BAC of damn near .30. She's been admitted to the hospital (they just went to the ER), and will be detoxing there for a few days. They're giving her morphine and crap and letting the alcohol get out of her. After that they'll have a psychologist come in and check her out. If she has problems (this seems likely to be the evaluation) they will transfer her to a rehab facility. The hospital works with a non-profit rehab place that she won't have to pay for. There will be social workers to help and such as well. This seems really promising. So if you guys have a similar issue, if you've got an alcoholic friend or relative, you can get help for this as a MEDICAL issue (as it should be!). The hospital we went to was awesome, and so helpful. She might actually get some help now. :)",19May2017,8
17,"I am 23 and young brother is 14. I am wondering what kind of advice/books/videos can you give me on how to be a better role model? Long story short, I kinda fucked up in school but I am doing better. I never had much friends or girlfriends and he seems to be heading towards that path.

The difference is that I was calm and obedient, he is the polar opposite. He has excellent grades in most classes but he got expelled from a prestigious school because of his behavior and often not doing his homework. He is currently in the same situation and is driving my parents crazy. We went to 2 different psychologists, often have talk with him, I do many kind of activites with him like karting, movies, cooking, basketball, gaming...but I feel I am not doing enough.

Now, just got expelled from the new school because he was bullying a group of kids and skipped his detention. He cannot be reasoned with and I don't know if I should play the good cop/bad cop, I am tired of picking up his shit and hurting my parents.

31,"I currently have a job that pays about $31k per year. Additionally I receive approximately $200-800 per year in bonuses, 11 paid holidays, and 127 hours of PTO- which I can basically take whenever I want. I get health insurance (and dental and vision) through them AND they offer domestic partner benefits for my boyfriend (though I am taxed on his portion of the their contribution). They also offer $1000 per year into a healthcare savings account and they offer a 401k with a 5% match. My commute is a predictable (very little traffic) 25-30 minutes. This is a job that I am not in love with, but I basically leave it there and don't take it home with me. I am not able to work more than 40 hours per week and it offers me a good amount of scheduling flexibility, time off for travel, time for hobbies, etc. There is room for growth if I was willing to move, which I may eventually be- but probably not for the next 2 years at least.

I was just offered a new job. This is more in line with what I enjoy doing and is what I went to school for. It has a lot more responsibility and a lot more hours. The pay is between $40k and $50k with the possibility of an additional $10k in bonuses. It will offer health insurance for me, but not my partner, and no dental or vision (I wear glasses and need regular check ups). No 401k or profit sharing. It is salary and offers time off, but I am only able to take the time off in January and February, and when I'm away I will still need to be reachable. This position will be 50+ hours per week- and for the summer (June-September) it will average 60+ hours per week. My new commute would be 40 minutes if I'm lucky, but probably will be a traffic nightmare most days causing the commute to be more like 50+.

I know there are a lot of other factors, but just based on these descriptions which looks better? I want a better job, is it wrong for me to not want to give up my personal life in order to get ahead. I'm 28, should I just suck it up and put it a ton of hours now in order to become more financially secure? I really like to travel and I like to have time to myself and I'm concerned I won't be able to. I'm not sure what to do.",19May2017,1

I'm wondering if I should take my last year of high school or if I should just skip my senior year and get a GED so I can focus on getting a job instead. You see, I plan on moving out as soon as possible and if I do end up moving out soon then finding a new high school is going to be difficult since I don't know if really even want to stay in the same city or state or even country (I'm considering moving to Canada at the moment). Not to mention my parents probably won't sign me up for another year if I decide to move out (which I will) so if I wanted to take another year of high school I'd have to become an ""emancipated minor"" and that's going to be a huge hassle to do. Not to mention if I do find a house I can afford in Canada I'm also going to have to try and get my Canadian Citizenship too. Some people have said that if get a GED rather than finishing high school and getting a diploma that I'm going to have a hard time finding a job or getting into college but the thing is I want to pursue a art career so I don't really think that's all that important. I don't plan on pursuing any big, fancy, high-paying jobs I just need enough to get by each month while I try and build up my reputation is all. And as for college I can't go to any big colleges immediately after graduating anyways because apparently I haven't met the ""a-g requirements"" to do so (I didn't even know a-g requirements existed until this point!) besides I've heard from other places on the internet that the majority of colleges will except people with GEDs anyways so I don't know if that's actually true or not. I also don't have any friends who go to school with me since my parents signed me up for an online school (against my will btw) and all of my friends live far away because we moved out of the old house so I don't really have anyone who would miss me if I left.

I suited up in some long clothes and leather gloves and got a pillowcase (closing the door behind me) to try to catch it. When I went back into my room, though, I didn't see the bat flying around anymore. 

There are *lots* of corners in my room and places a bat could hide, including two large, not-well-insulated closets (think more like an attic), the doors to which were open. I put on a headlamp and searched high and low, but couldn't find the bat anywhere. I took a screen out of one of my windows but later put it back in, figuring the bat was gone.

The problem is, there was no clear escape route for the bat between when I first spotted it and when I re-entered the room. So even though I searched all over and couldn't find it, I would be sort of surprised if it found a way out. I'm sleeping in the hallway tonight, and I won't be comfortable sleeping in my room until I'm sure the bat is gone. What can I do to ensure it is gone?

69,"I'm a 26-year-old professional living in a 2 bedroom / 1 bathroom duplex with one other male about my age, who happens to be a friend of mine from years back. I've been living in this duplex for going on 2 years now, and he moved in about 9 months ago when my old roommate moved away. While we certainly aren't super close, we get along well and have no problems being in the same room or hanging out. 

I by no means am a clean freak and most people would probably consider my room messy, however, I live by the idea that when living with other people, common areas should be tidy-ish. To me, that means few dishes left in the sink, no moldy leftovers in the refrigerator, and a relatively clean bathroom. I don't expect that dishes be washed as soon as they're dirty, that the toilet bowl be sparkling clean, or set any kind of cleaning schedules. We're adults with lives of our own, I'm not his keeper and he's not mine. I do my part, and I expect my roommates to do the same. 

So here's the problem: my current roommate does not live with these same ideas. He doesn't do dishes with any sort of frequency (though certainly makes his share of dishes), has never once cleaned the bathroom, doesn't take out the trash, and doesn't clean out his leftovers from the fridge. I understand that not everyone has the same priorities with regards to cleaning, so have just let it go. 

As a result of recent events, I now spend more time at my house (was previously out of town nearly every weekend for work), and now the state of my house is starting to affect my mood. I dread coming home because I know it's going to be a mess; I hate cooking because there isn't room in the sink to clean up my dishes or the dishes I need are already in the sink covered in grime and old food; I don't want to bring friends or my girlfriend over because my house is embarrassingly dirty.

I've opened dialogues over having cleaning days that were met with ""yeah, totally"" and then when the time comes I'm the only one cleaning. I've gone out of my way to recognize him when he does clean, thanking him and showing genuine appreciation. None of it translated into any kind of regular cleaning, and now I've resorted to just passive-aggressively only cleaning the dishes I make and leaving his messes to him. But this has only backfired, as he doesn't seem to notice or care, and the only person it seems to affect in the end is me. It's been two weeks of me not cleaning up after him, he's had two 3-day weekends to clean up the messes that he has left in the house, yet he made no attempt or mention of the messes and instead cloistered himself in his room. 

I know that I'm not the only one who's gone through this, and I'm sure that many of you have advice on how to rectify the situation in a positive way. So, how do I constructively and respectfully bring up that the current state of the house is negatively affecting me and that I'm doing everything I can and need him to take responsibility and help out?",19May2017,2
70,"Someone I know, from university, added me up on Facebook. I sent him a message asking how he was. He said he was doing great, then gave me his text number, suggesting that we get together sometime. He let me know on Facebook IM that he was lousy with text and message responses.

Taking his heads up in stride, I texted him. He didn't respond (as expected), but a few weeks went by without response. I decided to let things be and wait. Finally, I ran into him at a gathering. He seemed really happy to see me and kept on saying how he would like to get together and suggested we do dinner sometime, and used a few specific examples (let's try dinner on a weeknight or during the weekend). He also said, yes, he got my text. We only had a few minutes, so I told him I would text him again, then we went on our separate ways.

I texted him again to follow up. Still no response. It's been a week. I'm unsure as what to do next. I don't want to be a ""pest"" and bother him, but he seemed genuinely interested in person. It's odd and somewhat off-putting, but I don't want to give up. 

And, yes, he has an iPhone like I do – the texts were delivered, just in case anyone asks.

82,"That title sounded really dramatic and clickbait-ish, but it kind of makes sense.

A couple weeks ago, I met a girl here on Reddit. We exchanged snapchats and started talking. We talked everyday, we had Skype calls, she even said I was handsome. We always joked around and never took each other seriously.

This Monday, I opened Snpachat and found out she had deleted me. Same thing happened on Skype. The only thing I could think of was the fact that she started to not reply to my snaps, but I just assumed she was busy with her studying. When I talked to her about it, she said she didnt even notice it happened and that she was thankful I told her about it.

I've been through a couple similar situations lately (another friend who left me, for example, but then came back saying she was sorry and that it was a mistake leaving me(, and now I'm thinking:

Company 2) Huge world wide IT/STREAMING company, distance is 1,5 hour with the train, will be sleeping at familymembers house or rent an room/appartment with a classmate of mine. 

There are two departments which are interested in me, one of them is Service Operation Center where I need to have great problem solving ability and mainly focussing on assisting other departments or customers.

The other one is the Network Operation Center where I'll be configuring switches mostly, I have configured switches before such as the Foundry FastIron and the Juniper switch but it was a bit difficult for me but still kind of fun when it worked.

114,"Hello everyone,

I'm 19 years old, living in Germany and I study Informatics (B. Sc) at the moment.
I'm feeling so empty and joyless since I finished high school. My plan was to make an education as  an application developer after school, but every company where I applied to rejected me. I still don't know why. My grades were really good (only 1 and 2/ A's and B's) and the interviews were all good...it's depressing when you don't know the reason why company's reject you. 
Because, I was only rejected by the company's, I thought about going to a university. So I applied to the university in Gießen (Technical University) and now I'm here in the second semester and I'm doing absolutely nothing. I got no motivation to study anything, but on the other hand I don't want to quit somehow...I'm just so unsure. In the first semester I passed only 2/5 exams... I was so ashamed of myself, so I forced myself to study more in the second semester, but again the same game. Doing nothing all day, except laying around, watching YouTube, chat with my gf and playing videogames. My mood is so bad for a long time now...it affects my gf, my family and my friends. I was so motivated and happy in high school, got so many friends. My life was simply perfect at that time...I want that feeling back. I often have thoughts like: ""you are stupid, you don't known how the world works, look at you, you whiny piece of shit. Just die and don't waist the time of other's"".

Thinking about going to a psychiatrist right now...",19May2017,4
115,"I'm the Supervisor for the Security Team at a sales call building. My direct boss in the company is the Branch Manager who facilitates numerous buildings around the northern region of the city.
I'm in charge of team leadership, scheduling, invoicing, client relations on a day to day basis, and of course just general security and making sure people are at work on time and in uniform.

My boss literally comes by, maybe once every six months. Otherwise, I email him the invoice for paycheck confirmations, and he makes hiring/firing decisions on a case by case basis; that's it. I never see him otherwise.

Our client is the building Facilities Manager, who further has two clients who rent out sections of the building he owns and maintains. I see him every day, he works in the office next to my teams little room. He has access to all of our files, all of our computer logs, all of our time sheets, our security cameras, etc. If he wants to know something, he can find it out whether I tell him or not.

Recently, we had a problem employee. General laziness, lack of dress code, not showing up on time, leaving the post for an hour or more at a time when you aren't supposed to leave at all, etc.

I contacted my Branch Manager and informed him of the issue. For SIX MONTHS I emailed, called, or texted him regularly informing him of the situation, that the guard showed no improvement, that no amount of coaching (both written and verbal, at least once a month) changed anything with this guard. Mind you, our job literally consists of signing the schedule sheet, watching the cameras, and filling out a ONE PAGE report each day. That's it. 

So, there's a point where you can be certain that it isn't anymore about the employee not knowing what to do, or how. This is literally the easiest job ever. Employees watch Netflix and even play games at work, as long as their job gets done, I don't care; and the Facilities Manager/Client knows this. He pays us to make people feel comfortable and safe, and to follow legal regulations since one of his renters does taxes and works with the IRS, so he doesn't mind. Again, as long as the work gets done.

Six months of constantly telling my boss about the problem go by, he either ignores me or tells me he'll handle it and doesn't. At one point, maybe four months in, he asks me to begin emailing him specifics of what the employee is doing. Since I would have been emailing him a 2 page document literally every day, I kept it to one a week; about 7 pages worth of this person not doing their job  and having an attitude about it and blatantly so. After 5 weeks of one-a-week emails, he simply told me to stop bothering him about it.

Finally, after all that time, the Facilities Manager came to me and asked me what was going on since he was discovering discrepancies in that employees paperwork. I told him we were aware of the problem, and that I'd been working on it for a time now. I contacted my Branch Manager and informed him that the client was now aware of the employee's failings. He finally instructed me that I was allowed, from now on, to write up anyone I like for any reason so long as I have evidence, and after 3 write-ups he'd fire them. Only took him six months, but ok.

So, I went to the client in an attempt to inform him that his concerns were being addressed, and since this employee had been AS BAD as they were, to prevent him from being caught off guard by any potential blow up. I told him of the write up coming up that week. He thanked me for the heads up and that was it.

Branch Manager summarily found out from the problem employee that I had discussed the write up with the Facilities Manager. He was given no context, and I don't even know how the problem employee found out about that; the Facilities Manager insists he said nothing to them, and none of my other team members were in the building the day of that discussion.

In any case, upon finding out about said conversation, my boss informed me that should I ever discuss anything regarding employee disciplining procedures, employees with bad behavior, or any other issue that he deems to ""affect the client's opinion of the company brand"" I would be fired.

Needless to say, I went directly to the Facilities Manager and told him verbatim what my boss had told me. This was, to me, an issue of integrity and character, and I imagine the ongoing situation would have been far worse had the client not been aware of the employee's and now my bosses behaviors; and of course the facts regarding my attempts to fix things. Facilities Manager agreed, said it sounded more like Branch Manager wanted to hide things from him, than to be honest; that it made far more sense to ensure a client was not caught unaware of a problem and was always informed that in fact the security team are catching these types of problems early on and correcting them quickly. He said my actions had given him faith in our team, while the Branch Manager's actions and statements lost his trust in the company.

Facilities Manager proceeded to review several interactions with Branch Manager from the past year, only to discover their were numerous cases of shady dealings and outright lies to make the security company look good. Mind you, ALL of these issues upon review came directly from the lazy Branch Manager, who couldn't be helped to hire a decent employee in the first place, and certainly couldn't be bothered to assist in retraining, disciplining, or firing said employee. None of his bosses had done anything shady, and I myself had not either. It was all stemming from him, directly, and there was paperwork and witnesses and so on to confirm it all.

The Facilities Manager has now lost all trust in the Branch Manager, and in our company.

In essence, my boss asked me to lie to our client in order to make the company look good, and has been caught having been doing so since he took over the job from the previous Branch Manager last year.

In the meantime, Facilities is working on ensuring that our team keeps their jobs (minus the problem employee of course), even if it means hiring us on as private security (we'd be paid more and it would be cheaper for them honestly), while also finding a way to mount evidence against the B-Man and get him fired.

Does anyone else find this to be a huge breach from expected professional integrity, and is it possible what B-Man was asking me to do was actually illegal in some way? Is there anything specific I should do? I'm pretty smart, and capable, but at this point simple ""cover your own ass"" doesn't seem to cut it. Feeling a little in over my head.",19May2017,2

121,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting but I can't make up my mind about what to do with my exchange year abroad. I currently have few options. I'm sorry this might sound like a first world problem post but I've made multiple pros and cons lists to only get lost in them. 

The first is to extend my 3 year course to a 5 year course (1 full year abroad, and another studying the language). This gives me a double degree, a language and design one. My uni provides free airfare, but I pay for accomodation, food and other living expenses. I really want to throw myself out into the deep end and pick Switzerland, studying French, for my chosen country but I would like to spend a year exploring Japan, studying Japanese. The only reason I don't want to pick Japan is that the flight tickets are relatively cheap and I will definitely go to Japan regardless of whether or not I go for my exchange year. I wouldn't mind learning Japanese either, I grew up learning Chinese so it kind of links. The sole reason I want to go to Switzerland was for the scenery and an almost suicidal mission, that being in Europe and out of my comfort zone. I've only travelled around Asia. I did study French in my first year of high school but 10/10 I only remember how to introduce myself and recognising cheese on a menu. The only reason I am considering dropping this opportunity is that it extends my uni degree by 2 entire years and if I was thinking about doing an honours year for my design degree, spending 6 years at uni sounds absolutely horrible. 

Another option is to study a diploma. It would be side to side with my design course (which I'm already suffering in, mind you), and I would still be able to go on exchange for 3-6 months. For this, I'm considering studying French in Switzerland or Japanese again. 

There are a few other opportunities such as the normal student exchange, no studying needed. However, it's not guaranteed I will be able to go on exchange which is what I'd like. I could also do this if I choose to do the double degree, but only after my year abroad which would be in the 4th year. I could also go overseas with scholarship options, ideally to Korea. There's also other volunteer programs that allow me to build houses etc in 3rd world countries which I'd love to do except I'd have to pay for the entire thing myself. 

I'm sorry for writing such a long post. I'm really stuck in a rut. Any advice, criticism, ideas would be helpful! ",19May2017,1

This was the second time I got this far (last time they said no feedback) and as I said I WANT THIS POSITION SO MUCH so I am obviously keen to get feedback

TIME LINE

- Had interview and was told to wait a week to email for feedback

- 4 business days letter send email requesting

- a week later still haven't heard anything (was about a week ago), He replied back that night saying he wanted to ring me for feedback and asking when would suit me, and that they only ended up only hiring 1 person for the 2 positions available. This was Friday so I said monday worked and gave him my details

- monday came................ and went with no call, so I emailed him back saying tuesday works too, however I got an auto reply saying he was out of the office all week because of a conference (explains why he didn't ring)

I am planning on emailing him on sunday so it is first thing in his inbox on monday however I am so confused by what this actually means...

I know I am probably reading into it, and I am obviously not going to be the first thing in his list of priorities,  but it just seems like A LOT of delays..... but then why would he reach out offering a phone call if he was trying to get rid of me..... why would you not mention the conference if he was genuine with his offer

So I currently work in a supermarket part time whilst I'm at university. I do 10 hours a week on checkouts spread across a Saturday daytime and Monday evening. I've basically been doing everyday though since I've broken up for university and doing exams, so I'm doing more overtime than my actual contracted hours, which is fine when I want to but over the previous summer I literally worked every day, and it kinda got to me, money was good but I had like no time to myself! Now I've transferred to a new store since I've been at uni, and it's coming to the time again where it feels like they are going to be asking me to come in every day! But this time it's worse, it's not just down the road, I'll be doing a 45 minute drive to work and back every day, so at least an hour and a half of driving a day. I chose to do this as it's only 3 months before I'm back to my accommodation and it saves me transferring and going though all the hassle again. In theory I don't mind doing this say, a max of 5 days a week, then I get two to myself at least. But I know exactly what will happen and I'm going to be working literally every day. The worst part is they genuinely have no one else to cover it as now I'm on the customer service desk and it's only a team of 8 people! What do I do? I don't want to quit, I just want to be working a decent amount of hours a week, but also have free time. I've been seeing a girl as well just to really make it worse, and she doesn't go to university and works full time instead, but if I'm working everyday I will never get any time to see her, which I would like to do really. For example when I say ""no I can't do any overtime"" baring in mind, im in twice for my contracted hours, and already doing like 2/3 extra days as overtime they ask why, and I dont really have an excuse, I just want some free time really which is kinda understandable? I think they're understaffed and they talked about offering me say like 26 hours a week on contact and then dropping them when I go back to uni, not too sure on this idea as I won't know my timetable until September and I may end up loosing most of my hours since I'd have took these 26 hours in the day, got to uni and can't do them, which will leave me with like 1 day of work for 6 hours a week if I'm lucky!

133,"I have not felt genuine happiness for as long as I can remember, I'm 20.
I've felt like laughing, like crying and like fighting, I've felt happy for others or happy for something that happened but if someone asked me am I happy.. I'd reply not really, if they asked if I'm happy with how my life is as of now I'd say no.

It sounds ridiculous, I don't hate myself, I just don't feel comfortable I genuinely don't feel like I'm where I could or should be. I can distract myself from it by going out with my friends or by playing music but  the second I'm alone it's back, it could be depression or it could just be me being unhappy in where I am.

I've wanted to be rich for as long as I could remember, but I recently I've re-evaluated, I want to be happy, people do say that money can't make you happy, I still want a high standard of living, to be financially successful but to feel successful in my own right to feel like I'm happy where I am and who I'm with. 

It's hard for me to put into words, and this doesn't usually happen. I just don't feel happy. 
I don't care for big mansions and fast cars, I do want luxury but not exuberance.

I guess the TL;DR is I feel like I'm wasting my time and as a result I'm not where I want to be, I don't know how to get there but I know I want to have freedom, I don't want to have to work to live necessarily (I want to have assets/a portfolio that make money).

135,"So here's the deal. I'm coming up into my Senior year of College for Fall 2017. It's been a ridiculous ride, I've lost friends, girlfriends, etc., all the while trying to do the very best I can and make it out on top for when I graduate. I've been working on my craft my entire life, learning everything there is to know (details not important). I'm the top student in my class, both in skill and ambition. I'm looking so far ahead to the things I want to accomplish for myself and future family.

But here's where things get interesting. Now that I have ""moved out"" and currently live in an apartment, my parents have become... weird. It's a constant guilt trip with them. For instance, I've come home every weekend for the past month and now I just want to stay in the city (I have to go back to this piece of crap town in the country where I have very bad memories of a past relationship - hence one of the main reasons why I hate going back). So they start telling me how ungrateful I am, even though I have a huge workload and am unable to get any work done at their place as they do not have a computer (and I hate laptops so I only have a desktop PC) So I'm basically marooned on an island for the entire weekend, getting days behind in work and they see absolutely no problem with that. They seem resistant to the fact that I have to move to California (I'm in South Carolina) for my job, seeing as that's the only place where I can be truly happy and successful. At this point I'm not sure what I can possibly do and at the rate that things are going, we're going to end up being one of those families that don't ever talk to eachother.

**Side topic**
But honestly, should I even care if it comes to that? I mean why should I sacrifice my own future and happiness just for their pleasure? And just fyi, it's always been a struggle, since I was ever able to take of breathe of fresh consciousness from their over-protective cloud of ideals and morals to think for myself, it's been nothing but a roller coaster ride. I mean my parents and I are the absolute, 180°, exact opposites of each other.

So, thing is we'll get a child in 3 to 5 weeks and prepared the room for our son. So he started complaining at our landlord​ resp. the company that owns the houses and did not talk to us.

Few days ago my wife was taking out the trash. He went to her and threatend to beat me up and make noise in the attic above us when our child is born if we don't stop.

I went to a lawyer in my company to write him politely that he should stop to threaten us, because my wife was really upset. The landlord even got a copy.

Today I saw a note besides the stairway (which he writes he has written with approval of our landlord) in which he points the finger on us and says we make his living here nearly unbearable. But I assume that or landlord didn't approve such an direct assault, guess he meant more of an impersonal open letter.

Now I'm really not sure what to do. Write the landlord to grant me taking it off and stick a not that it's bullshit or just take it off... I don't want to go to him personally because I'm not sure that I'm able to keep calm after the incident with my wife. Should I go to the lawyer again or even do nothing?

As a bonus, in his note it says now also, that we are trampling and slamming doors... 

Sorry, this got longer than I thought it would. But I appreciate every help.",19May2017,3
149,"Some context: I'm 26. My dad is 48. We've had a history of fights and arguments. He inherited some money from selling my grandparents' house last year. He bought two houses, one legally under my name and my brother's and another one under his name. Unofficially, the house under my name and my brother's is mine (I currently live there) and the other, is my brother's (He and my father live there).


He decided to buy those two in the suburban area of my town, which means 2-ish hours of commute daily. 4 if I decide to go to college too. This leaves me with no time to do anything, on top of being in a very residential and dangerous area. I don't have a car, so I take the bus every day.


From scratch, I wanted a small apartment in the city. He pushed for a house in the suburbs (because you could get more space for the same ammount of money). When he announced it was either that, or nothing, I had to accept.


I kept trying to convince him and my brother to sell the house and buy something smaller, but within the city, neglecting space in favor of shorter commutes and safer neighborhoods. He throws a temper tantrum every time I bring that up.


I can either talk with him one more time and hope he'll listen to reason, or just go to a lawyer and sell it legally (as the house is under my name and my brother's, and I can sell it if I want, but that'd mean putting money upfront, which even though I have, I'd rather not spend there.



Also, my dad is an alcoholic and a drug addict, and he tends not to listen to reason and get really angry even though I politely expose my logical points on why I want to move to a smaller apartment. I also politely remind him that I'm an adult and that I should have a say regarding where I live every day.


What should I do? Give it another go? Wait for him to drop dead from smoking and snorting cocaine? Get a lawyer?",19May2017,0
150,"We don't talk to much anymore but I asked over the summer a year ago if he wanted to meet up and he invited me to his birthday party.

This guy seems to be testing the acoustic abilities of his mouth. When he eats chips, he chows down on it with his teeth bared and it's ridiculously loud. When he eats a burger he smacks his lips and makes disgusting sucking sounds between every god damn bite. Some of the noises he makes isn't even a byproduct of chewing. He likes to different noises and sounds depending on what he eats. It's driving me nuts.",19May2017,21
162,"My husband and I have been married for 5 months.  We have been together for almost 5 years now.  We have been long distance for the past 3 years (about 2.5 hours apart) because he is in residency, which was not really a problem for us before. Our plan was to move in together after he finished residency in June.  A couple months after we got married he started intensely studying for his medical boards. While he was studying, he became pretty distant and had limited communications with me.  I chalked it up to his studying and working his last year in residency until he e-mailed me that he was not happy and felt that I often snapped at him and things are not the same as before.  I recognized what he said and we talked and I said I would work on it, which I truly think I have gotten a lot better.  However, since then, he has continued to keep his distance and appear uninterested.  He has already taken his test (and is now waiting for results), and he still doesn't seem to want to see each other either.  This weekend would have been our opportunity to see each other alone after a long time and he said he wants to be alone and think about some things.  I feel he hasn't really given me or us an opportunity to flesh out our problems.  I want to give him space to think, but I am worried that all of this distance will only make things worse.  It is so hard to try to fix things when we do not live together and we rarely talk on the phone anymore.  I don't want to push too hard, but I don't want to give up.  We had lengthy discussions pre marriage about how marriage is super important and we will work hard on it.  I feel completely lost about what he is thinking and how to fix this.  I'm sure he is really stressed out about his test results and I know he has been realllly tired/exhausted.  He worked 4-5 weeks straight with no days off as he started picking up extra shifts on the weekend, which I wasn't sure he was doing to avoid me.  I just feel lost and don't know what to do.  I really want to work on this, but he's not giving me a chance to do that or an explanation of what is really going on!",19May2017,3
163,"My husband’s friend (who works as an accountant) filed our taxes in 2016 and was supposed to file them this year as well. Although he works as an accountant for a company, he was trying to earn extra money by doing tax preparation on the side. I was not comfortable with the arrangement but my husband wanted to help his friend out. 

One week before taxes were due, the friend called my husband and said he was swamped and would not be able to do our taxes this year. We gave him our documents in February so he should have said something sooner. My mom called her accountant and asked him if he could help us out and he quickly emailed me offering to file an extension and then prepare our taxes. 

He filed the extension and sent an email confirming that he had done so and instructed us to send a check to the IRS based on the amount that we owed last year so that we would not incur interest on the money we will potentially owe. We followed his instructions and sent him confirmation. Now here is where the trouble starts. After the extension was filed, we never heard back. After 3 weeks, I became uneasy and sent him an email asking if he needed any addition information and asking about the status of our taxes. He replied that he never received anything but the information we had submitted to him to file the extension. This was hard to believe because files were submitted using a secure drop site through his company and a popup notification would appear when the upload was successful. In addition, I emailed him on April 20th letting him know that I had uploaded the documents. If he hadn’t received them, why didn't he tell me at that time as opposed to three weeks later?

We resubmitted the documents immediately and asked him to confirm that he received them. He never replied. I waited two business days and called his office and left a message with his secretary and and he still has not responded and two more days have passed.

I am freaking out. I just want our taxes filed. I am nervous that we might be getting charged interest since the check is based off the previous year and just an educated guess. I am not sure if I am being unreasonable about my expectation that he would file ASAP. I do not know how this usually works since we have always filed on time. Is it normal for a CPA to ignore calls and emails? I understand that we are probably low priority, but he did agree to prepare our taxes and take us on as clients and now he is brushing us off and I feel frustrated.

Part of me want to just find a new accountant, but I’m nervous that he will bill us for hours that he supposedly spent working on our taxes and we would have to pay two different accountants. Help! I have no idea what to do. I’m scared to piss him off by calling or emailing him again. Since my mom recommended him, I also want to be careful in regards to their business relationship. Do I just need to calm down and give the man more time? ",19May2017,1
169,"For example, someone in class last semester that talked to me sometimes jokingly pulled my paper away when I went to grab it and I became angry and went quiet and they kind of had a ""woah it's just a joke"" type of look on their face and they stopped joking with me altogether which kind of sucked. It's like they became uptight around me because I'm so uptight. Like they were scared to joke with me again. 

What makes it worse is that they joked with literally everyone around me. One person threw a piece of paper at them and they just laughed it off and threw it back so I looked like an overly sensitive dumbass who can't take a joke.

Since there are so few ppl im having to do sales (generating leads), graphic design for brochures and the website (i learned how to use Illustrator in just a couple months) and going on installations.

185,"Hey there! I've been thinking about this for a hot minute but I figure it couldn't hurt to get some outside opinion on my situation.

I'm a senior studying telecommunication and film in one of the most looked down upon universities in my state. I changed my major from advertising to film because it was a more interesting to me and the people in the program seemed a lot more genuine--both are technically specializations within the communications major at my university--but the program has been so small and on such a small budget that we've only had one professor teach literally ALL of our classes (of which, actual film classes, their have only been 2) and though he has good intentions he doesn't really have a lot of knowledge of editing or even a basic understanding of cameras. Of the people who have graduated this year (a grand total of 10 of us) I'm the only one who has done external research and tried to learn the craft but it's really burnt me out. In my entire city there are only probably 4 or 5 entry level positions in tv--pretty much all for conservative local news stations and they don't open very frequently at all (I know about a dozen people who have been out of school for more than a year and only 1 that I can think of has one of those jobs)

Does anyone know of another job someone with a telecommunication/communications job would be qualified for? What kinds of things should I be looking into? I'm not concerned with working strictly in film, I just don't really want to work at a news station. In a dream world, I'd love to do something like work for the Verge/Polygon/AV Club in either print media or their video production departments to give you an idea of what I'm interested in.",19May2017,1

I don't want to 'share' her - I'd like to think that one day I could move in with her and marry her but this gets complicated if she has another boyfriend like me. She said she was just wondering what I thought, and that she just wants to know about every possibility. But she told me when we met she didn't want another boyfriend, so I don't know why she's asking this now. Should this bother me so much?

the last 3 years of my life have been very turbulent. i lost a lot of my friends and my parents have gotten very ill in the last couple years. my own healthy has deteriorated and i am in chronic pain. as a result, i have become very angry and depressed and sort of bitter toward everything.

things are admittedly better, and i want to return to a place of happiness in my life, but i just feel so guilty about doing so. 

for example, one day my pain wasn't so bad. i had the day off from work, the sun was out and i felt good. so i allowed myself to be happy and enjoy the day. then that night i heard that my parents went to the hospital and i just immediate guilt. the next day i couldn't let myself feel joy because i knew if i did, something could go wrong.
