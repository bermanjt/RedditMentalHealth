0,"Hey reddit, I'm starting to think I really screwed up. Most of my friends are girls and I have three sisters, but I ended up breaking up with the one girlfriend I've ever had. I'm not really sure what made me do it, I just got really scared I would mess things up somehow. I started talking to her less I guess and told her I wasn't sure about what was happening with us, how I couldn't talk to her in person, look her in the eyes, ect. (over text) She said we should talk about in person because the problem was talking in person (this is high school btw). I thought she was going to break up with me then, I mean, that's usually what the whole ""we should talk"" thing means right? I ended with her over text the day we were supposed to talk about whatever. 
We have lots of mutual friends so word got around in our friends group that I blocked her on snap 'n such. I've really lost a few friends over this for ""being a bitch"" and ""pulling some real dick moves"" and I've definitely lost respect from the ones that still like us both. 
I've tried asking female friends out over text but they either laugh or call me out for it in front of other friends. I'm afraid I fucked myself over by breaking things off with the only girl that ever liked me and any other girl at our school will hear the shit I pulled. I'm beta af guys, any advice on anything?",03Dec2017,1
2,"I am a 30 y/o female. I work in an office in a cube and my boss works remotely in another state.  I am not a manager but I support a software application. There are call center team members  who sit around me and they take calls for the application I support so I work with them here and there. 

I’m on conference calls all day and sometimes what I talk about on my calls could possibly impact processes of the call center folks around me.  I realized that some of what I was saying was being heard by those around me.  About two months ago, One of the call center guys who sits behind me very playfully made a comment to me that indicated he had perhaps overheard what I had said on a conference call. I didn’t have an issue with the comment and it was innocent, but it made me realize that some of the conversations I was having could be heard. I wasn’t sure about how to handle this because Ive never really had conversations that could possibly be deemed sensitive.

Not sure how to deal with this, I went to my boss about a month later and asked for her advice because I wanted to make sure I was being professional about calls I was having put in the open. I asked if maybe I could be moved to another cube not so close to the call center people. My boss wanted to know more about what was going on, so I have some example of calls that could be heard. I also casually told her that an employee (never gave a name) around me had made a comment that indicated that he heard my phone conversation. 

My boss told her boss, and her boss said that the guy who made the comment needed to be “talked to by his manager” because his comment was inappropriate.  My boss asked me to tell the name of the employee so I did, but I told my boss it wasn’t a big deal. I feel terrible I am worried that 1) the comment was stated playfully and wasn’t a big deal 2) was so long ago that the guy probably won’t remember 3) I  feel like I look like I am trying to rat the guy out when I initially never gave a name 4) I only mentioned the comment to my boss in the first place to make it clear that people could hear stuff I’m saying. 

I’m frustrated with my boss because she seems to be the type that likes to go to other managers about their employees (I’ve seen it once before). Now though, I’m worried about what will happen after the manager talks to the guy who made the comment. What if he approaches me after his manager talks to him and tells him? What do I say? I’m seriously worried because the comment was so long ago and said in a joking way between the two of us that it wasn’t a big deal at all. I even asked my boss to drop it because it could create unnecessary  discord in the office. My boss is remote and doesn’t need to worry about the repercussions of this employee being talked to, be I do! Please help. ",03Dec2017,0
3,"Backstory:

I go to this bar pretty often to play pool, they have really nice tables, and lots of good players.  Occasionally I'll bet on games I'm playing, but not very often.  The owner of the bar, we'll call him Tom, hangs out at the bar a lot a lot and plays pool, drinks (and gets really fuckin hammered especially on weekends).  Tom also has other business' that I have been interested in.  Over the course of a few months Tom would tell me that he would get me a job that pays a starting wage of 60k, offer me work, but then ultimately it falls through, or he flakes on me.  He also always has an absurd amount of cash on him, one time he pulled out a wad of like 20k in cash just to show me he had it.... I'm just like cool.... as i am struggling to even find work.. Sometimes Tom and I play pool for money, not very much, 5 bucks... 10 bucks.. sometimes I'll agree to 20 if I feel like I'm playing pretty well, but that's my max.  


Last night:

I go to the bar, start playing on this table with this dude named Josh, he is pretty good, but I am just slaying it for some reason.  I am playing some of the best pool I've ever played, I guess the practice I've been doing lately is paying off.  I beat Josh, then Josh wants to play again, so I beat him again.  Then Tom, comes up and wants to play too.  He is absolutely trashed though.  I think he's hammered drunk, and had been doing coke too.  Apparently he made out with one of the bartender's mom earlier in the night and slipped a hundred dollar bill in between her breasts.  This really pissed off the bartender and he left..  Anyways, before our game, I say to Tom ""so how much we playing for tonight?"" and he drunkenly says ""ohhhhh i don't know how about twelve hundred bucks??"" and as he says this he slips a wad of cash into my shirt pocket... and says ""welcome backkk"" (I had been out of town for a while) i'm like haha yeah ok... we never shook on it, just started playing.  I didn't really consider it a real bet, but I did know I had some cash in my pocket of a mystery amount, that I essentially was considering a gift...  We play the game, and I won... After I won the game, he went off somewhere in the bar shmoozing with someone else.. At that point, I went into the bathroom stall, closed the door, and pulled the money out of my pocket... they were all $100 bills...... I was like holy fuckin shit.. i didn't even count them, just stuffed them into my pants pocket.. went out, played Josh one more game.  My roommate was with me and I told her, Tom put a shit ton of cash in my pocket, as soon as this game is over, let's leave.. I lost the game on purpose with Josh (he had no idea what just happened with Tom)... then I went to Tom, told him I had to leave, he said bye to me, and bye to my dog that I had with me, and then we left... as I was walking out the door I looked back and could see he looked back at me with maybe some sort of ""you're leaving?"" look... I left... 


Started walking down the street and when I turned the corner... pulled out the money and it was $800 fucking dollars all in hundred dollar bills.  I was so exhilarated, and was shaking like.. holy shit, how did i just score this... haha.. My roommate was like fuck dude give me a hundred bucks, so i was like fuck it, here... gave it to her.. then went home and tried to just come back to earth.  

I am not sure what advice I'm looking for, but I'm just curious... what would you do in this situation?  Take the money and run?  Try to give it back to him?  Just act as if it never happened when I see him again?  What if he is like bro you left with my money the other night?  Honestly I'd be surprised if he even remembers he did that, because apparently according to the bartender, he's been like this for days.. Some sort of coke bender.  Anyways, would love some outside perspective.  

TL;DR: Dude drunkenly sipped 800 bucks into my pocket and i'm not sure if he meant to give it to me or not, or if he even remembers giving it to me... ",03Dec2017,10
4,"Last weekend, I told my mom about getting physically abused by my dad growing up.  I told her about a time that he slammed me against the family van until my mouth was bleeding, and then he dragged me inside and made me pull down my pants to spank me with a wooden spoon even though I was 14, just because he thought I was lying (I wasn't).

My mom emailed me today and told me that she wanted me to tell my dad how his actions hurt me and give him a chance to ask for forgiveness so that our family can be reconciled before Christmas.  I'm not sure if I'm ready for that yet though... I'm still hurt and angry.  Do I just need to let it go?",03Dec2017,1

Highschool lovers
10 years have passed she has 2 kids (different dads) and got married early this year.
Recently out of the blue started contacting me.
Tells me she needs someone to talk to and stars breaking down (Over Snapchat).
Depressed, hates her now husband and is together for the kid she had with him.
He smokes weed on the evenings and especially during free time away from the kids rather than them spending any time together.
Constantly has his dealer brother round when kids in bed or not there.
Her telling him that she doesn't like this and how it makes her feel doesn't change anything.
She's having a breakdown and asking me for advice.

I want to tell her she has the right to be happy and do what's best for her as she's only going to be here once but I don't know if I'm being biased / there are underlining feelings. What do I do? I don't want to be a homewrecker or anything and split their family up.",03Dec2017,4

7,I'm feeling really extra shitty right now and I'm not even completely sure why. Im having a breakdown. I can't speak at the dinner table without my voice shaking. I can't grab my cup or type this without my hands shaking. I can barely hold back by tears so I won't break down crying infront of everyone. My mom and brother were talking and all I could think about was in what way I could successfully kill myself.  I went to my room because I just couldn't hold it and as soon as I stepped I started crying. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm sick of all the negativity in the world and I'm sick of the negativity in my house especially. It's hard to try and stay positive when being surrounded by negativity. Idk why I'm posting this.

9,"I work in the deli at a grocery store. I started this job a year ago when I was 18 and had a girlfriend at the time. This guy that works in the meat department (I'll call him Matt) started talking to me. During a conversation once, I told him that my mom wouldn't let me spend the night at my girlfriend's house. He said ""if you guys ever need a place to stay, you can stay at my house as long as you film it.""

Another thing he has said (completely unprompted): ""you're so shy and quiet, I bet it makes your O-face that much better for your girlfriend.""

And once he asked me ""how long can you play with your girlfriend's bean for?""

He's said many similar things to my other coworker (I'll call her Allie). Some things she has mentioned:

- what are your favorite sex positions? 

- do you have any fetishes that you wouldn't want to tell your SO?

- asked if she's ever been on some fetish website because ""someone on it looked like her"". (He asked me something very similar about if I pole danced)

- asked if she's ever been with another girl

- and I'm sure much more

Allie has told him to stop because he's being inappropriate and he says he will then continues anyway. I've been to nervous this whole time to say anything back to him. 

We are going to our manager tonight (in about 2 hours) to tell her these things. We don't feel comfortable going to HR bc the person who does HR is a guy. 

He has been in the deli recently since we are short staffed and I work with him for 7.5 hours tomorrow morning. I really don't feel comfortable around him. I want to tell my manager that if he doesn't get moved out of the deli, I would like to be. He really shouldn't be working around women (at the very least). And there are girls younger than me that work here and I would not be surprised at all if he treats them in a similar way.

Is there anything I should know or keep in mind? Anything I should or shouldn't mention? I don't want them to just sweep it under the rug, but I'm very scared they will.

11,"My brother is 19. Hes a nice kid, he just hasnt had any role models or any consistency in his life. He moved in with his dad at age 12, and his upbringing from then on was ""here's an xbox, don't bother me"" (which included 'dont ask for food', poor kid), followed by getting kicked out of the house at 18 because his dad's parental duty was apparently up. 

Since then, he hasn't done anything with his life. He hasnt been able to hold down a job, he's been on a benefit, and he is currently couchsurfing. He is a talented musician, but he lacks of the confidence to make a real gig of it. Apart from that, he has no experience and no drive. 

I live in another country, and about a year ago I extended to him the option of moving in with me and my husband when we got ourselves stable and settled IF he was willing to actually make a go of improving his life. He was extremely enthusiastic about it. However, in the time since then, he hasn't made any efforts to get a job, pay off his debts, or do anything that would help him move over and give him a boost in getting a job here. We have offered to pay for his food and board until he gets a job here, but I'm worried that he thinks that this will be a free ride to do exactly what he's doing now, except in this country. 

How can I make sure that this wont be a terrible mistake? I love my brother, but I'm worried that our (admittedly not super-close) relationship would be irreparably damaged if he takes advantage of us. ",03Dec2017,0

In this marriage he hasn't hit my step-mom, and he doesn't feel controlling at all. He does still get angry, yells, and throw things however, but it is a once a month at most thing.

Today he raised his voice rather loudly after something (my step-mom was measuring the width and length of something is all I heard) and threw a bowl across the room. 

After this he grabbed his keys and drove away, which is something that he does in the middle of almost every fight. I'm guessing it's so that he doesn't do anything too bad.

21,"Hi! It is my first post on Reddit and Im not good at English as a first language (I generally speak Spanish) so I hope that you could understand what I'm going to explain and help me. 
Well, Im currently studying in college and fell in love with someone who is almost at the same age as me (I'm 17 and she's 16) but studies in a different school ( we are actually studying in the same school, it has 2 different locations). Well, I really wanted to be with her, we have a lot of things in common (we love kpop, anime and stuff like that). I'm not going to tell detailed information cuz is a LOT so I will try to be punctual. One day I went with her in order to explain what I really felt for her but she rejected me because she thinks its not the right moment to be in a relationship and she thinks she is not prepared to take that responsibility. I understand her but I really don't know if I should keep in touch with her. I mean, maybe she doesnt like me and it would be such a waste of time spending my effort,money and time with someone whom I don't know if she can feel the same as I love her. Yesterday I went to the cinema with her and after that I told her that I wanted to accompany her walking to her home but she rejected me, took a bus (she said that she didn't want to be late at home, that's why she took the bus) and abandoned me ( I  felt so bad at that moment and I suppose that she doesn't want to be with me

28,"     Ive been having a lot of trouble and conflict with my mother in the past two to three years. I'm about to turn fourteen, in a couple months. My mother wont listen to me when I try to tell her I don't want to be Christian. When I even bring up something close to that she shuts me down and says she doesn't want to hear it. When I tell her I don't want to go to church she sometimes goes as far as threatening to hit me with a belt. I fell like I can't talk to her about anything. I'm aware of everything i say around her to make sure I don't say anything she doesn't approve of. When I'm sad or down I can't tell her or show her because most of the time its because of her that I'm sad and I'm afraid of how she'll react. When I try to tell her that she's forcing me to go to church, and not listening to what I want, she doesn't understand. I try to make her understand but she just can't. She can't even consider the fact that I don't like church, or praying and that I don't care wether there is a God or not. It's like she thinks I'll turn into a satan worshiper or something and be condemned to hell (which I find completely stupid). 
       
      And thats not even the most of it. I have to hide most of the things I like/support cause she doesn't. For example, I love anime. One time she saw me watching anime. Then she immediately told me to turn that off and not watch that, cause its ugly and evil. I was dumbfounded. Is she serious? I was watching Ouran High School Host Club, which is one of the most innocent anime shows I know. Ever since then I don't watch anime or anything else she doesn't approve of when she's in the room. I can't even wear the clothes I want to, go to the places I want to go, and buy the things I want to buy. My friends don't even bother inviting me to some places because they know I wont be able to go. I had to lie and say I had a club meeting after school or something in order to go. I don't do that often. I don't enjoy lying but I feel like I have no choice. 
     
      I also struggle with my weight. I know I'm overweight, and I need to eat healthier, but whenever I'm emotional my solution is to eat. Its kind of like a coping mechanism. My mother also is always nagging me about what I'm eating and how I'll become  ""fat and ugly""(her words not mine) and with multiple health problems if I don't start eating right. I know she does that cause she cares, and I know she's right about the health part, but she acts like me becoming skinny, or slimmer will make me pretty, kind of like i'm not pretty now. I don't think she means it to be that hurtful, and I can usually just ignore that part, but it still annoys me.
      
      Another thing is that she (unfortunately) thinks homosexuality is a sin. She doesn't talk about it often. But when she does its always offensive. I hate it. When I was little she didn't talk about it at all. I didn't even know it was a thing until I heard about in school and I researched about all types of sexualities and identities online. I didn't think it was a big deal. So what? We're all human. Now I'm curious about my sexuality, cause I never knew there was more options then just one gender. I can't talk to her about this. I can barely talk to her about anything. I'm mostly silent when I'm at home. Only talking to her if I have a question I feel safe to ask her, or if she talks to me first. She wonders why I've become distant but I don't know what to tell her, so I just say it's natural for teens to detach or become distant with their parents as they get older. 
      
       I'm sorry if this seems all over the place. There's just so much. And its not solely my mother, I have trouble with other family members too. But it's mostly with her. I'm an only child and born out of wedlock, I've never met my father, never even seen a picture of him. I don't mind much. But that means I only have my mother to talk about with these issues. But the issue is mainly concerning her. I just feel so confused and conflicted. She's still my mother and I love her, but sometimes I just hate her. I want to get a therapist to help, but that means telling her WHY I want a therapist. Thats the whole reason why I'm writing here instead. If anyone can give me any advice please do. Anything helps. I just don't have anyone to go to with this. Again, sorry if it might be confusing. I wrote this on a whim. Thank you.",03Dec2017,0

I'm 17 years of age, I would like to go to college for astronomy, but I have low self-esteem so I'm to dumb for it because I have trouble understanding physics &amp; calculus in high school (junior). I know I'm supposed to figure this all out on my own, but no one encourages me, not even my parents. I used to want to go to an art college, but they told me I should be something else; but the irony to it is when I realised I'm most likely going to go nowhere with art, I went to my second choice for college --astronomy because space is what makes me want to invest my future in--
 they've been telling me that I could be looking at an art college. &amp; they want me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but that's not what I love; astronomy is.

I know the future is going to be tough, but they put me off as if I'm not going to make it. I told them today I got a college letter about an art college (Pratt University), which I don't remember signing up for. They said to keep it because I might want to go there, &amp; I told them I would like to go to a college for astronomy. My step-father challenged that by asking where am I going to find one &amp; I told him I'm going to have to look, obviously. &amp; I told them, my aunt &amp; step-father who have custody of me as my parents, that I'm too stupid to understand physics &amp; calculus so I might not make it &amp; they said it's my fault for believing that. Yes, it is my fault because I know I'm stupid, but they don't make me feel smart. I'm not smart because the only things I talk about are space, which they don't care about, &amp; poltics, which again they don't care about because I'm an Independent liberal &amp; they're Rebulican conservatives.

I do my best to understand what I want for my future by reading books for astronomy, physics, &amp; calculus &amp; watching documentaries (How the Universe Works, etc), but I think it's not enough. I haven't done anything to prove what I want. I haven't even gotten my bloody driving tests because I'm so worked up with school, taking 5 AP/Honors classes, so i'm dumb for that. But it's my fault for all of this.

I've also been thinking of where I would be in a few years, which is nowhere, because my petty self wants to kill herself sometimes because she doesn't want to face anything.

I struggle to trust my S/O, my friends, my colleagues. Even when it comes to the most simple of things, I'm prone to creating awful scenarios in my mind where I've been been lied to or purposefully misguided. 

I even struggle not to question the validity of things like the news, articles online, things said on social media. I realise there is a healthy amount of scepticism one should have but surely not to the extent where you can't enjoy these things because of it. It's as if none of it even matters cos so much of it BS.

I realise there is probably an element of paranoia here, which I imagine comes from my poor state of mental health these two years.

I applied and worked other places since, but I just didn't have any passion working hard for someone else knowing that it can all just be taken away from me, and I eventually quit.

That's what happened at the Job I got fired from - after putting in 2 years of hard work, my boss let me go because he valued his ego more than the work I did for him.  It's gotten to the point that I want to start my own business, do it my own way, and compete with my old place.  Which is great, but a lot of times I lose the motivation or focus to follow through on that because I get really depressed.

I thought maybe it would be a good Idea to focus on myself first and get my head clear before persuing anything new.  I gave up drinking and smoking, I gave up eating junk food, and I tried my best to take up meditation to help improve my focus and clarity.

No matter what I do though, I can't clear all this turbulence in my mind.  I really believe that most days the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my dog - whom is a sweetheart and I love so much.  When people tell me to be grateful for what I have, she is the first thing I think of.  I don't live near any of my friends I grew up with, and most of my friends from my Job have vanished from my life since being fired.


I wake up in the morning and the first thing I think of is how much I hate my old boss.  I got fired for no other reason than his ego and fear of me taking on his role - he felt threatened by me.  Sometimes I vividly imagine murdering him.  After an hour or two of laying in bed with those thoughts, the depression and self-doubt start to kick in, then I get up and take the dog for a walk.  The length of the walk varies depending on my mood - but I always feel a little better afterwards.  I sit at my laptop with every intention to research starting and writing up a business plan, or even possibly finding another similar job in a different state with different people and scenery.  


My mind is so clouded though, I never get far.  I end listening to music and browsing around the internet.  My life has been in this stagnant pattern since July.  Deep down I know that If I can just figure out a way to relax and not be so emotional, I would be able to focus and attack my goals.  I tried telling some of my story on /r/depression, but no one there really had any advice.  It was more of a place for sad people to vent.



**Does anyone here have any suggestions for me?  Has anyone ever been in the spot that I am in right now, before?**  Like I said, I don't really have any friends I can go to out here, and I really can't go out and socialize because I'm not working and money is tight.  **The internet is pretty much my primary resort for help.**",03Dec2017,1
34,"Ok let me explain the situation. 

I’m moving from Texas to Florida soon. I have a couple interviews lined up, but no offers yet until after said interviews. 

Any apartment complex has been asking me for offer letters which I simply don’t have. I have the money to pay rent, but that’s not cutting it for an apartment. 

I want to stay at a friends (I have someone in mind), for hopefully no more than a month just to get a few pay stubs under my belt then move into an apartment.

36,"My friend got pretty drunk last night and started telling me about all of his baggage, depression, regrets. Initially I was like “oh calm down your drunk go play your ps4” but it’s persisting and I think it’s more than just pure drunkenness (I know it sounds insensitive but he is the least emotional/sappy person I know).

37,"So it’s Saturday night. I’m bored, lonely (single), wanting to socialize, and realizing that the “friends I have” are becoming the “friends I had” - and by that I mean socializing with them has gone from once every 2-3 weeks to once every 2-3 months or worse - and it’s becoming further worse as time passes.

I usually meet new people through my social circle (which is/was not too big to begin with) but now everyone is essentially living their own lives now (getting married, having their own schedules, leaving town, etc.) which I know I can’t really complain about, it’s their lives after all, but I’m not sure what to do from here for my social needs as my social circle feels like it has fallen apart.

What’s worse is that I’m very picky when it comes to people I like. I don’t find it difficult to talk to people but I do find it difficult to continue when... I don’t know, they don’t meet my criteria  I guess?

I’ve tried dating apps with unsatisfying results and I downloaded Meetup but am not really picking up on it. I guess another option is to go to a bar solo which I don’t really do (unless I start now I guess?). Overall I just feel kind of lost. Any suggestions?",03Dec2017,1
39,"I don't know, really just what the title says.

I'm absolutely hopeless.  My grades are tanking to unfixable all-time lows, to the point where I'm probably just going to have to drop out.  Not that it matters anyway, because I'm completely hopeless when it comes to being an adult - my work ethic is abysmal.  It's become painfully obvious to me that I will never find a girlfriend - which in truth is probably the only thing in the world I really desperately want or feel would improve my life or give it meaning.  I just really don't see any point to life anyways.  All the childhood dreams I had are hopelessly unattainable, and I can't bear the idea of just becoming another gear in corporate society's machine.  Anything else I want to do just seems really useless.

Really, the only reason why I haven't yet is because I can't bear the thought of my family reacting to it.  Actually, it's a pretty strong deterrent - I don't think I'll actually be able to go through with it simply because of them.  But it still doesn't change the desire I have to though, or the fact that I know how I would, just not where yet.

I'm unwilling to talk to anyone about this.  The last time I tried to, that ""friend"" used and manipulated me and my emotions to the point where I did try it.  My emotions are my own, I should be able to fucking deal with them, anyways.  And the one friend I probably could tell, she'd probably think I'm a freak or something and tell everyone.  I'm unemployed, so I wouldn't even be able to afford a counselor or therapist or whatever.  Not that I'd even bother if I could.  Video games have helped to kind of distract me from myself, but they get boring after a while.

45,"Ok so: I do actually know how to do this. But my method is usually to tell people very directly, because I’m normally so nervous I can’t manage much else. I’d not really have a problem with this it it wasn’t for the fact that I’m probably going to have to tell someone how I feel about them soon, and I want it to be fulfilling and easy for both of us irregardless of the outcome. 

I figured having a conversation would be a much better way of going about it, but I can’t even imagine how that would manifest, so I’d appreciate some kind of example.

Just for some background, were both 19, live in the same halls flat (not recommended to date your flat mate I know but I’m probably not going to expect things to happen too quickly anyway), studying the same course at university. I’m unsure how he feels. Could really be either way. He’s not a horrible person though so if it turned out he didn’t feel the same he wouldn’t be uncomfortable about it.

I feel like I should go see a therapist to discuss my feelings but I'm embarrassed. I dream about hooking up with him, which makes no sense - there are a lot of more attractive guy friends I have who would sleep with in a heartbeat. But I just want him and he would never!

Unfortunately, I don’t get to see her now that cross country has ended since she’s preoccupied during lunch every day with clubs. Aside from her I have no one who I really get along with, though I’ve really been trying. I hang out with many different groups and I try to integrate myself but I feel like I don’t really fit in with anyone there. I’m not really a joker, I don’t have the slightest idea of how I made my good friends in the first place, and I feel like my conversational skills are lacking considerably, though I can keep a conversation going for hours if I feel comfortable talking to the person. Generally I don’t feel comfortable, so this is quite unfortunate and I’ve been working to get over it. 
Honestly, I can’t stand not having good friendships with people. I’m shy and introverted but despite that I can’t deal with loneliness, and now that my old friends are growing out of touch I’m beginning to feel miserable.

51,"I am a 20 yrs old useless human being.

I was born with a weak body and was often ill going from one hospital to an other even when i was young. I have a few chronic diseases and because of that i took med steroids that made me fat, i eventually lost a lot of weight in high school and became pretty fit in my last year. I slept trough most classes because i often couldn't sleep at night. This affected my high school diploma exam too and my results were mostly 4 (or B in other systems). After this i got into uni (free, godlbess eu) but in the classes where like 400 other students were i had a panic attack and became really introverted unable to continue my education.

Now I can barely leave my flat, and my parents are paying for it because they are worried about me being suicidal. (I tried to kill myself with meds once.) Whenever i meet random people on the street i feel like they are disgusted by me. I feel disgusted by myself too and i feel like vomiting when i see myself in the mirror. I got meds that were supposed to make me calm (Rexetin, Frontin) from the psychiatrist i used to go to, but i couldn't go to one of my appointments (I couldn't leave the flat) and because of this money loss she told me to never come again.

I can't work, I can't study, without surgery i wouldn't be able to have kids etc... Why should i still live? I don't want to live off of my parents.

52,"To explain myself better, what he told me first was that he wasn't happy with himself since a long time ago (let's say years). He told me that he forced himself to love me but eventually he couldn't fall in love with me the same way I was with him. Of course I was devastated because after 9 months of being in a relationship he just gave up on me. He told me it was since the beginning that he wasn't sure to date me or not but eventually he did because he felt lonely and wanted to give it a try on what was that feeling of being loved. We spent amazing moments together and I thought that he was happy with me and I could feel that at least he liked me a bit. It was until now that he decided to open up and break up. When he told me that I felt that my world collapsed. He also said that he wanted some space so I gave it to him because it was important. After a time I decided to ask him how things were doing and he told me that he was doing fine, but his opinion of being separated is still in his mind. He even told me that we didn't match after all and he only sees me as a friend. I asked him why things didn't work out and he just told me that some things are meant to be like that, seperated. I begged for another chance, in case that it was all my fault, that I could try better but he just keeps telling me that he doesn't want anything from me, not another chance and that in a future he doesn't see me as his girlfriend again. 

Right now I'm devastated, really devastated. He was my everything and now he's gone because on how he is doing within himself. I really want to help him but my friends keep telling me that is not a great idea because in the end he is the one that has to work out things for himself. He doesn't know what he wants in his life, he has been unhappy for a long time and sometimes he can be very insecure of himself. 

I really don't know what to do, i've gone to my therapist and she told me to give him time, that is how things work out in the end, supposedly. I really dont want to lose him but sometimes I thinks that he wants to become a stranger to me. I'm really sad, sometimes I event think of suicide because my heart is literal broken (I also have serious issues within myself but being around him made me feel so protected and safe). I've fallen in love for this guy about two years ago, I literally fought for him and when I happily have him, he is gone. 

The last thing he told me was that he was going to Italy for a year, alone so he is technically taking a break from everything, including his family because he is going alone. I supported him on that decision because I think that is going to help him to decide the things that he wants in his life, but I can't stand that he is gone and it could be our final goodbye.

All he really does is game when he gets home from work and his excuse is he's tired and needs ""me"" time. I used to catch him on dating apps all the time and have caught him talking to other girls.

60,"I’ve tossed and turned all night, every night since I was little. The only thing that’s ever helped me sleep peacefully through most or all of the night is certain strains of cannabis. 

I gave up smoking and all other recreational drugs over a month ago now.
Partly to save money. But now that the THC is out of my system I’m having a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep at night again. It’s really starting to affect my energy levels and overall mood throughout the day.

I’ve been taking otc sleeping aids and melatonin. Which suck to say the least, but they work fairly well at helping me fall asleep as long as I don’t use them too frequently. They don’t help me stay asleep though.

Is there any advice one could give me? How do I fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer? I don’t/can’t use prescription meds. I just want natural ways to do this.   

I just don’t want to have to start smoking weed again. I’ve really enjoyed this tolerance break and the mental clarity it’s been giving me, not to mention the break it’s been giving my wallet.

I’m worried that if I don’t figure out something soon that I’ll start to suffer the way I used to from the long term effects of sleep deprivation :(

62,"So, i've never had a gf and always been very introverted. 24 yo male, never had sex before, only almost. I started to challenge myself and got on tinder and actually started to talk to girls there. Been talking to a few girls on there constantly, but it's a small town so people know eachother here. I talked to two girls at the same time, and i invited one of them over to watch a movie. We did, she came over, we watched a movie, but that's pretty much it. I didn't get any signs or interests from her. We snapped a few times after, but lately she doesn't respond much. I've kept talking to this other girl, she works at a bar. We talked when i was out and she was working, but tonight she was out drinking and so was I. We met up, had a drink, she said she was really drunk, and i guess i was kinda drunk too. We made out, and she said if we should get out of here, and i agreed. Took a cab to my place and we had sex. I didn't last long lol, but to my surprise, even though i announced that i was gonna orgasm, she asked me a while later while we were cuddling if we ""had sex?"". She didn't really seem that drunk, she talked and walked completely normal, but didn't seem to remember that we fucked lol, and that was kinda off-putting.

Well, a while later while we had some more awkward sex and cuddling, she said she should probably sleep at home, and she said a friend was gonna pick her up. While she got dressed, i saw on her phone that a friend was texting her like ""who's the guy ur with? tell me!"" and such, and to my surprise this was the SAME girl that i had over to watch a movie and texted with at the same time earlier.

So two things:

- How is this gonna end up? The girl i slept with is obviously gonna tell her friend about what happened and who i am, and her friend will definitely tell about me meeting her. and texting, watching a movie etc. Maybe they realise we texted at the same time? Is this gonna complicate things a lot? I do like this girl, and i fear she will be scared off when she finds out this.

- Why do i feel so guilty after this? She is 19 years old and considerably younger than me. I expected to be thrilled about having sex, but i keep constantly being nervous about things. I asked if she was on the pill and she said yes, but she was also really drunk. It worries me that she told me she was so drunk she barely remember we had sex. It was like she didn't recognize i came inside her, although she did go to the bathroom so i assume she did.

68,"Hey all, I am (so far) self diagnosing myself with general anxiety. My mind is racing all day, and every day with situations that have either happened, or will never happen. I always dread being away from home and getting a call that something happened to my family. Lately, I spend a lot of time thinking about my parents having heart attacks. I get stressed about driving/my family driving &amp; thinking about what I’d do in case of a deadly accident - which causes me to panic. I replay things from my past that I can’t seem to forget - so years later, I’m still beating myself up over them. I am only 22 and have high blood pressure - either hereditary, or from constantly worrying. I often can’t focus on one thing, without constantly being interrupted with my thoughts. It gets to the point where sometimes I have to lock myself in the bathroom, cry about it, and pull myself back together. All of this is causing me to lose sleep, and to be very irritable &amp; impatient.

Tonight at dinner, my boyfriend and I got into a little argument because we went to one place for dinner, he didn’t want to wait 15 minutes for a table, so I got back in my car to drive, to go to a new location. When we were talking at the second restaurant, he said something along the lines of, “I don’t get why you’re so hostile all of the time. You flip like an on and off switch. You’re either really happy one second then sad and moody the next.” This isn’t the first time he’s said something like this, I usually hear it daily-if not every other day. 

I was telling him about how I feel, the thoughts I have, how my mind is constantly racing, all of that I said above. I told him “the only time I can completely turn my mind off is when I’m working out at the gym” Which is 100% true. After I explained all of this, he said, “Your life isn’t that hard, suck it up.” (On top of that, I work &amp; go to school full time)

I stopped talking after that. Where do I go from here? Do I bring this back up to him, do I let it go? How do I let him know this is a serious thing that I don’t know how to control?

TL;DR Long term boyfriend says he doesn’t believe me when I say I have anxiety because my “life isn’t that hard.” How do I tell him it’s not fake? ",03Dec2017,2

I have been living a solitary life for the past eight years. When I was 18, I withdrew from my friends and family and began to live on my own. This was the byproduct of an arrested emotional development that seems to have stopped at either 15 or 16. It was not a result of any specific trauma, but anxiety coupled with an inability to trust people.

As it stands, I have no friends, no family ties, no siblings, no relationships, no education, no long term goals. I also have no property, not much money, and not much job security either.

While that sounds quite bleak written out, 99 percent of the time I am fine. Not happy, not sad, but fine. In the beginning it was tough, but I've learned to live with it. I have found work, and have good working relationships with my coworkers. I don't have many hobbies, but living in a fairly large city allows me to enjoy movies and concerts from time to time.

But one percent of the time, and tonight happens to be one of those times, I am filled with a profound loneliness. I crave the belonging, the familiarity, the desire for love and romance. Having emotional attachments to others.

Very soon, I will have the opportunity to leave this city and find a home for the long term in a smaller area. Given the precarious nature of being in the lower class, it is not an opportunity I am treating lightly. I am pretty sure I want to do it. But I am also confident it will end any possibility of social competence in the future. It will be stable, long term hermitism.

My thought for the past few years has been that I am too far out of the loop to ever come back. I have not had any of the life experiences a normal person has had between 15 and 26. And yet I have not shared the regular failures either. I've never been an alcoholic or a drug user. I was not involved with fundamentalist religion. I haven't played video games regularly in many, many years. I have spent the past eight years doing, functionally, nothing.

My temporary desire for commisseration, for understanding, is undercut by the fact that no one else seems to have put themselves through this. I have seen the people at the movies and concerts I go to, and it doesn't even feel like we are the same species. They have their own aesthetic language that is contrived. It's an act. Not only do I not have the ability to approach them, I am pretty sure they have nothing to say.

This is an advice page, so I'll simply ask this: have you, or has anyone you have known, been this detached from society, and reintegrated themselves into it? More importantly, was that a good decision on your/their part? How did you/they do it?",03Dec2017,7
86,"So both my parents are religious and my dad is passionate and recites hymns everyday. He isn't pushy, he often asks me to do it but understands when I say I don't want to. I'm also a theist but I don't like reciting anything which I don't understand and thats written in another language. I'm also a philosophy major so to me truth is a very delicate subject and also interpretation. He's supportive of my philosophic pursuits but recently I thought it'd make him happy to tell him that I picked up one of the old religious books and started reading it but naturally because its part of his heritage he acts like he is an expert on the subject and the way he speaks about it really bothers me. Whenever he tried teaching me about it i deliberately cut him off  because I felt like I needed to be the one to interpret it and the way that he interprets it as a phil major is reallyy bothersome. I don't know how to tell him because I know he was super enthusiastic to want to pass it down but at the same time this loose interpretation is really bothersome and I don't want to act like I'm more of an authority when he grew up with these texts. I really don't know what to do?",03Dec2017,2
87,"So, I'll start from the beginning. Its August 14th 2016 and I meet this girl (we'll call her Ela), and I immediately start liking her. She was in 4 of my classes, so we were bound to talk. I started to try and get her attention. I searched up her name, and found her YouTube channel, and I looked at the videos she liked (im not a stalker I promise). I start singing songs around her that I know personally and that gets her attention. We start dating September 13th, 2016. Both of our parents' like our relationship and we visited each other every weekend. I'm 13 at the time and she was my first girlfriend, which is no excuse for my actions, but I did verbally abuse her to some extent sometimes. She would do something stupid, break a promise, lie, etc. and I would go way overboard. On November 11th, 2016 she tried to walk to my house at 3 AM, and got caught by police. That was the first strike for Ela's mom against me. The 2nd one was where I stole my friend's phone as a prank and Ela ratted me out, making me mad. And the 3rd strike was when me and Ela got suspended from being in a closet at school together. 3 strikes and you're out, but she actually let me have another strike. I took Ela to our formal dance, and we had a blast. The day after, May 19th 2017, I make Ela cry, and her mom reads our messages. Ela was gone all day, then said brb randomly after I waited to talk to her all day, and it made me way more mad than I should've been. Her mom calls me a verbal abuser, a terrible boyfriend, etc. After that happened, I really took a look at myself and changed for the better. Me and Ela never argue, we never really fight, and I never yell at her. Her mom still says we can't talk (which we still do), we cant date (which we still do). I have personally asked for forgiveness, and she accepted it, but said she wants me out of her life. Ela has talked to her, and still says no. We are both now 14, and have been dating in secret for quite a long time now. I dont know what to do, and I would really like some advice. Thanks",03Dec2017,2
88,"I have had dinner with this girl from Spanish class 4 times within the last week, and we have very good chemistry. We have the same sense of humor and like all the same things, and feel the same way about certain subjects. 

I definitely would've escalated things by now if it weren't for the fact she has a boyfriend back home. It is obvious that in her eyes we are just friends, which I understand. However, I am most definitely beginning to have feelings for her. Winter break begins soon, and I am considering telling her how I feel the last time I see her before break, whenever that is. I am not trying to end her relationship, but I want her to get the idea of seeing me as more than a friend in her head, and she can think about it over break. 

Bad idea or good idea? I know I should be honest with these things to stay emotionally healthy, but I also don't want to end our burgeoning friendship. Give me advice. ",03Dec2017,3

I have friends at school but I never hang out with anyone and I want to change it.

92,"This got long. TL;DR at the bottom.

So, as a note to start off, I do suffer from depression and anxiety, and I am curious whether that has a link to this fear. But I'll frame the rest of the post as a ""regular person"".

I have always had a problem with scary imagery. The earliest problem I remember having was when I was around 8 or 9 years old and my friend and I stumbled upon the Scary Maze, which was an old flash game which consisted of 3 levels of a silent maze, and when you finished the last level, a scary face would pop up and a loud scream effect was played. I remember that when this happened I couldn't fall asleep on my own for days, and years afterwards I would still have episodes where I needed someone beside me.

Nowadays I can handle a little bit more. I can watch thriller movies, and horror movies that aren't especially terrifying (it seems like extreme suspense and jump scares are the hardest thing for me to take). I've been able to get through The Shining, and I read House of Leaves with almost no problem. 

I actually really enjoy these types of stories. Narratively, I think horror is a wonderful genre and I want to be able to enjoy it. But the problems I'm having particularly today make me question whether or not I'm capable of handling it. 

Today I played Doki Doki Literature Club for the first time. Warning for those who haven't played it, I'm going to spoil most of the plot. I knew that it subverted the dating sim trope, and I knew that people classified it as a horror game, but I thought it would turn out to be really jokey and more so a parody of the genre rather than what it actually is.

When I got to the scene where Sayori commits suicide, I definitely felt a little scared, but it was nothing I couldn't handle. But when it went into the ""glitch"" aesthetic, I got a LOT more scared of it. For some reason that's a huge trigger for me. I got through the scene okay, though slightly shaken and really intrigued to what comes next in the story. 

I got over the art on the main page, which had Sayori glitched out and looking more and more like Monika. That was actually really interesting to me and I really wanted to find out what the next part of the story was. Sayori's death triggers an ""end"" to the game and you are supposed to ""start over"". When the game starts, any part that was supposed to contain Sayori causes visual glitches like distorted character models, incorrect fonts, and broken UI elements. This terrified me beyond belief, and when it happened for the second time, I had to close the game.

I was still really interested in the story, though, and decided to read around on the internet more about what happens. After learning exactly what the game turns out like, and after accidentally seeing more of the scary glitch imagery (The picture of Yuri with human eyes is unbelievably terrifying for me) I can't get it out of my head.

It's like it's taken over my thoughts. I don't know how I'm going to fall asleep tonight. Every time I turn my head I feel like one of the characters are going to be there, staring at me. Screens are especially bad because it was centered around an AI who deleted other people to get close to you, I feel like one of them are going to be there whenever I look at my phone, or when I change desktops on my computer.

I don't know how to deal with this. The same thing happened to me after just seeing just the trailers for It (though to a lesser degree). I really want to be able to enjoy this medium, but when I go through scary things, ESPECIALLY when they're unexpected like what happened with DDLC, they absolutely haunt me. Can this be overcome somehow? Is it linked to my anxiety?

TLDR: I have anxiety, I want to enjoy horror movies and games but can't because they absolutely haunt me afterwards. I can't turn my head without feeling pretty extreme anxiety for what I'm going to see behind me. I feel like I have to constantly distract myself and sleeping becomes incredibly difficult without extreme bouts of bravery.",03Dec2017,2

96,"So, Above all I want to make sure I’m not being a creep and reading into things and all that Jazz, because girls get enough of that crap.

Anyways, story.

A few weeks ago a girl walks into my store and buys a couple things for her friends birthday. If I recall it was duck related and that her best friends boyfriend was either a duck researcher, or just knew everything about ducks. I thought it was pretty crazy. She asked what my favorite animal was, and I said it was a squirrel, to which she teasingly remarked as being a poor choice. We chatted for a second more and then she left the store. For some reason I felt this incredible attraction and I was like “dang, guess she was just a random customer”.

Flash forward a couple weeks I am going to restock shirts and I see someone kind of looking at me and walking towards me and I made eye contact and I was really confused, and she was like “so have you reconsidered your stance on squirrels?” And i immediately remembered and we talked for like 5 minutes after her transaction and she told me she worked at a store right near mine and I was like “nice”. Anyways, she left and my other employee came in and I was like “oh my crap I am smitten, what do I do?”. Anyways we devised a plan.

I wrote on a piece of paper Derp (Squirrel Boy) OfDeath, and my number. I was going to go into her store, tell her she left this in my store and that I’m on break so I gotta run.  But I didn’t see her in the store. 

Now here is the thing. I feel like this is a cute move bordering on creepy. What are your thoughts?",03Dec2017,3
98,"Hi! I'm super nervous for my presentation tomorrow morning and was hoping I could get some advice on whether or not this is a good way to start it. It's for my English class, it's a 5 minute presentation on the correlation between mental health and meditation (I chose the topic). I'm not quite sure how to transition it from there, but does that seem like a good way to show my connection to the topic? Is that downward dog joke too corny? 

I’ve spent the past five years of my life successfully avoiding public speaking. I’ve allowed fear and doubt to consume my thoughts and actions for most of my life without being aware of how much control I was really giving it. Then, I took a yoga class. Doing the downward dog didn’t cure me of anxiety, but the meditation that followed had a lasting effect on how I viewed my mind. ",03Dec2017,2
99,"Here's my problem.

When I am speaking to someone especially a close friend in a casual conversation, I tend to have little trouble verbally expressing my thoughts. Sometimes I stumble when I can't find the right word to say but most of the time I have no issues.

However when I am under pressure, especially during a presentation, my mind goes blank and I often have extreme difficulty thinking of the right word at a given moment or the right way to explain something. It seems to me that I am always trying to think of how to phrase something while simultaneously trying to express those thoughts and this hinders my ability to present coherently and with clarity. For example, a few days ago I gave a small presentation but I had to keep repeating myself until I phrased my thoughts correctly. Someone in the audience asked me a question and I had a lot of trouble explaining a technical nuance to them. When I see other people presenting, they don't seem to have this issue at all. I'm not sure whether they are just improvising as they present or they just practiced extensively.

I have another presentation in a few days' time and as I am rehearsing and going through my slides while sitting at my desk, I just can't seem to think of the right way to convey an idea, as in I have to pause and think hard on how to describe something and I often get myself tongue tied. I know the concepts behind the topic that I am presenting but even still I have this trouble.

I used to be extremely afraid of public speaking but that has diminished somewhat. The main issue is always having to constantly think of how to convey an idea when under pressure.

Is this issue simply due to a lack of preparation or a result of being nervous? Will practicing more eliminate this problem? Or could this be indicative of a deeper psychological issue? Does anyone else have this trouble, and what is the best way to overcome it?",03Dec2017,2

103,"Like the title says, I'm 18 at a college and started talking to a friend of a friend (junior in a different highschool-16). We've talked since early in the summer and became extremely close. We are best friends, if not more. We have finally hung out a few times and we keep getting closer to each other and I don't know what to do. 

We're practically dating for the last few weeks, but haven't made anything official for many reasons:

First we're both super busy with school and would have little time to see each other, if ever. 

Also we're both broke students so I'm scared we can't have nice dates or get each other anything nice.

And lastly she's 16 and I'm 18. Not that anything sexual would ever happen (I'm not about that, she isn't like that either) (not even the fact that it's illegal, I know) but I'm scared college friends will judge, and her friend's will not trust this 18 year old she's seeing.

106,"I love my girlfriend Rachel to death and she really is the best thing to ever happen to me. We've been in a relationship for almost 2 years now, in June she moved to Arizona and she only lives 3 hours away from where I live. I'm mostly happy in the relationship and everything is almost great. I love her, neither of us plan to break up, but we've had one problem over the past week. It seems IMPOSSIBLE to have a conversation with her. Now before you just assume she likes some other guy, or losing interest, let me put out there that first of all, she's never really been the talkative type. Secondly, she would never cheat on me, ever, she's very mature, very clean and very trustworthy. But lately things have just been horrible. The past 3 days in specific. The other night before we went to bed, she sent me an audio message and she was crying. She just asked why we can't talk anymore and what happened to us, because we used to be so much better at talking. I ended up sending her an audio message later that night, telling her that I loved her and I'd never leave her and I'm sorry that this is all happening. Last night, however, after a very busy day, we called from 10:30 PM until 1-2 AM, like we normally do on weekends. That was good. We tried calling a few hours ago and it just sucked. Conversation was really slow, we asked the typical questions, ""How was your day?"" ""What did you do?"" but really, neither of us were feeling it. I said ""Let's just text."" I was in a bad mood and this situation wasn't helping. Right then, we both texted the same person. Our friend Rose. She's a very close friend of both of us and always helps us with each other. Rose told me that Rachel was really upset and afraid she was going to lose me. I'm just so stumped how to talk to Rachel and keep the spark alive. Any advice?

107,"So my sister's new friend has been coming over and she's pretty attractive, she usually smiles or low-key flirts with me but she decided to stay the night yesterday. So as usual she was talking with me till she went to bathe then came out looking even sexier considering she was wearing less. She also seemed to make sure I saw that as she told me goodnight.

So I stayed in my room door open and played the game for around an hour, parents already closed their door and went to sleep. And then I heard a door open, my sister's friend came in asking me where the bathroom was, which was ironic considering all the rooms are on the second floor and the bathroom is in the other side of my sister's room. Not only that but she knew damn well where it was.

I took it as a joke and playfully told her where it was and I see the light shine on from down the hall. For a while, it stayed on, so I peeked out my door and the bathroom door was wide open, everyone else's was closed. So I curiously checked and walked in on the girl masturbating... like literally sitting on the toilet fingering, she acted surprised when I saw her but I sort of teased her saying if she's that horny she might need to let me take care of her.

She liked that and agreed I should and opened her legs again in which I ate her out. (No comments about her probably just peeing, I need to make women whipped when I get them.) So that went on for a bit then we went back to my room and she gave me a blowjob. After that we had great great sex and fell asleep in my bed. When I woke up her panties where under the covers and she was gone. The next time I saw her was during breakfast with my sister and she snuggled up next to me, practically teasing me. Not in a sexual way at all either as if she played it off as we were friends and she was just playing with me.

It got to the point though where my sister gave me an annoyed look. But besides the closeness there was no direct indication to anyone else that we had sex. But since I like annoying/bothering my sister, I kind of teased the fact that I might go after her friend and if that was okay. My sister says, ""Leave that girl alone, she already has a STD."" I'm sure my reaction gave it away that I may have had sex with her but I'm worried as hell now.

I have no car and really I have never dealt with the possibility of ever having any sexual diseases who do I talk to about this? Is there possibly a way I can deal with this without my family knowing? All I want is advice on this shit, because I'm freaking the fuck out... Thanks in advance.",03Dec2017,2

110,"I’ve been attracted to one girl for the last 4 years but I’ve come to a bit of an issue. I was at one point really good friends with her. We had math together and would talk often. We both had the same sense of humor, similar interests, good chemistry, and just overall complimented each other rather well. I’d have days where we’d text for hours upon hours into the early portions of the morning joking about class and regular issues during the school year. But roughly two years ago I got into an argument with one of her friends, and as a result her friend told her to block me on social media and my number. I asked her to unblock me but she was worried that her friend would resent her for it.  And after that I couldn’t really talk to her outside of school. But during school we’d talk as we always did as though nothing had ever happened. But then I moved on to my freshman year and she was going into eighth grade. And after that we hadn’t ever spoken since we were in different schools. I only saw her maybe 5 times my freshman year and it was one of the tougher years in recent memory. My grades were worse, my social status dropped from having a good deal of friends to being a more socially awkward kid that had trouble reaching out to people. I became isolated.  I considered ending it all multiple times in fear of never having the same relationship with her again, but it was always the thought of possibly getting back to where we were at one point that would take the extension chord off of my neck. My mom found the extension chord that I had previously tried to use and asked me what it was about and I couldn’t bring myself to tell her what was up so she had me start seeing a therapist. I had some success getting some of the weight off my chest with said therapist but my issue was still there nonetheless. And after a while I stopped seeing said therapist. I’m now a sophomore and she’s a freshman at my school. Unfortunately for me we don’t have any classes together. But every time I see her in the hall she doesn’t even look at me. Except one time when we locked eyes for a second then then she turned around and walked the other way intentionally altering her path of travel presumably to avoid me. I don’t know where I went wrong because when I argued with her friend she didn’t hate me for it (that’s the only thing I can think of that she might hate me for), and I haven’t said anything to her ever since I started freshman year.  But I get the feeling that she resents me strongly now. I try and tell myself to move on but I can’t bring myself to do so. I need to know if I should just try harder to move on or maybe try and talk to her. I know I might sound like just some other 16 year old kid that’s acting all angsty or something but it’s been a real issue that’s plagued me for a while and I really need any input I can get more than ever.

Time is our only enemy, nothing can withstand the test of time. From our knowledge even the universe might not... Our planet is fractured, our species is fractured. Everything is being impacted by our species choices. Other species are being completely wiped out by our hand, and for what reason? Our own ignorance. We need to change our focuses from things with insignificant outcomes to the big picture, we need to focus on unity, human advancements not only in technology or feats, but as caretakers of our one and only planet. We are all so tunnel visioned on whats going on right in front of us when we should be more aware of whats going on everywhere. When we come together to accomplish a common goal, we work wonders. Why divide and fight amongst ourselves? When in the end were all the same.. Were flying through space on a habitable world unlike any other we have come across, shouldn't that be enough to motivate us to make a change?

124,"Hey everyone.

So basically every year the prefects at my school organise a Valentine’s Day for the students. People come up to a booth about a week before the day and buy something for us to deliver to a special someone on the day while everyone is in class. So like someone may walk up and say “hey can I buy a rose for *insert name here*” then we keep track of them and deliver it on the day.

I’ve been assigned to promotions for the event. Every year the promo is really cringe worthy and difficult to watch, which is basically what we’re aiming for. We came up with the idea of re-creating popular scenes from romantic movies (like the I’m flying jack scene from titanic) but we’re struggling on easily re-creatable scenes to choose from. The promo has to be around 3-4 minutes so we need like 4- 6 scenes.

Any ideas?",03Dec2017,2

I am in need for WiFi for 2 weeks until an engineer comes to install the new broadband. 
I am planning to get a WiFi Mifi thing. It's a mobile contract which you put the simcard into a small router. It's a 24 month contract but I only need it for 13 days.

128,"First off, thanks for reading and commenting. I'll keep this as succinct as possible, so I won't go through every detail as the backstory takes place over the course of years. 

I (20M,now) had a sometimes incredibly toxic friendship with a girl I'll call K. When we met(both about 15), she was in a long term relationship, which we both respected(I was attracted to her but never made any 'moves'). We became close friends before I moved and started going to a new school. We stayed in touch, but didn't really hang out because neither of us had cars yet. 

About a year later, K invited me to a party with her and a mutual friend and a bunch of people I'd never met. I attended and ended up really enjoying this group, who K and I started hanging out with regularly. K had broken up with her boyfriend recently and I started having interest in her. We were close, so I was open about how I felt. She said she was interested but ""wasn't ready"" (I was 16-ish and too stupid to know it was BS). This continued for two years and her being in two relationships, both of which she seemed to rub in my face. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, and it's been a bit too long for me to recall every detail to be honest. That being said, some of her actions were way too egregious to be done without purpose. For example, instead of telling me she was in a relationship, she just started making out with a mutual friend while we (K, myself and mutual friend) were in the middle of a bookstore. 

Obviously, this made me feel pretty awful at the time. Due to this and other drama, I stopped hanging out and broke contact with that group of friends, which also sucked. Over time K and I more or less made up and would talk via Text or FB every once in a while.  Eventually(8-ish months ago) after talking with another friend, I figured that she was just a bad person and deleted her on all social media but didn't bother to block her. A few days ago, K sent me some messages that went similarly to:

K: Hey What's up :)?

K: Oh, you unfriended me. Did something happen?

And today, K sent me a third message:

K: Well, I get what's going on, but I don't know what I did. I hope you're alright.

I know I wasn't smart about this in the past; And trust me, I've learned my lesson. Nobody knows how much of an idiot I was better than I do. 

I'm just having a hard time deciding to block her and move on. While I realize it's the right thing to do, it's hard to give up on what used to be closest friend.

Anybody, have some insight?

I’m also aware that this is more than likely just infatuation, and not some kind of genuine love. Even though I partially believe the feelings are mutual. There are literally dozens of reasons for me to drop the friendship altogether: She lives many states away, has tons of other guys into her, I’m broke, I need to focus on college, my other aspirations are being neglected, I spend waste much of my day thinking about it, etc. The list could go on.

144,"My bedroom is the only room in the house that is not part of the original structure (built roughly 1890) but is actually an extension. It's also the only room with this problem; all the other rooms are not damp and can be heated to a reasonable level of warmth.
I've lived here for over a year now and had to complain about several maintenance issues but the landlord and letting agents have made it clear they just don't care. One thing I complained about last winter was the fact that my bedroom was freezing; with the heating on full the temperature was 15 degrees!!! I was informed by LA that because my property has original sash windows ""it will let some heat out"", but 15 degrees......
So then in spring this year, we started getting heavy rain and I noticed the casement window at the side of my bedroom was leaking water, even when closed. When open, water literally poured in like someone had a hose directed at it. Again when I mentioned this to LA I was dismissed and their advice was ""keep the window shut"", even though I'd explained it still leaked when shut.
I later discussed this with my upstairs neighbour (they own their flat), and they explained that there is a drainpipe that ends right above my window and pours water down the wall when it rains. My LL and the other flat owners are all aware of this but don't want to fork out the £4000 to get better drain pipes.
So, fast forward to autumn this year and I tripped in my bedroom and hit the wall quite hard and at the same time I heard the wall disintegrate and crumble down. Now I don't know much about wall construction but I know that outside is red brick and the inside is plaster, presumably with some kind of gap and insulation in between with something for the plaster to adhere to. I hit the wall again just to make sure I didn't imagine it (this time it was an average to light hit, as opposed to a full body slam), and again I could hear the plaster crumbling away. Now, knowing how little my LA and LL care about any issues, I didn't report this. There were no visible problems at this point and I only planned to stay a few more months before moving out, so just figured LL can deal with it when I'm gone. To add context, I called my LA for a different reason last week and the first thing the property manager said to me was ""Oh, I haven't heard from you in a while, not another problem to report is it?""... So that's the kind of hostility I deal with when discussing problems.

So we're now in December and it's absolutely freezing in my bedroom again, when I open my bedroom door, you literally feel  gust of cold air hit you like opening a fridge. On top of this, the two exterior walls have some white damp marks on them and recently some minor water staining as well. The walls feel cold and a little damp but there is no condensation on the wall so I don't believe this is from anything I am doing. Does anyone know what I can / should do about this? I am worried if I report it (or when I move out) that the LA and LL will just say this is condensation damp where I have not looked after the property and will charge me; this isn't the case at all.

TLDR drain pipes leak water down my bedroom wall, wall is now falling apart and covered in damp. How do I make sure this isn't blamed on me?

146,"In September this year I started my degree in Cardiac Physiology, one month later my father died suddenly in his sleep of a massive heart attack. 
When I graduate I wanted to work in the cath labs (this is where they send people having or suspected of having a heart attack). After my fathers death I’ve decided that I don’t want to do that because every day I’m at work I will be faced with the situation my father died in. If a patient dies, I will be reminded and feel guilty that I didn’t save them. When a patient looks at me with that scared face that patients make before they die, I will be reminded. When a patient makes a mess of themselves (which often happens during heart attacks) I will be reminded of the indignity of death. 
I worked in cardiac care before he died and my old colleagues have told me that if anything, I will make a better physiologist due to my fathers death. Is it selfish that I don’t want to be reminded every day at work of what happened to him? I know I can help people but there are plenty of other people who can help those people just as well as I would have. I know there will be those who survive but I don’t want to be surrounded by death every day.

I was incredibly depressed and isolated myself. I wouldn’t talk to anyone, even him, for long periods of time.

It began to instantly hurt, like a throbbing pain but I just ignored it and went into the dressing room. I stepped out into the pitch and the pain was still there, almost twenty minutrs later. I decided to sit on the bench and wait out but it had now swelled up considerably so I spoke to my coach and he told me to sit this game out. He gave me an ice pack and the swelling went down considerably so I took off the ice pack. Five minutes later and it swelled up again. Put the ice pack back on and then after the game I went home. I didn’t have an ice pack and the throbbing pain increased and I had to stay very still to relieve a small bit of the pain. My foster mom asked if I wanted to go the hospital and I said no. Next day it was still sore but I could move it so it wasn’t broke, I tried making a fist and I could grip every other finger perfectly except my middle gets very close to touching my palm but doesn’t actually touch it. Trying to force it is painful but not overwhelming, it’s like trying to lift something but you can’t, if you do, you know it’ll hurt. 

Even if I’m out in the cold, it begins to hurt again and swells up (it’s still swollen but only when I try to make a fist). When I try outstretching my hand there is no pain whatsoever except for a slight tickle where the pain usually is.

I've been in therapy for about two years now, for my anxiety, depression, and ADD. for YEARS before starting therapy, I'd been repressing anger. basically my whole life I believed I never had the right to be angry...so I would always just pretend I wasn't angry, and it would come out in depressive or anxious symptoms. To a certain degree I suppressed all my emotions in favor of being anxious. Now, I've made a lot of progress in therapy and I'm starting to feel things again! Which is great!

But I'm still super uncomfortable with anger. The fact of the matter is that it sticks around longer than I know what to do with. I'll give an example. One of my roommates pays the internet bill, then charges us accordingly. We've been having internet issues since we moved in six months ago, and this roommate hasn't once called the company to complain or tried to fix the problem, even though we kept asking him to do so. So I got angry (good), then I expressed to him that I was upset (good) and offered a few solutions (good). But after all that, I still can't really think about my internet connection or my roommate without getting so immediately furious! Like, I keep typing these angry texts to him and deleting them.

I want to go to a music festival on another country in my region. I did my research and read older posts about fake IDs, in most cases the gap between the restriction age and the person’s actual age is pretty big (between 1-3 years). However, I’m only few weeks more to be legal, but unfortunately it’s in next year. I plan to make a fake ID with my date of birth is set back to one year before my actual date. Here’s my thoughts:

- Most IDs discussed in the internet are scannable, but fortunately my country’s ID doesn’t have that, just some personal identification and a small hologram strip. Should be pretty easy to replicate and pretty much believable I think.
- Since my difference in age to the restriction is only one month, my looks should be believable enough to act as if I’m already legal.
- I know *many* friends who is younger than me got in easily to a festival in my country using fake IDs. Note that the festival in which they got in is one of the biggest in the region, security there is no joke, and, sharing the same nationality, the bouncers know that particular IDs too well. Now I, who is older than them, am going to a festival in a different country, whose bouncers doesn’t really know my country’s ID back-to-front, so chances to get in are pretty high, don’t you think?

A little bit about my situation: So I'm currently a junior in college living in university housing, and they allow us to reassign our contract to other people if we wish to discontinue the contract halfway (it's an academic year contract and I am wishing to move to my friend's sublease the next semester)

I found another person to takeover my contract, and we both signed an agreement form, but she backed out last weekend, and as it was a super last minute change, I already paid the deposit for my sublease.

Therefore, right now I am in a situation where I'm bound by two housing contracts at once, can someone tell me what I should do from here? :'(

What I have done so far is to meet with the housing office to petition a termination of my current contract because of various personal reasons, however, the decision takes 2 weeks to make because of inefficient university administration...

Additionally, I've consulted multiple people and they all agreed that the school is kind of dragging the process such that I wouldn't be able to find housing for next semester by the time I'm released from my contract.

Any advice is much appreciated!!!!! :'(",03Dec2017,2
175,"I had a child with my girlfriend in high school, my daughter, A. I ended up developing feelings for the girl (C) I hired to baby sit her when i needed help during college (after her mother and I separated), and we got married. 

At the time we got married (when A was 7) things seemed fine. C was kind and attentive and worried about her care. However, things started to change when C had twins two years later. Suddenly everything A did was wrong, from little things like making too much noise getting ready for school, to big things like the time she (at nine, mind) got a bunch of rainbow highlighters and colored our extremely patient dalmation, and she needed to be ""punished"" for all of them. I intervened numerous times, until I couldn't tell myself that my wife was just having a bad day anymore, at which point I pushed my wife to go to therapy. She did, and I didn't hear anything more about how much she didn't like my daughter, or how ""bad"" my daughter was, until last night.

I should note here: My daughter moved in with us full time when she was 12, when she was removed from her mother's house by CPS. That was when I learned her stepfather had been physically and sexually abusive. I immediately got my daughter medical help and therapy, and while she's not the ""super preppy happy all the time"" teenager, I feel like she's definitely doing well and has a handle on the mental fallout of that.

Last week was my daughter's 17th birthday, and we'd decided to let her have a bunch of (female) friends over. My wife and I and the twins retreated upstairs, and let them take over the living room and kitchen.

We have two very large bookshelves in our living room, filled top to bottom with books, and have always had a policy that anyone can come grab any book to read, any time. At some point around 11 pm, (I had been dead asleep), my daughter stormed upstairs, pushed open my bedroom door, and threw a book at my wife and I, before cursing us out. Then she and her friends got into a car and left. My wife turned white upon seeing the book, and tried to ""go put it away"" but i grabbed it to see what it was. 

It was one of those ""self-help"" books where you are supposed to ""meditate"" on a topic each day. Every page was filled with my wife's handwriting, talking about how much she hated A. Her grievances apparently ranged from the fact that I spend too much time and money on my daughter, to her believing that my daughter 'seduced' her stepfather.

My wife swears that book was part of her therapy, and she must have ""accidentally"" put it on the shelves downstairs and not kept it in our room, but when I went downstairs I found a number of other books just like it. Nearly every ""self-help"" book was filled with how much she despises A.

I called A numerous times to see how she was doing and make sure she was safe, as well as checking the location of her phone on my computer. She went to stay at one of her friend's houses last night, and I spoke to her friend's parents who said they would let her stay with them last night and tonight and take her to school on Monday. So I know she's safe, and while I was writing this she sent me a text so I'm hoping to talk with her.

My bigger issue is, what do I do about C? On the one hand, I know having a child forced onto you is hard, especially when she went through something as traumatic as A did. On the other hand, she knew I had a child long before we started dating, much less getting married. She knew my daughter was a priority for me, and my daughter is still a *child*, no matter how much she likes to pretend she's the smartest adult in the room. I'd have believed one book was an accident, but over a dozen? I thought she was getting therapy for this. 

My wife has been sulking all morning, since she knows I'm angry, and the twins keep asking for their sister. I am just at a loss as to what to do. Any advice you have would help.",03Dec2017,321
176,"Hello guys. This refers to my friendship with a friend from work.


What started as a normal, mundane week grew into something more when I started speaking with someone who reminded me of myself in *all* attitudes. She was very distant and very 'resigned'. Having spoken closer to her, I have discovered a lot about her, but there are several worrying things that bother me the most.

* She was sexually abused
* Doesn't have much close friends
* Grew up in poverty 

I am worried as to how to react. I have battled depression in the past, and my first instinct is to look after her and help her. I have done so and this week, in particular, we have gotten really close but I am so confused as to what is the 'acceptable' reaction. Do I leave it alone? Do I take it into account? She is very 'numb' to it and seems to accept it, which is a *good* thing. But as someone who has battled the depression in the past, I just don't know what exactly I should do.

TO make clear, I know I have no duty to do anything. But I want to because I really care about this person as a friend, and a fellow human being.",03Dec2017,2
178,"I'm 21 years old now, and I really started smoking weed when I was 19. Before then I had taken a couple of tokes, but I wouldn't count that as being an actual pot smoker. When I started smoking bud, it was great. It helped with my depression tenfold. It wasn't a problem for me at first, I started out by smoking with just friends and I would smoke like a bowl or two by myself at the end of the day. I did smoke almost everyday, did miss a day though here and there. My tolerance was down, I was always able to get really high, but I did it in a manner that didn't get in the way of my life.

A little more than a year ago, I started smoking a lot. I started smoking all day everyday. If I'm not at work or sleeping, I'm doing something while I smoke. My tolerance is sky high, I can hardly manage a buzz with a lot of weed. I'm spending an absurd amount of money that I wasn't before. But here's what's really killer, is the time I'm lost. I'm wasting hours a day everyday to just smoke and its not even getting me high anymore really. It's stupid.

I sat down with myself about 3 months ago to address that issue. I took a three week tolerance break, come back and smoke like I did originally. I kept up for about a week until I started going back to my old ways, now its like I never even stopped.

I really want to try again with cutting back. Weed still helps with depression, and honestly if I quit entirely my dumbass would likely just replace weed with something else like alcohol(I picked up weed right after I got off the cigs). But it is easy to say I need to quit based on the evidence. So reddit, what should I do with my relationship with weed?

EDIT: If I do quit, I have a pretty strong uphill battle. Basically all my friends smoke, and I'm not good at making friends. So if I quit, I'll be having an issue socially. I'm not the type that can stay strong if people are smoking right in front of me.",03Dec2017,3

182,"I (25 M) have been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend (26 F) for over 2 years now. I live in Houston, Texas USA and she lives in Tijuana, Mexico (directly south of California). I currently live at home with my dad, attending college and not working. I met her during her medical internship in Houston, but she had to move back home afterwords. We decided to stay in a long distance relationship.


As of now, I’ve gone to see her 5 times and she’s come to see me twice (because she’s in med school, she has very little time and spending money to come see as often as I see her). Our relationship has been great. Her family likes me a lot and mine likes her a lot. She’s brought a lot of good out of me, such as motivating me to break out of my social anxiety shell by making me more outgoing, attend college, and other things. I’m currently in my 3rd semester in a community college, planning to get a Bachelor’s in Information Technology at a university.

In my eyes, we have hit sort of a roadblock. Once she finishes in med school/social service/maybe work a bit in Mexico, she wants to start our life together and begin the process of working/living in Canada. She says that we could both get work visas there (I would work in IT, she would do something in medicine). She overall prefers to live there and thinks she has an easier time becoming a citizen there than the US. I, on the other-hand, would prefer if she came to the US. I believe that it would be easier for us to start a life together here because I’m already a citizen and I don’t mind marrying her if it speeds up the process. I also have a credit score of 750 that I’m building. She is very hard headed so it’s sometimes difficult for her to see things my way. It seems unrealistic to think I could finish my Bachelor’s Degree and somehow have enough money to move all the way to Canada from Texas when I’m not even currently working.


My question: where would it be easier for us to begin a life together? Both of us moving to Canada, or her coming to the US where I already am a citizen? I tried the immigration subreddit but it’s dead :(. Any useful advice/information would be greatly appreciated! Feel free to ask for more details if necessary.


TLDR: I’m happily in a long distance relationship, but I am having trouble understanding if it would be easier for both of us to move to Canada (she’s in Mexico, I’m in US) or if it would be easier for her to come to US. We both don’t have much money until we begin our careers.

185,"I am the single mother of an only child, now 23. I know I haven't been perfect, but I don't believe I was as bad as my child claims. I was never into drugs, alcohol or into any relationships while he grew up and still today. I have sacrificed everything, all these years, I went without friends as he didn't want any over. I got judged by my family for doing too much for my child, went without buying anything for me for years, sometimes during really difficult times, I went without food for 3 days, to make sure my child had everything to be comfortable. I made a monster out of my child! He now resents me for everything in life! While I thought we had a great relationship, he told me at age 16 that he hated our relationship. He constantly bashed me to our friends and family. He's angry because his dad didn't want him in his life, and I didn't want another man in mine. He even said to many people that he cannot stand being in the same room as me. He is now 23. He's moved out a few times, gone on ""adventures"" across the country, and all at most of my expense. He always came back home to restart. He even told me once that he is so sure of my love for him, that he knows he can do what he wants. Several months ago, he moved his gf and their dogs into my house. They never paid a dime, they never cleaned, never picked up after their dogs and even never repaired any of the damages the dogs caused. I put up with it, as I didn't want to damage my relationship (or lack thereof) with my son. At first, his gf brought us closer together, but over the last 2 months at my house, they fought frequently, and neither was less guilty than the other. They finally broke up while I was out of town, taking care of my sick parents. He called me at 3am, while drunk, insisting that I send money to go see her or he would kill himself. He yelled at me, insulted me, but I kept him on the phone for as long as I could to ""keep him alive"" and to calm him down. Eventually, he agreed to go to bed and was calm. I got back in town the next day, he ripped a cupboard door off the hinges in my kitchen, broke dished and nicnacs around the house. When I saw that, I complained about it and I had to keep my emotions in check, or I knew we would start a war. The evening was calm, he went to bed while I cleaned up. The next morning, I woke him up to let his dog out, prepared breakfast for him, then he went to work. Five minutes later, his now ex texted me insults, as my son told him that I felt she was being a brat, that they weren't a good match, that they were pulling the negative out of each other and making each other miserable. I also said that they needed to grow up and stop threatening to kill themselves when they didn't get their ways. I have no clue what else he told her but I did text back saying that I would discuss with him. He got home late that evening after a long day at work. I went to his room to discuss that text. He started insulting me, dropping f-bombs on me, calling me all sorts of names and finally, I had enough. I told him to get out. By then we were both angry, and he called the cops on me because he told me to leave his room and I reminded him that since he never paid rent, it was my house, therefore my room. The cops saw the damage he caused to the house and allowed him time to pack and leave. He has been over twice since, to pick up mail and a few things. He's also been at my house last week, while I was out. This does not impress me. I don't know if I should change the locks or not. I'm at a loss. He's blocked me from Facebook, cut all ties. I have no clue where he's at, if he's ok, where he's staying. I've texted him a few times, as his grandparents want to see him. I have not told them what is going on. They're too frail. But, I did offer to pay his trip to their house, and he hasn't responded. I'm at a loss. This is consuming me, which I'm sure he knows and he knows how much this hurts me. He hates me and it's clear. In a way, I feel I need to let him fend for himself so he can mature and hopefully see that his anger is an issue, as well as his disrespect for me. On the other hand, this is making me sick, literally. My question to you is this, have any of you ever dealt with such of dysfunctional relationship with your child?

186,"On mobile so I appologize for format and any other issues. 

I am going to be having surgery and be non-weight bearing for at least 8 up to 12 weeks and then work up the stages from there (PT and walking boot with crutches to build up weight bearing, then walking boot, etc. The whole recovery is usually 6-12 months 😕) 

My insurance doesn't cover knee walkers. I'm left with buying or renting and that's where the problems are:

I can buy or rent one from local med supply store. To buy one is 100s of dollars.  Renting will be at least $200 over time so not a lump sum and easier to do. However when looking around you can buy them for that price. Obviously not the same quality as the ones from medical supply stores. But if I buy I'll have it incase down the road if I need it.

I started to look around and read reviews etc. There were so many reviews that obviously made money if you bought their recommend device links. Amazon was so extreme from one end or the other. 

Where can I find honest unbiased information? What devices are best (steering vs non steering is confusing the hell out of me based on reviews).  Is buying better even if it hurts ($$$) more upfront.  

Renting is $70 a month from one company. However if you have it for even one day into the next month it's still $70.  The other company is $25 a week. I was advised to get it a week or two before surgery so I'm already accustomed to it and don't do major damage to myself after surgery.

I'm confused, stressing out, and not knowing what to do. Which is very unusual for me.  I'd appreciate any advice or knowledge you have. Thank you ☺

Whats more is that me and another person in my class has had a long history of disputes, from the fact that this person was interested in me but i wasn't, but since i wasn't clear enough about that(according to this person) we eventually had a talk where we came to the conclusion that we're not friends anymore after all that's happened.

199,"So one of my closest friends, who is also one of my roommates, basically dropped off the face of the earth around a month ago. She has anxiety and possibly depression, and is otherwise working through a decade of repressed issues, poor coping mechanisms, and low self-esteem, so when she began to withdraw I was worried.

I didn't say anything for a week or so because I assumed she had a lot of schoolwork and was staying up late, because she would come home after I was asleep and be gone before I got up. She stopped replying to group messages with every one of our mutual friend groups (and there are at least 3 or 4). I asked if she was doing okay and she insisted that she was, that she was working through some things, and that she wasn't avoiding me. So I assumed it would get better soon, and that after Thanksgiving break we could go back to normal. 

But instead, it's only gotten worse. She seems to only spend time with and be herself around the same 3 people, none of whom she was particularly close with before this semester. The only times she's communicated with me at all in the last month have been when she's needed something from me or wants to complain about something, but in total we've spent fewer than 20 minutes together in over a month. 

Last night, my other roommate and I got back late. She didn't seem to be home (her bed is lofted and hard to see, but it looked empty and nobody answered when we said her name) and has frequently been coming back well after 1am, so we assumed she was still gone. I began telling my other roommate that I missed my best friend, that I was frustrated at being shut out this way, and that I felt like the friendship had become incredibly one-sided. But she was in her room after all, and overheard. She texted me saying she could hear us and it was a really passive-aggressive text. So I went to her room, apologized for waking her up, and told her we should talk when it wasn't so late. 

But now what do I say? She's intensely sensitive and can't take any form of negative feedback without shutting down and becoming defensive, and tends to have a victim mentality. Is there a way to productively tell her how I feel and make sure she's doing okay without falling back into the trap of being a stand-in for a therapist like I was a year ago?",03Dec2017,2

Amy just got back from a sabbatical and she was like...overly excited to see me I feel like. She ran up to me and gave me one of those hugs where the girl wraps her legs around your waist when I came over to visit the day after she got back.

She's constantly texting me and asking when I'm coming over to hang out, sometimes even more so than my girlfriend. Last night she invited me over and I told her I had other plans with my buddies. My buddies and I go to a town 45 minutes away and go to a nightclub.

I put on my snapchat story a few pics of us and then an hour later, Amy texts me and asks which club I'm at. I tell her, thinking nothing of it and an hour after that, she walks through the door with her friend (not my gf). I ask her what she's doing here and she says that her and her friend were hanging out and decided they wanted to meet up with me at this club. I thought it was weird, but whatever.

The rest of the night she's a little flirty with me, touching my arm and when we are all in the booth talking, when I say something she finds funny, she laughs and rests her head on my shoulder for a split second. After we left, she texts me telling me what a great time she had and said (verbatim) ""You know you are so funny. I was laughing out loud the entire night! You're so much fun to be around. I hope we can do this again soon"".

203,"Hey all, I came here last time looking for advice on Essay subjects that were interesting and someone provided me with an awesome one. So I'm back, here are the instructions to help you narrow it down, if you're not up for reading it then feel free to just post your suggestions regardless!

&gt;What is a causal essay?

&gt;In this kind of essay, the aim is to informatively argue the causes (reasons) or the effects (results) of an event or situation.

&gt;There may be several causes or effects of a situation. However, in a student essay, it is advisable to keep the number of major points to 2 or 3, which form separate developmental paragraphs.

&gt;Example: 
Consider the topic of acid rain:  there may be several effects worth discussing, all leading to the point of the essay: that acid rain is causing enough damaging effects in our world that it’s worth taking the steps necessary to eliminate the problem.  Eliminating that problem, of course, would be another paper—one that examines the causes of acid rain (thus making acid rain the effect of the paper).  In the case of acid rain as cause, you might still want to briefly review what makes acid rain—in other words, you’d be acknowledging that acid rain doesn’t exist in a vacuum.  

&gt;Acid rain thus temporarily becomes the effect caused by all sorts of environmental hazards, foremost among them air pollution.  Your conclusion, then, could move back to that original cause, our insensitivity to our own environment, which is the primary cause in the chain leading to acid rain, and point to that cause as the culprit that needs to be addressed if we’re to see an end not only to acid rain but to the environmental effects you’ve discussed in your essay.

Yesterday, I made this clear, when he gave my younger sister an iPhone 8 and turned to me, asking if I wanted a new phone. I said no, that the newer phones were too big, that there were apps on my phone that are no longer available in the App Store I want to keep, and that it was just ridiculously expensive and I would prefer him putting money towards saving for when I need help paying college fees. I still have the iPhone 5s, but it still works terrifically. There's no cracks or dents, despite me having dropped it multiple times, and all of the buttons work.

Just now, he returned home from shopping with my brother, having bought my brother a new iPhone, himself an Apple Watch, and then shoved the iPhone X in my hands. I said no, attempted to walk away after handing the box back, but he told me, ""No, take it. I already paid for it."" Where did he get all this money, I don't know. I'm coming from a Vietnamese family, and they tend to like buying stupidly expensive things just to brag. Yesterday, my mother harassed and screamed at my younger sister to swap phones with her. My mother has an iPhone 7 Plus, by the way, and she was arguing her youngest daughter for a phone maybe just a generation apart.

I'm just so irritated. There are far more people with worse problems than I do, I realize, and there are those who are in dying need of functional phones, but my current phone is fine.

She's contacted me a few times since then wanting to get together and talk or something but usually gets a little too freaked out and flakes, it was by far the most serious relationship either of us had been in.

208,I've got a lot better in a lot of aspects of anxiety but every now and then I'll have a really low day where all I can think about is the fact I haven't had as much as a sexual partner in two and a half years. How do I get over this?,03Dec2017,3
209,"Hi all, this is my first Reddit post ever because I made a Reddit account today. I have no other ideas of where to or who to turn to so I'm here as a last resort. To get started, my name is Logan and I am 23 years old. I have my associate's degree and have been working as a full time restaurant manager for the last year making $45,000 a year. It was great money for my age and a (mostly) stress-free job. However, I cold-turkey quit it a week ago. I have always had the desire to help other people in life because I had a terribly rough upbringing. Now that I am in my twenties, I have had an overwhelming urge to do something meaningful with my life - so overwhelming I quit my management job and lost my steady income. I've been in this suicidal depression for the last 6 months. It's become so bad that I no longer wish to see my family or friends most of the time. I just want to sit in my room and be alone because I feel like I have no purpose in this world and I do nothing to benefit people or society. Even at my job I felt like I was doing a purposeless job giving rich people food and listening to them bitch about how they hated our waitstaff. Every time I was at work I would day dream of myself volunteering at a homeless shelter or helping a troubled teen. Now that I've quit, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, but now I don't know what to do. I have no job and no credentials to jump into a job that I feel is meaningful. I knew this was the case when I quit, but I just had to do it for my mental stability. 

I am here for some real advice. Please don't troll me and say ""You threw away a great oppurtunity, deal with it."" or the like. I know a million people would be happy making what I made at my age and would have zero complaints. But I just need to do something for people. I need to help the world. If anyone is out there and reading this with some solid, real advice. I am here with open ears. Thank you so much for reading this and have a wonderful day.",03Dec2017,2
210,"Met someone several months ago.  He’s divorced with 3 children - 16, 13, 6.  Will this work?  

Here are my concerns:
#1: he’s very social and is constantly on his phone texting.  When confronted he claims it’s only with his kids but that’s not true.
#2: he literally does everything for his kids - they don’t know how to turn an oven on, put things in dishwasher or fold laundry so he’s always running around stressed all of the time making sure their every need is personally handled by him.  I understand taking care of your kids (I have 2) but he can’t get anything else done which eats into the little time we have together.
#3: I feel like because of #2, there is very little time left for me.
#4:  we have had a few arguments about various things and he fights very aggressively.  Because of this, it doesn’t feel like a safe environment to discuss any of this.

Will this work?",03Dec2017,2

My name is Ari. I am currently 15 years of age, attending a private school in L.A. In the past 5 years, many of my friendships didn’t work out and I don’t have any real friends. My youtube and reddit account have not been shared with any of my “friends”, due to me not trusting them or not liking them. I consider myself an extrovert, but in some instances I am an extrovert. I tend to have seasons where imma brain activity is at its peak. This is normally a cycle for me but it has died out. I don’t seek any pleasure of staying with my current friends, but rather keeping in touch with my friends that are in college and so on. For being a 15 year old, I consider myself to be mature. The only reason I am posting such posts on reddit such and this, is because I need to open up to others, and any type of advice will help me out. Thank you to r/watch7maker . He was the only man/girl that commented on my first reddit post. It was so descriptive, and literally answered every question at that time, it showed me how there is always someone listening. I learned this lesson a while back in a play I did for school in the 4th grade. I was the lead role of a tomato in a garden. We need to set a plot that would be funny and appropriate. I told my teachers of a murder idea that someone is making ketchup. None of the teachers listened. The only person that listened was the school guard, Jose, and he told the principal himself. My idea was told, and taken into consideration, then implemented. This is just a thank you to everyone who has listened and who has not. I plan on making daily videos of what I have done that day, what I plan on doing the next, and where my life is at its current state. If any of you have give me advice on life, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advanced, and have a blessed day.",03Dec2017,2

216,"I'm writing this on a mobile and I'm also drunk which I know sounds like a bad start but I'm an honest drunk and currently feeling really low and need some advice/guidance. This will be long by the way. 

I'm 21 years old, male and heterosexual, you'll see why I state this shortly. Despite being 21, I've never been in a relationship, I've never even had a kiss, now I'm not one of these people that complains they're not good with girls despite never actually trying anything but rather I'm someone who finds the thought of being that close to someone really intimidating. Opening up isn't something I like to do, I feel like I'm exposing myself and part of me usually feels betrayed if I do allow myself to get close to someone. Over the years I've had phases where I've wanted nothing more than a relationship, someone I can get close to emotionally and during these phases I get really angry at myself, I feel a strange hatred and I'm not sure why, it's destroyed a lot of potential relationships over the years.

I'll give an example. At 17 I started to chat with a girl called Amy, she was great, we got on great and she just got me, nothing I could say or do around her made her uncomfortable, we clicked and became good friends. Eventually we started getting closer and closer and finally one night while at a friend's 18th birthday party we got a little drunk and went upstairs. We just sat and talked about random shit to begin with, just our usual chit chat and carrying on, until she brought up feelings. She opened up to me and told me she felt like she wanted to be more than friends and for a split second I felt the same, I felt really happy, warm and elated but almost immediately I felt pure anger, hatred and I wanted to lash out. I think I hid my true emotions well and I joked that she'd had too much to drink and we'd have to talk while sober. I soon left and on the way home my emotions got the better of me and I hit a wall more times than I'm willing to admit (immature I know).

Shortly after I told her that it couldn't happen, because I only saw her as a friend. We still talk to this day and she's with someone now. She has no idea that I lied to her and I have no idea why I sabotaged myself like that. But the example is pretty applicable to the few other times I've gotten close to someone.

I honestly feel like two people in one body. Like I'm sharing my brain with someone who doesn't want to share me because in those few seconds after Amy told me how she felt, I felt it too but then a voice in my head told me we're okay on our own. We don't need anyone. Notice the *we're* and *our* there, I've always thought that way though. Since about age 10 anyway, I may say *i* aloud but in my thoughts I refer to myself as if I'm more than one.

This effects all aspects of my life and is usually too complex to explain but like I said, I'm drunk, so this is just flowing. The easiest way for me to explain would be to give you a run down of how we differ. And I hope it's not too weird.

Person A - This is me, this is the normal Jason, I'm a healthy mixture of outgoing and shy, I feel optimistic, happy and content. I get on well with family, friends and colleagues and generally enjoy spending time with others, going out for drinks and just having fun with the people I care about. I'm compassionate and I hate to see anyone upset or hurt and I'll happily go out of my way to help anyone who needs it. This is me and this is who I want to be.

Before I describe Person B, I feel I may have described this situation poorly, so just to clarify I feel like I'm both people. I'm A and B, but B is a stronger personality. 

Person B - This is not me, this is a polar opposite, full of hatred, anger and resentment. Pessimistic, violent and indifferent to those around. If someone is hurt or upset it's a good day. I feel no one deserves help, they deserve nothing from me and I'd rather kick them whilst they are down than help them stand. While I feel like this I feel like nothing matters, if I'm in this state of mind or whatever it is i don't feel fear or regret. I want to be alone, I don't want to do anything other than think of ways to hurt those around me or myself. Usually when I feel like this I want to be in dangerous situations, I want to lash out and cause as much damage and pain as I can. Being in pain excites me and have awful, cruel thoughts. Whilst in this mood I'm repulsed by the thought of intimacy and sex. 

Reddit, I honestly haven't a clue what to do. It really tears me apart daily having to keep a balance. I can usually feel when I'm starting to turn into Person B and avoid people, lock myself in my room and try and sleep it off or just sit until it passes but this can sometimes go on for days. Whilst being Person B I've done things that Person A never would, like hit my brother unprovoked, squaring up to my dad, telling my mum that she needs to careful because one day I won't come home. When I'm Person B I'm a disgusting excuse of a person, it honestly hurts me knowing I've hurt my family when they're nothing but supportive. My friends have only seen me in B mode once, we were out drinking and I was approached by a girl, which I sat and spoke to for a good hour,last before she tried to kiss me and just like that a flip was switched. I told her I wasn't interested and found my friends. They could tell something was up but didn't press. The next club we tried to get into denied me for seemingly no reason (I wasn't black out drunk and had ID) usually we'd just move onto the next club, as there's plenty but instead I got confrontational and pushed the doorman, yelling a threats and trying to get at him whilst friends held me back. They walked me away and were absolutely speechless. I then had a go at them and walked off.

I've toyed with the idea that I'm suppressing something, I thought that maybe I was gay and that's why I seem to flip when I'm close to being with a woman but I ruled that pretty quickly as there's zero attraction to guys. I've thought that maybe I'm deeply misogynistic but Person A has no qualms with women. Im just so confused and feel isolated. I've also looked into depression but I'm not always Person B.

I just don't know what to do. It makes me feel like I'm wrong, like I should just run away because I feel like I have this malevolent darkness just brewing in me and as edgy as it sounds I'm fearful that if I'm on the wrong place at the wrong time and feeling like B that I may do something I'll regret (like almost fighting my own dad ffs) I know it sounds like I'm blaming all my misdoings on this other person or alternative personality but please believe me when I say that even when I'm normal I'm no Saint but when I feel like B, I'm not me. It's not just me lumping my bad qualities and actions onto someone else. It honestly like I'm a completely different person, I know I'm not acting myself but I can't help it, my thought process is different. I even speak slightly differently, using a slightly altered vocabulary. It's like I'm aware I'm not me but I can't change it. Almost as if I'm just watching a movie. I often forget what I'm doing if I feel like I'm B. 

Has anyone ever felt this way? Does anyone have any idea what could be going on? How the fuck do I explain this to my doctor without getting carted off?

**TLDR:** I feel like two people in one body, one side is normal and the other is cruel, heartless and motivated by anger. I'm worried i'll be this way forever and I'm also scared and reluctant to seek help. I'd like a few opinions and some advice. ",03Dec2017,3

220,"I feel so mean for it, we’ve been the closest friends for 4 years (I should note, we’re online friends and haven’t met irl) but lately everything she does agitates me constantly and I don’t really know what to do about it..... of course there are days when i’m fine with talking to her and I enjoy the conversations but more often then not I wish she wouldn’t text me

of course the obvious answer is we’ve grown apart but I can’t stop talking to her now because we’ve already planned to meet in a few months. everything is booked. this was a gift from my parents and I really don’t feel like telling them they wasted so much money only for us to end up not friends after so long

if I try to think specifically what agitates me,,, shes always clingy.. I cant go a few hours without talking to her because i’m not feeling it/in a bad mood without her texting me and saying she misses me. if I ignore her she continues to spam me and eventually gets upset/mad. sometimes in these cases i’ll respond really bland so the conversation ends fast and she ends up again texting me later saying she misses me/is sad. 
i enjoy talking to her when the conversation is normal and casual but it seems like every time we talk she brings up something to complain about in her life or she is talking about how much she missed me. seriously lmao

I wouldn’t really know how to talk to her about this because anytime i’m angry w her she gets so upset and doesn’t take anything from it and will just be in general, dramatic. and then if we fight she posts it all over social media,,,, 

I understand partly why she gets so upset easily and it’s because she does have depression and I understand this!! she however doesn’t do anything about it no matter how much i’ve tried to tell her that I can’t always be her lifeline and she needs to help herself to get better but she doesn’t try.
this is another reason why I don’t think I could ever stop talking to her because she relies so much on me and i doubt i’ll be able to if I tried 

not really that relevant because it happened recently and it didn’t change anything but she told me that she likes me. which I again really do not get because lately all our conversations have been me texting extremely bland responses while she complains
also i’m a girl before this makes ppl think i’m a dude lol

anyway,,, advice is appreciated

234,"Hi there, i [18M] have a bestfriend of 7 years [18F] and i’ve fallen for her ever since. Throughout the years, we didnt get in touch that much because she had been dating a few guys which i did not want to get myself into but after her previous ex she had been in a very tragic break up which left her having trust issues when it comes to a relationship. So we started hanging out again and talking more than usual. We started being very comfortable with eachother. She started telling me stuffs that she doesnt want others to know like her family’s condition.I mean this girl doesnt give a shit about herself changing her pants next to me in the car. But she cares when its with other guys.(Maybe im so far up in the friendzone). So time passes by and she starts dating my friend and eventually had a bad break up with him as well. And i posted some kind of a dare on instagram saying (You can ask me one question by dm me and i’ll answer truthfully).  She then says “Do you have a crush?” Then i said i had a crush on you. And then we talked about it and turns out she already knew (I mean i did show obvious hints that i liked her) but i said i used to liked her and didnt care who she is with because its her choice. And after that we just stayed as friends per usual. But, i can sensed that she is more “girly” than usual around me? The way she talks to me are more softer and while im studying in a different state she always says that she misses me and she always calls and texts me to let me know how she is doing and  telling me whats new. Heck, she is closer with me than most of her guy friends and even girl friends. Im probably the closest shes got. Also 2 days earlier, she checked on my found and said have you been stalking me on instagram? (Not in a weird way of course.She acts it like its normal) Then i said “Well yeah i always check up on you to see whats up” and then she just acts okay.

When me and my gf first met, she was drinking pretty much most days(holidays - she likes drinking as well). I don’t drink but I was still there. She is a ‘slutty dancer’ which attracts male attention as it would and obviously o don’t like it. 

She knows about my anxiety and has told me that she will try to talk to me when something is up. But she doesn’t, she ‘forgets’ and seems so oblivious to it - I understand she’s hormonal too. 

Now, she has her Christmas party and she’s not going due to her not being able to drink. But I’m scared about what’s gonna happen when she’s had the kid and goes out drinking as I won’t be there to sort of look over her. There is already a guy there that’s after her yet knows she is with someone. 

I do plan on marrying the girl and she knows this and wants to marry me too, but my anxiety really fucks things up for me around this. 

My past relationships have been being cheated on, lied to, left and I have a fear that everyone is gonna leave me(and that she’s gonna cheat on me) - her also despite her saying she’s not going to. I really need help on this 😭

I need some advice on how to talk to her about this and just about us in general.

236,"This is my first year at University. Near the start of first term, one of the most important people in my life, someone whom I trusted with everything, my girlfriend from back home, cut contact with me over an argument we had. I talked with her every day for the past 5 months of my life. I confided so much in her, with my day to day problems, my insecurities, my mental health, and just anything that was affecting me negatively. When she stopped talking to me, a lifeline that I had grown so accustomed to having in my life was suddenly cut.

As someone who suffers from extreme anxiety and depression, the last few months have been nothing but hell for me. Every day for 3 months after it happened I would wake up and cry over the fact that she was out of my life, and for the foreseeable future, she has no intention of re-entering it. To say that this has had a significant impact on my first year would be an understatement.

I grew extremely distant from the friends I had made here. I just wish I had someone to cry to about this, but nobody wants to comfort the strange dude they just met in college. I felt like the fun and happy guy that I was when I first introduced myself to these people was gone when she left my life. I grew more and more secluded, and to this day I dont really feel like I know anyone here who I can confide in.

This has led me to pick up some very unhealthy habits. I went from going to every class to maybe going to half of my classes a week. I stopped eating regular meals, and to this day I only eat about one meal a day. I picked up a very unhealthy drug addiction that slowly gets worse every single day. I have problems taking my prescription medicine. Some nights I'll stay up thinking the entire night, not even staying up doing anything, just thinking about her and how much I miss her.

This past week was the first time I had ever considered suicide in my life. Every day just feels like I fall a little bit lower into an inescapable pit. I want to scream for help, but am just to scared to trust anyone I know with things like this. The only thing that keeps me going every day is the fact that maybe when I go home over Christmas that I might be able to fix things with this person. But part of me knows that things might not ever be the same between us, and that scares me.

If things don't go over well between us, I honestly am scared of what is going to happen to me. Part of me wants to just pull the mental health card and tell her that for the sake of my health we need to talk and figure things out, but I also feel like that would be extremely manipulative of me, no matter how true it is.

I wish I had some sort of guidance on what to do in a situation like this. Do I just try to move on in my life? If so how, because I dont know how I can live my life currently without this girl. I mean hell I still go on facebook and instagram every day to see if she had posted anything. I just don't know what to do, and I'm not sure if i'm a fool or not for still caring about this girl even after she hasn't talked to me in so long. If anyone has any advice on how to get through a time like this in my life, any wisdom is extremely welcome.",03Dec2017,1
238,"So I’ll try to make this as brief as possible. Me, my fiancé and my best friend was all going to get a two bedroom apartment together. Long story short, he got fired from his job for calling in too many times. Apparently he had called in around 7 times (you are allowed 5) and he only worked there for 5 months. He would call in to go Kayaking, Hiking, His Girlfriend, etc. Since June he has not had a job and Me, My Mother, Father and Fiancé have all been trying our best to find him a job and sent him jobs that are hiring. Well he always tells us that “They aren’t hiring” when we will call 2 minutes later and ask and they say they are, so we know he is lying to us. He spends all his time at his girlfriends, he doesn’t apply at jobs unless we send them to him or we help, he has no resume, he firmly believes that his unprofessional email and dress attire to interviews has no correlation with how the interviewer sees him as a potential employee. When I mean he has an unprofessional dress attire to interviews, I mean it’s bad. Like he will wear Jeans, Vans, and a Slayer shirt to an interview. 

Me and my fiancé live in our apartment already. We have since September and we’re perfectly fine financially. So I guess my real help I need is: Should I just spend the $50 to remove him off the lease? Would it be worth it at this point? Also, he’s literally one of my best friends. I want to help him, is there anything more I can do to help him more than I already am now? I’m trying my best with him. ",03Dec2017,1

245,"So about 9 months ago i told a girl that i liked her more than just a friend,she said that she didnt feel the same, and we stoped talking for a while,until that point we would talk on a dailybasis and we got along very well (which was one of the reasons why i started to like her).

Now 3 weeks ago i saw her (while i was with my friends) and she joined us that night, so me and this girl went to bar we talked about what had happened with us,she said she kinda regreted not having had anything more with me,this all happened after we drank a little nothing much rly and smoked some pot, but later that night when i walked her to her house there was this moment (you know) and i know she was waiting for a move but i didnt took it.... Later when i joined my friends i was still thinking that that was my chance and all that stuff, so i decided to text her and i asked her if she was disapointed with that kiss on the cheek,she said yes and i asked her why couldn't things be simple between us she said she was a mess and that it wasnt my fault. The other day i saw a photo on her insta and found out that she has a boyfriend... So i ask you my good people what is your advice for me??

I behaved like a total asshole, disrespectful etc, all because ""you need to be cool"" stuff shit. This always happens to me, from 1 sec to another. ...I want fo fix this friendship.

We know eachother now for about 2-3 years, everything was going well, pretty much best friends until we met for the first time today. Then the need to be ""cool"" came over me again and I just became that disrespectful dick. Obv I fucked this up, once again.

248,"I'm 21 years old now and my parents pay for most of my college tuition. I have about $15,000 in savings from working part time jobs and I am about to get my first paycheck from my software company which will be around $6-7000. I am looking at renting an apartment with friends who are also the same age as me. We found one with a 12 month lease that would be about $350/mo per person. Their parents think that it is a good idea, but I feel like mine will say I'm spoiled for wanting to move out. They also might say that if I can afford to move out, they shouldn't have to pay for tuition anymore. When I go out with girls and tell them I live with my parents they usually give me a funny look. The commute to school and work right now is anywhere between 35-60 minutes. If I move it will be cut down to 15-20 minutes. Is this reasonable of me to move out now?",03Dec2017,1
250,"I posted this on the confession sub but I don't want to copy-paste the same thing here, because i'm looking for a specific answer here.

I'll give the long story short.
My brother and I had a very traumatic childhood; he was sexually abused as a child, etc. Divorced, unstable parents, moved between relatives homes, etc. We have always been very close. He had a mental break in the last few years, however, and moved in with me and became even more co-dependent. He has been in and out of hospitals and therapists but it's very hard to get him on any regular treatment routine (I do see a therapist and psychiatrist regularly for myself).

Basically he showers with me, he sleeps with me, he won't let me talk to guys, he will threaten and try to attack male co-workers if he feels they get too close. He has tried to get physical with me on a few different occasions. By this I mean both with affection and violence (although he is smaller than me, I am not afraid for my life per-say, but people have advised me that I should be..)

 I have been guilty in letting this co-dependence exist and fester, and I don't really know why, other than it gave me comfort of knowing i'm not alone. 

I need to stop this vicious cycle of love bombing, him threatening to kill himself when I tell him this isn't acceptable, then coming back to love bomb me again. I don't want to have him admitted because he would never trust me again. He puts so much trust and faith in me and depends on me for literally everything. I know this isn't healthy, or socially acceptable, or even remotely okay.

What can I do if he refuses to go to treatment? Is the only other option to force him to be admitted? He was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder as a teenager, but I don't know if his attachment to me as his sister would be called by that, or if we both need specific therapy for incest.. victims?

This is a weird question. Sorry if it freaks anyone out. Any advice is appreciated.",03Dec2017,3
251,"So a few months ago I moved into a two bedroom apartment where one other guy has been living for some time. He has two cats. One is a messy cat, one is clean. The apartment is split into two levels, with our bedrooms and shower/bathroom on the upper level, and kitchen, living room, and second washroom on the lower level. The upper level has a large closet that the one kitty litter box sits in.

When I moved in, the litter box smell was somewhat noticeable on the second level, but not obnoxious. About standard for an apartment with a litter box, I guess. 

I didn't/don't want to have anything to do with the care/upkeep of the two cats. I don't feed them, I don't clean up after them. They're my roommate's cats.

*However*, the past two weeks or so, the ammonia smell has gotten a little more intense coming from the closet. It is a standard-size box, plastic, with two small floor mats in front of it to catch litter stuck to paws. I believe he scoops the litter and keeps the clumps in some kind of special sealed bags for later disposal. I don't know how often these sealed bags get disposed of. I don't know how often my roommate cleans out the litter box, or replaces the litter, or wipes the whole thing down, but it is not enough, it would seem.

Today I just got back to the apartment from two days out of town, and HOLY GOD is the smell intense on the upper level of our apartment-- so much so that I'm afraid the smell has managed to sneak into my bedroom, which I maintain as a 100% cat-free zone, and possibly seep into my clothing and bedding. Argh! It's so gross!

I haven't talked to my roommate about this at all. Since I moved in, the whole cat thing was tolerable. But I think maybe I'm at the point where I really need to address this.

What is a polite and/or diplomatic way of talking to him about this? I'm guessing he hasn't noticed what has happened, got used to the smell, etc. I really don't want to take up kitty litter duty, but it may be the case that he just doesn't think it needs to get scooped and/or refreshed as often as I do.

What do you think? What should I do?",03Dec2017,1
252,"Idk how common of a problem this is, but for at least the past few years of my life I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing I truly want or desire in life. Sure there are things I’d like to have or happen, but I don’t want them; I wouldn’t work to get them. For example, I may want to eat a pork chop, however, my laziness and aversion to marinating, cooking and cleaning greatly overwhelms and overrides my want to eat a pork chop. I suspect that my lack of wanting things is caused by the fact that I don't find achieving goals or doing certain things rewarding or pleasurable, and my state of mind and happiness is flatlined in an emotional neutral. I fear that if I don’t overcome this, I won’t achieve anything in life as I won’t be motivated or passionate about anything, and in the end, I will regret everything I’ve done, or rather, haven’t done. I would greatly appreciate any tips or suggestions of how to overcome this.

259,"I’ll try to make this short and sweet.

I’ve lived next to my neighbor for five years, and this house has been in my family since the 50s so he has lived next to some member of my family for like three decades now.

Well call him R. R is a middle aged man with severe mental issues (think autism/Aspergers to the EXTREME). 

I’ve never really had a huge issue with him. I have always had three cats that have lived outside of my home. They’re my pets. He has told me countless times how much he enjoys having them around and pets them and plays with them.

At least once a day over the past week he has come BANGING on my door (often when my baby is sleeping) and starts yelling at me about how my cats are suddenly shitting in his yard. They have never done this before and it apparently started out of nowhere. 

I have told him ill try to think of solutions but I’m not sure what to do. He told me to “move their food bowls” so I did that. Still he came back the next day banging on the door. He seems angrier and more aggressive each time and he is starting to make my family and I very uncomfortable.

As of today he demanded I get rid of my cats for him. I told him I’d be happy to come check for droppings daily and clean them up myself, that I’d go buy professional cat deterrents at the store and put them in his yard myself, that I’d do everything I could think of.

He told me he won’t let me do that because anything like that means that I’m “okay with them doing this to him” and that I need to either “get rid of the little bastards or watch them after they eat EVERY TIME until they shit somewhere other than this yard!” He even told me that they are doing it on purpose and that they “wait until I’m behind the house to sneak over and do it so I don’t see!”

He has yet to provide any proof that this is even my pets (this neighborhood has a shit ton of cats as well as possums). 

My other neighbor has already banned him from his property for other similar threatening encounters. My worry is that I’m going to end up with the cops or animal control beating down my door or something. Or worse, that this nutjob might slip poison into my cats food bowls or something.

I have no idea how to handle this and quite frankly this guy is starting to really freak us out. He’s bizarrely obsessive and aggressive about this situation.

I get lots of messages on LinkedIn from people interested in building websites/startups and asking me if I'm interested in working for them, but I usually ignore all of them.

But a month ago I got this message from a student at my same uni, telling me he was working on a project WITH THE UNIVERSITY and that they needed a developer.

I said I was interested, so I did a couple of interviews with him and a professor(always from my uni) and I got an offer for this part-time job.

During the interviews, I found out that this project was actually NOT with the university, but it was basically a startup that he(the student) and the professor wanted to start.

I thought about the offer, but I decided to refuse because I was too busy with other stuff.
I sent the student an email and he called me saying he was not going to accept no for an answer and that he really believed I was a good fit for the job and that I could work as little or as much as I wanted depending on I busy I was with uni.

So I said okay.

Now he(the student) has been texting me for a week asking me to go out with him(he didn't explicitly said it was a date but it was clear).

I find this very unprofessional, and I was already not-too-sure about the job, this is just stressing me out.
I have exams and I really don't want to think or worry about this.

I just want to tell him I'm not interested and never have anything to do with him ever again, but since he doesn't take no for an answer I'm not sure what to do.

Should I make up an excuse? But what excuse? ""I don't have time"" didn't work and I think that was a major issue.

She can get pretty judgy and always likes to talk about herself every time I mention something is going on with me. Also, I have depression and when I get sad she never says ANYTHING to me or even asks if i'm okay. I remember I was crying in the room and she said nothing to me and we did not talk in two weeks. After I got over it I ask her why does she not say anything because I think she doesn't care, and she responds with that she does not know what to say or do so she just does nothing. Which I guess is okay, but sometimes it makes me feel like she just doesn't care. In addition to that, every time I mention something that she does that I feel bothers me, like how she points out every mistake I make in terms of vocabulary or word usage, she likes to switch it back to me and say stuff like, ""Well I don't like how you....."" and it is usually tedious stuff. For instance, when I asked her politely to not always point out my mistakes because it bothers me, she brought up how she doesn't like it when she lets me try her snacks and I don't like it, and mentioned an instance that occurred a month ago. She gets personally offended whenever I say I don't like how a snack she has taste. And its not like I say it out of the blue just to be an asshole, its after she lets me taste it and she asks if I like it.

286,"So recently there was an opening for another full-time position at a place I interned at while I was in college a couple years ago - lets call it job B. I genuinely enjoyed my time at job B and lost out on the position which opened up at the end (I essentially let my friend/co-intern have it for several reasons). So instead I went to work somewhere else in my field (IT) which is my current job.

I've already interviewed for job B and I know I have a very good chance at a job offer and I can expect a call tomorrow. This job would have better pay, benefits, and almost no commute (which is 20 minutes one way at my current job). It's clearly the more logical choice and a great next step in my career. 

And yet, I don't want to leave my current job despite all that. I really enjoy the flexibility and laid-back atmosphere and camaraderie I've built up with some of my co-workers. 

Our department is understaffed and some days can be very hectic and downright stressful. It's because of this I feel like I've grown close bonds with a few of my co-workers, one in particular I've always really liked and wanted to ask out but never have because frankly I'm a fucking coward. Even if I worked up the courage to ask, I'm afraid that if I take this job she would distance herself from me for leaving and turn me down. Since I would also really like to maintain relationships with my co-workers after I leave if I can, that would complicate interactions and make it awkward.

As far as I know, my co-workers have no idea I've been inquiring about this job and I haven't told them because I feel guilty and don't want to hurt them I guess. I was going to wait until it was a for sure thing rather than dangle it over their heads that I may or may not be leaving - I don't want to put them through that. Some higher-ups probably know, but so far nobody has confronted me or acted differently towards me since.

Now obviously it's possible I won't get the job and this would all be a non-issue, and maybe I'm putting too much stock in myself but I'm guessing my odds of getting the job are about 90% given my past performance and qualifications.

What should I do? This is the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my (albeit short) life and it's stressing me to no end despite the logical choice being so clear. Sorry for the wall of text, I just can't quite put into words adequately how I feel. Thank you for reading.",03Dec2017,1
287,"I'm 25, and my parents have been middle class business owners my whole life.

What I don't like about them is that they are very biased toward other people based on how much money they make.

Anyone he perceives as rich who didn't earn their money or who is too showy with it for his tastes is literally Donald Trump.

My dad also hates his brother who seems like a pretty good guy. The problem is that he runs an even more successful business and has a nice house. I've tried to have serious talks with him about why he hates Uncle Jake,  and it's all about how he's showy with his wealth which good people don't do.

They even got me presents for my birthday. I'm living on my own again in my new apartment and I want to give them each something to show my appreciation but I'm not exactly living lavishly. As of right now, I have an extra $210 to spend that I've saved up for Christmas presents (but I'm reaching in to the jar to pay for groceries sometimes). What should I get them?",03Dec2017,1
289,"Hi, I’m a high school senior going to be graduating in may who has no idea what to do with his life. Previously for years prior i had plans to join the Marines, but came to the realization that I’m not mentally or physically tough enough. So now i have to go to college, which is paid for already, i know this sounds like a great opportunity that many others would kill to have, which I’m thankful for, but honestly the idea of college fills me with dread. I have hated school since preschool every single day. The lessons, the meaningless work, homework, projects, stupid drama and people. The whole package i just disliked since day 1. In fact the only subjects i like are history ( which to major in leaves almost no job prospects) and automotive (which i know i don’t want to work in as a career). So my current plan is to do two years at my local state college (I don’t have the necessary classes to go straight to university) and then transfer to a university and get a degree in business to pursue a career in human resources. I have zero interest in this field and am only going to pursue it since it seems it pays well. I don’t really know what I’m asking for on here just looking to see if anyone has been in a similar position and what they did. Thanks in advance.
tl;dr: high school senior who is looking for advice on going to college to pursue a career he has zero interest in.",03Dec2017,1
291,This man means the world to me and we went through a really hard time. He has personal stuff going on and I have some mental health issues that have arisen again. We used to be so amazing and then things went downhill. He’s very stubborn and closed off. I need a way for him to remember how he feels about me. It’s hard when I’m being put down constantly to keep a positive attitude but I’m trying. I will do anything to make this work. ,03Dec2017,1
292,"So this is a long, sad story coming out of western california, spanning nearly 8 years of my life. At the age of 24, that makes it a full third of my life. For years in High School, I was friends with a wonderful girl, Kiara. Best friends, nothing more. We shared relationship issues, life issues, skyped eachother until 3am on so many nights just...venting. We were the best of friends, platonic and simple. And we liked it that way. Feelings eventually reared, my last year of HS, when she was at the end of her sophmore year. We started dating, and it was great. Classic High School sweethearts. Her parents weren't always the greatest or most understanding people, but they liked me well enough it seemed. I got her pregnant. And like the flip of a coin-I was pure evil to them. She ended up miscarrying, but not before I forever altered my course in life while I was planning to take care of a baby. Her parents forbade her from seeing me, she was young, afraid of them and afraid to be on her own. So we met up for nearly 1.5 years in secret. Until of course she got caught. Was going to happen. I kick myself every day for not simply knocking on her parents door and explaining myself-that I was not this asshole out to hurt her. We had been friends for so many years at this point. Something crappy happened, but my intentions were always pure. When she got caught, her parents told her out on the streets, or drop me. She dropped me. It wasn't easy for her. But she did. I don't blame her, she was 2 years younger than me and her parents...wouldn't have made life easy any other way. I moved on, as best I could. Found a great girl. dated her for nearly 6 years. Lived together for 5. All the while, Kiara and I talked. As friends...sometimes, maybe a little bit emotionally more. She wanted to meet up over those years ""for closure"" I declined every time. I was afraid, so afraid because I knew in my heart if I saw her. I would cheat on my gf. So I stayed friends from a far. My gf knew we talked rarely, and I kept it platonic. I was 100% honest while I was with my gf, whitney, but kiara and I stayed best friends if removed from space. Every now and again, id find myself missing kiara to the point of it affecting my relationship with Whitney. So, I would remove myself from her. Ignore on facebook...until that irrational bit went away.
4 months ago, whitney left me for unrelated reasons. I was a wreck the day of, and....i of course told Kiara. By some cosmic joke, she was only miles away. She met up with me for dinner, to try to cheer me up. I agreed because, well, I knew that she knew me more than anyone in the world. And maybe some closure was what I needed finally. 

We had dinner, walked around. Good friends. She came back to my apartment, hung out with our old friendgroup. It was great. We always had a huge friendgroup, and when she left me her parents also cut her off from ALL of her old friends. She wasn't allowed any of us. We had sex. And we both realized that over the years and relationships nothing had changed. We were still just as close, just as intimate. And its here where we reach the point where she can be damned, and I can be called an utter asshole. She has a boyfriend. I avoided this for years, because I knew, I would cheat on whittney if I saw her. She thought time had removed our connection. Clearly it did not. I don't condone it, despite being part of it. But I understand it because I know I would have done the same thing. 

That was 3 months ago, and we've continued meeting up. We're back to where we were. She plans to leave her BF once she finishes her last few college classes. Her parents are paying for it, and she worries if she got back with me, they'd just cut the funding. It isn't right. Im not looking for moral right or wrongs. Years ago, I wanted to meet up with her father. She wouldn't let me. Her and I are now trying to arrange a way for me to ""Accidentally"" meet her father in public...so that I can begin to show myself as decent. A part of me just wants to walk to her parents house with her, and knock on their door and just brazenly tell them the whole, damn truth. She doesn't want to. Thinks it would end with me getting shot and her being forced out of college when her parents kick her to the curb. I want to fix this old wound.

I know shes morally wrong for cheating, and I am an asshole for being complicit. But this story has spanned 8 years, and it needs its resolution. How do we confront a father who hates me and convince him I am NOT out to hurt his daughter, and that we have only been the best of friends for nearly a decade? Random ""Accidental"" meet up? A letter of apology? Or is the best course just her biting the bullet and us showing up at her parents or her taking them out to a nice dinner where im there.

293,"I feel like I am alone, my father forces me into too much mental workload. He is an capitalistic workaholic. I want to keep up my three things in life: Tennis, Friends and School. My father forces me to work even though I don’t want to because there is no point. I will get into debt anyway, how hard I work, it won’t make i difference for the future because I work for minimum wage ( I am 17 years old). Because of the huge load of schoolwork and the working hours I have to make Tennis and Friends are let down. I have to get through this year in school, so working less on school isn’t an option. How can I handle this period the best?",03Dec2017,1
294,"Hey guys, I posted this to /r/careerguidance earlier today in the hopes somebody would respond, nobody did :( so thats why im here. I really don't know what to do and need to see what others think. 

For reference, fidelity is a big company that is a stock brokerage, retirement, market trading, some banking stuff, basically financial stuff. 

So basically I have been working at target for the past 3 years, about 1 and a half years in the pizza hut part in the front and then the other 1 and a half in electronics. I am currently attending community college for an associates in accounting which I would like to transfer over to a university and get my bachelors. My mom works at fidelity and said her department is hiring and needs a lot of people and told me that her manager said to send my resume if I was interested. The Fidelity pos is Financial Service Associate and would get my foot through the door a little with experience in the financial world. My only problem I would like to continue my education.

This is where it gets kinda hairy, unfortunately because I am most likely going to fail accounting. Because I have to much target work, I changed my availability before the semester started but when I went to change it again it got denied because we are in the holiday season, and not enough time for to do accounting work, squeezing by just fine with my online business class and English, and I took a Credit By Exam test for my computer class so I don't need to take that. I would like to retake accounting in this upcoming semester as they won't need me as much post Christmas. But if I want to retake it I can't work at fidelity because it would be a full time position and the accounting class doesn't have an online classroom option whereas all the other ones for this semester do.

The fidelity position starts January 22nd. Before all this my plan was to apply and hopefully work at one of the banks in my area for the summer to gain some experience that way but this kinda changes everything. I could take some of the classes online since I wouldn't need to be at the school and work at fidelity, assuming I got the position but im not to sure on what to do.

Edit: idk if it matters but I graduated hs in 2016 and started college in fall 2017, took a gap year and saved up money for college.",03Dec2017,1
295,"A few months ago I started following a mostly vegan diet and find that it works for me. 

My mom has family dinner at her house every single Sunday and pays no mind to this. I have explained it’s easy to accommodate (ie cooking veggies in olive oil vs butter, leaving the bacon out of my salad etc) but she continues to cook things that I can’t eat. Ie today she’s making a pot roast - all the veggies stewing in beef fat all day. Last week she made a chicken casserole. I sometimes end up picking out the meat and eating these things to not be the odd one out but I end up with diarrhea and acne for the next few days (LOL), and also feel disappointed in myself. So I decided i am not going to eat the stuff anymore. 

I considered bringing a dish but then I draw more attention to myself and my siblings give me a ton of crap. I would rather just eat what everyone else eats - it would be so easy for my mom to do a vegan side and she doesn’t. I should mention that my brother in law refuses to eat onions and my mom always makes a separate dish for him whenever there’s onions in anything!! But she won’t make a few tweaks for me, her daughter! 

Sigh - first world problems but it still hurts my feelings coming from my mom. I see this both ways - on one hand my diet is MY choice and I can always bring separate food and have my own meal (which makes me feel a bit of an alien). I shouldn’t expect a host to accommodate me - that’s what my family says. On the other hand if roles were reversed and I was the one having family dinner i would have NO problem altering one or two of the side dishes so a family member could eat. I would want to accommodate that person - I would be happy to.

I guess it hurts my feelings my mom doesn’t give a rats behind about accommodating ME just as I would do for ANYONE in my family.

What are your thoughts on this? How should I proceed?",03Dec2017,0
