1,I've liked him for almost a year now and we recently started hanging out and it's been fantastic. But I dont know how to progress or tell him that I have feelings for him. ,24Sep2017,1

3,"I have a lot of personal problems in my home life so I told this guy I really did like that we can have fun and go on dates, but I do need to focus on myself. We ended up getting really close and dating for about 2 months and he was honestly amazing but my problems at home were getting worse. My mother is heroine addict and none of my family was responding when I asked them for advise. Also everything was moving so fast with this guy I was having dinner with his family almost every night. I think it was everything I needed a break from so I told him I would like to stay with my friend who is my ex in colorado for four days. Before I went I told (lets call him Kyle) this and he distanced himself greatly. I told him that I Have no feelings for this ex (which I don't. its been over for two years. we did go through a lot together our best friend and roommate died when we lived together and his mom died two weeks ago) We both don't really have any family and have always been there for each other even when we don't want to. so I thought this trip would do us some good. He said its okay go, but were done dating or whatever we were doing and that he didn't want to see or talk to me. I told him I would stay and be in a real relationship with him because he is honestly a great person and that I what I wanted. But I was crying hard core and emotional on the phone when I said this which I regret now. I think because of this he refused to talk to me in person. Ive been dumped over the phone and it is super disrespectful to me. I think that is what really what set me off. then he told me well we aren't boyfriend girlfriend ya know? And I said yeah but were friends. I freaked out and said some hurtful and untrue things. I apologized for everything I said, and it's true I am very sorry. I had a lot of stress and lashed out my emotions on him pretty hard. I also wasn't trying to toy with his emotions by not having a relationship but I think he took it that way. I kind feel like I am owed an apology as well. Or am I wrong? I would like to continue to be friends with this guy but it is bugging me that he did kind of dip out on me for a bit there even when I wasn't doing so well.
All of this happened on the phone a week ago. I made him promise to talk to me in person once I got back from Colorado. well, Its been a week and after I apologized he messaged me about it and I'm back and I don't know what to do. I really want things to work out even maybe just as friends. But I feel like he isn't trying to understand me, or are my emotions clouding my judgement?
This whole thing has made me realize I really do like him and I would work hard to maintain a relationship with him if he would let me. But at the same time Im not sure If I am owed an apology and don't want this coming back in the future as an argument even as friends.",24Sep2017,0
6,"Hey everyone,

I am really hoping for advice here because I am just at a complete and utter loss as to what to do. I was homeschooled when I was younger and had a very protective mom so I didn't pick up any friends when I was in school up until college where I found two best friends who I care for dearly. After college though I moved away from my friends and now I feel as though I am just stagnating in relationships. I have no girlfriend and no real idea how to meet new people, new friends, especially in my town which is mostly populated by older couples. 

Does anyone have any advice? What to do and where/how I could meet people? I'm not exactly lonely (two best friends help immensely with that), but I feel like I am growing older and quickly reaching that point where I'd be unable to find anyone. I dont know, I feel like there should be an obvious answer to this, but I am just so completely clueless on how to meet more people...",24Sep2017,1

8,"Hey folks, 

I won't go into too much detail, but long story short:

Met an amazing person, we had a really great connection. I'm fairly certain we had yuuuge feelings for each other. 

Has since (very recently) cut me completely out of their life with absolutely zero explanation. No thoughts. No feelings. No why. No conversation. No excuses. No discussion. No questions. I have absolutely no understanding of the reasoning.

Now... I *DO* understand that she has her reasons. Maybe they aren't any of my business. However, I would think that being so emotionally involved with someone doesn't really justify treating someone that way. Maybe I'm being irrational? 

I need advice on how to just... Be okay? Move on? Justify anything? Forget? 

I just don't know what to do.",24Sep2017,1
9,"Someone recently sent pictures to my cousin. I took these pictures for my ex-boyfriend. I confronted him and he denied it came from him. The pictures were taken almost 8 years ago. I trust my ex that it didn't come from him. 1. Because I have the snapchat name that sent these photos, and it is not his. 2. Because he doesn't have the computer anymore, which is confirmed by a good friend of mine. and 3. Because he didn't share them after we broke up, why would he share it after 6 years of not talking? 

I'm not sure who I can report this to, or how to get this person to stop. ",24Sep2017,1

Now my stomach is more visible through my shirts that weren't before. I want to lose weight but it has been a struggle. I tell myself that I'm going to try and after a couple of days, I lose motivation. It's because in my mind I know it's not a fast transformation and it takes time, but I expect it to happen quick.

13,"Obviously I literally know how, but I don't know what to say.

Long story short, she was my best friend from kindergarten to junior year of high school.  She ended up getting a boyfriend who I didn't see eye to eye with because he made a point to change her - she stopped being a vegetarian because he wasn't a vegetarian, she converted to his religion and political beliefs, etc.  I knew it was shitty so I confronted him, and he ended up sending me verbally abusive emails and harassing me over the internet, dissolving to the point of making a rude Urban Dictionary definition under my name.  I told her point blank it was me or him, and you know how it goes.

It's now about 7 years later, and about a year ago she sent me a friend request on Facebook, which I accepted.  She very recently married said boyfriend, but because she sent me the friend request I feel like we've all grown up enough to move past it.  I want to reconnect with her, but I don't know what to say.  Do I apologize for the sake of progress, even though I feel like it wasn't my fault?  It breaks my heart every time that I think of it that I don't speak to someone who was the sister I never had growing up.  ",24Sep2017,3
14,"This is gonna get long, but please listen. I feel so alone.

Backstory: I moved to this state when I was 17. I went to a high school here for just a year and a couple months. By the time everyone had cliques and their group of friends. I had made about 5 but nothing too serious. One of them I hung out with a lot, because I was lonely, and I know she thought we were close friends but I felt we had nothing in common. She was very nice though, and I enjoyed being together.

Fast forward, now I'm off to college at a local community college. All the people I talked to in HS go off to college hours away. Two I talked to go to the same CC. They become BFFS and act like I don't exist. Don't talk to me, or anything. I know I did nothing wrong. I had a very difficult time making friends at school. I talked to a few people, but it was never more than talking in class. I'm extremely shy and have had terrible social anxiety since I was a child. Those two don't mix well. I got involved in a very manipulative relationship for about 4 months where I felt trapped and was abused. I couldn't face going to school out of complete fear of him and I was terrified walking to class, being in class, and so on. I left and now do college online.

I worked somewhere where I got along well with people but found out some were talking shit behind my back. They knew nothing personal about me, and it just really pissed me off. I hated the job but I stayed because it payed well for a beginning job. I quit in May due to being extremely ill (hospitalized) and since haven't been able to find a job. I have been on a ton of interviews too. 

My friends from where I lived before basically disowned me, I heard from 2 since I left and the others stopped replying to my texts. 

I have a boyfriend but we aren't doing well. Getting in fights constantly, he always ignores me, and never wants to see me. We keep clashing and don't seem to want the same in life. I keep holding on to him because I have no one else, and same for him.

It's to the point where I cry at night because I'm so fucking lonely. I can't stand it. And the advice I always get is ""go out and say Hi to someone! it's not hard!""... When you have social anxiety that causes you to shake and get nervous saying even a simple hello to someone, and you know i have that issue, is so rude. There's no meetups here, not many things for young people (I'm 20) to do. I just don't know. I'm so depressed and so lonely I feel insane.",24Sep2017,64
16,"My bf(28 M) and I(22 M) have not been on much of good terms for the past week. We have also been dating for three months. So it all starts with my friends and my marijuana habit, which he does not like. Every time my friends decide to call me they either want to hangout and smoke or they just need a favor from me, which I normally do for them depending on what that favor may be. He doesn’t like the fact that I smoke/purchase weed and at the same time I’m trying to find a job(because I’m unemployed), so he knows that’s not helping at all. He also does not like the fact that I am quick to answer my friends’ phone calls and do favors for them, smoke with them, or just go out with them and hang. He claims that I will ditch him just to go hangout with my friends or to smoke pot. For example, last Saturday I invited him over to my house when my parents were out of town and we hung out for a few hours that afternoon-evening. My friend texted me while we were relaxing that night asking me if I wanted to chill and smoke tonight? I said yeah, and then I proceeded to tell my boyfriend and he calmly said “No I don’t want you to go hangout with your friends because the plan was for us to hangout all night.” I told him that I was only going for a few hours and that he could hangout at my house in the meantime. He then refused to wait at my house, walked out my door, walked to his car and went home. He then completely ignored me for the rest of the weekend, I then went to his house to go see how he was, and I saw that he had downloaded a hook up app(Jack’d) in his phone, had a profile, and was having conversations with other people. I deleted it and confronted him. We talked about the entire situation and made up a day or two later. 
Now, a similar situation has happened this weekend. Instead of me going  somewhere with him, I stayed home and ended up taking a friend to a job interview, who needed a ride, that same afternoon and he did not like that. We needed up fighting that same night. He told me that he didn’t want anything to do with me and he told me to leave his house, but I didn’t and ended up sleeping over in the same bed. But today, things are a little better... We talked it out for a bit in the morning, but he is still upset, the hook up app(Jack’d), has been redownloaded, and he is now actually pursuing hook ups and random sexual encounters. I told him how much that hurt me, but his response was “Good. I hope you see how it feels when you decide to choose your friends and weed over me. We will remain friends with benefits until you actually learn how I felt.” He admitted that he hooked up with someone the previous night while I was out with my friends and claims he will do it again even when I’m around. I want to know what to do and should I try and save our relationship. This has been stressing me out for the last day. 
TLDR: My boyfriend says I put my friends and my marijuana habit as a priority over him. He downgraded our relationship to friends with benefits and is now going out and downloading hook up apps so he can find people to hook up with. That’s his way of showing me how I hurt him, because I don’t like him downloading these apps and having random hookups. ",24Sep2017,1
17,"21 Male and I was hoping that someone could maybe point me in a direction to figure out this. I've definitely been depressed the last year or so (I think I'm coming out of it possibly the last month or so?) but one thing that's stuck is I went from never being able to sleep, yet I could function. But NOW I usually do get appropriate amounts of sleep yet I find myself tired all day. So tired that doing homework and studying is becoming near impossible. It's taking me half a day to do an assignment I usually could get done in like 2 hours. I've always had issues focusing but now I'm just a zombie almost. My doctor just said More exercise and healthy eating which I've done but I'm still just tired all the time. I try coffee, caffeine, everything people have recommended but I'm just so tired.

34,"So I was volunteering at a race today and met a girl that I found attractive. She was pretty shy and was with her friends (she also talked to another man, unfamiliar to her, and I didn't know if he was hitting on her). I kept telling myself to talk to her, but I just didn't have the balls to do it. I just stayed with my friends and looked to see if she was ever looking at me. It seemed like she was looking towards my direction quite often, but I don't know if it was directly towards me. (most likely not my friends, they aren't the attractive type, not to say I'm the most attractive either). I had a few interactions with her, by working on getting water for runners, but other than that there wasn't much small talk. At the end we all left and I kept kicking myself in the head, wondering why I didn't ask her more questions, or for her number.

The only thing I got about her was her name and school. Now, being from a state that doesn't have too many people in the school system, I was able to find her social media by looking at who everyone follows (I have absolutely no relation to anyone she would know). My question is, do I send her a message saying ""I was at the race yesterday and (I don't know what else, I'm terrible at this)"" or should I have a friend message her and say ""I was at the race yesterday with my friend ""my name"" and he said he really liked you, so I thought let you know"" (see what she responds with and then give my social media) or should I just forget about it and hope I see her again.

The funny part is that he talks to friends and family members. Fortunately we didn't get in a fight or anything before that. For the past year and a half I been giving him his space and waiting until he speaks to me again. 

He still says hi and bye. And says something once in a blue moon but never tries making conversation. So I don't think he has anything against me.

38,"Hey everyone, I’ve been meaning to get this off my chest for a fair while now, I’ve tried talking to psychologists and speaking to friends, but I feel generally it’s hard to understand unless you’ve gone through it yourself.

So let me start from the beginning. 

Age 6 - 8: parents got a divorce, typical stuck in the middle. Either parent wanted me in their custody, was manipulated by both. Ultimately ended up with my lovely mother. Not a real issue but does play a role in my mind.
Age 8 - 16: was bullied a lot at school, typical exclusions, name calling, brushed that stuff off though. 
Age 9 - 12: molested by a family friend. Didn’t know any better made me question my sexuality and still does make me at times. I’m pretty sure I’ve mentally blocked majority of it out, but it still haunts me. 
Age 14  - 16: became dependant on weed, more a phase I guess, but due to this, as the years went on, I slowly lost more and more friends, which I attribute to my lack of keeping people around long. 
16 - present: suffered depression and OCD, was worse at the start, but managed to maintain it quite well for a while. But I can feel it crawling back. 
Age 17 - present: found my beautiful partner whom I’m now having a child with, which is scaring me a lot. But I assume it’s typical. 

As for advice, how do I deal with my early life, it’s so hard to speak about it to anyone, I’ve seen councellors, psychologists, psychiatrists, you name it. Every time I want to, I just get a mental barricade thrown up and I can’t progress.

41,"So the guy isn't a *bad* person. Hes done charity work, he would give you his shirt off his back if he thought you needed it. However he is really fucking high on the disagree-ability scale.

I suspect he has Aspergers syndrome. It started with me thinking he had antisocial personality disorder but he doesn't meet the bill. Everyone who I know who also knows him thinks hes a really good guy with a couple of problems. He meets the criteria for Asperger almost 100%. I've worked with people with Asperger and have a degree in psych (and the guy meets the checklist) and I *seriously* doubt he doesn't. Even if he has it though it doesn't explain all of it.

First he screams and argues with friends and you can't predict it. Tells people to fuck off and shut the fuck up a lot, and says it in the most hateful voice he can muster. No one really knows why he does. Honestly the guys led a good life. Typically after saying something really angry/hateful he will (depending on whats going on) leave, quit playing games (online), or go to bed at his house or ask everyone to leave.

Now granted its not angry all the time but he goes on doing it for a few weeks, then goes back to normal. Typically he binge drinks, sobers up, then tries to get off of alcohol when hes the biggest dick.

The only indicator he will be like that is if hes sober. The guy drinks a lot and is a functional alcoholic who self admittedly suffers from depression.

He won't seek help for clarity. We've tried to get him help and he won't go.

I asked him today if it's an issue he's had before and he said no, so it has to be something with me. But sex just doesn't feel good. It doesn't really feel bad though either. It's just kinda neutral.

46,"by the way we are not dating. She lives just over two hours away and invited me to go to her homecoming, I accepted and the dance went good and afterwords we went back to her house because i asked if i could meet the pigs her family raises/sells (and she really likes pigs). I bought her a cute stuffed animal of a pig and after i met her pigs i gave it to her. She seemed to really like it and we talked in her driveway for almost an hour, we could have talked for longer but it was late and i had a long drive ahead of me so i went home.

Anyway, she didnt post the picture of us at homecoming (she posted like two pics of her and her band friends before the homecoming game and usually posts a lot of pictures of her and her friends like randomly. But after I left she posted a picture of the stuffed animal on her story and said like ""this pig is the GOAT, thanks u/squaderino6 *blushing emoji*"" so i screenshoted it and swiped up on it and chated the other blushing emoji that she didnt use and she saved it in the chat. Sometimes i re watch stories when im bored and and I watched hers but the pig picture was gone (this was at like 8:30pm and the pic was posted at like 12:30 am so I have no clue when she deleted it). I met a lot of her friends at homecoming and I feel like I made a good inpression, like I made them laugh and stuff so I dont think her friends who are girls had anything to do with it.

ALSO, this probably isnt relevent but at the dance one of her friends puller her away and pointed at me and asked something and my date noded no really hard, and when i asked what she asked my date said like ""oh nothing"" then when i asked what she asked about me my date said like ""dobt worry about it, but it wasnt bad"" and that made me super anxious as well, but im really good at hiding it so im 100% sure she didnt know how anxious I really was.

Anyways, basically I lived on campus for five years at a small private school. For the first couple years I had a small group of friends that I met in the dorms, we were tight at first, but they started to bully and tease me over time. It started out really minor but by the second half of my second year it got pretty major and we were straight-up feuding with each other pretty much (admittedly I was at fault for some of this, and I completely admit that I screwed up). I ended up cutting ties with those people and started living in a single apartment by myself. Then from my third-fifth years I lived in an on-campus single apartment by myself. I joined a club for a subject I was interested in, I had a lot of fun doing things but the people in there seemed to find me obnoxious (and admittedly they may have had a point there) and never wanted to hang out with me outside of the club. I decided to stop participating as much in my fourth year because of this. No one in my classes ever seemed to want to talk to me because they were already talking to friends they made in clubs/dorms. Also, I found that I didn't really mesh with the culture on campus at all; the vast majority of the student body consisted of rich white people with active social lives and normative hobbies, which just isn't really my crowd. Whenever I did get to talk to people, I found that they were typically either huge academic overachievers who participated in several clubs and overloaded themselves on units whenever they could and never had any free time, or they were huge partiers who just went out and got wasted every night. I never felt like I had anything in common with anyone, since I never did either of those things (I like to just have a light schedule and be able to focus in on my few classes heavily, and I don't drink/do drugs/party). 

So basically, my point is.....what do I even DO from here? My main fear is just that I'll spent the rest of my life with no friends but my parents and the last time I'll have ever had a fulfilling social life was high school. Should I try and be more sociable when work starts up? Do something else? Just immerse myself in my hobbies and work and find my own enjoyment in life? What do most young adults my age do socially anyways? Also worth mentioning that I live with my parents now and plan on doing so until I'm in my 30s. ",24Sep2017,3
48,"Community College anyway. Social events and clubs are almost non-existent and the ones that do exist barely have any retention or very few dedicated members. I understand that everyone in CC actually have lives and bills to pay, I do too. I go to school in the morning and work until 10 for half of the week, but holy shit my life has become sort of desolate. I have a few friends I still talk to but I almost never see them. I did have a girlfriend at one point but she was my HS sweetheart so that fell apart soon after I graduated.

Sometimes I really want to be with someone or meet some new people, but I have no clue how to even begin going about that. I contact some old friends occasionally, but nothing ever comes to fruition. I tried dating or chat apps from time to time but I only ever get bots of people with very different intentions. I tried joining some clubs at my college but now I work so I can't keep up with them as much as I'd love to.

Nothing serious, I'd just love to know how I could go about meeting people. Is there anything I don't know that everyone else does? How have you met people and mingled or such? Thanks!",24Sep2017,7

We both laughed and then we kissed like 4 more times before i thought i heard something, so we went back. I am 14, and i never realized until now that i didn’t know how to kiss.

52,"Hi all! I just graduated in May with a BS in Kinesiology. I currently work as a behavior therapist full time. I wanted to go get my masters in occupational therapy (which is why I was a kinesiology major), but working as a behavior therapist has made me think of perusing a masters in applied behavior analysis (ABA) and becoming a board certified behavior analyst (BCBA). 

Both career paths work with kids with disabilities, but have the option to work with adults if I wished. But I definitely want to work with kids. 

The pay after the masters is pretty similar to each other. 

The only difference is what I'd be doing in my day to day. As a BCBA I'd be writing treatment plans and training therapists (the entry level position in this field) on implementing those treatment plans. Treatment plans are based on skill acquisition (functional communication, learning play skills, learning how to sit at a desk for school, and many cognitive skills as well), as well as reducing problem behaviors that children with developmental disorders might have. Behaviors include aggression, violence, excessive tantrum/crying at older ages, elopement (running away from parents without warning, very dangerous), and so on. As a BCBA I get to supervise therapy sessions with therapists to ensure there is treatment fidelity, and I'd be involved with patients, but I'd have less direct care. I also get to be involved with families of these children as some of them require meetings with their educators at school to help implement a behavior and IEP for them which I really like. It's a holistic approach to it all. While getting my masters I have the option to get paid for my clinical/practicum hours, which is a nice bonus, and the program is about a year-year and a half long.

As an occupational therapist, I'd be doing direct care, and doing assessments/reports as well for those patients. We'd work on activities of daily living that are important for school, as well as addressing sensory issues. During my time shadowing I've seen therapists set up obstacle courses to help with motor planning. Therapists also work on executive functioning, following directions, appropriate play, feeding therapy, and so on. It's also a very holistic approach and different depending on the needs of the particular child. During my masters I wouldn't be paid for clinical hours, and programs are anywhere from two-three years. 

Both allow me the freedom to be creative, and at the end of the day I want to help kids and their families. I'm really lost on what to do. I think I could be equally successful at both. ",24Sep2017,1

54,"Preface: I am a university student studying Computer Science, junior year

I've been having feelings of inferiority over the past year or so. Relative to my peers, who are performing well in classes and scoring great jobs, I'm struggling to even get interviews or passable marks on my work, and I'm unsure what to do.

My solution, for the past year, is to simply work harder and make up for the difference. I put in hours of work into my problem sets, preparation for interviews, etc., so much so that I'm often helping my friends by teaching them the material or guiding them through the solution.

However, it seems this gap is still existent. Though I'm overworking myself every week and pushing myself to take tougher courses and develop myself as a strong, upstanding person, I feel as though I'm being left behind in the dust. I don't know how to deal with these feelings, as quite literally all my other friends are performing so well whereas I'm stuck despite my struggle.

I understand that everyone has their own story and that it is difficult to know how ""perfect"" someone is until you step in their shoes, but I still feel like I'm so stuck in this slot of life and can't get out.

If anyone has any tips or understands this kind of position and can relate, I'd love to hear the responses. Thanks",24Sep2017,1

67,"My friend, who's a girl, that I've known for a long time told me recently that the reason girls seem to not like me is the way I dress. I have to say I don't really agree with her. Now I'm no James Bond kinda looking guy, but I'm not ugly either. Solid 7/10. And she says I dress nerdy, even though I wear the exact same type of clothes the more ""popular guys"" wear. Usually in public I jus wear either jeans or basketball shorts with a tshirt (on special occasions, flannel) . Plus we go to a private school so we wear uniforms, we have very few days out of the year where we wear our regular clothes and normally I just wear jeans and a tshirt. She also said my hair is greased back too much, to where I look like a pedophile. I normally such spike it up and put it to the side a bit, pretty normal for a guy today.

69,"Some background on this guy: I am a JV football player moving onto varsity next year, but I'm not looking forward to it. I play lineman and the coach for line is a complete jerk.

   The story starts a year prior on a separate team in which the same guy coached since the varsity team was 0-6 at the time. The drills he made us do were much more tough than we were used to, which I was fine with considering I was playing to get in shape anyways. But then when we started to do blocking drills and after I missed a couple of my blocks he would start berating me in front of the team, embarrassing me in front of my friends/teammates, one particular time that stood out to me was when I missed a block during a scout drill and he called me the ""the weakest link"" of the starting line (in front of everyone yet again). 

   This year we had a camp in which JV and Varsity were mixed together. We would do a one on one drill where we would try and make it to the inside of the opposing lineman (this was meant to simulate defense v offense). When I was on defense I assumed that means we would have to just find a way past the guy in front of us, so I ran to the outside. Apparently he meant to go the inside so instead of helping me understand the drill he yelled ""you got DESTROYED"", so obviously he hasn't changed over the past year. Luckily the two teams split up so this year I don't have to deal with him.

   I love playing football, it's one of my favorite things to do when I run out on the field and make a tackle or stop a block, but when a coach is consistently berating me I don't have any idea what I can do. I don't want to be seen as a quitter to all my friends who play on the team, what should I do?

TL;DR: Asshole coach has constantly berated me and don't want to deal with him next year, should I quit?

I find myself talking down to myself and remembering things I did wrong, which I then use to justify myself as a subpar person that shouldn't try to connect to others. I used to always have crushes, but nowadays I find myself squashing any burgeoning hints at romantic feelings, telling myself that it would just place undue stress upon the girl to have to deal with my unwanted emotions.

After a round of self-deprecation I feel horribly sad, but end up smothering those feelings until I just feel apathetic. I try to counteract these feelings and the desire to quit trying. I try to get people to go out to bars and socialize, I text friends, I try to be friendly and interesting in my office. After all of it though, my actions feel empty and superficial. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of being a warm person and not truly connecting to anyone. Like I did it all because I'm supposed to, and not because I really wanted to.

An assistant manager trainee has chosen to do this, and it has greatly affected my tip money. Seeing as I make under min wage as a driver, I went from averaging $15 an hour to $8 an hour
I went to him and asked him why he chose me to switch. He said, ""Because you work really hard. You don't complain when we want you to stay longer. You are also cross-trained, so you can jump on make-line if we need it (which means I make pizzas while the other lesser trained opener takes runs). You should take it as a compliment.""

This is not a compliment. This is, I feel, is really selfish and wrong. I am going to go to the general manager and speak to him about this. I have made comments, and he knows that openers don't make good money at all.

I am not sure if I should speak to him in person or write and print out a professional note and do it that way. I also don't know how I should put it.

92,"I don't really know where to begin with this. Today some random number texted me that they were going to track me down using my IP address and ""fuck me up."" I didn't know the number. They called me a racist, told me I had no friends, and said I have a sick mind. Really mean shit, and I had no idea where any of this was coming from. I couldn't think of any recent incident that would cause people to be giving out my number so people could anonymously threaten me. I called the police. They treated it as a hoax, so I don't think anything is going to come of it. 

A few hours later, I'm texting someone in my family that practices law about pressing charges on this person who anonymously texted me a threat (I found the facebook profile connected to the phone number). She got back to me that a quick google search on images, and boom, the first thing under my name is some twitter post from a crazy ex girlfriend of mine from two years ago.

A little background... around the summer of 2015, my dog died in my arms, my dad had a stroke, my mother moved out of the country, I worked relentlessly and drank myself to sleep most nights when I got home, and my crush called me too unattractive to date. Needless to say, I was in a very very dark spot. This ex of mine is absolutely insane. Her twitter is full of illegal shit - abusing adderall and smoking weed. She's definitely a trashy person. She failed out of art school, and all her friends are trashy too, from reading her posts. Well, being the outstanding person she is, she pissed me off about the Black Lives Matter movement, and I did not really approve of the things happening in Baltimore. It was embarrassing to see my city up in flames and rioters cutting fire hoses of the firemen trying to put out the blazes. This girl knows I don't like it - so she hits me with the liberal ""oh you're just a white man, you don't deserve an opinion"" which frustrated me to the point where I said something really stupid. I said ""nigger."" Fuck yeah, I was wrong, and I regret it immediately after I sent the text with the word. I can't take it back, even if it was just something stupid said out of frustration. 

She took it and ran. Put screenshots all over facebook and twitter to try and ruin my reputation. I have been harassed by people who used my information she posted to find my number and text me nasty things, like today. If I am being honest, I am so down right now, I am considering just offing myself. The death threat, and then finding the twitter shit with my name on it as a first google result, I just want to give up. Nobody will ever know the context and how depressed and emotionally burnt out I was when I said that stupid shit. Nobody will ever associate this washed up, drug addict with this story - only my name and that word. I get death threats, and I'm sure she would just enjoy it if she knew I am still being harassed because of her. Because of what I said, yet she will never get in trouble, because I said the n-word. It doesn't matter if I receive threats and am humiliated to the point where I want to end my life - she's not in the wrong at all. 

Steps I have taken: the facebook posts were removed two years ago, so she reposted them on twitter. The google image is still the first thing to come up when my name is searched. I have reported the tweets and her twitter account for posting my name and allowing people to send me death threats because she basically handed out my name to hundreds of people.

He's been in and out of jail/shock camp for the last 3 years and he came home this August. Initially he seemed to do fine but he fell in with the same crowd as before and now he's using heroin again. I found him doped up nodding off in his room as he was pissing himself and my mom heard me trying to help him and saw it herself. He swore up and down he'd get clean again but last night I found him in his room acting retarded with a needle on his bed. My parents don't know he went straight back to it, do I breach his trust and tell my parents?",24Sep2017,7

96,"So some history, I was in a relationship with this girl (We'll call her Eliza) for about 4 years. Met at 17 just after high school and it was both of our first long term relationship. But in the end, it broke down because she was insanely jealous, distrustful spiteful and manipulative. She's not entirely to blame though. I made plenty of mistakes myself and I learned a lot about myself as a person because of those mistakes. Now we haven't talked in almost 2 years.

I'm in a fantastic relationship right now, there's no denying. This girl, Sally and I have been dating for about 9 months now and I honestly couldn't be happier. She brightens up my entire world and she understands me better than anyone else. We support each other and love having new experiences together. She's much better for me than Eliza ever was.

And yet, for some reason, I keep wanting to look up Eliza. She's blocked me on Facebook, askfm and instagram so I can't. I almost considered making a fake account to take a look. I don't understand why I want to do this. I don't want her back, she was toxic and I have someone much better in my life now. So why do I care?",24Sep2017,4
97,"Hi everyone, I've been battling a bad habit for most of my life. It's a horrible one, and I can't stop. I have a big issue and I'm deeply ashamed of it, and it's time for me to get help. 

Before there are *any* posts about therapy, please know that isn't an option right now. My very small town doesn't have any decent therapists.

I'm a psychological liar. Growing up, I always got in trouble for it. It was for stupid shit too - putting on deodorant or whatever.  The thing is, the truth was always worse. My parents said the consequences for honesty for something they didn't like to hear was better than lying, but the fact of the matter is that it wasn't. Ever. They always either lied to me or (my mother, in particular)  was *WAY* too honest with me. 

I felt safe in my lies. And I realized my parents lied to their family, work, whomever so frequently (and never got caught)  that I figured I could do it too.  It wad a terrible example. If I told the truth I was judged, manipulated, teased, made fun of. It was horrible. 

Now I lie to my college professors about why I'm late, or to my bf that I didn't spend money on the vending machine to buy a drink. I do lie to my bf a lot.  That I don't read fan fiction (escape tactic) is the biggest one. The other ones are like me walking to class when I should be driving (I desperately need the exercise). 

The worst part of it is is that I still try to justify it. My bf says I should lie to my parents (and given the fact they are giant shit birds, sometimes in a situation this is a must) and one time to a professor to be able to go on a trip with him.  Yes, the trip was worth the guilt I feel.  But this whole trying to figure out when a lie is appropriatebor not is super difficult for me, and doesn't help me try to kick my habit's ass. 

Now I DO feel guilt and shame when I lie, and not just when I get caught, so I know I'm not a total sociopath, and I've gotten so much better about not lying in the past three years wherein my bf has set a good example. 

But I need help. I need to remember not to lie. I'm not still living with my parents. I'm not in that survival mode. Here, with my bf, being honest for once *is* better than lying.  How can I get over this horrible habit so I can just generally stop being a shit person.  ",24Sep2017,8
98,"I'm currently studying chemical engineering, and I have been programming for a few months and have wanted to do study CS for a while now but have been too afraid to make the switch. I really don't enjoy chemical engineering at all - I've done a few internships in the industry and I know I can't see myself doing it long term.  With graduation looming (4 months from now) I realized if I didn't look at my options now I'll regret it. I don't want to look back 20 years from now and think to myself ""what if?"". It's like throwing myself into something I know I don't want to do for the sake of money or security, I am sick of doing that. I have been doing that since I started studying engineering. I have surrounded myself with people that also don't like what they're studying, however, have never wanted to do anything about it. I became like that, I encouraged complaining and whining about what I was studying. 
I have never been more afraid of anything, so I think I'm going to do it. Haha, I guess I had my answer, and just wanted to let this out. Thanks for listening though.",24Sep2017,9

100,"I’m an international student whose native language is not English. I finished high school in my country and it traumatised me a lot because of an incredible amount of work that we had to do, very strict teachers, 8 lessons/ 6 days a week and some other things. Basically, what I’m trying to say is that after all that stress, I became incredibly self-conscious and vulnerable to everything. I’m enjoying studying in a different country, especially in this very friendly environment but there are just situations that happen on a daily basis that can completely ruin my mood for a week or so. And so little things like this just keep piling on and this makes me incredibly depressed.
Quite recently I have started developing very weird symptoms: terrible fatigue, apathy, loss of appetite, itchiness but most importantly — bright-red rash. Of course, as soon as that happened I went to the hospital asking for help. I can’t say that I received any help at all. At first, my doctor kept saying that I look perfectly healthy and that my “rash” is probably a viral infection and, while I’m a bit sick, I’m mostly imagining things, I was prescribed paracetamol and I also had to go through some blood tests which didn’t show any signs of infection. Fast forward to today (~2 weeks later after going to hospital), I still have rash, I’m still itchy, even more depressed than ever, fatigue (I’ve slept for more than 30 hours during the last two days). And, yes, I’ve also been to a psychiatrist once and it didn’t help me at all. I was told that “I’m perfectly normal”, “my weight is acceptable” and other bullshit (I’m more than 15 kg underweight, I don’t think that’s “acceptable”).

Anyway, what I’m trying to say is that I don’t even know where to ask for help. I’m international, alone in this country, barely know anyone, have no friends and is very demotivated by all of that. I tried to go to the hospital but stupid paracetamol is just not helping me.
I have this itchiness that drives me crazy, I’m depressed and underweight but hey, I’m probably just imagining things, right?",24Sep2017,1
101,"**Disclaimer:** I’m writing this from my phone and have fat fingers. So let’s hope auto-correct doesn’t make me look like a fool!

**Second Disclaimer:** No, I am NOT suicidal. Yes, I’ve thought about it in the past, but I will not allow myself to go down that path again.

**Third Disclaimer:** I originally had this posted in /r/depression, but after thinking on it for a while, I felt this would be a better place to get the input I'm needing.

So I’ll start by admitting that this might not be THE subreddit to post this in, but I figured it’d be worth a shot. Next I’d like to admit that fact that I’m not one to really ask for help, so this is honestly hard for me, as it makes me feel weak. But I’ve reached that point that stuff needs to change, within me, so why not ask for help?


Anyways, I’m here to ask the community’s opinion on what steps would best benefit me to help get my life back on track. What would be the best thing for me to do first? What’s the best way to approach my issues? I know I’m going to get the positive feedback, but understand there will also be negative feedback. So please, flame me if you must. Just don’t be so harsh to others and their comment(s).


So let’s hear a little about me. This might be the longest part, so let’s begin.


- as a freshman in high school, I wasn’t quite the coolest kid in school. I should say that high school for me started in 1998, as I’m 33 now. Now I understand that everybody has their own personal issues during high school, but some are able to also overcome those issues, while others are left with lasting scars. slowly raises my hand to the later so freshman year in high school, acne decided it wanted to have a field day on my face. When you got bad acne, a freshman in high school, you get made fun of quite often. I don’t mean quite often as in a couple times a week, it was a daily thing. At the bus stop waiting for the bus, during the bus ride, break in between classes, lunch, you name it. Even during sports (not on the high school team), it happened from teammates as well as opponents. It happens right? Some will say people were just joking, but some jokes scar you. Some jokes lock you up inside and you don’t allow yourself to show emotions. Some jokes push you to take a Razer to your body, and trick you into thinking that watching the blood drip is like watching the pain leave your body. You start wearing your hood up on your sweatshirt, listen to music just to drown out everybody’s comments. If you were made fun of in school, you know the drill. This is where MY depression started, or started to show. With this experience, I learned to dislike people. I wanted all the hurtful people to feel my pain. I wanted them to know what it was like to feel pain like they made me feel. Except, I wasn’t the confrontational type. So I kept it all in and hid what I was feeling. From my parents, the very few friends I had, even my counselors. Nobody knew how much I was hurting inside. To this day, a lot of people still don’t.

- next I’ll bring up the way I was raised. My parents were financially quite stable, as both had government jobs. Now I respect they both raised me the best they knew how, but I also feel they hindered me with things I should have learned growing up. I could do no wrong, I didn’t have to be responsible, I didn’t have to be held accountable for my actions. Cleaning up after myself? Nope. Brushing my teeth? Nope. Did I learn how to cook? Another nope. The things I should have learned to become an adult, as an adolescent, were never instilled in me. So honestly, simply put, I was a spoiled little shit growing up. Now here I am 33 years old, trying to learn how to become an adult. Holy shit, a part of me resents my parents for what I feel they should have taught me, but I’m done putting the blame on others for my actions/irresponsibility.

- would now also be a good time to mention I had ADHD in my youth? Ya, I’m talking let’s give me some Ritalin and help me become a zombie at school. Maybe it was a good thing I took them because it helped me zone out some of what was happening around me. At the same time though, maybe it also helped keep me inner “me” locked inside. Maybe I missed my “golden” time to learn some of the things I needed to. Well, let’s just say that now I’m dealing with this Adult ADHD and it’s a bitch! Biggest way it impacts me now is trying to complete something I start. It’s SOOO easy for me to get bored during a task. So maybe I should do the dishes, instead of my wife doing them ALL the time. Sure, I’ll start the water, get some starting to soak, go have a cig, then completely forget about what doing the dishes. Or how about starting to clean up the house and get distracted by friends wanting to play some games (more on the gaming later)? Hell, I’ve burnt spaghetti due to completely forgetting about it. So honestly, I’ve had a hard time keeping a job. It’s not that I can’t do the job, but I get bored. I don’t feeling like I’m being challenged enough. I’ve tried multiple different industries for work, from working as tech support for computers, sales job for cell phone companies, truck driving in the oil fields and OTR, roofing, banquet employee for a local resort, framer, masonry...I can keep going if you like. Out of all of those, I must say the one I enjoyed the most was the truck driving. It was like there was something different every day. New issues would arise, new routes to take, etc.

- speaking of jobs, it’d be a good time to mention that I have recently learned about a physical issue that has forced me to stop working in the physical labor industry. I’ve always had back pain since I feel at my first job (19yrs old). Worked at a bakery/deli, and while cleaning the floors one night I slipped and fell on my back. Well I was 19, thought I was indestructible and never went to see a Dr. fast forward to a year and a half ago, I FINALLY go see a Dr about my back. Bone spurs in my L4 L5, L5 S1 (if I recall what the Dr said correctly) and arthritis I my lower back. From talking to her she informed me that it was more than likely cause from when I fell at my first job. So heavy lifted has gotten harder and harder for me, even though I’m stubborn and do things I shouldn’t. I was told that I strongly needed to change my career path, away from worrying about my physical strength. Looks like I needed to focus on a behind the desk type job. I can’t stand on my feet for very long, I also can’t sit down for very long either. Sitting at my computer playing games, I look like a hyper 10yr old in church who can’t sit still. Always having to move positions every couple minutes, standing up while I’m dead in a game waiting to respond. Honestly, laying down on my chest and playing/using my laptop has been the most comfortable position for long periods. Taking the pressure of my weight off my lower back, and allowing it to spread out feels so good. My wife doesn’t understand why I can lay down on my back in the parking lot, head on a curb and smoke a cig.

- now let’s talk gaming. We all know how gaming can be SO addicting to some people. I got introduced to gaming on an NES as a child. Loved the hell out of Bionic Commando and Excitebike. Let’s go back to the whole acne subject. With what was going on regarding that, I needed an “escape”. I needed to find some form of joy out of life. Ya I played baseball, I skateboarded (Thanks Rodney Mullen for pumping me up in your skate videos only to remind myself I sucked as soon as I got outside, lol), but in the end, it was video games that gave me a true feeling of excitement. I used gaming as a way out of what was going on around me. A way to have an honest smile on my face after hiding so many tears. This, is where I became addicted. :-/

- maybe one more thing you need to know, is that I don’t know what it’s like to have TRUE friends. I never got invited to parties after school or on the weekends. I never snuck out of the house to meet up with a girlfriend. My best friends are those behind the monitor. The ones that can’t see my faults. The ones that can’t truly hurt me. So I have NO idea how to build and grow friendships.


So here I am, feeling worthless in SO many ways. Father to an amazing son (from previous marriage), married to a woman who I feel isn’t IN love with me anymore, and have no idea how to get my life back on track.


Recently my wife has moved out. She feels that with her moving out, that we will be able to focus on ourselves. I completely understand her reasoning. I don’t resent her at all. I do feel like that the one person who should have been there, is bailing on me to put all the pieces of myself back together alone. I also don’t feel like it’s her job to do that. If I can’t be happy with myself, how can I expect somebody else to be happy with me? I can’t expect her to give me happiness and a sense of self worth. I understand all that, but damn it’s hard feeling alone. Call me selfish, wouldn’t be the first time, but sometimes it’s nice to have somebody hold your hand and want to watch you grow. Be a part of your growth, and offer them support when you fall. Having adult ADHD mixed with Depression is such a bitch! Sometimes I’ll look at the house in it’s disastrous state, decide I’m going to clean this shit up, get overwhelmed after I pile all the dishes up in he sink, say fuck it and have a cig, then completely forget what I was doing and hop on my computer. I have always been that guy that when a room is messy, I know where everything is at, but the moment it’s clean, I have no idea where anything is. Im that guy who when I finally do clean, I get OCD about it. Wife asked me to clean the living room, next thing you know the couch is in the hallway and I’m sweeping and mopping the hole thing. She stares at me and states she just wanted me to pick up the dishes and the trash. Wife asks me to separate laundry, and I’m throwing socks in one pile, whites in another, darks, towels, colors, jeans, long sleeves, short sleeves in their own piles. Oh the look on her face when I was done. All she wanted was darks, lights, and colors.


Now this next “vent” is a bit harder for me, because it’s the one that pisses me off the most. My son. So let’s briefly remind ourselves how addicted I am to games. How I use them as a crutch to get through life. How I can play for 14 hours a day and think nothing of it. Yes, it stuck with me. My son comes over for the weekend, and wants to hang out. “Hey son, how’s it going?” “I missed you” “Want to play some games together here in a little bit?” Said games are Borderlands 2, Minecraft, Rocket League, Creativerse...things we can both play together. He has his own computer and I have mine. So I’ve got him on steam and he’s making friends, we’re playing games together, we have fun. But...whenever we play games together, before it happens, I have to get my “fix”. What I mean is, that I have to play a couple matches with my friends of CSGO (community is toxic AF now than when I first started on Source 10 years ago, btw), an hour of PUBG with my friends, or a couple rounds of Rocket League. Any one of those, or all of them, before I play with him. Ya...talk about me being a selfish asshole father. Really, you can say it, because that’s the number one thing I hate about myself. That I’m so wrapped up in MY games, that I put them before playing WITH my son. Don’t get me wrong, I have no problem throwing my headphones off, taking a ban, pissing my friends off for randomly going afk to help my son with his homework or to help him get something out of the cupboard. But when he wants the quality time WITH me, I’m absent. Jesus, here comes the tears putting this out there now. Just thinking about this hurts. I currently mine Bitcoin with his computer (RX580) and my laptop (GTX1060), and have been buying us games to play together the last couple payouts. I’m wanting to get him games that I regularly enjoy with my friends, so that I can play my favorite games WITH him. He’s 11 yrs old, and with how mature and innocent he still is (Sturgis this year was fun with him, pulled me away from the painted body ladies. Lol) I’m completely comfortable with him getting CSGO and PUBG. CSGO would of course have to be Voice_enable 0 (no voice chat) so that way I can keep him “sheltered” a bit more until he can understand how hurtful some people are and can be. I talked to him today about setting him up on twitch, with a heavily filtered bot to keep his chat clean. I’ve had the talk with him about people he may come across on the internet. After all was said and done, he was excited to soon (hopefully) get some more games and start streaming/making videos. He gave me a big hug and thanked me. To me, that’s what being a parent is about. Warning your child of possible dangers, supporting him with something he wants to do (gaming and streaming) and both have a happy outcome. There is a negative to how much I game with my son though...that’s how much he games. Not just games, but he’s always got an electronic device in his hand. Whether it’s a keyboard and mouse, tablet, or his phone (no service, just WiFi). I try to get him off the computer and do things outside, but he never shows interest in sports. He played baseball a couple years, isn’t willing to try football, doesn’t like camping, doesn’t really show much interest in things other than YouTube and games. Maybe it’s due to the fact I focus on myself instead of opening my eyes to what he wants/needs. I’m unemployed so taking him random places to do things is few and far between. If so, how do I stop being THAT selfish and be the father he needs/wants?


Shit, that was my first question, I think. So maybe it’s about time to wrap this up.


Now I know I’m going to get the response of seeking treatment from a professional. I’m currently trying to get healthcare back so I can go see my Dr again. I’m not avoiding that but damn, the whole “finding the right medication” thing sometimes feels like a never ending battle. “Here, try this med out for the next 3 months and let me know how it’s working” “oh that didn’t work, on well let’s try it again but with another med to possibly counteract a different side effect”...some of that stuff is just too frustrating. Almost feels like it’s never going to be right for me.


So Reddit, where do I begin? Where do I start to figure out who I am, and what I’m good for?


What do you do when you have no willpower and/or motivation to do what you know you need to do? What career is something that would be a good fit for me and my “issues”? I highly enjoy playing around with Google Sketch-Up and designing things, sadly, schooling for architecture and industrial design is out of the question (defaulted loans from when I was young and dumb in my early twenties). What tips/tricks can you give me to help me become a better father, husband, and person?


Maybe another question is who is willing to be my friend? Who is willing to be there beside me to lend a helping hand? Is there anybody out there?


I will try my best to answer questions, but will apologize if I don’t get back to all of you.

104,"Hi so I'm in a pickle.  So to make long story short, I'm being evicted and have until the end of the month to move out (she wants to charge more which is why she found someone else to live here).

Knowing I have very little time, I found a house renting a downstairs studio apartment for about the same price I'm paying now, the problem is he's charging first months rent and for security deposit, x2 months rent.  That's A LOT of money for me....A LOT.  I rushed into it because it IS a nice apartment, but 3 months rent JUST to move in is A LOT OF MONEY so I called him this morning (fyi I signed the lease last night) and left a voicemail giving some excuses as to why I can't accept the apartment (said the sec dep hit my bank too hard and some other excuse).  I've been waiting all day for him to call me back but he hasn't (could be out of town for the weekend or something).  What I was deciding was I was going to cancel my check.  He deposited it into his bank but it's pending so I have time to cancel it.....but.....

I then told myself that if he just gives me back one month rent, I'd feel more safe/secure and happy to move in.  I just feel that $3,300 to move into an apartment is A LOT OF MONEY and it really hit my bank account.  I didn't make the right choice and I signed the lease too quickly.

I'm not sure what to do.  Part of me wants to see if I can find an apartment closer to work and maybe a tad bit cheaper; part of me wants to cancel the check NOW and part of me thinks I should give him until tomorrow to see.  Idk.  It's late and I'm tired and I'm worrying too much about this.  I'm not sure what to do.",24Sep2017,1

First of all, sorry for english, not my native language.

So i am dating this girl since 4-5 months ago. Her birthday is soon and i am thinkg about a gift.

She was talking to me about what she wanna do for her birthday. Told me too that she want to buy a gift to herself, but she told me that the money she has right now doesnt allow her to have it for her birthday, but for later.

I am helping her to find a store where do this chain, so, i sent her a capture of my conversation with the store and she asked me “you didnt tell her to do it, right?” I said no, that i didnt. (I was planning do it lol) so i stopped the process.

So, i was thinking i can buy her this gift for the exact day of her birthday (is a chain with her date of birth in roman numbers) but then i started thinking about, this is maybe a gift she want to buy by herself? So i don’t know if buy it.

Should i do it or not?

106,"Hi there!

I had an uncomfortably moving and powerful experience the other day, and I'd like input from people who aren't my immediate family, for fear I sound like I'm losing my mind.  And, if I *am* losing my mind, I'd at least like that forewarning so I can go to my loved ones with the suggestion of seeking treatment instead of a stream of insanity that would hurt them emotionally.

Let me give some context by some background info, I'm sorry it's rather lengthy, I just want to be thorough, and I promise it ties in.  I'll make a line or something so you can skip to the bottom if you want to read the experience.  Thanks for reading the following in advance!

I'm in my mid thirties, and I don't have a particularly great or grandiose view of myself.

I'm not religious, like at all.  I've just always seen religion as a man made method of manipulation.  I often described my beliefs as ""A belief in mankind"".

I believe all people should be as free as I am.  Life is to be savored and enjoyed.  

I have *great* interest in *religions*, cults, and the like.  I've always been fascinated by how man uses beliefs and fears against himself for benefit.

I have no fear of what comes after death. Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo. I believe the time we have living should be celebrated from moment to moment.

I have ADHD, and have led my life skipping from one passing obsession to the next, seemingly immediately forgetting what came before.

I love every type of art, my interest in mediums cycles with my attention span

I have been drawn to the observation of politics since a young age, I enjoy the complex dance  performed between politicians, people, and policy.  

I consider myself to be empathetic to a fault, but I have also been ruinous to relationships, friends and lovers.  I am very good with people in some ways, but due to having such a rapidly shifting attention span and impulsive nature, I cannot be relied on to maintain communication in any regular fashion, family or friends.  The longest friendship I have maintained is probably like six years, and that is to this day.  I drove off all my childhood and adult friends for a variety of reasons. 


I have always been drawn to technology in every form, being exposed to the computer at a young age, and sharing my formative years with the dawn of internet usage.  

My internet usage began with local dial up bulletin boards, plodded through Prodigy, accelerated with AOL, and then on moving to college, a voluptuous T3 with an ATM backbone, I swear to god, the memories I have of that connection are more vivid than some nights with various lovers.

I have spent literally countless hours on the internet over my life, reading the writings and interactions of other people, getting brief flavors of their thoughts and drives, motivations and ideas.

I spent an inordinate amount of time commenting on the internet, enjoying the variety of beliefs.  I also spend too much time seeking out those that spread misinformation, correcting it where I see it.

When I do write my thoughts, people seem to agree with what I say.  Now, I don't know if that's because the ideas I have are *good*, or that I just know what people like to hear. 

When I speak, people like to listen.  I've been told I have a pleasant voice, and I have many years of speaking to others, by performing or communicating for work.

I have an above average intellect, but I put it to no real tangible use or lasting benefit

I grew up in a wealthy conservative household, consider myself to be extremely liberal, and also consider myself deeply respectful of differing political beliefs, as they are as free as speech and should be respected as such.

I had passable grades in school growing up, exceeding in topics I was interested in, but doing average to poor where I couldn't pay attention. I was never able to push myself to study, do homework, and pay attention in class like everyone else did. 

I dropped out of college, I utterly failed at it.  I was incapable of motivating myself to go to class, doubly so at completing homework or studying.  

I instead spent my time socializing with every person I could.  I was a bit of an outcast in middle and high school, but the newfound freedom and tabula rasa of college was enough to ignite a passion of learning about people.  I became exhaustively outgoing, constantly searching to converse with different people with different life experiences.  I feel I became pretty adept at learning how people interact, in language and emotion.

I became increasingly depressed at not finding meaningful work or life direction due to no education, and turned into what any reasonable person would call an alcoholic.

I have a good solid decade of my life, just about my entire twenties lost to a haze of hangovers and terrible decisions, several of which feel I can never atone for.

I spent much of this time in abject poverty, never making more than fifteen thousand dollars a year.

At my lowest point, my spouse and I met.  We both had a long history of hard relationships, and somehow made the radical decision to just accept each other as we were, and moved in together two days after meeting.

Around this time, I started using cannabis, growing to deeply love and appreciate the calming cerebral effects.  I ceased drinking immediately.

Over the years that followed, I felt myself grow as a person, but I also felt my inner fire temper.  I grew more patient, gained perspective on all the mistakes I made, and came to terms with the fact that *I*, the person, made those mistakes.  I realized that all those mistakes I made were necessary, as they became building blocks for the person I am today, and gave me reflection that I needed to heal and move forward.

I am comfortable with almost every aspect of my life, and have come to terms with the fact that due to my own actions, I will never be remembered for anything positive on this earth. My immediate family will remember and love me, and if I'm lucky, grandchildren.

I'm just a man passing through time, attempting to reach my destination in the most comfortable transportation possible.  I don't want to be a great or powerful man, I just want to be.

Looking inwardly as hard as I can, I think the only ways I feel unfulfilled are in work.  To this day, I have not had a job that I would be proud to tell you. I have never had a career.  I felt I contributed nothing to this earth, other than my wonderful children, and anybody can do that. I lucked my way through life, and still contributed nothing. Despite having political passion, I could never hold office or be in the public eye due to mistakes in my past, no matter how much I have learned from them or how much time has passed, the public would rightly judge me harshly.  

------

I'm so, so sorry for how disjointed the above is, that's how my brain works with memories.  The following should be much more concise, because it involved what happened and my memories going forward.

So, we reach the present. I'm super happy and comfortable in life.  I have everything that I could reasonably ask for. My days are a pleasant haze of parenting, reading and writing ideas and opinions on the internet, indulging in art, music, video games, and gardening.  

I was a little toasty from vaping a bit earlier, and I was in the mood to clean the house up a little.   I went upstairs, and saw that our dog had shit on the carpet, like all over in four locations, the fucker.   I went into the bathroom, grabbed a handful of toilet paper, and picked up as much of the shit as I could at once, managing about three of the four piles.

I was a little irritated while I was doing this, I was upset at the amount of propaganda being spread on my web site of choice, and was trying to figure out how to combat such an onslaught.

I walked back into the bathroom, dropped the shit in the toilet, and kept the toilet paper so I could pick up the rest of the shit.  I looked at the shit in the toilet for a second, turned around, and began to walk out of the bathroom.  

Instantly, something exploded in my brain, and I fell to my knees, sobbing with incredible intensity.  I was **absolutely, completely, and overwhelmingly** filled with the most beautiful feeling of gratitude and joy.   It felt like a spark of electricity that started at my forehead and raced out as a shock wave over the rest of my brain.  Suddenly every interest I ever had made sense as a whole.  I felt connections between everything I've ever done appear, and suddenly I knew that all the idle interests I had leading up until this moment weren't just for in passing.  All that time that I thought I wasted though my life suddenly appeared to be time well spent, and I sobbed uncontrollably at the gift of that revelation.  Even writing this now, I have tears streaming down my face, because I'm so thankful for this gift of purpose. With all this new perspective, I could suddenly see what I needed to do with my life, I knew why I lived my life the way I did, I had the most pure feeling of validation that none of my time on this earth was wasted at all.  

I knew exactly what I needed to do, saw how my talents, passions, and interests in life assisted in furthering that goal, and saw how my mistakes turned me towards what I needed to learn to refine myself.  But the thing is, the thing I need to do sounds fucking *out there*, so I'm afraid to tell anyone what I felt.

Ever since this happened, I have felt compelled to create.  I feel like there's something inside me that I need to rip out, and only when I do, I can rest.  I've shown new interest in other topics where I had no interest before, suddenly searching out philosophers, because I need to know more philosophy, **right now**, because it's **important**. Where once I had no appreciation for philosophy, having read none, I found myself reading John Locke's Two Treatises of Civil Government, laughing with delight at the revelation that this was a historical record of what I did daily.  Locke quoted wrong or misleading statements, and described in scathing wit why they were ridiculous.  Suddenly I understand the importance of philosophy, and the importance of these ideas, and the importance of spreading correct information.

(deep breath)

I am so incredibly, indescribably, so *purely* grateful.  I'm shaking with energy and purpose. If only everyone on this earth could feel such earth shattering, such *root* level validation.  I'm so afraid that this gift is mental illness for two reasons

1.  That means I'm crazy

2.  That means only crazy people can feel this, and sane people will never know this beauty.

107,"I'm a young guy in my mid twenties. I was working as a software engineer for a big defense contractor for 3 years when my manager up and left. I really looked up to him and was super disappointed, I started looking for a new job myself shortly afterwards but I wasn't hell-bent on leaving unless it was a great opportunity. 

About 1 month later he calls me up about joining him at a small start-up for a 50% pay raise and the opportunity to work with some new technology, as well as the chance to wok remote whenever. The defense contractor made an attempt to keep me with an offer of a 20% salary raise and a bonus that would pay out in 1 year, so about 30-35% total raise to stay put. It was a really hard decision but I ended up accepting my old managers offer at this startup, despite being warned from a few colleagues that the people in charge were dicks, basically. 

It has been about 2 months at this new job and I'm not having much fun so far. The work that I was promised has not been exciting. The CEO has a tech background so he's meddling with my managers decision-making. My manager told me he had absolute power over design/tech decisions which had turned out to be false. The people here are also pretty shady, 2 people have been fired for petty reasons since I started. The whole company is composed of 20 people and the majority of the development team is scattered across the globe working remotely so it's been very boring for me as I've learned that i really did enjoy interpersonal communication and collaboration that I experienced at my last job.

My boss really pumped me up to the CEO and everyone over here, I know that if I leave so soon it would look tremendously bad for him. But at the same time I'm unable to perform my work to the best of my ability because of my unhapiness. 

I hold a pretty high level security clearance and I'm pretty good at what i do, so I know I could find another job pretty easily. Before I left the defense contractor, I was told I could come back anytime as I was pretty beloved and did excellent work. I was on a management path ( or at least that's what i was told ). The big-wigs at this defense contractor were pretty dissapointed that my old manager poached me and a few other good employees.

What would you suggest I do? Does anyone have any experience going back to an old job after making a bad decision? Should I even bother calling my old job or should I just move on? Were you able to get a bigger salary the second time around? Do you think my manager will understand or will the bridge be burnt? ",24Sep2017,5

111,"Hi, I am 21, in university, second year. I am getting increasingly impatient with my classmates and most people around me. I get irritated in class when we move slowly, I get irritated when my classmates can't shut up and disturb the class. I get irritated when people can't keep up. Yes I understand that not everybody will be a good programmer or whatever but seriously, it's a lot easier to understand the class if you shut up and if you don't spend most of your time going out , chilling and writing some code.

I am get irritated by relatives that can't respect my time and my space. I get irritated by almost everything that doesn't let me study or doesn't let me do my job ( I am also working as a programmer in an institution ). 

Very few people understand that I don't like to be disturbed for meaningless reasons and all I want is some space and some silence to do my stuff. 

I have tried to assert to said people that I don't like to be disturbed or touched when I am working with my headphones on because getting back in the zone is really taxing mentally and to my time.

I am really stressed, I love what I do, I love my profession and I love my job and the degree I am getting. I just can't cope with so many external factors slowing down my progress this results to me getting irritated and becoming mean to said people. What can I do, to not get irritated?",24Sep2017,4

118,"I had to choose Fine Art in school because I need a C or higher in Art in order to do Graphic Design in college. I enjoy Graphic Design but I hate Fine Art, are they the same or similar? 

Because in my school, they also do Graphic Design, and so I chose that too for one of my subjects. So now I'm doing both Fine Art (which is required if I want to do Graphic Design in college) and Graphic Design.

In my Design class, to me, in my opinion, it's almost a completely different thing. It seems to focus more on the target audience, logos used, characteristics a cartoon could have, etc as opposed to Fine Art where you really begin to focus on certain movements that were prevalent during a certain time. It also seems to focus on detail, and paint. Fucking paint, I hate paint.... Acrylic is my worst nightmare.

120,"Ok so I kind of have been infatuated with my boss for the past few months. Like I have a serious crush on her. I don't want to get into a relationship with her or anything like that, because I know that's not realistic, but... I do wanna be her friend. She always says hi to me when she sees me around at work, I make her laugh a lot. She's paid me plenty of compliments and that's been nice. I do receive compliments from women but she's given me more than what I'm used to. I guess you could say we are friends, at least at work. I just don't like how she's been sending me mixed signals. It's just made things so confusing for me. I tried to contact her on Facebook, and, well... I got ignored. I know if you're not friends with someone and send them a message, there's a good chance it will end up in their filtered messages/message requests. I sent her a friend request and it just sat there for a few days so I just cancelled it. I just don't know what to think, because when I see her around at work, she always seems delighted to see me and will come up to me and talk to me when she can. Now it's just like I can't stop thinking about what she really thinks of me. She's added plenty of people from work, one of them is even on the same team as me and he's only 19 (she's 28). Part of me thinks she has no idea I even sent the messages. But the friend request, I think she just straight up ignored that. Now it's just so awkward for me. I can barely talk to her. I know it's just a friend request and whatnot, but it just makes me feel like maybe she's putting on an act around me. On the other hand, I get the sense she genuinely likes me, always says hi to me, really finds me amusing, ya know, compliments me, etc. I just can't figure this woman out! I hate when women do this. It just confuses the fuck outta me. I also get the sense maybe she knew I had a crush on her, so she is keeping me at arms length due to the fact she's my boss and there's legal reasons at play so things aren't so simple. What's something I could do to resolve all these mixed signals? Like what's a way I could gauge where I stand with her without making things even more awkward?",24Sep2017,3
121,"I've always had groups of friends. I'd hang out with them, get really embedded into the group, make best friends I could have kept for life, etc. But after a year, or two years or whatever, I distance myself and eventually leave.

I still remember every group of friends I have, and I've got keepsakes from all of them that are important to me. Sometimes I go crawling back to the friend groups and they always take me back. Sometimes I only hang out for a day or something before leaving forever again, once or twice it was a year.

I tell myself every time I make a new group of friends I won't do it, but it seems like an inevitability. I've just done it again with a group of friends I've had for two years, they've seen me through some terrible times in my life and always been lovely. I've pulled away from the larger group but I'm finding it hard to break off with the person I was closest to, she and I have spoken for hours and hours every day for the last 2 years, she's been my only best friend for a long time now.

I'm convinced it'll be better for them all. I don't get on with one person in the group super well, it's a one sided thing cause he doesn't really dislike me. Me and my closest friend fight about it sometimes cause she's good friends with both of us. I don't have a lot in common with the group, and every time that one person is involved in something I kind of don't want to be involved. I feel bad because he's been apologetic but he kinda doesn't have anything to apologise for. I get on really well with everyone else.

Without me around the group doesn't have to shoehorn me into activities, they say they don't have to but I always feel like the odd one out. Without me there I won't end up fighting with my best friend about our mutual friend, which invariably spills out to our other mutual friends who have to deal with the fallout of the fight. I'm convinced this will be better for them all, but they're taking it kind of hard and I don't know what to do. 

I also don't know why I do this, but it is something I can't stop myself from doing. I don't set out to make a group of friends and then dump them, it just always happens like this. My friend and I fought about the mutual friend and I kinda just, left. I'm sure they'll be happier without me, but I don't want to go. We did a lot of really fun stuff together and I'm going to miss all that and them. But I'm sure it'll be better for them like this.

I don't know what to do. Should I cut them all off completely, should I just keep in contact with one or two, should I just go limping back after causing all this trouble? Am I the only one that does this or do other people do the same thing? Is there someone out there that used to do this and found a way to stop?

124,"I've recently come to the realisation that I've been repeating the same pattern ever since I've moved out of my parents house at 18. At first I moved to another city in my home country to attend university but since graduating I have moved from and to several countries in the EU. Whenever I move to a new place I feel like I'm on top of the world because of all the new possibilities. Making new friends, new relationships, performing new jobs, experiencing different cultures and so on. This has left me with a wealth of experiences I wouldn't trade for the world. However, this feeling always fades away after a while, whether it's after 6 months, a year or several years. My friends will leave for a different place, a relationship ends or I no longer enjoy my job. This usually ends up with me getting depressed and moving to a different country to repeat the whole process again. 



I'm currently at the end of my stay in yet another country and am now looking into moving to Australia or New Zealand. However, after having assessed my past decisions I know that this is going to be the same story all over again. I'll feel great initially but will end up feeling unfulfilled and depressed in the end and will more than likely end up moving yet again. I'm feeling like this behaviour is a symptom of my inability to deal with my emotions/issues in a healthy way, I have a tendency to repress a lot and just keep carrying on like nothing is wrong.

None of the staff believe me, and I am going to loose my deposit if I ""admit"" I smashed it, or worse if I don't.

127,"Hello all, 
I am a complete newby to Reddit but thought I may get some helpful advice about a problem that has been plaguing me for over 10 years. 

It's difficult to articulate in words, so I will start off my plea for advice like this. ""They say the window to your soul is in your eyes"". Well, I am a heterosexual male (I have chosen to write in this forum but will consider taking it to the LGBT community forum) - anyway, my problem is this. 

When I am trying to have a conversation with a female, for example on a date in a coffee shop, or whether it's with a female colleague or boss, whether it's my own mother or sister - whenever I try and hold eye contact with a female and have a conversation, if there is another male present in the vicinity, for example, an elderly man, or an attractive man, or ""socially unattractive man"" (it does not matter what the man looks like in any way, shape or form is what I am trying to say) - invariably,  I can not maintain complete eye contact with the female and whilst, 'out of the corner of my eye' I will be almost looking at the  male to the right of us as we are having a coffee and also trying to look at the female at the same time. 

I apologize if this is not clear - again, it's difficult to explain. The thing is, it even happens with my brothers and male friends. For example, if I am talking to my mother, and my brothers are five meters away from her to the left but still looking at us while are all having a conversation, i will try and look my mother in the eyes and maintain eye contact but I will almost 'out of the corner' of my eye, almost be looking at my brother (or any male - this is just one scenario) at the same time. This may sound confusing, so I will give another example. 

If i am watching TV, and my brothers are to the right of me and my girlfriend is to the left of me, as I am watching TV, my eyes are fixed, focused on the screen about 60% (if i could quantify it as a percentage) and the other 40% again, is almost 'locking eyes' with the male(s) to the right of me. 

This is causing me a lot of angst. They say (irregardless of whether it's a female or a male) that during conversation, during business meetings, having a chat with a female friend, whatever the social situation may be - to show respect by giving someone your full attention and looking them in the eyes whilst talking.

I am unable to do this. If I take a girl out on a date, and a an elderly man and his wife sit down at the table next to us, immediately my mind's focus and (imagine a horse's head - how their eyes are on the side of their head) I will try and maintain eye contact with the female - but my mind's focus and my eyes will, at the same time, try and be focusing on her eyes, but also be catching the males eyes at the same time. I know this may sound kinda crazy but this is seriously driving me insane. Truly, this is no joke, I am crippled. Suffering debilitating anxiety from this. I can't go on dates with girls, or talk to my mum, watch TV or talk to my female boss with a male present in the room because  I cant give the female my complete and undivided attention as I will be thinking about the male and if the male is looking at us both (both me and the female) for example, in a business meeting, If I go to say something to the female in the office, it's almost as if I'm talking to the male - because it's almost palpable that my 'focus and attention' is on him - even if the conversation should only be between me and the female and this outside male has no say in the conversation. 

Is there any advice on how to focus more. I truly hope this has made some sense - I could give more detailed examples. I have been ruminating over this issue for over 10 years and it has left me crippled with anxiety. I need some advice and help. I am truly truly broken from this.",24Sep2017,8
129,"So at my school we got accepted to leadership 1 but  after 2 weeks apparently there were too many classes so they kicked everyone out of my leadership class, and the worst part is we HAVE to take it this year or we won't be able to tale it next year or the year after since we need 3 years of leadership.

so for the pass 5 weeks i've been telling the counselor to put me in one of the 2 leadership classes but she can't move me into the first period since i have honors math 3 and she can't move me into her third period because apparently all the digital arts classes are full even though i've seen a whole row empty

so my original idea was to ask to change my digital arts to 3A to 5B so i can have leadership and if they say no reply "" why not, it's the schools fault in the first place that i can't get back, aren't you guys going to take responsibility like you're always telling us to do"" but i feel like there are better ways

132,"I am 24 years old and have my GED. Ive gone to community college twice but life happened and I dropped out twice. The first time was for Civil Engineering and I chose this path because I love math and thought engineering would be a good fit. But I had financial struggles even though I was on financial aid, and ended up dropping out after 1 year. Then a couple years later I went back to community college for a criminal justice program they offered. I LOVED and thrived in the academics of it, but was slightly too out of shape for the PT courses they had in the program and dreaded having to do them. This lead to me taking a break from the course, to get into better shape and during that time my dad took his own life and left me in a dark place. In that time the program has been canceled and Im left wondering what to do.

So my current situation is that im 24, I have a lot of debt that I cant pay back (about 7k in medical bills and 3k in others. On top of 1-2k left in student loans). I could probably afford to file for bankruptcy (I currently have a reliable car and a house that im renting and on good terms with the landlord) and to pay back the student loans, which is my current plan. Only issue is my loans are in forbearance and I havnt contacted Navient or made a payment in about 1.5 years since I havnt been financially stable.

My question to anyone who can answer it is this; if I pay back my loans and file for bankruptcy, getting me caught up financially, is there any chance that I can go back to school? Most importantly is I want to be a laywer, as I stated before my favorite part of criminal justice was the academic side. I had a 3.8 average in all of my classes that wernt fitness  based. Could my current situation still have a chance at getting my masters from scratch and going to law school (which I 100% believe I can pass all the classes, im more motivated than Ive been in my whole life) or am I not seeing something?

This is hugely going to shape the rest of life, assuming I get the right advice. Thank you for reading this, and to anyone who can help me.",24Sep2017,1
135,"My sister is going through a time now, she's 22, recently finished college, and now she stays alone in her house building science projects to sell off wherever to get a little cash. I'm not so sure what exactly she does with all the stuff she builds and makes since she hardly talks about it now, I just basically read between the lines. It was fine for a while but now I'm guessing her projects are failing or whatever it is because she seems so depressed and stressed.

I try to visit, she barely eats, just gets drunk very often and smoke packs of cigarettes a day. It's really bad because she was so smart and beautiful in school but now... she looks like she's flushed, you can look and tell she's depressed... bags under her eyes... it's hard to see really.

I often bring her food to eat and usually she's drunk, with new guy she let stay over again, or both. Sometimes she's already busy with the men that when I ring the doorbell or call I am brushed off or just told to leave it in the kitchen and come back later. Whenever I do get time with her, I have to take her away from home because she'll research stuff on the computer or work on engineering projects and basically half ass any conversation. So I try to pull her out to lunch or a fast food restaurant if she prefers that and she'll basically fall asleep on me.

It's getting worse as the months go by... she isn't getting much sleep because she's drinking every night and then she brings guys to her house that she just met. It's so dangerous to do that... I tell her all the time to let me help her, but no, she doesn't want to inconvenience me. I have tried so hard to get her back on her feet but it's like she's drinking and smoking more. I don't want my sister to die from this lifestyle, I am so worried about her... 

Would reddit help her? Maybe if I can convince her to use this maybe she would start asking for advice or whatever she needs. Maybe her habits can be sidetracked by this instead and she could he more social even though she rarely gets out. Please tell me any advice I can use on my part to help her get theough this, I really do want to see her in a better life than this. And if it's possible should I try to get her on reddit as well?

There is evidence of drug-use in the neighborhood that never used to be here, including discarded joints and needles. Last week, a woman was mugged, but I don't know the details. I suspect, but cannot say for sure, that the car break-ins are providing a lot of the cash that goes to buy the drugs.

The neighborhood association and the local police consistently tell us that they are aware of the issue and are working on it, but they have nothing more concrete than that, and obviously the problem is still going strong.

138,"Some important backstory: I left my boyfriend of 6 years (we'll call him Steve) a little over a year ago now.  I loved him with all my heart, as he did me (even at the point of the breakup), he and I were really good friends who got along extremely well and neither of us wanted it to end.  The thing is, as much as we got along as people and were attracted to one another, the relationship was making me physically and psychologically ill and wasn't going anywhere (I'll get to that in a bit).  Leaving him was the hardest choice I've ever made and it just killed me inside.  I cried for months (and still cry about it).  I'm with somebody else now, and I'm about 100 times happier with this person (and have no intention of leaving him or any desire to get back with my ex) but I am haunted by the memory of the relationship as well as worry for my ex and his wellbeing- and my deep sadness over the fact that I can't realistically be friends with him.

Steve had an incredibly difficult start in life.  His parents abused him, he lived in poverty, had to raise himself, got bullied, beat up a lot (likely also molested in childhood), dropped out of high school, then got into worse and worse and worse drugs as well as drinking, smoking, bad scenes, etc.  He then later got into a horrific accident (unrelated to the other stuff) which gave him PTSD so bad that he can't sleep without heavy sedatives even a decade later.  He's spent most of his life just scraping by and isn't very close to any family or friends- he basically has nobody.  When I met Steve, he was nearly 30 and had worked very hard to try to put that stuff behind him.  I didn't know most of his past, though I could tell that he had a lot of baggage; I still wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.

He and I really hit it off and eventually fell in love and had some incredibly good years, during which, Steve never drank or did drugs, quit smoking, moved to my town to be with me, and otherwise got his life on track as best he could.  We had/have a lot in common and never really fought, were always laughing together and kind of having childlike times playing video games, going for walks, etc.  Though Steve had slept around a bit before he met me, I was the only person he has ever had an emotional connection to.  The first/only one he fell in love with and the closest thing he's ever had to a real friend.  Similarly, although I had/have a lot of friends and loved ones, I grew to consider Steve to be my best friend as well, as we had a really special connection (in *most* ways).

The thing is, after a point, I realized that Steve had too much baggage for me to cope with.  I was 22 when I got together with him, and at first he seemed so wise and mature, but truthfully, I felt myself outgrowing him around the midpoint in several different ways.  Firstly, Steve has a lot of difficulty with empathy and communication (more so than the average person) and I regularly felt like I wasn't getting very much affection or emotional feedback.  Secondly, he was neither willing, nor able to properly take care of himself.  He didn't keep track of things very well and was also extremely hard to get a hold of.  He was insanely reckless and irresponsible in ways that repeatedly screwed him over (and sometimes me), his habits led to all sorts of situations that hurt me and otherwise caused a lot of stress for both of us.  He flaked on me *constantly*, and between his health problems, depression/anxiety, sleep issues, work and just general forgetfulness, I often only saw him on average once every 7-9 days.  There was one period towards the end where he kept on canceling on me and it ended up being three weeks before I saw him (this was during a time when I was having a major emotional crisis pertaining to something unrelated and I felt like I needed him to be there more than I'd ever needed him).  There had been another time like that 4 years prior, during which I had a medical emergency and almost died and he just disappeared off the face of the planet and didn't give me so much as one *text* asking me how I was, let alone a call for two weeks while I was recovering from surgery (and he definitely knew what was happening, since I was at his house when the emergency occurred).  So, between that time and the more recent 3 week abandonment, from my perspective, things sort of ended up slowly dying between us.  I warned him about this, and he just... let it happen, even outright telling me (repeatedly) that I should leave him.  I later found out after the breakup that he had started using cocaine (a few months before the breakup) and that was why he had been so unavailable and flaky.  I tried so hard for many years to be patient and supportive- truthfully, if he'd have communicated with me about the cocaine when he started it, I probably would have stayed with him and tried to help him through it- but it got increasingly difficult for me to picture a future with this person.

There were other reasons for the breakup too.  For instance, his house was a biohazard (he never learned how to clean and there was always stuff like mold, plates of week old food sitting around, scum on every single surface, etc).  His immune system was virtually nonexistent after years of hard drugs, malnutrition and neglect, and his hygiene/habits made this way worse.  He caught every virus that came his way and was always passing them along.  He never ate more than one small meal a day and I was unable to get him to treat himself better.  He treated tiny adjustments such as getting into the habit of washing hands after using the toilet to be notable undertakings that he was doing for my sake, rather than his own.  I loved him and wanted him to get better and find some kind of peace, but the gap just kept on widening.

When I left him it basically smashed his heart like glass.  I think, from his perspective, I was practically the only good thing that ever happened to him.  Afterwards, I couldn't sleep and all I could think about was how horrible he must be feeling and how badly I wished I could be there to comfort him, since he lost his girlfriend and his best friend at the same time.  I also keep feeling incredibly sad thinking about how he started up cocaine again while I was with him and how much I wish he had told me so that I could have at least been there for him and had a better understanding of what was going on.  It still kills to to imagine someone I love/loved so deeply in that state and all alone.  But, even without the drugs (he managed to quit again), since I left him, he just keeps finding rock bottoms.  I've mostly just observed from a distance, as I didn't want to rub salt into the wound by getting too close to him, but it's really hard not to worry.

There were several months, later on, during which I felt a little more grounded and hopeful about Steve finding his way.  He seemed (from a distance) like he was doing a little better.  So, I did an incredibly stupid thing and tried talking to him online (this was a few weeks ago) and it ended up being a disaster.  It started out very cordial and we were very careful/tentative, both realizing that there was a good chance of one of us getting hurt.  But I quickly learned that he has not moved on.  He's in exactly the same place psychologically that he was a year ago and he ended up getting really drunk and sending me the same kinds of rants he sent me during the first few months after the breakup.  I now realize that I shouldn't have spoken to him at all as all it did was rip off the scab and make him feel really lonely and sad.  I feel like a complete moron.

So, I'm left wondering how to deal with these emotions of guilt and worry, knowing that any attempt I could make to help him or engage with him at all would only make it worse.  Someone I care about who used to be my best friend is out there alone and grieving, feeling like he's lost everything and there is nothing I can do about it.",24Sep2017,58
139," So, I'm working as a company employee at tech startup and it is located inside the university. (CEO used to be a professor there.) I'm also an avid Pokemon Go player so, I joined the public group chat mainly focusing on raids and gym take-over inside the university territory. Naturally, almost everyone in the group chat is uni/grad student there and I haven't had any problem and they haven't either even if I'm not a student. Well, until now.

 What happened is, we talked about things related to the game and I tried to inform them some new findings about the game they haven't heard of. So, I copied the link of the web page containing the information and pasted it in the chat room. At least I thought I did.....

 What I actually did is, I somehow managed to highlight the whole url but totally failed to copy it. and.....Guess what was inside my device's clipboard. I'll leave it to your imagination but, I can say it's definitely NSFW stuff.

 I tried to be calm and casually continue the conversation. From then, suddenly the speed of the succession of the chat felt kind of dragged down and it feels like to me everyone in the chat room is staring at the giant elephant in the room.

  I think by now, pretty much every one in the chat room clicked the link already. 

 What should I do? I've never experienced this kind of stuff. You know, technology biting my ass off kind of accident. Any advice guys? Thank you for reading this. 

 PS. I tried my best to describe the situation/how I feel but since English is not my first language, you might have had difficulty reading it. I apologize for that.",24Sep2017,1
143,"So I just recently made posts on offmychest and trueoffmychest about this, but the situation has changed a bit since posting and now I want to seek some actual advice vs consolation. 

WARNING: this is really long but I'm not able to make it any shorter because I feel all these details are important. I'm also unfortunately out of my ADHD meds today and didn't have any to take so just typing a couple sentences in a row (like this) is difficult.

Thank you if you even clicked, I understand if you don't read though due to the length.

Gonna say this now so you know what I'm working with here. I need advice specifically with what I can do to help him, how I can stay sane until he gets back, and one other thing (NSFW) that I will mention at the end.

I'll try to keep the background on this short, because I could go on for a while. We met off Tinder almost 6 months ago at the end of March, spent a lot of time together during the first month until I went back home over the summer (my college is about 4 hours from my permanent home) and he was stuck in Norfolk as he is in the Navy (his decision to join has always been split in his mind, half glad for it, and the other now obviously larger portion that regrets it so deeply). We did our best to stay in touch through snapchat (Neither of us are fans of texting) and visiting each other when we could-- which only ended up being a little less than once a month. It was difficult but we were getting through it and both couldn't wait for me to be back at school for the whole year. 

I started to notice maybe mid-july that he seemed off. He was never the kind to reply to messages immediately but I never had to worry that he wouldn't give a response at all. But now, he was taking days at a time to even acknowledge that I had sent anything, often times not even answering the questions I had asked (and I know that it was not something Navy-related keeping him from responding). This went on for about half of the month and I continually pestered him and texted him, even left a couple voicemails. I'm not good at being left in the dark like that because of my anxiety and not being able to understand what's going on makes me feel the worst. I also know that pestering him like that is overboard, but we both knew about each others issues when we started dating and were ready to deal with it. 

He finally started to get back to normal and apologized and told me he had been feeling depressed lately, and that he had been doing stupid things to make money. He also had something he wanted to tell me when I saw him next. (He owes a lot of money for the car he bought recently and this has been a major weight on his shoulders). I tried to help by providing him alternative ways of making money aside from... illegal means... but in his mind this way was the fastest and only way to solve his problem. I believe this is why he wasn't responding as normal, due to it taking up a lot of his time and also possibly because he was ashamed he felt he had to turn to that. 

Things went relatively back to normal for a bit again and I was able to visit him after something else I had to be in the area for, though only for one day. Since he is in the Navy he never actually knows what time he will get out for the day, and told me he should probably be done around 2, which was about 2 hours after I was done with my thing. I asked him to text me when he was ready for me to come over (to his PPV housing) but once 2 came and passed, I figured things were taking longer than he had estimated and decided to drive around and just chill out. He sent one text at maybe 4:30 (???) to say work was taking longer than he thought, of course, because he can't ever seem to catch any luck when it comes to his Navy stuff. I said I understood and would just wait, it had been almost 2 months since I had seen him so I was willing to wait. I had nowhere to stay so I just sat around in my car because I was exhausted and decided to take a nap. I woke up around 5:30 and fucked around on my phone until seven god damn o'clock. I finally go over there and I was annoyed that it took so long, but it wasn't at him. When we started talking he told me what he had wanted to tell me, which was that he had picked up smoking cigarettes-- partially due to stress and anxiety, partially bc the Navy banned vape mods on the ships (obv vaping was something he was into). I was upset but understood why he would take them up, it just made me so so worried bc of all the risks and health effects. It was also another waste of his money, putting more pressure on his financial situation. anyway.

I was only there for about 20ish minutes (got there a bit after 7) when he got a text from one of his ""guys"" saying he left his phone in (my bf's) car (the text was obv the guy from one of his other friends phones). Then my bf tells me he has to go bring the phone to his ""guy"" and I said it should be able to wait, but he said this guy had been there for him so he should bring it right away. I was upset bc I had waited 5+ hours doing nothing so I could see him, even though I knew i had to leave really early in the morning, so this guy should be able to wait a day to get his phone back. I asked if I could just come with, but he didn't want me to be around ""those type of people"" (related to ""stupid things"" he was doing to make money..) and didn't want me to be there bc it was in a really bad area. He left around 7:40 and promised not to take longer than an hour at the very most. I stayed at his place and watched random tv shows to pass the time. A little before 9 came around I texted him to ask if he was on the way back and about 30 min later he replied saying he got caught up in something and his ""guys"" asked for him to do a couple things when a fight broke out and it took a while. 

He got back a little before 10 and he seemed okay, but when he laid down next to me, I noticed a couple things. At first we were just laying together but before I came to see him we had been talking about sex bc we haven't done it together yet (I've never done it before), and we both really wanted to. We started making out and stuff when I noticed he was REALLY warm and his heart was beating WAY faster than normal (I like to listen to his heartbeat when we lay together bc it's really calming for me) so I made a comment about it and he said he wasn't sure why he was like that, and that maybe it was from the adrenaline of breaking up the fight earlier (even though it was a while ago at that point). He was still feeling like that (fast heartbeat + really warm) a while later but I just shrugged it off, figured it was bc we were under the blankets moving around a lot and stuff. We were getting really into it and were about to actually ""do it"" but I was nervous and it was taking a minute, then he wasn't hard anymore. Back and forth a couple times almost doing it and him not being able to keep it up. Eventually we just gave up on it and he was kinda annoyed I think, and I was upset. He apologized and said we would try another time, so we just snuggled for a while until he said it was too hot and wouldn't be able to sleep while we were snuggling (which was fair, it was really freaking hot and humid).

He had to wake up at 3 the next morning because he was supposed to be going to this class he had to take for the Navy which was a little more than an hour away-- he had to be there before 4:45 to be able to get into the class because it was full, and he would only be able to take it if he got there early enough. Despite knowing this he decided he would be okay to stay up late, even though he was ALREADY pretty sleep deprived. I was sad we couldn't see each other for longer but I had to get home too. I left feeling a little weird in the back of my mind, but I let it go bc he had been depressed lately so I attributed it to that. I found out a day or two later that he had missed the entire second day of his class, and he was waiting to find out what the repercussions would be. In a couple hours he let me know that he had been dismissed from the class and that they had taken away his PPV housing. This was a huge blow to his already bad depression because living on the ship made his depression worse, so the idea that he may have to go back to that killed him. Fortunately though, he eventually convinced himself that it was okay to ask for help, and is now living at a friend's place.

A couple days later, he messaged me to say he had done something stupid, and I could tell bc they way he was wording everything was off. He told me he had smoked a certain illegal thing that I won't mention (it was part of what he was doing for money). He had done it once a long time ago but hadn't since then. I'm not into those kinds of things at all and I never have been, but there are certain.... kinds that don't seem too dangerous and I understand why people use them. Just not the kind he was dealing with. I couldn't remember what the possible effects would be, so I was looking it up and realized it can cause rapid heartbeat, high body temperature, and make it difficult to get and keep an erection. I asked if he had done it the night I was there and he said yes. I asked how many other times he had done it and he said those had been the only times so far. 

Fast forward to move-in day at the end of August and I was so ready to be back. My bf hadn't done the ""illegal thing"" for a little while now and I was really glad for that, and hoped it wouldn't happen again. I was trying to make plans to see him when I got moved in, but he had been really sick lately so he felt like ultra-crap. It was understandable but I was still upset bc I had been looking forward to it. The next couple of days were the same, and he eventually got to the doctor to find out he had a deviated septum which was why he still felt so stuffed up and crappy. Once he was feeling better he said he just wanted space but he had promised multiple times to either call and talk on the phone or come over to see me finally. (side note; he didn't always have access to his car even when he was available and not feeling like shit bc he lets his roommate borrow it to see his mom in the hospital). I was really angry that he had been making these promises and breaking them again and again. I gave him some leniency on it though bc of the depression, as I've been through the same thing before and I know it can be absolute hell. Since then it has just been on and off me trying to contact him to make sure he is okay while he ignores most of my attempts at contact, and doing my best to give him space by not texting him every 20 minutes. 

It has now been two months since I've seen him in person or heard his voice. It's also been nearly a month since I've seen his face, even over snap. I might've seen one picture a couple weeks ago, but nothing else. He has acknowledged that he's been treating me like shit and apologized but I said I didn't think he meant it, but of course he didn't acknowledge that comment at all. My birthday is at the end of the month, and it will also be six months since we met. I love him so much and I want to help, but he won't trust that I know isolation makes depression worse. I tried my best to give the advice I could, but he was so in his own head that I decided the best course of action would be to really give him space. I only texted him once for an entire week now (which was really difficult for me because of the circumstances), which was only to ask if he remembered that my birthday was coming soon. Otherwise, literally no contact at all. I'm just so tired and lonely, he's my best friend and I can stop thinking about what he might be feeling like right now, bc I've gone through depression too and it hurts me to know he has to even go through this. 

Advice is welcome as long as it's not to tell me I should have broken up with him a while ago. I've heard that a couple times now and hearing it from some random person on the internet won't change my decision in that regard. Side note, I am positive that he suffers from severe anxiety as I've been diagnosed myself and have done extensive research on it in the past. I've been able to help a couple friends in realizing why they are the way they are, allowing them to seek professional help. I've told him this but he doesn't want to ""depend on other people to solve his problems"" and is also afraid to get kicked out of the Navy despite having my mom's Navy friend tell us that he wouldn't be kicked out bc of that.

I just care about him so much.

TL;DR there is no tldr bc as you can see i have no self control and a little bit of ADHD so i cant summarize shit effectively. sorry, thanks for clicking anyways though.

Shortly after posting this I found out that he was on restriction for getting caught doing the ""illegal things"" mentioned and he is now working on the barge and isn't allowed to leave at all for 60 days. I can't remember if I mentioned this in the original post but I was expecting to see him this week as it will be both my birthday and 6 months together for us (kinda), so to find out I have to wait another two months is devastating. I've always known I would never be able to handle a long distance relationship because I am shit at communicating anywhere but in person (even with friends who move away, I often lose touch without meaning to), and an important part of being in a relationship is physical affection especially since this is my first relationship ever. 

Once he is off the barge he plans on somehow leaving the Navy (plans on that are shaky right now) and going home to Oregon where he is from. He says he will come see me before he goes home, but I'm not sure when exactly or for how long. If he were to leave the Navy directly after he gets off restriction I would be at home (4 hours away from my college) for Thanksgiving break that exact day; although I don't think he will be able to leave just like that as far as I know. 

The one good thing about him being on restriction is that I don't think he will have access to the ""illegal things"" he has been doing; I strongly believe that they have a large part in the worsening of his depression (based on extensive research of said things and based on when he started those things and when the depression got bad). 


On restriction, as I read (I'm not for sure on this), if he is not working he has to be in his room at all times, which is separate from all the other rooms and is used to house anyone on restriction. He was supposed to get his phone taken away but he got around that for now and pretty much nothing is allowed in the room (I read about some people who, for entertainment and sanity, made up a game where if someone farted, the first person to touch the doorknob first was the ""winner""... A lot of staring at the walls apparently happens). Part of me is deeply concerned that this will throw him even further into depression as he also struggles with anxiety, and as I've had the same issues, I know alone time can only serve to make things worse. I'm really hoping that being off the ""illegal things"" will show improvement in his depression at the very least.

I've already been worrying about him every day for nearly a month now and I know I will continue to do so until I can see him again, probably no matter what. I'm worried and I'm lonely, and I genuinely need the physical reassurance of his affection because I don't really like to be touched by most other people. 

ALSO not gonna lie here (NSFW) I'm really fucking horny. Like all the time. I've never really actually masturbated at all and the farthest me and my bf have gone is hand stuff, as well as him giving me oral (bless his heart bc he knew I wasn't ready to reciprocate that and didn't expect anything in return). I've continually been looking forward to seeing him (and hopefully being able to get frisky) and then getting it pushed back again and again; all this pent-up frustration is starting to get in the way of my school work. The wall of the house I live in are REALLY thin and I am LOUD. Never really been able to hold that back much. so yeah.

I need advice specifically with what I can do to help him, how I can stay sane until he gets back, and what to do about the sexual frustration getting in the way of my school work. Thanks so much if you read this far, you've truly got a heart of gold.",24Sep2017,2
144,"Hey people, how's it going?
So a little background about my college and the kind of people in it. It is a strict environment and most of my classmates are assholes when it comes down to marks and grades lol. They don't give a fuck about friends when it comes to academics and though i get it, it still makes me uncomfortable occasionally. People have already chosen their final year project partners based on what's best for them. I being an ignorant fuck started a bit late.

In this environment I'm glad I have 2 very close friends who are clearly above average in academics but their practical skills are a bit...unreliable. I've had to team up with them and I don't know if college changed me but I'm really not sure if we could pull off something extraordinary with these guys. 

I don't know if I'm being an asshole or should i just try for a better group? On one hand I think our dynamic is awesome but on the other hand I think they would would screw me up when things come down to actual technical skills. What do you'll think?",24Sep2017,1
145,"I just started my second year at my university that I transferred to. At the end of last year I met my now roommate who we will call “Ed”. One of my friends from high school that I was/am very close to got accepted to our school and transferred here. We will call her “Beth”. 

Backtrack to the first week of classes starting (4 weeks ago) we all go out to a party and drink. I left to go get a friend from her house and walk her back to this party. On my way, the alcohol starts to hit me and I throw up in some shrubbery. I decide it’d probably be best if I go back to my room. I get back and just throw up a lot. A few minutes later my roommate(ed) messages me “I’m coming back” I said “ok”. He responds with “I’m bringing Beth” I said “pls don’t fuck in our room, as I was throwing up in the bathroom which is directly connected to our dorm room. 
Fast forward 10 minutes and he brings her back and proceeds to have sex with her while I am throwing up in the bathroom. 

The next day they apologized and told me it was the alcohol and it won’t happen again. I don’t see them the same anymore, I can’t see them standing next to each other without my stomach turning. Usually I would just give it a little time and things would get back on track. I have no trust for them that they won’t do this again. I am slowly backing away from the group we all hang out with because of them. So you might wonder why this is bothering me. 

For one, it was extremely inconsiderate to have sex in the room while someone is throwing up in the bathroom. 

Secondly, I have always put Ed first. He is one of my closest friends and by doing this, Beth drove a wedge between our friendship. I have put so much effort into these friendships and by then having sex it created a whole new dynamic. 

I don’t have feelings for either of them, that seems to be a popular question. 

My problem is I don’t know what to do. The anxiety I am having by hanging out with them is creating problems for me. I’ve slowly began to branch out to other groups so I’m not being a loner. I just want some other options I could consider.

146,"I'm writing this post partially because it's something to do. I moved to university 100 miles away from home (British by the way) and I'm having trouble really socialising in the day. I'm not the most confident, but I just feel like my flat mates don't really like me. Today's Sunday and I only arrived on Saturday, so it is very early doors, but I tend to stress out a lot.

I'm in a sort of students union where we go out in the nights, doing various events. It's all very fun and I do socialise well then, but I can't feel any real friendships will come out of it. I meet all my course-mates tomorrow, and there's a sort of freshers 'fair' on Tuesday, so I'll join some societies, but it's hard at the minute.

148,"My brother is a whiny deadbeat with no job, he's always at home bitching about everything I do to our parents. He's been obsessed with me forever! Earlier this year he would stare at my ass all day and publicly announce that I don't wear panties in public and make a dumbass of himself. Not only that, any guy friends I made, he would persue them and try to lie and act like I'm a slut.

He slut-shames me (despite me being a virgin), hits on me, snitches on me, tries to spread hate to me, judges me, etc., including talking shit to me. He will literally get in my face talking so much crap, calling me a little bitch and being so hurtful that I literally feel like crying. He's so hateful and mean and I don't deserve any of it.

My brother has been heated since he lost his job, I had to get a job but since I couldn't drive yet our parents thought it be good that I work there. He hated that and made it a living hell, I couldn't go anywhere without him snitching, he watched me like a hawk as if I needed to steal, then he would run around looking for me or smell where I'm at and try to go accuse me of smoking weed. It got so bad they fired him and he's so mad now.

So I was going out last night to a club with my friends and he catches me before I go out the door. He gets on what I wear again calling me a hoe and all this other bullshit. So I start talking back and I told him how he needs to leave me alone because he's a deadbeat bum loser who can't get a real girlfriend because he's a jealous dumbass who's obsessed with me and he hits me, knocking me to the ground and my parents come down and ground us both, so I couldn't even go out with my damn friends.

My first project was started by two others who are new to the technologies used, so some cleanup/restructuring was needed. I only have a few years of experience after uni, but I've used this technology since its existence, so I have a good idea of what works and not.

During the first few weeks I've ran into the following problems/conflicts:

1. More or less all my ideas on how to improve the project have been met with a lot of skepticism, making me feel kind of useless and like I'm patronizing when I'm really just trying to help.

2. The guy I've been working together with (who is new to the technologies but much more experienced than me in general), has basically been a proxy for the lead developer, which has caused countless confusions.

3. Every time I've tried to talk to the lead developer he has basically not listened to my arguments and instead been discussing by linking random blog posts which are unrelated to the discussion. 

4. In our last discussion (I think) the lead developer started realizing that he's more or less wrong, but he still didn't accept my way of doing things. I don't care who's wrong and who's right, I just want to be listened to when there are problems in a project. 

5. Discussing with him is kind of like I'm digging my own grave, since no outcome is beneficial for me. All I want to do is help, but now the situation has become kind of toxic.

So basically since the lead developer wants to push his own agenda instead of listening to arguments which are related to the problem itself I have no idea what to do. The guy I worked with together on the project has basically just forwarded the lead developer's opinions since he's a) new to the technologies and b) trusts the lead developer (which is totally natural).

So now I'm in a situation where I feel like shit and I just want to quit and find a new job, since I can't find any way out of it.

Thinking about the situation I think I have the following options:

1. Quit or call in sick, basically avoid the problem. I know it's not the right thing to do but it's what I feel like doing.

2. Discuss the situation with a superior. This will probably lead to them thinking I am a snitch etc, which is why I haven't done it up until now.

3. Talk to them again. I've tried several times but they become very defensive and I don't think there's any point in trying again.

4. Wait and hope my next project is with other people even though it's very hard to work under these circumstances.

5. Listen to them and not have my own opinions. I'll basically be doing something which I know for a fact is bad practice and will cause problems further on in the project. 

Any help is appreciated. Thanks",24Sep2017,1

156,"I started a job about one month ago that pays $11 an hour plus commission in the cellphone industry. Prior to accepting this offer I also applied to a bank as a teller. I received an email Friday from the bank asking to set up an interview, and based on my communication with them it seems as if they’re willing to offer me $16 an hour or maybe a bit more. 

I’m still in training and my job has put a great deal of effort into me. They clearly like me very much and upper management has made it clear that they value me and are very happy with my performance and progress. I am happy at this job. 

However, if the bank offers me $16+ an hour, it would be difficult for me to make a decision. $11 an hour high stress job with a varied schedule and the potential to earn up to $14 or $15 if I sell a lot, vs a guaranteed $16+ an hour low stress paycheck with a consistent schedule and better PTO benefits. I have good reason to believe they will make an offer in this range. 

I don’t want to screw over my new employers by leaving right after they put all this effort into setting me up for success, but I am a college student who needs a reliable source of income to pay off debt and have enough stress in my day to day life as it is without having sales goals and constant work related group chat notifications do stay on top of. 

Additionally, I worry that if I tell my current employer about a better offer and see if they will match it, they will take offense or take it personally (based on the way management acts I can see this happening. Their professional boundaries seem to be slightly blurred.)

To top it all off, no one working at my current job has been there for any considerable length of time (one year or less, including upper management.) this is not a new company by any means. Why such a high turnover rate? Red flag in my eyes. When I asked they said they “needed to clean house to get the business on track.” I respect and understand this, but am still wary. Most current employees seem to be quite happy however. 

If I get an offer from the bank, do I stay or do I go?!

157,"I'm a junior at college, and here, there is one girl that I have been into for at least a year now. The tricky thing is, she's very different from most of the girls at my college, and I can't find a thing I don't like about her (honestly tried). We were friendly last year, we got a meal together and chatted from time-to-time. The only time I approached her at a party, she had been with another guy for some time. It was a roundabout way of me getting rejected.

This year, we haven't spoken, mostly because I refuse to approach her while drunk at a party and haven't had the chance during the week when sober. Either way, I need this girl to get out of my head. I have fixated for too long and it's super unhealthy: I cannot stop thinking about her and ""scenarios"" involving her. I cannot get any work done anymore this year. That's how bad it is. Trying to distract myself with television, friends, or socializing with new people does not help.

I'm now wondering if I need to see a therapist to help deal with this. Should I just do that or does anyone have thoughts that might help?

160,"Hey everyone!  
To quickly summarize my situation:  
I'm a 22 years old male. I work in IT sector as a Junior Product Owner.  
I've started University 3 times (I live in the EU, so I don't have any debt regarding that - yet.) but something always happened which caused me to stop doing it. First time it was money (I lived in Denmark while I'm from Hungary and I was not able to finance myself), second time I was just genuinely uninterested in my studies (teacher program) and now the Uni didn't approve my ""Permission for personal schooling schedule"", so I can't do it while I work.  
I also realized I have nothing that I have passion for which'd provide me a ""stable"" employment in the future. I have a band and I live to make music, I'd love to be involved with streaming/making youtube videos or starting my own company.  
The problem with those: I'm not that good with music theory (I learned by myself), youtube and streaming is full, and to create my own company I'd need funding or at least as ""Entrepreneurial"" people as me - but they are nowhere to be found in my friend's circle. Also to be honest I really don't want to go back to school, because I love working. My current job and current workmates are great, and I'm grateful that they accepted me with a high school diploma only. I worked in a call center before which sucked, but I'd prefer that over school everyday. I understand as well, that I might not be the most clever person because of that. Also, I don't want to let down my parents, who really want me to finish a University.  
Have anyone here been in the same position? What happened, what do you suggest?

I wasn't quite sure if they were serious or not, but another coworker had confirmed that she said she was.

She's pretty cute, so I figured why not give it a shot. We've been talking for a while, and last night made plans to see a movie today (not our first date). Anyway, we both decided to go into work at the same time last night for overtime, and to work with each other.

So after our shift, we were out in the parking lot talking for a while. At one point it had gotten a bit cold (we had gotten out of work at 4am), so we got into my car to keep talking. We talked a while more, then she leaned in for a hug. A long hug. Probably about a 10 minute hug. After a while she said, ""Would you like me to come around to your side?"" and I said, ""Do you want to?"". She said, ""yeah"" and so she got out, and came around to my drivers seat, and got in (both of us in the same seat). From there we started making out. For a long time. Probably about 15-20 minutes.

I went with it, but to be honest, this doesn't feel right at all. I don't know if it's because I've never been in a relationship or not, but I just feel really uncomfortable right now, I didn't even really like the contact. Making out was awful to me, and I don't know what to to.

I'm afraid to tell her how I feel because she might be like, ""WWHYD YOU GO ALONG WITH LAST NIGHT?"" or something like that. It was a weird situation, we went from kinda talking to that.

I really don't even want to go see a movie today, I just want to go back to what I'm used to.

169,"So to set in the scenario, me and this girl know each other for few days and ended up at a little party at our friends house. Drinks were involved and we generally had a good time, but didn't get totally wasted, more like tipsy.

So it gets late, around 3am and every decides to go sleep and I sleep in this room with 2 other people each on separate beds and she randomly walks to my bed and cuddles with me. We spent the whole night touching each other, cuddling and trying to sleep even tho we couldn't fall asleep. It got a little sexual to a point of her constantly pressing at my crotch and me running my hands across her body and breasts.

However, we didn't go further because of the third person in that room, so we ended it there and eventually fell asleep holding hands and spooning. In the morning we decide to pack things and leave.

Later in the day, we texted a bit and she told me straight away that it was probably just a drunk moment and she doesn't know how i see it and asks if we are stil friends, agreeing to not tell anyone even tho people all the party knew what happened because of the third girl.

I am not sure what to think of it, she seemed okay with cuddling and touching in the morning too when she wasn't really tipsy anymore and was never fully drunk during the night. What's your opinion?

My girlfriend has a friend, her only friend, whom we’ll name C. C is a terrible friend, she’s constantly hurting gf emotionally and physically. Earlier this month, she called gf (who has an eating disorder) fat and told her to throw up her food. Today, she just asked gf for oral. ORAL. C knows that gf and I are in a happy relationship, and they’re both underage. C ended up inviting a 27 yr old guy (10 years older than C) for a blowjob. The guy ended up leaving after realizing that C is underage.
My girlfriend is still at C’s house, and her mother is coming to pick her up. C started blaming the oral thing on gf, and called her a “fucking annoying cunt” too. and last night, C told her that she could have some of her drink. An hour later, gf had some and then C slapped her head and called her a cunt. Gf gets migraines, and C slapped her head so hard that she got one. Meanwhile, C complained that her hand hurt.
I want to do something about this. I’m texting gf now and she’s realizing how shitty C is. C also gave her a kindle tablet and an apple watch last night too (gf is poor and can’t afford much) and now C is asking for it back.
I live an hour away from gf, and we’ve only met up three times. Idk how to help her besides texting her; i don’t want C hurting gf or doing something to gf that she doesn’t want to do.

It might be just me, but something tells me that C is a shitty person.

Almost running him over because he was hesitant to not leave.

Just got some new hiking shoes- Merrell Moab 2's. A lot of good things about them, but I'm having trouble with my right foot. For some reason, the top of the shoe presses into the top of my foot in an annoying, and eventually painful, way in a particular spot above the arch and slightly right of center, just under the right side of the ""tongue."" Just did my first bit of serious walking in them, and that right foot fatigued a lot faster than the left- I was feeling it on the bottom of that foot after about 2 hours on city streets, whereas the left gave no indication of fatigue until about 3 hours into my trek, and even then not a ton. What's strange to me is my left foot is slightly larger than the right, but that isn't having any issues with a tight fit. Couldn't be happier with the performance on that foot.

So what can I do? Will this resolve as they break in, or is there something more proactive I can do? I tried tying the right foot very loosely today, to try to stop it from pressing into the top of my foot, and that worked for a bit but eventually the pain came on. Maybe the loose tie is why I had fatigue on that foot, but I don't think I could bear it any tighter, considering how it presses down on the top. With the shoe off, I don't feel or see anything sticking out of the tongue that would cause this, although it does sort of fold up right where the spot is, but so does the left one. And no, my right foot is not injured or anything. I can press down hard with my fingers all around the spot in question, and it feels normal.

So my mom went inside and her and my neighbor started having trouble with each-other, and my mom at this point was ubering for money but she didn't get enough to pay the car bills for the month so she had to hide it and eventually the neighbor found out and told the repo guys where the car was and they took her car.
Middle-
My mom at the start was determined to either get her car back or find another job, she started searching and found a way she could get her car back but then they said they couldn't get her the car because her credit was to low, my mom began getting very depressed and me and my little brother were the only ones living with her at the time because she and my older brother got in to a fight and got him kicked out. Then my mom found out she could get a co signer to help out and we thought she could get her car, but then we found out she would have to put down a down payment and be at a meeting a couple hours away in a couple days, my my began to start drinking and laying down at the house constantly.
Now-
My brother and his girlfriend has now moved backed in and started working constantly for my mom but she still mopes around all day and drinks constantly, i'm really afraid she is gonna die or we are not gonna be able to see her again. Me and my little brother will be ok because our dad said we could come stay at his house but my mom will not, she doesn't have any places to go and i'm very depressed by this. Please what can i do? Me and my little brother are both honor students with honor classes and doing good in school, we just have this going on at our house and i don't know what to do, please help!",24Sep2017,1

198,"whats up guys,
I've met this girl through a school club and then she invited me out to pregame and go to bars with her friends. She was very touchy feely and she bought me a drink and dragged me to the dancefloor. We danced, made out etc. Because of association through a club I didn't wanna make a move the first night we went out so nothing else happened that night and she wound up leaving with her friends. Anyways the next day she asked me what i was up to. We wound up going out again and I was gonna plan to take her home this time.
Anyways, in line for the bars she was flirting with me again (blowing her cig smoke in my face as a joke and making comments hinting at going home with me that night. I'm thinking to myself, great well get a couple shots then ill take her back to my place. Anyways we go in and get the drinks and things and one of her friends calls saying that someone she knew is hurt badly. We walk outside and theres an ambulance and everything. There was a huge scene, and all the bars were closing out, and the vibe was killed and so naturally she went off with her friends to look after their hurt friend.
Here's the fun part. I woke up this morning and tried to hit her up on facebook and she had legit blocked me. Not just messenger, not just defriending me she straight up blocked me.
I've had some people tell me i ""didn't move fast enough and it ticked her off"" but I think that's wrong because i legit met her a week prior to us going to bars this past weekend.
Then there was one guy who said ""oh well it probably wasn't going as well as you thought and she thought you were creepy"". Thats a more possible answer than the previous one but then again, I don't think that's it because i never messaged her on facebook other than to initiate plans, and i never had the chance to officially bring her back to my place so coming on too strong wasn't a thing. Plus she initiated a lot of the making out and flirting, so I have a hard time believing that one.
My third friend told me that her behavior is not due to anything I did but simply because she is crazy. He also mentioned how because i wasn't needy over social media, that there is no way she was ""creeped out"" at the thought of me contacting her again. This to me is the most likely answer
Ive been in situations like this previously, but in these situations the chick simply either just stopped talking to me like a normal person or I could look back and pin point something where I screwed up bad.

199,"Context: 
Moved into a 3 bedroom/3 bath about 2 months ago. Pretty good living situation until now. When I first moved in, one of my roommates M let me know that his girlfriend was storing her stuff in our living room for a little while (he said a month) and she pretty much lives at our place. This is fine with me, because my SO is here most nights as well. 

However, its been about two months now and her stuff is still in the living room. Additionally, he let the living room become a mess. We both have dogs but he never vacuums or picks up shredded toy parts/cotton or cleans up the room in general. He's good about dishes so I've been biting my tongue. (After I cleaned the kitchen one day he said he was aware of the living room mess and would take care of it....no such luck.) 

I finally got fed up with the mess last night and cleaned it/consolidated his SO's things into the corner. I was hopeful this would prompt a positive response and a better future as far as cleaning goes. One final note is that I took his table outside so I could mop the floor and forgot to take it inside before I crashed. That was my fault. I woke up to [this](https://imgur.com/Jy4zRj0) message. 

I was definitely upset when I read it, so I took some time to cool off before I sent a angry reply. After thinking through what I wanted to say I sent [this](https://imgur.com/BL7JUml) response. 

Did I respond appropriately? What can I do in the future to prevent these kind of situations? 

One more thing to note is that I haven't directly confronted him about his mess yet. I was waiting to see if he would take care of it since he has referenced the mess multiple times and seemed apologetic. In hindsight I realize it was probably a mistake to clean the room before directly asking him to do it. ",24Sep2017,1
200,"We are trying to move to a neighboring town, and the only way we can afford to get what we want is to buy an old tear-down and remodel it almost from scratch (but not entirely). After searching for 5 months now, which I don't think is all that long but my husband feels it's an eternity, we finally found a house in our most desired neighborhood on our most desired street. It's an old tear down. The catch? Someone died in it last year. An elderly lady who passed away from cancer.

I've always been a little spooked by dead people, ghosts, etc.. and it's basically awful for me to live in a house someone died in. However, we'd be tearing it down and building new. I know it seems illogical that the foundation/land could still be ""stigmatized"" and I know death is natural, and people die everywhere, etc etc but I'm worried it will always bother me. Yet I'm feeling guilty that this is what we've been waiting for and I feel like I'm taking this opportunity away from my husband. He says he doesn't want it unless I'm on board 100%, but then also says he's going to give up our house search if we don't buy this one as he feels we're ""not ready"" to move. Feeling very torn.

204,"As the title states, I'm 24 and still in school. I earned my AA and a community college, transferred to a University for 2 years where I struggled &amp; failed to graduate. I then transferred to a tech school for a 2 year program to become an electrician. I graduated from that program with an AAS In May.

I decided to stick around for an additional semester that would get me another AAS in electrical technology. (The more automated side of it.) I was supposed to finish this in December, but I was failing a required course and dropped it.

Here are my options: get a part-time job now &amp; continue taking the classes I'm doing good in. I can then attempt to retake the class I was failing in the spring &amp; graduate in May of 2018. The average starting pay with this degree is $23/hr.

Or 

Drop out now and go full-time with the degree I have now. The average starting pay with this degree is $15/hr. 

If I stay and attempt to finish it, the additional classes would only be $1500 in tuition.

I currently have ~$50k in student loans, though the interest is dirt cheap. I have $14k in a mutual fund and $5k in savings.

I'm stuck because the additional degree WOULD be beneficial, but I'd nearly be 25 and 1/2 by the time I graduated without having been in the workforce yet. And I'm scared I wouldn't be able to pass. 

To add to it, the school is 5 hours away from my hometown/ everyone and everything I know. I hate it up there.

206,"Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this. English is not my native language, so I am really sorry if I make any mistakes. 

I'll try to make this short. This year, will be the fourth year since I started studying for this engineering degree, and I will probably finish this degree by the end of 2019. Now the thing is, is not that I hate my degree, I like it, but my potential, that big gift that I could bring to the world is not present in this degree. You might wonder, then why did you chose this degree in the first place? Well, my family always had economical problems and we've never had much, so over the years I promised to myself that I would do everything possible to never face this problems again in my life. That, plus that I always enjoyed all of my math classes in school, lead me to choose an engineering degree, it was a perfect match for me.

I know, that if I finish this degree I'll probably have a good job and all the nice things everyone promises because the world need engineers and bla bla bla. But in my mind, I think that if I am here in this world, then I want to bring the best of myself, my abilities, capacities and share it with the world. And what I know best is connecting with people, I enjoy having meaningful conversations with people and specially interviewing, trying to get the best of people. Over the years I've had several conversations with different people from around the world, and it was life changing for me. 

But, what kind of career is this? what kind of job would aloud me to do this? And even if there is an answer for this, isn't it a bit late? having invested four years into this degree, I feel really bad about droping out now. Also, droping out now would mean spending more time in my parents house and I can't stand living here anymore. In this point, its a dilemma between convenience or passion. Any advice? ",24Sep2017,2

211,"While I'm pretty removed from the situation its really clear this guy has a problem, and goes out of his way to blame other people.

Almost every day I've seen him he will angrily say something like ""I don't have TIME for this bullshit."" its always under his breath but loud enough for everyone to hear.

Well today his grandmothers brother died (I don't know the relationship name...is it great uncle?) and she asked him to do something for her (shes basically immobile) and he started freaking out and screaming about how she was worthless and he hated her. Then when he gets told that what happened he freaks out even more and starts punching holes in the wall talking about how everyone 'just puts everything on him' and they are 'just trying to make him look bad.'

Here is a short list of things that only happened to make him 'look bad.'

My GF graduating college.

The middle child entering college.

His grandmothers brothers death.

His grandfather asking him what his plans for the future are.

I could list a whole lot more but I think you get the picture.

Once while I was around him he got set off because his grandfather (we mostly see him when she goes to family gatherings) asked him a question and he said something like ""I don't have to tell you anything, fuck you."" and he replied with ""Well honestly you should because I'm your grandfather and I'm just trying to look out for you."" To get a response of ""You just want to make me look bad."" Before flying off the handle and screaming at every one and storming out.

None of these people have done anything to him and mostly just want to see him do good in life. When my girlfriend told him she was out of college he screamed at her about how he hoped she failed, and went and told everyone he knows thats black that she told him 'she hates niggers and won't work with them using her degree.' I mean seriously what the fuck? When she brought it up he denied it. When she pressed he started screaming and punching holes in walls before getting thrown out of a restaurant.

They refuse to force him into therapy, and he refuses to go saying he doesn't have a problem and its everyone else. Which is clearly false. His family thinks therapy is strictly for 'crazy' people (Isn't punching holes in the wall over being asked to get someone a drink crazy?) and that it would 'shame the family' and that 'therapy doesn't work.'

Most of his adult family members (hes on the verge of 18.) have openly said they don't want him in their houses anymore. And on one occasion this caused him to try to jump out of a moving vehicle on the highway, in a (really stupid) attempt to take control of the situation. I'm pretty sure this guy is going to wind up homeless despite his 'dreams' of being a massive pot head who doesn't work and makes tons of money off of his music...even though he doesn't actually play in a band, and is at best average at it.

I really don't want this guy in our life but my girlfriend keeps insisting that 'hes family.' I don't really care, my family has a lot of people like him and I avoid all of them.

I was in a very nasty car accident over a year ago and I take Percocet to help me deal with pain 

I just got my prescription filled a few days ago and I leave it inside my room a very safe spot. This morning I go to take some medicine and noticed half my bottle was empty 

I asked my parents was any body in my room and what happen to my pills they said that a exterminator (A-Academy Termite and Pest Control in Howell NJ) was in my room spraying chemicals. I asked them did they go in by them selfs and they told me yes they insisted that my mom was not allowed up stairs because of the chemicals. My mom said they finished in under a minute after they told her to leave. 

Now I know that these guys took my medication and I am stunned and angry. More angry that the fact I am crippled and have to deal with pain for the rest of my life unless I get surgery which I am consulting this week for that. 

I went to the police station and filed a police report I know there's not much I can do. The police also told me the same thing but it's obvious that they did it but with out proof I can't do nothing 

What can I do ? Nothing much I'm guessing besides calling my docotor and pharmacy and showing them the police report. 

I'm in so much disbelief and so upset that somebody would do that to me

My parents and police told me I should keep my medications In a safe place but come on they where in my room where and I suppose to put them up my ass hole? What should I do now? Just wait to talk to my doctor and pharmacy? Contact the buisness owner ? Hide my pills in my ass hole?

215,"(Long post, but I could use the help.)

I'm a seventeen, almost eighteen year old boy who has been accused of many people of being abusive. 

Let me break this down into the main types of abuse, with their common definitions. Although there are, naturally, other issues that fall under each type of abuse, here are the main types and most common traits of each.

- Physical abuse: Violence against a person.
- Emotional/Verbal abuse: Breaking someone down mentally or emotionally through repeated put-downs or yelling.
- Sexual abuse: Coercing someone into sex or restricting contraceptives. This may include sex that is rape, or even sex that isn't necessarily rape, but isn't entirely consentual or may be forced in the sense of manipulation.

My accusation is towards the middle form of abuse discussed, emotional/verbal abuse. 

For a better understanding of the situation, it would be best for me to give you an explanation of myself, my partner, and why I feel that people may perceive me to be emotionally/verbally abusive.

The majority my attributes are traditionally masculine. As a member of a local junior reserve officer training corps wing, I have duties involving regular drill team meetings, community service, and physical training. I'm also on-board as a member of a traveling theatre company, and as an extent of these two hobbies, I can be very loud and confident at times. I also have a tendency to be protective.

My partner is much more submissive and sensitive. They are also emotionally manipulative at times in the sense that always make themselves out to be a victim. They tend to leave out important details about situations to make things look as though they were more of a victim than they had been. Examples in the past include lying about a status in which, they were fully aware that had I known they had, I would not have dated them. While they apologize, they state that had I not been so adamant about not dating people of that status, they would have had no need to lie to me to begin with. 

They also tend to forgive people in the past who have been absolutely horrendous to them, which upsets my protective nature. It also concerns me because I know how often they leave out details that would have otherwise explained this person's behavior. For instance, they used to tell me that an ex had been explicitly abusive towards them, while I learned from a different source that the larger consensus had been that they had been mistreating the ex, and although while both had issues, it was not the black-and-white abuse story that I had believed it to be.

It is to my understanding that my partner doesn't purposefully do this, but rather, that they genuinely see themselves as the victim in these situations. Nonetheless, they could be aware of this, and so I am particularly careful.

However, I have recently been bit in the butt by this. I had met one of my partner's friends and we became good friends ourselves. Sometimes I made practical fun of their friend, but we we're on good accords by all means, and their friend was beyond supportive of my relationship with my partner. 

All of that changed after a conversation with my partner where I explained to them a number of issues that I was currently having with the relationship. My partner disappeared for days on end, and I began receiving messages from their friend. Messages saying things like, ""They hate you,"" ""they're never speaking to you again"", and so forth. Eventually my partner did talk to me, with the story that their friend saw me as abusive and forced them away from me. Which struck me as odd, because we had just gotten along so well before.

""I don't think you should talk to your friend anymore,"" I told my partner, who agreed, but two months later, they admitted that they still spoke to their friend on a regular basis. This struck me as odd, and I'll get back to it.

I've had other people who have spoken to my partner rise from the woodworks to accuse me, as well, of being abusive. These have always been people who have had contact with my partner.  I've always made a point to talk out issues with my partner, and I've asked them as a result of these accusations, ""Am I abusive?"" They said no, and I asked them again with the same answer.

I wound up speaking to a man who had been in an extremely abusive family in the past. I was afraid that perhaps I had been being abusive but was unaware of it. He admitted to me that I didn't show any signs of being an abusive person, and if anything, the fact that I go to such lengths to talk things out proves that I wouldn't be knowingly abusive to anyone.

""Did you happen to talk bad about me to your friend?"" I asked my partner. ""No, I would never,"" my partner said. But it makes no logical sense for their friend to have suddently accused me of being abusive unless they had said something to them. Never in our talks had there been any implication of such - We were downright pleasant with each other. I feel as though my partner did have a hand in this, but won't admit to it, or there is at least some piece to this missing, and despite trying to bring it up with them, my partner keeps eluding me as to what it is. 

Conclusion: I want to trust my partner, but I think they might be talking behind my back, and given their history, I should have seen it coming. ",24Sep2017,1

After having completed nearly all the military requirements (went to MEPs, took the ASVAB etc...) I was denied entry. I decided to go community college to get my grades up and reapply to the schools. During this time I made the bold decision to date my friends ex-girlfriend. Lost all my friends and fell into a deep depression and dropped out of community college, ended up with a 0.5 GPA. Spent the next year working, decided that I wanted to give school another go and after getting my academic suspension lifted, was able to return to the community college.

222,"I'm currently 18, go to community college, and don't think too highly of myself. I've never shared something so personal about me to anyone but I'm at the end of my rope and am desperate for anything to work. I met this girl during my senior year of high school. I met her through a close friend that added me to a chat and didn't start talking to her privately until a month into being in there. She lives nearly across the country from me so I've never met her in real life, so let's just call her Sam. Our friendship quickly blossomed into a unexpected relationship and it was the happiest I've ever been. People say you don't or can't feel live this young, but to me that's wrong. They also say that feeling love at this age won't last and it's just infatuation. I love this girl with all my heart. Our relationship grew into us on the phone everyday sharing secrets, telling each other about ourselves and just being there for each other. I can gladly say I don't think I wouldn't have made it though high school without her. I started to learn about her family, small little things about her that I felt were so perfect, and I believed she was the one. I still do. We started to talk about our future together and where we would live, talk about children, and how many we would have/ talk about names as well. She was so perfect to me that I never wanted it to end. Our conversations were so caring and heartfelt that I would always hate to see them end at the end of a day. We slowly but surely fell into a routine as the days past, calling each other in the morning/afternoon and spending the day together. She never seemed bothered by how much time we spent together; and God knows I didn't as well. We would hate to be apart and always want to spend time with each other. I want to make it clear that none of us were obsessed. When we did have to go, the other would always understand and be patient. Then fast forward into the latest summer and a year Into the relationship, we still have that great connection that we uses to have. Up until the beginning of September. I was starting up community college and she was still in school. I assumed we would keep up our routine as usual but she got busier than usual. So some days we wouldnt talk and I was fine with that and I understood. 



Then, she gets a message from a guy she used to like. They were sort of friends and she used to have a thing for him but it never went anywhere. He just broke up with his ex and needed someone to talk to. Being the amazing person she is, she decided to help him and told me what was going on. Because she used to have a thing for him, I was a little suspicious and worried that he would try something but I trusted her so I let it happen. Then they start spending more time together and I start to feel her slipping away. I try to keep contact with her, but it's not working. Then one day she calls me and tells me she's torn between us. He had just asked her out and she said yes. At that moment I felt my heart break for the first time. She said that she was developing feelings for him again and that she felt conflicted. The reason she told me she feels like that is because he can actual be with her. The physical component is why. And that I can't give her that. Yet I was willing to wait years for her and she uses to say she would as well. She then tells me she wants to do a trial week with him where she talks to him and spends time with him solely for that week and then with me to decide. After talking that doesn't happen and she tells me she's going to decide in a week. It's been a week and she still hasn't picked, even though I can feel her inching away from me and more towards him. We've been talking a lot less, and I don't know where's she been. Almost all the time I'm thinking about her and I miss her. Until today when I'm at a family barbecue at a park close to my house and after not hearing from her after a couple days I decide to call her.


Surprisingly she picks up and starts to talk to me like she hasn't been gone the past almost three days. We start talking normally and apparently she had been out with him the past night. I asked her if anything had happened between them and she told me no but then later told me they she had grinded on him, then later went to a friend's with him and they cuddled. I was silent after she said that. I had no idea what to say or do. I start quietly walking away from the barbecue and slowly start walking home. I ask her if she's decided yet and she said she still can't. I tell her I think she has but she's afraid to tell me. She says she doesn't want to lose me. But I know she's leaning towards him more. The call then ends badly and I'm here now.



I honestly don't know what to do. I feel defeated, heartbroken, and I don't know what to do anymore. I have classes all next week tomorrow and I don't feel like even getting out of bed. I feel so weak. My confidence is at a all time low. I loved this girl so much and she says she loves me but I don't know if she's just forcing it now. I don't want to lose her and I can't bear with the thought of it happening. I feel so close to her and I feel like a piece of me is missing. 


I'm not close enough with my family to talk about this, I'm usually the always happy type with my friends and I don't want to show them how I'm feeling because I feel they wouldn't want to hear about this. I just don't know what to do. I feel so lost. I feel trapped in a corner and the sadness is hitting me too hard. I feel like deleting this because I don't think anyone wants to hear about my problems because they won't want to hear about it and trying to help would just be a waste of time. But I'm trying to stay strong but I just can't. Love at this age hurts more than any emotion than I've ever felt. No one truly tells you about your first heartbreak until it finally happens. And it's even worse when you are all alone. 




Please Reddit, what do I do?

Should I try to get her to choose me or just try to move on? I can't bear the idea of losing her and not being able to hear her voice anymore.

223,"Not sure if this is the right sub..

I'm creating a new club at our high school that focuses on making donations to orphanages overseas. It's not connected through any organization (it's not like I'm creating a new division of Key Club at my school). It's literally a brand new club and I'm not even sure where to begin. 

Can someone who has set up their own charity (or just anyone) guide me through the process of getting money from here to overseas? Should I make donations through the websites? Or through a church organization and then they donate it overseas? Also, if I donate it through the website, how do I get them to recognize my club? Like I don't want them to think it's just a single random person giving a bunch of money to them. Is there a way to forge some business partnership/connection with them so that they recognize me as a donor? ",24Sep2017,1

234,"tl;dr: Dad and brother make racist/sexist/homophobic remarks, but only in private spaces (living room, dining room, car: places no one else can hear it but us). I call them out on it, but they get angry and say they have freedom of speech and that it's not hurting anyone directly so it's ok. Am I wrong or too sensitive for being uncomfortable with their remarks? Should I ignore them?

I've grown up with a single dad and older brother. Being the only girl in the house with a hyper-masculine, over-protective father was tough for many reasons, one of those being his blatant sexism and emotional/verbal abuse. Because of it, I've always been very aware of what he's said and how I feel about it.

When I was about 14 I made the decision to go away to boarding school (thanks to a full-ride scholarship) and was luckily able to escape the toxic environment for a while. Fast forward to postgrad life, and I'm back home for an extended time, for the first time since middle school. One thing I've noticed is that both my dad and my brother are (still) very dense and close-minded. Actually, my brother used to be more open-minded back in the day, but I suppose my dad's way of thinking has rubbed off on him (he's two years older than me and never left home). They often make derogatory remarks about minorities and make rude comments about how women look (""jokes,"" they defend) when we're watching tv or out and about. These comments are made in private spaces, so no one but us can hear. I used to get very angry when they'd say shit like this and yell at them for being assholes, but now I approach the situation in a calm manner, or simply just give them a side eye. Their response, even when I calmly call them out, is to become very defensive and angry, yelling that I'm ""too sensitive"" and ""too-liberal"", that they're ""not racist,"" and then blabber on about how they have a right to freedom of speech. I tell them that yes, they do have a right to say that. You can say whatever the hell you want. But what I'm trying to say is that comments like those can hurt people. Why would you want to hurt someone for no reason? I try to reiterate that it's not right to judge people by how they look -- and why do you care if that girl is too-fat, or what race the bad driver in front of you is? Let people live their lives in peace, it's not that hard. But again, they blabber on about freedom of speech, ect. They proceed to gang up on me, saying I used to be ""nice"", and ""have a sense of humor"", before I went off to boarding school/college. Keep in mind, neither of them are educated beyond high school and we're poor, white immigrants. So I suppose I understand their thought process, in a way. I know they aren't hateful people, but because my family has come from a harsh, impoverished background and are immigrants they excuse themselves from being associated with ""whites"" in America, and because they don't consider themselves white, it's ok to say these things... I mean, I understand the thought process... But I don't think it's ok to make these remarks, whether you're white, an immigrant, or POC... Am I wrong? 

Every time I try to have a rational conversation about the way they speak, I always get scapegoated. And this is how it goes all the fucking time. They say they feel like they can't speak freely around me, but I feel the same way! Am I just supposed to shut up when they fat-shame a plus-sized model, call a black person the n-word, or comment on how ""gay"" a man acts? I wouldn't even consider myself to be ""that"" liberal, I just wholeheartedly believe that you shouldn't use derogatory words or judge people by how they look, especially if the person is not in the room. (Side note: one of their arguments is that they aren't hurting anyone with their words because they would never say any of it to that person's face. But that doesn't make it ok in my opinion :/ )
Idk... This has been going on for years, even when I've visited home before. I'm not that sensitive, and I can take a joke. In fact, I think I have a pretty good sense of humor. But they just say some things that aren't ok to me. It's something that I am passionate about, and somehow that's a good reason to scapegoat me. It's because they're family members that I feel like I especially can't stay quiet. Though, now I'm starting to feel like I should just shut up, even if it bothers me. Advice? Should I approach them differently, or just give up?

Another side note: I've tried ignoring it in the past, but they know what they say and purposefully instigate a reaction from me when I do. They'll look at me and say, ""Oh, sorry, I forgot you were here. Sorry for *offending* you"" and stuff like that.

235,"My english is bad.

So, im in my mid twenties and never had a proper relationship. I want one, but im not very lucky. I was on dating sites (gave up/ rest the whole search thing a little bit) and what i see is devestating.

You know the almost naked posing without any value or something. But the worst part. Everybody wants to be perfect. Average profile looks like this: fashion, money, alcohol, party, career, expensive dinners and this gives them (false) high value. Most girls wants and looks after the outside, not the inside.

But i cant relate to this. I dont care aboit fashion, the looks and other shallow thing. I got plenty of times from girls, that i should wear expensive clothes, go get drunk,spend dayli several hours in the gym, to get girls and so. This is not me and i dont want a girlfriend whos value is only those shallow things. I barely drink alcohol ( i dont think posing with vodka bottle is sexy), i got bored with nightlfe and so on. Because of my value i get from dates all the time that im a good guy and boring because i dont live at night ect.

237,"I am 27 and having a quarter life crisis (which I never thought was real until it hit me like a bag of bricks recently). I have a Bachelors of Business Admin I got in university but I didn't really have anywhere I wanted to go with that. 

I currently am living in Vancouver and have been working as a Production Assistant in film for about 3 years. I enjoy the variety of my job, no two days are the same location or are exactly the same. However the hours are exhausting, and leave little time for a life. I do like being able to work for a few months and then take a few months off. But this leaves me nervous sometimes because my job is somewhat freelance so I am always looking for the next project. Mostly I am tired of working in the department I am in (menial and thankless/low pay) and not finding any ways to move up or out of it. 

I am looking at other career paths that I can try. I would ideally like something that is flexible and not stuck in an office with some variety. I like the idea of working as much or as little as I want. I have the ability to move back home to Calgary and live rent free if I choose to go to school as a possibility. I had thought of something like becoming a massage therapist.

Anyone have any ideas or have jobs they they really like? I don't need tons of money more I want to feel like I am doing something worthwhile rather than wasting my time. Not waking up everything dreading another day

238,"I've experienced a lot in life, I turn 21 in November and I think I'm finally headed in the right direction. I'm going to try to condense my life story into a few paragraphs so you can get an idea of where I'm at in life. I'm half white half Chinese, I was born in Beijing, I grew up in Dallas. My father passed away when I was 11, It affected my life a lot. I started experimenting with drugs at 16, eventually I got hooked on heroin and other hard drugs. 

By 19 I was had a crippling heroin addiction, I used every day. I was a poly substance addict, I used heroin, meth and xanax regularly, I was overweight, unhealthy, depressed, anxious, all of the above. I've never had a strong relationship with my extended family and have a dysfunctional relationship with my mother and sister, whom I live with. I was committing crimes daily to support my habit, twice I managed to get a job serving tables at restaurants and twice I got fired for something that had to do with my drug use. I was a heavy, heavy user, I would flip drugs to support my habit, and steal, hustle, etc. My whole life revolved around my drug use. Last September on the 28th I go to take a psychiatric evaluation before I'm supposed to be placed on probation for a robbery and I tell them I had used the day before. I get locked up and eventually get ordered to do an inpatient program at a judicial treatment center. I resolved to change... Truly resolved.

Eight months later I'm released and I feel, look, and act like a new man, a different person. Part of my probation stipulations is an aftercare program in Dallas county called S.T.A.C.S, it consists of mandatory IOP, AA meetings, weekly court, weekly probation meetings, sanctions and random drug testings. It's been 3 months since I got out and I haven't relapsed, I've been doing very well. However I'm started to feel overwhelmed. One day I couldn't piss for a UA in time at the end of the day, I take it the next morning and pass, but I end up being Sanctioned with 3 days jail which is standard in my program. I end up having to get a drug patch, which I pay $35 to have switched out every 10 days. Two weeks later one of my drug patch comes back positive for heroin specifically which is my DOC. I tell the judge adamantly that I didn't use, I don't even try to give an excuse or say anything about an ""accidental exposure"" or such because I know I didn't use or come into contact with heroin. It seems like they believe me because I was only sanctioned with zero tolerance in my program, which is 30 days of meetings every day and 3 days of jail for any infraction at all. Two weeks later I made the mistake of drinking too much water before a random UA because I was scared I wouldn't be able to piss, and end up getting a diluted UA. Since it's my first diluted UA since I've been out It's only a warning, but since I'm on zero tolerance that's still a 3 day jail sanction. I also get put on mobile breathalyzer that's a $100 a month, and that I have to blow into 4 times a day. 

I understand that this is my second chance and I'm forever grateful that I was lucky enough to receive a second chance, but it seems like this aftercare program is making my life infinitely harder because I'm doing better than I ever have before and still getting punished and scrutinized. I have a decent job as a server and make around $1800 a month. I'm talking to a gorgeous girl but I've never had a real relationship before and I think I'm being too obsessive. I'm just looking for general advice, I don't ever want to be reliant on a substance as a coping method for life again. 

A few more things about me, I'm highly ambitious, I grew up poor, I'm fiercely independent and I want nothing more than to be highly successful, I have no convictions on my record, only a number of arrests. My credit score is bad, around 460, but I'm only delinquent on one thing. I didn't have a lot of guidance in life, I learned through a lot of trial and error, I'm very articulate speaker and been told I'm likable. I'm determined to stay on the right path. 

I don't typically ask people for advice, but I've lately I've been so out of my comfort zone I felt like I should just give it a shot.

**TL;DR;** : Met a girl, liked me, only saw her as a friend at first. No got to know her, developed feelings for her, became friends with her close friends but she might have a new boyfriend(don't interact with each other much).  Usually don't give attention to dating and stuff. I care about her.
I am lost. 
Should I let her know or let her go?

--

I'm not a pro on dating at all, I'm very picky when it comes to women, I only developp feelings if I really like the person that I can see myself longterm with. That's probably why. I never had a gf before (I'm 21).


But I met this girl. 
She initiated conversation and at first I just saw her as a friend. I had the feeling she was into me. She was always with her best friend with whom I got good friends. At first it was a bit awkward because it was as if both of them had feelings for me. 
When only the 2 of us, we would always hang out, sit together in class and eat lunch together with fun discussions, she flirted a lot she would rest her head on my shoulder sometimes during class and always greet each other with tight hug, when we talk we always eye contact most of the time. 

So after a couple of months she invited me to come with her during the vacation with her group of close friends ( her best friend and her best friend's new boyfriend) and we had a great fun time but I never moved on her other than flirting.

Since then, I knew her quite well, we shared a lot in common and I really developped feelings for her. Next semester we would go out together and her close friends (the couple who now became good friend with me) multiple times and always have fun/ fliring. Then came summer break and we did not see each other for a month. We never really texted a lot she doesn't like social media. She did invite me to her birthday and I was the only guy from our college there. I gave her a small gift she mentioned she wanted  in one of our discussions and really loved it. This was in the middle of summer break. 
After that we did not see each other for 1 month before the beginning of the next semester. We always have a good time when we are together we laugh we flirt. She has always been asking me questions and we have really great conversations on a bit of everything except we never talked about relationships. 

At this point she really can't get out of my head, I really like her but I never tried to make a move on her by fear of losing our friendship and by cowardness . 
Then this week I go to a party she organise with her close friend, after her best friend invited me through facebook. 
There were a lot of people from our college, she was acting a bit more distant ( was hanging more with her other friends that I did not really know) but she was super happy I came to the party. I wanted to leave that night because I was not feeling very well and I knew no one apart from her and her close friends, but she insisted that I stay to sleep at her place( she shares a house with her best friend and the close friends I know) so I accepted and she told me I could sleep in the only guest room they had (she slept in her room with other female friends of hers). The next day her sister came over and we had a lot of fun and talked a lot. 
But the second night is where the unexpected happened. We were all talking around the table and I was sitting just next to her. Suddenly one guy gets up to go to sleep and I think kisses(I heard a kiss but did not really see it) and hugs her goodnight. I really was not expecting that, she never mentioned having a boyfriend at all. She immediately left the table after the guy went to sleep and she went to sit in a chair in the corner of the room. It hurt so bad I was sick to my stomach, and left 3min later saying I had to go. She was a bit unusual and seemed awkward that I saw that. I think if they are together it hasn't been for more than a month and I have the feeling she tried to hide it from me during that party (I never saw them together she was always with other friends or me). 


Next time I see her will be in class in a few days. I am so lost I don't know what to do. She is really a really special person to me and I can say I truely have deep feelings for her, on top of that I became good friends with her best friend and other of her close friends.
I feel I waited too long, 
I should have asked her out before and I regret so much.

Do you think I should tell her how I feel and get it off my chest even though she apparently has a boyfriend now? 
Or should I just act as if nothing happened and stay friends ? 
Should I distance myself? 

It seems like all the possibilities will hurt anyway because she maybe likes that guy? Even tho They never really interacted together at the party. Is there a chance still she likes me and will return my feelings?

251,"I just recently started school at my local community college. I had a decent number of friends all throughout high school and found it easy to go about my day having known many of the people in my grade.

As college arrived, all of my closest friends moved away, and only a few of my friends that I am not very close with remain. I feel like I won't really be able to start a meaningful friendship with any of them because we don't really share common interests or the same senses of humor, and I feel as though I would find it difficult to hang out with them on the weekend or something along those lines just because we wouldn't ""click"".

However, lately, a guy that I sort of knew through soccer during high school who went to a different school has been texting me saying we should hang out sometime. I really want to because I feel as though this would be a good way to sort of break out of my comfort zone and he could potentially introduce me to new people, but I feel like I would be really awkward when we hang out and I would squander my opportunity to make any new friends.

Are there any ways to steadily ease in to a new friendship? Or any ways to just meet new people in general? I just want to build meaningful relationships and make friends because my ability to do so is something that I have been very insecure about for a few years now.

I have heavily thought about quitting without notice because I don't even want his reference nor would he probably give me one. With that being said, I have many other people at my workplace that have offered to be a reference for me and their opinion of me would not change regardless of the situation since I am close friends with them.

Now, my question to you guys is, should I just quit on the spot when I get my new job or give in my two weeks?",24Sep2017,1

Now, I'm in a bit of a pickle. The car I had been driving up until now has finally broken down and given up the ghost, so I sold it for parts. My brother moved away to a different state, but left his car here. He has told me that he plans to give/sell it to me, I just have to repair it. 

Here's the issue: He didn't have the title prior to moving and still doesn't, and I""m pretty sure that the city his car is registered requires you to be there in person to request a title. On top of that, the car's registration has expired so I will need to get that renewed, but he doesn't live where the registration says he does anymore.

263,"Lots of problems to unpack here. Looking for advice as to how to get out of this rut or if I should be ok with these problems and not consider them as such.

I'm a 20 year old male who doesn't drink alcohol or smoke weed. Now that's not a judgment on others, it's just I know I have a very addictive personality and should I try these things out I'll dig myself an even deeper hole. Now this might be a sign of maturity for some but I think it's coming out of a place of anxiety. I don't think of myself as responsible enough to be undertaking these activities. I suffer from major anxiety issues whereby I can't stand silence and need to always have some music or TV show playing in the background for me not to spiral into an anxiety-riddled crisis. 

Anyway, so aside from alcohol and weed, I feel like I'm not going through the rites of passage a normal 20 year old should have gone through or be going through in the present. The thought of sex scares me as much as it did five years ago (I am a virgin). Whereas a lot of my friends have even been in a long-term relationship or two, even. 

I feel like I've been stuck with the same emotional maturity level and am in a rut. I felt great until the age of 16 because I still thought I was growing as a person. Now I look back and think that all this time was wasted because I am the same person I was a year ago/2 years ago, etc. Nothing has changed and I'm scared it never will and I'll become a manchild. 

It doesn't help that this fuels my anxiety as well and I study in a university where all the people around me are 2-3 years oder than me and also unwilling to befriend me. 

I'm very scared of coming out of my shell so much so that I can't stand the idea of going to a strip club. it's not like my parents were conservative. I feel like I brought the conservativeness onto myself and became an uptight person at some point.

Why is this? Why do I feel like I'm the only one I know who faces this stagnation in emotional maturity? Even discounting the bias that applies to how I perceive how amazing people's lives are based on what they post on Insta or Snapchat, it feels like they're doing something with their lives and gathering experiences. They will look back and realise the year went by so fast. But they won't say, ""holy shit, I haven't changed at all, what am I doing with my life?"" and will say what I ultimately want: ""man, I did so much stuff and I'm a changed man with new experiences""

Even hanging out with people of my age is a strain because it's a constant reminder that I'm behind. It's not a great feeling. Hanging out with any younger person is also the same because they're going through a rebellious stage which is normal and are my polar opposite when it comes to the point about alcohol and weed for example. They are high on life too and that is what I want. Any younger and it's weird that I'm friends with that demographic.",24Sep2017,1

There are some other things I noticed about myself, for example I hate bodycontact and I lack empathy and don't really care about other people except those  ones really close to me e.g my sister and I even don't care to much about here aswell (just a bit), I also lie a lot, sometimes to avoid social akwardness, sometimes because I think it's fun.

270,"This is gonna be long, so I'll put a TL;DR at the end.

Just to set the scene: I'm an 18yo in uni with more drama going on now than I've ever had in my life lmao.

Basically ever since I was born I've lived on the same street beside the same peeps, and this girl (A) is basically my sister. This isn't one of those ""I'm in love with my best friend"" type things, we've legit grown up beside each other basically in the same home.

A few months ago I started seeing a girl (B) and things were going pretty well but she was moving away at the end of the summer for uni. A wasn't a huge fan of B but we were really only together for the summer so it wasn't an issue.

Kinda out of the blue I started talking to a new girl (C), purely in a platonic sense. Honestly C wasn't even on my radar before we ran into each other while doing a tour of the uni we both happened to be attending in the fall, and I was still seeing B at the time. However, A started talking to C and became really good friends with her. As time went on it became more and more clear that C was super into me. I learned this from my friends, from A, and just from what I could see (ie after parties she took care of me when I was hungover and I napped with my head in her lap, we'd go driving alone together, etc).

Eventually it got to the point where I kinda reached a crossroads, because things weren't going to well with B and A told me C was really unhappy watching me with B (sorry I know that's confusing with all the letters haha). After talking with A about C for so long I decided to go for her instead, and I ended things with B. From this point on things were looking good, I started tentatively hanging out with C and B went away to uni on fairly good terms with me.

After a few weeks tho, things crashed. Out of nowhere C cut contact with me, ended our streak, stopped texting back, etc. I was really confused for a little while, and to add more confusion to the mix C had cut contact with A as well (which was really strange because at this point they had become good friends). After talking with A about it a ton I decided to pull the trigger so to speak and confront C about it. I was on vacation at the time so I could only talk to her over text but C said she was originally planning to talk to me about how things weren't working out once I got back.

I was disappointed obviously but honestly not too shaken up, basically the gist of my response was ""ok I understand, just please don't stop being friends with A on my account"". At first I was good, I came back from vaca and school started and I got a new job, and things were looking good. As time went on tho I felt like I had a hole in me and I started missing talking to C. After almost two months, I still couldn't get over her and I decided to talk to my friend (D) about what to do. D had been good friends with C before he went off to uni too, and so I asked him for advice. He convinced me to try just talking to her as friends again with purely platonic intentions. Now right off the bat she didn't respond for a couple days which wasn't a good sign, but when she did she said how she didn't see things working out between us. For a few days I had her words swirling around in my head, and I couldn't forget what she had said, and I decided to analyze why I felt the way I did. After spending some time contemplating my feelings, I concluded that the reason I felt the way I did was because I had never got any sort of closure. She had ended things without ever telling me really why and for nearly two months I had had questions that I couldn't get answered.

I decided that in order to allow myself to move on, I had to text her how she had made me feel and delete her number to ""delete"" her from my mind as well. One night after work, I wrote a long ass paragraph about the confusion I felt, the fact that I never got closure, and that I would delete her number after this. I know it might not have been the nicest thing to do and I'm sure I said some accusatory things, but I felt I had to ""clear my mind"" so to speak.

For the most part, I was right, and I felt so much better afterwards, like I was finally free. But that next morning I realized I had only DELETED her number but hadn't BLOCKED it, and therefore she could still text me a response. At this point I also realized that I might still subconsciously be waiting for a response, and that wasn't healthy either, so I had to block the number as well.

One thing I haven't mentioned is over those two months A and C hung out quite a lot which I had no issue with. They were friends and there was nothing wrong with that in my eyes. The only issue was A is honestly one of the biggest snakes I know (and I say that in a loving way). She just loves to gossip and she always unintentionally spreads around things people say to her. This means that almost everything I said to A about C would make its way to C even if I didn't want it to. This also meant that A had learned about the texts I sent C.

Consequently, when I asked A for C's number so I could block her A thought I was gonna start texting C again and told me I have to leave her alone. Don't get me wrong, I know I was crazy and messaging a girl you weren't even technically dating two months later was bat shit insane, but I had my reasons. We had been taking for months beforehand even if we weren't dating, and I felt I had to msg her in order to move on.

But the thing is, the way A said it and the fact that for the past two months she had been ""siding"" with C hurt me. In our 18 years, A has always vented to me about whatever's going on in her life, and I've never complained about anything. I never talked about my feelings or anything to A and I've never told anyone about all the things A told me.

But at this vulnerable point in my life, when I was experiencing feelings of confusion and loss and didn't know what to do, I felt like she wasn't there for me. Anything I said would end up being trumpeted to the world and C would hear about it. That's just the way A is, and I've always known she likes gossiping, it's just she's always had me to lean on, and at the time when I needed her help, she would almost rather be friends with C.

Now today, I don't know what to do. I feel I'm on track to move on from C, which I'm happy about. However, I can't forget A's words about leaving C alone, which make me feel like I'm a creep and a pervert. I know that's not her intention, but I also know that since A knows about my texts it's only a matter of time before she tells people. I'm at the point where I feel like shit with no direction, because while I think I can finally move on from the girl I've been obsessing over for months, I've sort of lost my best friend in the process.

Where do I go from here?

The thing is, she never starts/initiates the conversations ever, it's always me. She never wants to call me, finds reasons to avoid my calls and gives bullshit excuses for not being able to talk but posted recently about how another friend of hers up and randomly called her telling her how awesome she was which made her day. She also didn't get me a birthday gift as I did for her, and she went and bought her new friend a record player around the same week of my birthday.

Example: Person in question got mad when I chuckled that about person having missed a spot while cleaning with a hand brush. I wasn't trying to be rude. I explained myself calmly. And got out of said persons room.
Another time I was trying to explain a situation that had arose but was quickly interrupted and instructed to take conversation to more private quarters by said person. (Before I divulge more into this,I'd like to point out that I don't like tip toeing around people in a truth or lie sense. If I need to talk about something I will if I feel its not private. But if need be, I will respect your wishes.)Anyway this conversation was only about money matters. And not even said persons money. It was my money in question. Helping said friend out with things and I guess they didn't want but a few people hearing. But what really struck me was the way said person handled it when we were in private. Saying they didn't want a certain person knowing this and I should know better than to give away this information. They were belligerently mad and disregarded what I was saying. I get that maybe I should've handled the information more privated but you don't need to make me feel useless.

286,"Eighth grade was very easy for me, and I ended up getting into the IB Program at a prestigious high school in my area. However, I'm now in tenth grade and I feel that I am wasting my teenage years. The school is an hour away, and I leave home at 6 AM everyday only to get home at 5 PM. As soon as I get home, I have a pile of homework to tackle until around 10 or 11 PM, sometimes after midnight if I start a bit late. Even on the weekends, I have a ton of projects to handle and exams to study for, and I'm becoming very sleep-deprived.

On top of it all, my dad is currently working in another state, and only comes home on weekends. As a result of this, I can't go to any extracurricular activities after school, because my mother has to pick up my sister who is in a school that is farther away. I also want to get a job in my junior year, but I cannot if I only get home by 5 PM.

I have found a solution to my problem, but my parents aren't being super supportive. My solution is to go to my neighborhood school. My neighborhood school starts earlier than my current school, and it ends earlier too. It's also only about a mile away. This means that I'd get up at 6:30 AM and I could be home by 2:30 PM. I could also just bike home after school, which solves the distance problem, and I'd be able to do clubs, extracurriculars, and get a job. The school isn't as hard on its students either, and I wouldn't have as much homework. 

My neighborhood school is still a pretty good school with a program similar to the IB.

287,"I met a girl on this anonymous app (not a dating app like tinder, bumble, etc), and we hung out several times but never did anything sexual (tickle fights and cuddling doesn't count). The first time I brought her over, my roommate was super impressed and very happy for me. He's a really nice guy, has taken me out to dinner and has done a ton of favors for me. He even offered to drive her to our place if she needed a ride. I can't emphasize enough how great of an overall person he is. When he asked how we met, I introduced him to the app I used and taught him how to use it. 

Anyway, about this girl. I learned that she's been meeting several other men on the same app and have been hanging out, sleeping with them, etc.. At this point I knew I didn't really have a chance with her since I was competing with 8+ other dudes, half of which she has already slept with, so I decide it's best if we just stayed friends despite the fact that I'm sorta am still attracted to the idea of hooking up at some point (even though it won't happen). Because I do like her company. 

My roommate let's me know that he met this girl on the same app, and I'm like ""cool"" because I don't think he'd do *that* to me (see title). Turns out he did. When I asked him about it, he said it didn't go anywhere but I know for a fact that she slept with him. How? The same way I knew about the other guys. I spoke to her on the same app pretending to be some other random stranger (sneaky, I know). 

So now I dont know if I should confront him or not. What can I say? We are/were good friends. He doesn't know I know this. He's my roommate, things can't be awkward... but what if he does something similar again with a girl I actually have a chance with. I'm not pissed, just disappointed that he lied. I'd be very fucking angry if it was a girl that I had a chance with. 

Also, what should I say to the girl? She's already mentioned 2 of the guys to me, in which I reacted negatively.. causing her to react negatively..... and by talking to her through the app as someone else, I already learned about a few lies she's told me. Is it worth being friends if I know she's meeting a new guy every 2 days and sleeping with every other dude? Should I expect her to replace me completely eventually, and just cut out the friendship?

291,"I am going to be scheduling a counseling session about this soon. In my experience, if you haven't really needed counseling in a while and need to go back, it can be a while before an appointment opens up. So, I wanted to see what ideas people here might have.

When I was 10 (I'm 24 now), I was molested by my friend's older brother. Their mother was my summer babysitter. I was swimming in their pool while the older brother, who was 14, was swimming on the other side of it. Suddenly, he started asking me to have sex with him. I was disgusted and I said no, he said he would pay me for it, and I started going over to the ladder to get out. He grabbed me between the legs, and I pushed him and escaped the pool. I told his sister, who told her mom, and then my mom called the police that night. I never went back to their house, I had to switch schools, and I lost two of my best friends. 

At the time, switching schools and losing friends was scarier than what was done to me. But, over time, I started feeling triggered by certain things. When I was 18, I saw a newspaper article about another 10-year-old girl that had been molested, and I had to go cry in the bathroom for a few minutes. I have a hard time picturing the assault in my mind because to do so causes me to feel like I'm going to vomit, so I stop. 

I currently work as a paraeducator for low-functioning children with special needs. Some of them aren't yet potty-trained, so we change their diapers. I hadn't done it before, but I learned and it wasn't really that bad at first. However, I started feeling anxiety at having to see the children's genitals. I realized that it's because seeing the children in a vulnerable situation like that puts me right back into the mindset of feeling like I might not be able to escape the assault. 

It is confusing to me because the children I change are little boys, and I was a preteen girl that was close to puberty. What I'm seeing doesn't look anything like it did back then...but the thought of putting someone in a vulnerable situation even though I'd never do anything to them is really, really bothering me. 

I have no idea how to deal with this. Any insight would be appreciated.

294,"Hey all. I like to think I'm a pretty strong person. I've spent my whole life building up an immunity to shit. I have an anxiety disorder (like my mom) but its been drilled into me that I shouldn't bother anyone with it, and until I was in my late 20's I never even acknowledged it. I saw a therapist for 8 months 4 years ago, when my insurance covered it, and all that did was verify that I have an anxiety disorder and that that I should keep with mindfulness and meditation practices and see a psychologist (not covered by HMO).

Our financial issues have compounded over the last couple of years (since I was laid off) so seeing a psychologist or therapist isn't really an option. 

So, I just started a new job that was supposed to be a dream come true and turned out to be a real nightmare. My bosses are bullies, my coworkers are all back-talking, melodramatic, blame-seeking drama queens, and I'm expected to work 14 hour days while being paid for 8. It took me A WHOLE YEAR to find THIS job. I don't sleep at might. I cry in the bathroom stalls daily. I feel like a piece of shit every day.  So I'm looking for another option, and my hard-working husband and I have decided to move back close to family by the time our lease is up (oct 2018). Until then, I need help. 

I spoke to my doctor and she offered to give me 4 Xanax pills to ""get me through"", but like... what. I can't afford a psychiatrist. My Mom keeps saying""just see a female nurse practitioner and tell her you need some Paxil"". But when I say that to anyone here, they treat me like a drug addict. My $800/month health insurance is the lowest tier. I don't get most things covered. I am still looking for work and at this point I'm just taking anything I can get my hands on to stay sane. Mostly alcohol. Weed makes my anxiety300x worse. I cry every night. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can convince my doctor to give me something better for my constant anxiety? How do I convince people of my situation? Has anyone else been in this situation? I'm pretty desperate. I feel utterly hopeless.

296,"I'm a female in my 30s.  I work at a crappy part time minimum age job,  was originally like 10 hours a week just to give myself some play money and get me out of the house a little, as my husband is a full time worker.  I recently picked up full time hours as we have some home repairs to do and car repairs and I want to help pitch in so the burden is not on my husband alone.

The assistant manager is in her 20s.  She's engaged.  I've been working there almost a year now and since I've started she's been openly talking about some dude she's been sleeping with and apparently another one before him,  all while being with this fiancé. 

Anyways,  my best male friend has the hots for her.  She knew.  Eventually she says to me ""tell your friend ya"".  So they started talking and discussing meeting up for sex.  He slept with her one time.  Mind you,  the other manager and myself have seen all the text messages about her telling him how tight she is how she wants to let up soon blah blah blah.  

The week after they slept together she pulled down her shirt at work showing me a hicky.  This hicky is from the other guy (not the fiancé) she has been sleeping with.  Says her fiancé saw it, she said it was a scratch (hickies don't look like scratches lol), and she said that he didn't believe her (ya no kidding lol).  -  she also sent my friend a topless pic of her with that hicky she got after sleeping with my friend. 

Now let's fast forward to a week after that.  I wake up on a Tuesday morning with texts from my bff saying the assistant managers bf showed up at his work 4am (he was heading in as he is a truck driver) and rammed his car into my bff's truck.  So he went to the police station and when he came back this fiancé showed back up with a friend wanting to fight.  Needless to say the fiancé was arrested and charged with some felonies.

So this assistant manager was at work when I showed up and I wasn't getting in the middle of it as it wasn't my business and love my friend but shit happens lol.

Before the assistant manager leaves,  one of my coworker looked worried. Says to me ""have you heard about what happens to the assistant manager""?  I laughed and I'm like ya they are all dumb pretty much.  I end up talking about what I knew about as we were on a smoke break.  After the assistant manager left this coworker comes back to me and is like ""I really need to tell you something"". Come to find out she is telling everyone I work with my friend raped her and that's why her boyfriend attacked him and got arrested.

I was FURIOUS!!!! He's basically family to me and was not only my officiant but also my maid of honor for my wedding I just had in June.  

I called the manager PISSED saying when I clock out I'm not coming back,  I quit,  I can't work with her,  etc.... my manager wasn't happy with the information as she knows my friend as well AND she's seen all the messages. She managed to talk me into staying (I really need the money anyways so after calming down I was like fine but one of us needs to be transferred).  The manager told her boss and it looks like nothing is being done and they wanna kinda sweep it under the rug.  

Between then and now I've had her bf try to intimidate me at my job,  her whispering behind my back,  and her giving me the dirtiest looks.... I seriously feel like I'm in high school again. 

Every day I work with this idiot and it pisses me off.  You'd figure after me finding out she would stop,  but I stopped in today (Sunday) to find out she told other people the same story and asking them to back her up if I try to fight her at work.  I'm a 34 year old mom who needs the money,  sort little girl you're not worth losing my job and going to jail ok lol

So since my informal complaint got me nowhere I will be doing a formal complaint.  But idk... what kind of crazy bs is this!!? What do you guys got for me?  What should I do?  What should my friend do to make sure he's safe if she tries going to court with this shit?  Apparently this is her plan to keep her fiancé out of jail.  It's a shitty job but right now I need it... how do I protect myself?  FYI,  I'm the hardest worker there and usually end up doing everything myself... I've never been late... never called out once.  

Like anything... input, advice, etc....

297,"I dropped out of school the day of my first clinical rounds. I was afraid and panicked, drove around the hospital for 15 minutes before pulling into the nearest fast food parking lot and crying. It has been 2 years and I have been thinking of going back. I have self-esteem issues and have always had this idea of myself being a fake, and not being as good as my test scores show. If asked about anything I was learning I found that it was hard for me to explain. I regurgitate information instead of actually learning. I would like to go through the program from the beginning but when I left my teacher told me I should finish and could really succeed. I only have clinicals, one semester, and another round of clinicals. 


More back story-When I left school I emailed my teacher and wrote how upset and sorry I was about not showing up to the clinical rounds. She thought I was suicidal and called the police. After a few months of half assed counseling sessions and taking anti-depressants (irregularly, not taking them properly) I just ignored everything and focused on my job that I'd been working at for a few years. Applied for the manager position, got it, and tried not to breakdown every time someone brought up school. Again, lately I feel like going back would be good for me. Finishing and really knowing if I can do it.

298,"I'm 41 years old, white, fairly well put together. I have an English BS and an MFA in Filmmaking from a fairly ok university. I currently live in LA, after basically just shitting away the past 20 years on alcoholism and mental health issues. But I am good now, stable and healthy and ready to move forward. I have no money, no credit (a 4-year-old bankruptcy), completely insane student loans in deferment... No car, some ok clothes, and (fortunately) a girlfriend who has been with me through all of this and with whom I am now patching a lot of things up with.

What I do have: A laptop, all the Adobe Software I got when I was in school so it's CS6... I am a really good video editor, a pretty good graphic designer, an excellent writer, and none of these things seem to be getting me anywhere.

I'm trying to do the whole freelance thing, but it's so hard to even be heard above all the noise. I finally a few weeks ago got a job editing porn, which was really cool but the guy paid me but never followed up again. I have a few things out there, but I just...

OK, so, the advice part. This is my situation. I'm not homeless or anything, I have some work that comes in, but I really want to know what you guys think I should do next... What should I concentrate on? What will get me closer to some kind of stability? I've literally never had it.

299,"Hey,
I just went through a rough break-up and kind of wanted some female attention. Out of the blue a girl DM'ed me on Instagram. We started chatting and she was out for one thing and that was sex. Needless to say she started sexting. One thing led to another and she sent some naked pictures of ""herself"". She asked if she could get some pictures back and I said no, but as the days passed I got comfortable enough to send one. She got one from me in my full glory with my face on it (I know, dumbass)... A few days later my friend and I did some research and we found out the account was a fake. I'm freaking out right now because if that photo leaks my career might be in serieous jeopardy.

It honestly seems like there is nothing that I can do aside from pursuing a degree in history.

301,"I think I'm planning on applying RD to Vassar and Middlebury. Trying to figure out if I should apply to one of them ED instead, or, if I do apply RD and get into both (not to be presumptuous), where I should go. I want to probably double major in theatre and English; also really want to learn foreign languages.
Here are the main pros and cons for me:
Vassar pros: both of my sisters went there so I know the school well and I'm pretty sure I would like it, strong theatre program, good english program, good music program, people seem pretty cool, beautiful campus, my sister is a junior there so if I went we would be there at the same time and we want to make theatre/art together anyway, I have a better chance of getting in, prevalent queer culture (I'm a gay guy), and it seems like the theatre program might be a bit more experimental/open to different types of theatre which is what I'm looking for
Cons: Poughkeepsie is not really what I'm looking for in terms of location, I think (I might be wrong) that Vassar is less academically rigorous than Middlebury, I get the sense that while there's a lot of racial/socioeconomic diversity, there isn't really diversity in terms of opinions/personalities and even though I'm pretty liberal and would fit in, I don't want to just be exposed to similar minded people
Middlebury pros: really strong language program, connected to its own off-broadway theatre company, more students studying abroad, more rural setting, attracts more outdoorsy types, seems like it might be more academically rigorous, there's funding for student produced theatre, they have a 4-1-4 academic calendar, there seems to be more diversity of opinions
Cons: less queer culture/people, I don't know the school as well as I know Vassar, the campus is nice but just generally laid out very strangely, I don't know if the theatre program offers opportunities to do more experimental stuff (e.g. Butoh, Grotowski style theatre), I don't know how I would fit into the culture, I have less of a chance of getting in.

These are my thoughts; if anyone has gone to Middlebury or Vassar or if you just have advice, I'd very much appreciate it.",24Sep2017,1
302,"First, let me thank you all for the insights and advice from my previous post (about the Harley Quinn poster, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/71s5s9/im_a_30_year_old_nerd_thats_having_a_girl_over/) it was extremely helpful and I have decided to leave the poster up.  

I don't intend to have any ladies in my bedroom anytime soon, but something one of the comments said really stuck with me.  A while back, after my ex and I parted ways, I purchased a body pillow to help me sleep at night, as I had been sleeping with another for several years.  Well anyways, the pillow case for it was getting a bit thin from washing and whatnot, so I bought a new one.  It was around the time that Nier: Automata as released, so my new body pillow cover featured 2B because I was really into the game (still am, too, though it will never be quite as dear to me as Portal :-P).  Here's the image (front and back) of the pillowcase in question: https://imgur.com/a/hMakG

Now I realize that this is much more sexual than the Harley Quinn poster, but that isn't the reason I chose it.  I just like the game and the character and when I happened across this on Amazon I thought ""Oh, cool, that one!""  If I had stumbled across a GLaDOS pillow case I would have gotten that!  Cool androids and AIs are just something I really like.  

Should I hide this or remove the pillow from my bed entirely before anyone would go into my room?  I want to be myself.  Myself is not at all misogynistic and I don't objectify or sexualize women (or men, or any other person for that matter).  Yet I'm worried that this pillowcase my imply I do or upset/offend someone.  

Please, throw your advice and guidance my way again?  It would be greatly appreciated. ",24Sep2017,1
303,"Hi all,

So I'm currently 26 years old and about to finish my PhD in chemistry. Job wise I'm possibly looking to be leaving the city I've spent my whole life in and moving far off to pursue my career.

The niggle I have is that my parents are both showing empty nest symptoms while my older brother is still in the house. He is currently 34 (but that's really another story)

I've been moved out for about 3 years now but I live in a flat that is about 5 mins away from the parents home. Therefore i'm still in contact with them fairly often and see them once a week.

What concerns and worries me is how both my parents act when ever I leave after I visit. Both seem to be really sad whenever I leave and there's almost a desperation in their words when they're asking when I'll be up next. Now that I'm thinking of moving away I'm struck with a feeling of guilt as to what this is going to do to them.

I thought the feelings would pass throughout the relationship but the feelings were always strong, constantly thinking about her and even more now that we've broken up. My ex even told me several times that she likes me. 

However they are still friends and it would obviously be wrong if I were to try something but the feelings are so strong it's hard to handle it all.

Is the mature thing just to bottle it up? Do I just get on with life with that sinking feeling of 'what if'?

Debating French because I took a year and a half of French in high school, I dropped out before the final so I feel a little less confident about the entire thing now. I don't know how useful French would be, as I don't know of anyone who actually speaks it around this area.

Also debating Japanese because it would be something totally new and different and that's what college is about right? I'm also a weeb so I have a slight interest in it. I live in the Bay Area where we have a pretty big Japanese community, so I feel like it might be more useful. I'm mostly worried about having to learn a new alphabet or different characters.
