3,"I was looking through my bookshelf to narrow it down and out of curiosity I looked up the price of a Bill Nye book I had, it is the consider the following book. The version I have was going in the 430 U.S. dollar range. I was in disbelief so I waited a little over 6 months to see if the price would go down. To my surprise it went up to the 470 U.S. dollar range. The more places I look the more I come to realize this seems to be rare and the real deal. The reason it is rare is because it is the library binding hard cover version of the book and that many were thrown away or discarded. The ISBN-10 is 0-613-12519-3 the ISBN- 13 is 978061312519.

You have totally forgotten about me, us, this week. It broke my heart. You didn't send one picture. Not once did I get a good morning or a good night, how are you, whatcha been up to. NOTHING.

17,"I was going to ask if I should trade off my group therapy with one on one therapy, but I thought about the whole thing. Why SHOULD I have to go to therapy? Why do I have to go through with this?

I just had a small argument with my mother in the car. It was like an interrogation room in that car. Asking me when my dad is going to pick me up. Asking me when he is going to drop me off, and if he'll drop me off before group session starts. I say that I di not know, and she starts assuming out of her ass. Then she's forcing me to call the fat bastard...

Im just so tired. I don't want to call the fucking guy. Why does she not get it? Why can't SHE call him? They created this visitation bullshit, she should AT LEAST call HIM to figure shit out. Fuck, I just want to lay down and stop breathing this weekend. But I HAVE to do this. Hey, mom, im already being dragged out of my home by my hair. You can at least speak to him. 

Then she mentioned something about my dad knowing about my therapy and I just snapped. I just wanted her to stop fucking talking for just a few moments. I just had a bad therapy session...I just wanted to be left alone. I won't go into details, but im just sick of her shit. 

During my therapy session, I had to think about going into my fathers house. It opened up too many wounds. I just wanted to go home, go downstairs, and just wait until tomorrow comes. But no. I have my mom jumping down my throat about visiting my dad. It's bullshit.

Im just so tired of this - the visitation, my moms constant yap, my dads condescending behavior. Im jusy so tired. I always wondered if dying is a bad thing. I mean, im free! No more annoying noises, or bad days....im free. Roaming in darkness. Finally, time to myself. I can finally be alone if I die.

Is death really a bad thing? If I die, then I stop being unhappy. And I am tired of being unhappy. Really, why should I not just do it and leave. Im just so sick of it. 

I also miss my dog too. She died a few months back. If I leave, I might see her again. It seems like a good deal, when it means I don't have to deal with the toxicity in my life.

20,"So I am a Freshman, about to become a sophomore in high school and I need some advice on how to approach my current situation.

About 4 months ago I began an online calculus 1 course online to do over the summer with the end goal of skipping the class so I may start calc 2 at the beginning of my sophomore year. The problem I just found, however, is that my course only covers half of the material taught in calc 1. I have about half of the course to go still because I thought ""Hey, I've got plenty of time, I don't need to finish this that fast"", so now, the summer is half over and I still have half of my active course to go, plus the other half not included in the active one. 


Worst comes to worst, I can probably finish my active course in about 1-2 weeks if I 'eat sleep and breath' calculus. But I don't have time to do the other half.


Now comes the part where I need advice, my sister offered to teach me everything I need to know about the second half. I know it will go better and faster with her, but I don't want to strain myself too far. Furthermore, I would need to take a placement test at the beginning of the school year to prove that I know the material.

As I see it there are two options, I can either work my ass off for the rest of the summer, and still maybe not make it. Or I can finish the online calc 1 course but not skip it during the schoolyear, and take the easy A. 

Can you help me r/advice?

30,"Hi reddit,

I'm currently 16 (and obviously in high school) and have been thinking about my future a lot recently. I have passions for several different careers and disciplines but am not sure which to generally push towards. This is probably rather incoherent as I'm kind of just pushing more abstract ideas to words. 


Passions: 

I enjoy computer science (specifically the security aspects of it) a lot and am fairly accomplished. I'm getting more into CTFs but regularly competitively program (USACO/CodeForces; silver USACO blue CodeForces).


I enjoy investment and the stock market both on a theoretical level and actual level and am somewhat accomplished (largely thanks to the recent tech stock volatility (that I've been on the right side of) and am at 8% returns in about two months and manage what started out as $25k. I also really enjoy cryptocurrency and the blockchain (I have my own personally built ethereum miner @ 160mh/s) , but that's more of a personal interest/hobby than actual career path. 



I really enjoy law and specifically the intricacies and phrasings that allow for loopholes and read state/federal legislation for personal enjoyment. I participated in mock trial, but found that it was much more focused on the litigation and trial aspects as opposed to the more ""behind-the-scenes"" aspects that I enjoy (contracts, legal code, etc). I have founded my own LLC for the investments that I currently own. 

Ideally I would want something that combines these passions, but I'm not sure where to go. I've considered the PhD/research course for computer science research, but not sure I want to exclude so many other passions from my life for such a long period of time. I'm not sure I want to go to law school and end up with an incredible mountain of debt. I don't really want to be an investment banker as I believe it would change me into a money hound and ruin my creative side. That said, I do believe I would enjoy the environment environment that a business law career would lead to (I work much better under pressure than I do without)  and a high salary is still somewhat important to me. I've also considered government, but I'm not sure I would be incredibly fond of the extreme rigidity and low salaries.


Sorry for the incredible blocks of text and ranting, but any help/guidance is appreciated. ",30Jun2017,1

33,"To begin with, I'm 21 years old and a sophomore in college. Somewhere around when I was supposed to be headed to middle school ( I can't recall which grade,) my parents withdrew me from traditional schooling to be homeschooled. I was kind of shy to begin with, and my parents are accurately described as misanthropic, so from the beginning of middle school until I began college, I had very little interaction with people who were not my immediate relatives.

I don't have any friends from high school, and I'm having a really hard time connecting with anyone, like at all. I almost feel like I don't remember how to interact with people.

35,"More than a year ago, I was renting a room from someone. My mom was living in another city. She had recently broken up with her boyfriend after he cheated on her for the second time and she was feeling extremely lonely. She began crying to me on the phone about how alone she was and I told her that if she felt lonely, we could move into together. So we got an apartment together.

Her boyfriend had contracted cancer before they broke up. He was living with his mother after they broke up and for some reason or another, he was going to get kicked out. My mother asked if he could come stay with us because he was dying. I told her that I didn't particularly want him to but as long as I wasn't expected to help him in any medical capacity, that was fine. We lived for approximately 5 months with only small issues between us.

We moved last month and that's when things began to sour.  Before the move, my old desk had been damaged when it put into the storage container and it was in pieces. Her boyfriend told the movers not to load it into the truck so that it could be thrown away. I told them that it was my desk and that we were bringing it to the new property.

Once we arrived at the new property, he told the new movers not to place it with the rest of the items in the garage because it was going to be thrown away. He then placed it outside. It was the only item from the truck that was not put into the garage.

After the move, the garage was in shambles. Boxes upon boxes everywhere in no discernible order. I spent a good three full days in 90+ heat rearranging all of the boxes  into categorical piles. My items, his items, my mother's items, items that need to be gone through, etc. etc.

A couple weeks later,  he went through the garage and moved all of my stuff without bothering to ask me. Additionally, the desk that I had saved, he attempted to appropriate it. The top piece he had taken and placed into his pile of items. The two sets of drawers he had placed outside and was using it in some way that was unclear to me. One piece is still missing and I have no idea what he did with it.

I then took all of the items that were reasonable for me to take and place into my room. After I did so, he asked if I was going to use the drawers because he was using them for a project.

Now what really bothers me about this is that he had the audacity to try and throw away something that belonged to me then when I saved it so that it could be used, he tried to take it from me so that he could it use for it himself. This really bothers me.

Now, I've been digging up the backyard for this project I'm working on. While doing so, I've come up across an inordinate amount of junk from the previous neighbors. Some of this stuff could actually be reused. I placed all of the junk in one pile and was going to go through it to see what could be salvaged. (One particular set of items was a pair of hinges that were basically brand new.) 

Today, he was talking to me while I was digging and noticed the pile. Without saying anything, he picks up the hinges then goes back, grabs a bucket, picks through the pile and heads back inside. 

When this happened the first time, I talked to my mother about his behavior. He's done other things after that first time and she's expressed to me that he's not receptive to what she's saying. She's broken into tears regarding the whole situation repeatedly and has expressed a general sense of helplessness. 

Now some of you say may say, ""Why don't you talk to him?"" Firstly, I don't believe that would be productive in any way. If I did talk to him, it wouldn't be nearly as politely as the way I would talk to my mother about the situation. Secondly, I don't really trust that would lead to anything. His response would most likely be polite and receptive but he would continue whatever behavior because that's who he is. Because I have no actual power to force him out of the house, I don't really see the point in talking to him even if my mom wanted me to. 

I'm not sure if I can continue living here, but if I moved out I feel I would lose a lot of respect for my mother. At one point in my life, I asked why she decided to have me as a single mother and she said that she didn't want to be alone.

Now that's a little cringeworthy, I know, but it kinda characterizes the relationship between her and I. It also puts us moving together in a different context. The way I see it, I was the only person that was there for her after this same boyfriend cheated on her twice. The fact the she allows him to behave like this towards me due to either her feelings of pity for his imminent death or her fondness for him disgusts me. To put it simply and vulgarly, it makes me think she's a basic bitch.

In terms of advice, I'm mainly trying to get another person's perspective. I know the characterization of my mother isn't necessarily reasonable but is everything else reasonable?",30Jun2017,1

She was taking me home the night before yesterday and I told her that I was gonna take her on a date the day of her birthday so she wouldn't be able to plan anything. She thought it was weird that I worded it like that but when she understood that it wasn't a romantic advancement she was cool with it and said she'd be down. After that she said we'd do a ""girl's day"" the next day (which's yesterday).

She called me asking to pick me up and I told her that any time was good since I already showered, so she said she'd shower and be over to pick me up and take us to her house. We were there for like 4-ish hours and she told me she was gonna shower again (she never showers twice in a day because her hair gets super frizzy &amp; she hates it, plus we were going to a water balloon fight so it was a super inconvenient time to shower)

As she was leaving her room I said ""watch out for the cameras"" as a joke and she was like ""oh shit,"" as she was leaving the door she saw that I didn't get up and said ""I thought that you wanted to come with me"" and I was like ""No?"", ""You sure?"", ""Yes?""

She changes tone whenever she says one of those sexual jokes but she didn't change tone and seemed genuinely disappointed as she was leaving her room. The rest of the day (yesterday) was fine.

Today we were together again and she was significantly less touchy than usual (both her and I are decently touchy people) and I don't know, am I just overthinking this whole thing?

48,"Hey guys, I recently found what I am quite sure is my job posted through a staffing agency on Indeed.com a few days ago. The description of the job is almost identical to the posting from when I applied to get this job. The job title is the same and even the advertised pay is very close. While they are keeping company details confidential, I had a friend call and they didn't tell her much except about the industry and type of work. That did confirm the industry and approximate location, and it fits exactly.


 I checked on my employers site and it is not listed there. I have been here 7 months now and have never been given any indication that I've had poor performance. My boss and I get along but I wouldn't say we have a great relationship. Unfortunately, she is the only person I work with as we are a department of two. I can't imagine adding another person to the department as our projects have slowed down and she actually doesn't give me any substantial work. Since I started, I've been kept out of the loop on project details and I pretty much just do what she wants me to do for that day or week, so information and tasks are pretty filtered. I was promised a lot of interesting work and projects before being hired on, but none of then have happened. She is currently on vacation but the first day she was gone, she had a co-worker awkwardly check in on me. My boss has been gone before for multiple days and never had anyone come check in on me. She also did not leave me much work to do while she was gone.


Should I be concerned? It has been suggested to me to approach HR and ask about the listing but I'm not sure that's a good idea (or that I have the guts)...

My problems are, should I take the 2nd part time job on top of the first if it is offered to me, should I talk to my employer about the 2nd job (I plan to ask about a fixed schedule next time I see him), how do I quit my job(s) after only working for a few weeks without burning any bridges and being able to use people as references for future jobs?",30Jun2017,1

I've been in an interracial relationship for almost 4 years now and my family does not know because of muslim traditions. I'm moving out to gain some peace because my anxiety stems from constantly lying at home (where it's more difficult hence why I am leaving) but I am not sure how to get away with moving out and hiding the fact that I will be living with my significant other. I'm moving a bit far away, but not too far where they couldn't reach me if they wanted to. Plus I know that they would like to be involved in the process because they are over protective and want to help me as much as they can. Any advice would be helpful because this is a big life decision that I am firm on and I am not sure how to approach it with my family. I want to maintain a good relationship and work on it more after moving out with my family, but I am worried about the anxiety that will come with trying to get away with this new moving out situation that includes lying about someone I'm going to live with. This feels like an even bigger lie and I'm not sure how to handle it correctly that'll keep everyone happy to an extent. I don't want my parents to find out and do/say who knows what, I don't want to put my partner through a ton of hassle that makes him feel like he's not even welcome to get comfortable in our home, and I don't want to create more anxiety when I'm trying to get away from it in the first place. I don't plan on mentioning him until we are ready to get married after experiencing living together. How do I get away with living with my partner by pretending I live on my own for my parents?

56,"Hi folks,

Back in July of last year, I started work with an employer who offered me a lump sum of $5000 relocation assistance. The company itself took on the tax grossup amount, so the total expense on the company's end was approximately $7000. I took it and signed a document stating that if I leave the company in less than a year, then I would have to pay back a prorated amount depending on how many months I would work there. Additionally, if the relocation amount is not repaid in full during the same tax year, the tax grossup amount will be added to the amount due as well.

Fast forward by 8 months to February of this year, and I was terminated due to certain circumstances. I received a correspondence from the employer two weeks later, stating that if I don't pay back to relocation amount, I will not be eligible for rehire with the company.

I emailed their collections department as to whether any legal action would be taken or if it would show up on a credit report. They replied that it wouldn't, and that they'd simply mark me as ineligible for rehire until the repayment is received in full.

During the termination I was already informed that I wouldn't be eligible for rehire, and I don't plan on ever working for the company in the future either. Is this relocation obligation something I should honor? I understand that not doing so is crass and rude, but would this come back to haunt me anytime in the future?",30Jun2017,2

I'm an aspiring SFX artist, and for most of my looks I end up having to cover my eyebrows with glue or medical adhesive. This is a really inconvenient process, and I still don't have it perfectly down after four years of doing practice. I want to shave off my brows to make this easier, but my parents won't allow it. I tried to offer a compromise and ask them if I could only shave off the tail end to start with--- still no.

Conflict runs rampant, misunderstanding abound, and physical distance ensues, oddly generated by me.

70,"Sorry for the strange title, but I don't really know how else to phrase this...

For my junior and senior years of high school(15-17 years old), I had to wake up at 6am for 7am classes, something I absolutely dreaded as I am not a morning person AT ALL. Well, having to do this 5 days a week for the entire school year took a heavy toll on my health I think (I am/was physically healthy and played sports, but I was mentally exhausted I think) as I was probably getting around 5-8 hours of sleep a night (not enough for me, but not little at all compared to adults/many other students). 

Obviously, I would be irritable and tired most mornings, but the thing that still weirds me out to this day is these very strange thoughts that would pop into my head every morning right when the alarm would go off. I would have vivid thoughts of grabbing an imaginary gun from my nightstand and just ending it right there instead of having to get out of bed. Like, I would think to myself ""I would legit shoot right now if I had a gun."" Then 10-20 min after I would get up and shower etc. I would have other weird thoughts where I would completely doubt myself, my life, my friends, and just other out of the ordinary thoughts I would not normally have. After about 30 min+ though, I would snap out of it and realize how ridiculous these thoughts were. I eventually got to this state where I was ready every morning to have these thoughts and at the same time knew how crazy they were and how they were not me.

Other than these early mornings, I was and am not depressed, suicidal, sad, anxious, or anything at all in my normal life. It was just right when I would have to wake up for high school, and now it occasionally happens if I have to wake up especially early for something, but not nearly as frequent. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Should I seek help for this? Or just deal with kind of? If there is a better place to post this, please let me know! I'd be more than happy to move it. Sorry for the rambling wall of text.

73,"###Background

I'll try to make this brief while still being thorough.  I'm a 23 year old male currently entering my final year of undergrad (electrical engineering).  It's been a tough road, partly from depression, partly from realizing that I'm not crazy about my major.

In 12-18 months, I would like to attend graduate school in Brazil at either the University of São Paulo, or Unicamp, both high echelon schools.  I want to pursue (Ma or PhD, undecided) in Computer Science with a strong focus on Machine Learning.  While there, I would like to train a  martial art, BJJ or boxing.  

Throughout undergrad I've consistently done better and enjoyed my CS classes much more than ECE, and as such think I would enjoy the material much more if it were my focus.  I'm from a very poor background, but I've made it this far, and I've determined that this is the sum of what I am most interested in, in this life.

###Where I'm At So Far

* I've been self-teaching Portuguese for the past 9 months.  I've finished Duolingo and now use a host of other apps, books, and talk to natives online every day.  At this point I'm spending at least 3 hours of my day in Portuguese, but this flunctuates.

* I created a Github and started an AI project.  It's not nearly done yet, but I hope to finish it this month and add many similar projects in the future, possibly blogging about them regularly.

* I have some pretty decent programming experience, especially in Python.  As well as 4 months internship experience.

* I began reading some Machine Learning textbooks when I go to bed.  Progress is slow.

* I historically score high on standardized tests.

* I have a pretty intense workout regimen that's about 50/50 on strength training and conditioning.

* I've got $800 in savings, $60 in stocks, and $141 in cryptocurrencies.  I also own hardware that I'm mining crypto with that is netting me $10-$20 per day, depending on the market.  Last year my credit score was in the high 700s.

###Obstacles

* My GPA is dogshit, I've got 30ish credits left and I'm sitting on a 2.6.  It's a self feeding cycle of getting hopeless about improving my grades and then getting worse grades.

* I will have roughly $65k in student loans when I graduate next year.

* I currently have $10k in credit card debt, partially from missed work during a depressive episode I had, partially from shitty decisions.  The majority of that is on a credit card that will not begin accruing interest until December.  Its sort of out of hand.

* I can't afford to go to a BJJ gym here and there's literally no boxing gyms.  I have no technical skills in either.

* I'm currently making minimum wage at a campus job.


I feel like I'm doing some good towards what I want to do, but I have no idea if it's the best way, or if my goals are even realistic.  Is this even a good idea? Am I going to fuck myself trying to pursue this? The financial situation is the most concerning, although, college is *free* at the institutions I specified.  

Could anyone shed some light on what I need to do, starting today?

tl;dr How do I get to a great graduate school in Brazil with a shit gpa and a decent amount of debt?",30Jun2017,1

75,"As a child, I saw the world as this grand vast place, with nearly infinite possibilities. With most experiences I had in my daily life, I felt that there was some magic in it. There was something fresh about the days spent out, whether if it was waking up to see the morning fog, walking out in the hot afternoon, or breathing in the cold night breeze. I was livelier, more energized. I would go about my day with lots of excitement, and actively find things to be joyful or cheery about. Life just seemed to have more color, sounds, even a sense of fullness in the air back then. 


But now, I just seemed to have mellowed out a lot more. I see the world just as it is, without anticipation or disappointment. It's a bit sad for me to realize how much I've changed from back then, and I've started wondering: is it possible for me to get that same sense of wonder and joy in the world around me, just as I had as a child? Or is this just how adulthood is? If anybody could offer any advice on how I could bring more color or life into my world, I'd definitely appreciate it. ",30Jun2017,2

84,"Okay so I'm fresh back into dating and everything after a long term relationship and need some advice. If it is important I'm a 22 year old male college student in the States.

I was recently shopping at the mall for some stuff for my buddies wedding. I ended up getting everything except a new belt for my suit because I can't find a store that sells leather belts without a buckle or with a removable buckle so I can put my lucky belt buckle that I got from my grandpa on it, I was also wearing my lucky shoes that I got from him and are the nicest leather shoes I have ever owned.

I go to a bunch of stores and cannot find a single belt that fits this criteria, I honestly didn't think it would be that difficult to find. Anyways, I see the store ""Buckle"" and I think in my head that it was like denim and would have belts, because you know the name. 

I go into the store and I see that my assumption was extremely wrong and the store does not seem to carry any belts or buckles. Shit. I do see a small section with belts and head over there, where the cutest goddamn blonde I have ever laid eyes on walks up and asks if she can help me with anything. And I start to explain my dilemma as I look at the belts, we find one that does have a removable buckle but it looks like a affliction or Ed hardy shirt made on a leather strip. I explain it won't really go with a suit for a wedding and she goes to look online and see if she can find it but can't tell if they have removable buckles. So we chit chat for a bit and she suggests going to check out a leather store she knew of and off I go
As I go she jokingly was saying about come in anytime to see her because she basically lives there. I decide to check at a work wear store across the street and find one. I decide to put the belt buckle on the belt and go back in. 

I head back into the mall, take a deep as breath and walk into the Buckle store, I see her talking with her two coworkers and she sees me and asks if I was able to find one, I say yes I was and we chit chat about it being weird they didn't have it at any of the other stores in the mall and that she would keep note of it being there in case anyone else wanted something similar. 

We talk about silly stuff about belts for a bit and I can tell the conversation is dying down but honestly I want to keep talking to this gorgeous woman. So I tell her I actually needed to get some clothes for the 4th and saw when I was in before that they had some patriotic and alcoholic shirts. And we walk over to that section and start looking at the availiable beer shirts and then start talking about drinks and then plans for the 4th, I tell her it's my first time being back around my family because I've traveled for the 4th the last few years and was probably going to barbeque, drink beer and probably blow some stuff up. She says she thinks she  works during the day but gets off around 4 and sadly has nothing to do. Here is where I feel I missed the first opportunity to be smooth and confident by asking her to come celebrate with me but that is way too bold for me and honestly I was just a little in awe most of this time. 

She is the first to compliment me by saying I look like I am dressed very fancy and what I do for work and I said I am actually down here waiting for my evening class as I am a student, but that I actually did just start my new job/internship with the fancy title of Biology Technician on the military base nearby. My dumb ass forgot to brag about the fact that I'm also becoming a wildland firefighter... 

She asked what I was studying and what I actually did at this internship and so I explained I had just spent the week doing timber sales and looking for raptors, birds, invasive species around logging operations and she starts into a story about hating pocket gophers. It was about her parents replacing the mobile home on their property a few years ago and how after they got rid of the old house and have the new one placed the department of ecology stopped the move because it was supposedly breeding grounds for pocket gophers and no construction would be able to happen and her parents were stuck living in her apartment for over 6 months.

I remember the whole story because of how damn transfixed on her beauty I was.

 A bunch more small talk after this I end having already bought a pair of sandals because a quarter of the way into this because, honestly I needed an excuse to keep talking to her. 

We keep talking about stuff, whose wedding it is me saying I couldn't do retail and her saying that I could with how I talk to people and how nice I am, she jokes again about always being at work and basically living there, I said so the bed in back is yours and she says yeah the mattress over by the dumpsters, some Febreeze jokes follow. I start heading to leave because I'm too retarded to make a move, strike three. 

She says to come back and visit her since she basically lives there and that she would love to see me again. As I walk away she is talking about if I need to get shirts or jeans that they have jeans and to come in to get them. 

This happened on Wednesday and I didn't realize until Thursday morning driving to work that her name was Alex.

 My buddy who is going to get married the Saturday after the 4ths name... Alex. 

The belt buckle given to me by my grandfather who raised me for much of my childhood, that is the reason I walked into that store that day is white gold with a letter ""A"" for Augustus and now Anderson.


So guys what do I do? I was thinking of going in tomorrow or possibly Monday and asking her to either celebrate the 4th with me or come to my friends wedding if she is available and if not to go get lunch or dinner with me.

Would that be creepy or inappropriate? Is this how people meet people as adults? Should I feel this confident about going to talk to her?

What do I do?!

I've tried to convince him and my dad to sell off just enough land so that we can pay off the remaining balance, but my brother is so stubborn and says we shouldn't sell any of it. We even talked about selling the small piece to him and then still including him in the ownership of the remaining land, but he asks why he should spend 60k in a small part when he can spend 60k for all 100 acres.

98,"Hi, I have just started a job I was offered the month before graduation in May. I am working for a large corporate materials company in the Midwest as a production engineer in the plant. I was so glad to get offered this job and get to utilize my skills with good pay &amp; benefits ($65K, all health, 401k matching, etc.) However, I have begun to regret this decision as I have found that my coworkers, and especially my boss, do not seem to value professionalism or decency behind closed doors.

It seems to be accepted among these people in my department that it's okay to say whatever they want, whatever they think, and make crude comments about anybody. A few examples: My boss has showed me a pair of tits on his phone during work hours. They refer to a manufacturing associate as ""Bob"" - big ol' butt. Every morning meeting includes sexually-charged jokes, comments about women (all male employees including myself), my boss giving me shit and trying to belittle me in front of the other guys, and random bullshit that you wouldn't otherwise say to higher-ups. At lunch the other day, my boss and another co-worker tried to get me to hit on a waitress, which made me really uncomfortable. They have the mentality that you dont have to hold back from making comments about a woman's body out in public within earshot. I'm not gay, but what they say is too much to hear. Everyday there's a lot of swearing and referring to other people in the company as ""cocksuckers"" or ""motherfucker.""

Everyone in the department, including my boss, is at least twice my age and has good job security as they have been, in all fairness, meeting company quotas and getting things done for an otherwise understaffed department. Aside from the shit my boss gives me, he does try to remind me that it's all a joke and I shouldn't take it personally. They've all said that our workplace is an environment not everyone is strong enough for and that the business is like this everywhere else, insinuating that if I leave, I couldn't make it anywhere. I don't know if I am allowing myself to be disrespected or too passive to say anything back, but I just don't enjoy being around these people. I don't want to be like them and act the same way. I just want to do my job and not have to hear any locker room talk. I'm tempted to quit right now, but I don't have any fall back plans other than to move back in with my parents 3 hours away as I live in the country. I don't have any savings and also took relocation assistance ($1350) which means I'd have to pay back all of it if I leave within 2 years, on top of breaking my apartment lease. The potential for growth in the company is there if I want to advance in management, but I don't want to put up with my peers' mentalities for more than another month.

Would it be so bad if I left this job so soon? How am I supposed to adapt here?

102,"Hello everyone, so the title speaks by itself. So, what happened is that yesterday I was returning home after five months of living abroad and was carrying three different bulks: I had a big carry-on, a 60L backpack **in which I was carrying 50 euros plus around 20 euros in different countries currencies** and a small bag with my computer inside. My plans were to do the check-in for the carry-on and take both backpacks in the plane with me, but they told me I wouldn't be able to bring my bag since it was too big and I would have to do the check in for it as well. I'm positive the money was there before it was checked in, and once I got off and took my stuff, I was about to take the metro with the money I had in the bag and... Surprise! The money was gone. In the small pocket where all the money was, there were only the keys to my house left (at least I'm glad they left that alone), but my question is what is my next move now as a passenger of a flight and if you think I would be able to get the money back (I had A LOT of coins from different countries and that's the real loss here anyway and I'm certain I'm not getting those back). There were also a couple of small souvenirs from Croatia that have also gone missing and they were both for my girlfriend, so yeah, this is not good. 

Also before you ask, I'm completely certain the money was in there before I left the bag at the airport and I'm guessing no one apart from the airport staff had even got close to it before or after I picked the bag up.

So yeah, if you have any advice or anything really, I might really appreciate it. The company I was flying with is SmartWings and the flight was Prague-Valencia QS-1054, if that's of any help. Thanks.",30Jun2017,2

107,"Background on me: I am a 22 year old male who works full time and goes to college. A month and a half ago, my now ex and I ended our 5 year relationship due to differences that could not be reconciled. This was my longest relationship, but I am the type of person to be in long, committed relationships. I have only had 2-3 ""flings"" in my life's other than that have had 3 long term relationships prior. As far as mental health, I obviously feel very down right now but overall semi severe ADHD is my only diagnosed condition

Background on her: her history is a bit more messy. The relationship she got out of was very messy, with him becoming a stalker and there is a pending restraining order. She was not in the best mental health before that, but he was very emotionally abusive to her and she is still very apparently damaged. She has a history of depression and has BPD, but is currently in treatment for it.

The situation: during my relationship, my ex was not a huge fan of any of my friends and was quite demanding for attention. This led to me eventually cutting off pretty much everyone in my life prior to the relationship. This includes the girl in question, who I was very good friends with and had a minor fling with prior to meeting my ex.

Flash forward to a week ago. I had gotten over the ""bury myself in my own sorrow and never leave the house"" phase and was looking to reconnect with old friends. I decided to message her, since I remembered her typically also having difficulty sleeping at night like I do. We talked for the next few days, then hung out a couple of times in person, mostly just walking around town. It began as me simply looking to connect with an old friend (yes I am capable of having a platonic relationship with females, I actually prefer females as friends as most men annoy me) and also looking for human companionship as I had been very lonely after spending the previous month isolating. However, after tonight I am convinced I am growing feelings for her. This obviously makes things very complicated, as each of us are very vulnerable at the moment. I am particularly worried about hurting her. She has an extreme problem trusting men since her ex was extremely abusive and manipulative and is now stalking her. 

My fear is turning her into the ""rebound"" girl; I genuinely care for her and would not want to do that to her. Another fear is ruining a great friendship so quickly after rekindling it. And of course my other fear, neither of us are ready for any of this.

So I ask you Reddit, what should I do?",30Jun2017,1

I am currently studying abroad in Japan for 8 weeks, and it has only been a few weeks. I happened to get accepted into the program with my boyfriend and some friends, so we are all here together. Now, because we all knew each other before coming to Japan, we naturally spend the bulk of our time together when we do homework or walk around town. We simply feel more comfortable together. 

Today, the teacher of my Japanese class told me that I spend too much time with my boyfriend and that I have to hang out with other students or else, practically. She then said that I can spend time with him in America, but now I'm in Japan and I shouldn't spend time with him. (She said this in Japanese, so perhaps it just doesn't translate well?)
I understand that she wants me to branch out, but I have been already. I've made plenty of friends here, and I'm no more quiet than the other students here.  I do my work in the common spaces and talk with others outside of class. It's just a little difficult to hold real conversations because we aren't allowed to speak in English to each other; but I am doing my best to be social.

My boyfriend had to meet with her later and she did not mention any of this to him. I'm not sure if that means anything, though? 

Maybe I am just being too sensitive, but I did not think it was appropriate for her to say that to me. I'm just not sure how to proceed in this situation. I already feel very uncomfortable with some things she has taught in class (i.e. Black people are like gorillas)(I'm obviously half black), and her comments today are not helping.

We've recently rekindled again as we were very close, she's got a new boyfriend now who's lovely but not my type at all.
Anyway, she's gone on holiday for a week and he asked me for some art supplies so he could make her something for when she came back. From that request, we've started to chat (all platonic every day stuff, nothing that could even potentially be read inbetween the lines as sneaky or trying to ""steal"" him - which I would never do.)

Anyway, I've woken up this morning to find out she's blocked me, I asked her boyfriend and he said she hasn't mentioned it. I have plans to see a (guy) friend today, and he's just spoken to me saying that she messaged him last night asking if we were friends, which he then replied yes to and proceeded to have a completely ordinary conversation with without mentioning me again.

131,"Hi.

I'm a 16-year-old kid from Holland. I like drawing, gaming, and... Helping.
I say help because it's something I love to do. Seeing people in need or having problems gives me the urge to help, and a rush of happiness when the problem is fixed.
But ""problems"" can include medical problems. And these medical problems can include mental problems like depression.
This is the worst type of problem I can't ignore. I've had my share of online and RL friends that have been depressed, cut themselves or even attempted suicide. I've been safe from the last subject, knowing that I'm not in a position to ""fix"" them.
But this girl...
She's a 15-year-old girl from London. She loves writing and roleplay. In fact, that's how we met. She loves roleplaying in a Percy Jackson themed discord server and is a regular visitor. Eventually after a few weeks of rp'ing together we became friends. That escalated to being good friends. That made her open up about her problems; unmotivated for writing, feeling like she's a burden, her parents trying to seek help for her, her friends commenting on her bad eating, and... cutting. This is where I snapped. My helpers' senses were tingling and I instantly began talking to her. It began as a regular counseling session. Asking how she's been, asking what caused certain stuff and how to prevent her from doing harmful things to herself. It went pretty well, at least I thought.

She had three waves of depression in 2 weeks. 2 of which made her plan suicide.
I was with her, talking on voice chat, every. single. time.
It made me cry, it made me feel sad for her, and lastly: it made me feel the need to help her even more.
She had me hooked. Taken hostage. Bound to listening to her problems and trying to help her.
She told me that if she'd ever do it. She'd message me so I could tell the discord server she loved and cared about.
I had a strange feeling in my throat for 2 days. Every night I couldn't stop thinking ""Is this the night?"". The morning after I would rush to my phone and check my messages. 
She's still alive. I've talked to my school's counselor. He told me I'd have to refrain from doing more. and even do less. I'd have to encourage her to seek medical help and when times get rough, when she'd have ""a bad moment"", I'd have to back off.

I was devistated. I didn't want to leave her. The thought of her killing herself made me worry more.
That was a week ago.
Now I'm trying to make a border between being her friend, and being her ""Hero"". That's what she calls me. She feels like I've saved her thrice right now and that makes her sadder every time she mentions it.
She doesn't believe she's gonna make it. But hope still lies in her heart.

But how long can I keep up?
How long can I keep helping her before she snaps, and hurts herself? And hurts me with it?
More importantly, how can I make myself resist the urge to ""fix"" these people. Resist the urge to be a teddy bear of motivational talks and bad, unprofessional therapy sessions?

146,"Hi Reddit!

Long story short my friend has a person in her life that has become a bit of a stalker. She asked him to not contact her anymore a few days ago, then after she published a blog post, he posted a response. Sorry it's long- he always writes her these very long and odd things, before in email, but now on her blog. My question is how can I respond to his comment concisely, but also in a way that might help him realize he is going overboard and needs to let their ""tiff"" go? Maybe also something regarding the fact that he just put all of this on the internet in a very public way, since he is so concerned with privacy. Note she didn't mention him in the blog, but his name is on the reply.

Here is his response to her latest blog post:

Based on our mutual agreement, I had no intent to further communicate with you, whether it be in private or in response to your public social media writings and podcasts. However, you almost immediately wrote this very public blog and mentioned me (even if not by name – as if nobody is going to ask you about who it is you are referring to or presume it is me), inferred that I was a “hater”, and made the substance of the blog a topic we discussed in private and which obviously bothers you. All of this after you claimed that nothing I have said in our private communications affects you. Since the substance of this blog was targeted at me or what we have previously discussed in private, I believe I am entitled to respond with three particular points.

As a preface, I have 30 years of extensive writing experience, having written hundreds of factual and persuasive briefs, memorandums and other legal related documents at the highest levels of government, the corporate world, and the legal system. I have found much of your private communications to me to be based on emotion, hostility and lack of facts and not rational or well thought out at times, and much better suited for the fiction that you are probably great at writing, rather than debate. I have avoided any public debate with you on your extensive social media sites because – quite frankly – I would overwhelm you with facts, persuasive argument and invective. I have no inclination, energy or heart to do so.

Even though this response is via your website/blog, I still consider it to be private.

First, I am not a “hater”. I do not hate you, or anything you have said, or anything you have done, or anyone you associate with. Just because someone does not agree with your words or your actions, or questions you about something you have said, done, or failed to do that you indicated you would be doing, does not make them a “hater”. I have dedicated a substantial portion of my life to helping people who are in need, who have suffered trauma, and who have dealt with death in their lives, including holding their hands through their own deaths. At last count, not including my parents, I have buried about 15 close friends and quasi-family members of my age group to cancer, alcoholism, suicide, AIDS, heart attacks, aneurysms, accidents and even murder. I have dedicated time and effort to supporting those who were dying and their families, including providing legal assistance and other help and support they needed. Those people would certainly disagree with you that I am a “hater” and would stand up for my character, at least to the same degree that your friends applaud you for succeeding in the lofty goal of wearing 30 different outfits in a month. Calling someone a “hater” without fully understanding them or what they have been through in their life is hateful in itself. I am entitled to an apology from you – and although I am sure I will not get one – as a Christian I forgive you anyway.

Second, almost immediately upon getting to know you I made clear that any and all conversations or communications between us were completely private and confidential. I have spoken to no one about the substance of any of our discussions or communications. You also assured me that you were a “vault” and that all of our communications were private and confidential. As a Christian and someone who held themselves out as being trustworthy I put my faith in you that anything that was said between us, even if difficult, hurtful or sensitive, would remain private. I have held to that agreement. However, one of your close friends (who shall remain nameless) also defriended me on Facebook when you did – making it pretty clear that you are discussing what we have discussed in private with others. I am not sure to what extent you have discussed what you promised would be private and confidential with other people – but you have certainly breached your promises and what I believed was an ethical duty, and shown a lack of maturity in doing so. That is one of the most serious breaches of trust imaginable. Even speaking about me, although not directly mentioning my name, in your blog, is still a breach of trust. I will forgive you for your conduct and lack of discretion, but I expect that going forward you keep to your word and not speak about anything we have discussed to anyone, and that you never mention me (even in inference) in your blogs, website or podcasts again without my explicit authority. If you have anything to say about me – say it directly, and privately, to me, and to me only – as I have done with matters related to you.

Third, and finally, as to the issue of your goals and whether you should publicly disclose your goals or not – it really does not matter. But if you disclose them, then you should also be answerable to people w

Then it cuts off because his reply was too long... See what I'm saying?

About a month ago, I developed a strange craving: cigarettes. I have never smoked a cigarette a day in my life (I've smoked hookah a couple of times before though, but that's a different kind of tobacco). I do spend a lot of time around smokers/occasional smokers, and never really thought twice about it.

Cue internet research. Apparently women that have wonky estrogen levels will crave either dirt or cigarettes, depending on how much 2nd hand smoke exposure they have had. Go figure.

The other day I caved (because I actually feel like I'm going to gnaw my fingers off, the cravings are so bad) and tried to buy a pack of my friends brand (I liked the smell), but they didn't have them and gave me the ""next best thing""...and it wasn't the next best thing...didn't remotely smell like my friend's brand, and I've been to like 4 other places trying to find it.

Weeks go by we become friends we talked almost every day in class/skype. she was having problems with a friend so we talked about it for a bit then she started to cry and I have no clue what to say or do so I just suggest we watch some youtube videos together to get her mind off it (and it worked she was laughing and seemed like she was happy.) so over time I start to open up to her a bit and talked about my social anxiety and just my emotions in general. Anyway, the past few days have been normal but I’ve started getting scared about her replacing me with another friend. I’ve fallen in love with her and I have no clue what to do… do I tell her I like her? But what if that destroys the friendship I have with her, I don’t want to lose that, she’s the only person I’ve ever talked to about my emotions and makes me want to be a better person and she’s made me happy. But on the other hand, I can’t keep going like this because if we don’t talk at all for a day or 2 I feel lonely and start thinking that she just talks to me because she feels bad for me or she dislikes me or she’s found someone else to talk to. I understand she has her own life and stuff, I don’t blame her, it just sucks. (Sorry for the huge chunk of useless text I just wanted to add a little bit of context.) 
What do I do? All of these new emotions I can’t think straight and I can’t talk about it with her.

158,"Hey guys, a little background.

Service: frontier
Speed 75/75
Router: Verizon actiontec

Problem: my internet router is set up in one corner of the house. My room is in another corner. The wireless signal is horrible.

I have tried wireless range extenders, I have tried power line adapters, and I have tried all the software tweaks I could find for the routers. My internet connection is terrible because of the range.
Frontier will charge a bunch of money for sending a new router and coming out to ""diagnose"" the problem.

Wired connection I get 50/40 speed.

Also, the company will charge even more to come out and run the cable through another wall for a better router placement.

I want to get a new router but someday I need a modem too. I don't know what to do.

The router gets power from the wall and has a coax cable coming in from the wall. That's it.

Any help will be appreciated. I don't even want to move the thing anymore, I would be fine with getting a router that will have enough range to provide good signal to my room",30Jun2017,1

170,"I wholeheartedly admit that my issues in no way compare to what millions upon millions of people suffer every day, but I need help or I don't know what I'll do outside of exploding or grinding my teeth to nubs/nonexistence.

I'm 24 years old, and a lot has happened these past two years. I've always struggled financially and grew up in northern Iowa without heating and electricity, and I've always suffered from various depression and anxiety related ailments. 

I've been financially independent since I was 16, and have been paying bills since 14. I graduated from University in May 2016, as a Fulbright scholar.  

In 2013, I received a scholarship that sent me to Brazil for 7 months. That was the first opportunity I ever had to change my life, and upon my return things were looking up for me. I had a nearly 800 point credit score, money in the bank for the first time in my life, and a shining future with the university.

During my freshman and sophomore years, I struggled with my mental health as always, but had coping mechanisms that made life bearable. I trained MMA and jiu jitsu, was a personal trainer, and did yoga daily. 

Then, in late 2015 several things occurred at once that kind of destroyed me. My father, who is on the road to disability, ended up with a sizeable tax lien against his house (that we only had due to a lottery he won, which he pissed down the drain). The State was going to auction his house within months, which would have forced him and my uncle both into homelessness. So I took out a personal loan of nearly $10,000 to stop that from happening.

Around the same time, I went through a rough demoralizing breakup. My mental illnesses also shifted. My bipolar got worse, my depression and motivational issues became crippling. My coping mechanisms all stopped helping, which led me to stop doing them altogether. I went from Honors student at the University to nearly flunking out in just one year. I was given a Clinical Law internship my senior year; an internship intended for second year law students, a law professor put his reputation in the line to let me, an undergrad, participate. I pissed all over it by not going.

I got with a psychologist, and we tried various methods and medications that didn't work. One such medication sent me into a month long fit of akathisia, which is severe and painful anxiety. I averaged 1.5-2 hours of ""sleep"" that consisted mostly of microsleeps per night.
Most of 2016 I spent unemployed due to my mental issues.

Now, I'm 24 years old. My bank account stays at 0 and the financial burden, as well as a general sense of uselessness have be just trapped here. Due to the situation, I've had to turn down two ideal human rights advocacy jobs out of state (I acted as an executive member of two on campus organizations, and it's the line of work I need to be in.

I also received a Fulbright scholarship which would have sent me back to Brazil for research, but I had to turn that down due to finances, as well. I had to sell my car (twice) to get by and still hardly do.

My anxiety is crippling. The medications I'm on help with my bipolar, but hardly, and I am avoiding anxiety medication because that's what sent me into akathisia and I will die before I go through that again.

Aside from my student loans, I have $6000+ in debt that I'm struggling more and more to pay off. My anxiety and stress are so bad that my night time bruxism (teeth grinding, which I've always had) is at an all time worst, I've chipped many of my front teeth noticeably and worn down my canine teeth significantly in the past year. I hardly sleep, anyway.

I feel useless, and every possible opportunity I've found for the human rights world in my area has been a dead end, and I loathe the idea of staying at my current job (selling phones for Verizon) because it just exacerbates my depression.

I don't know that I'm asking for advice here, or not. I'm a researcher and abnormal psych is of huge interest to me. I know what I need to do to help my mental health, but I'm ALWAYS so worn down and demoralized that it's difficult. 

Edit: I got fat, too. From 180lbs(82kg) to 250lbs (113kg) in about 4 months time. Stayed at 250 for a year. I'm currently 210(95kg) but I didn't lose that weight from exercise, mostly from sleep deprivation and no appetite.

I KNOW if the financial burden were lifted, if my family didn't reply on me so much, the majority of this stress and my mental health (aside for actual chemical imbalances) would be lessened. But i don't know what to do to pay this stuff off and start being free.

I'm just do damn tired. I need a break, and it's nowhere in sight. They say the real world after college will wear you down. They're right, but the real world has been wearing me down since I was born.

I'm just tired, you know?",30Jun2017,6

173,"I was a virgin up until 23. Before that I was in college, had depression to a point I wouldn't get out of bed or shower for days, and my depression was always caused by people using me or taking advantage of me. 

I didn't really like to date or talk to other guys because I was constantly ghosted on, used, played, and hurt. It made me realize that the men of my generation are basically worthless as protectors and providers, making me want to use this year to better myself and see what the world is really about. 

My job now requires me to work a minimum of 15 hrs a day, 6 days a week. Before I began working this much I used POF to find a guy just to take my virginity as I honestly saw no point in saving myself anymore. The guy was a cocaine user and he stood me up multiple times, and always found a way to blame for everything. According to him I was never happy with anything. He's gone! 

Around that time I started talking to a new guy who I liked better, the problem is he's just as busy as I am. He's like me in that he doesn't want a relationship, but because we aren't together I wonder if he should be the ONLY one. I don't have sex often because it feels nasty to me to have sleep with multiple guys at once. 

Before I shut down my POF, I saw that he was still using it, it doesn't bother me but my friends say I'm being played because he has multiple people and I only have him. I don't know for sure and never asked, don't really care, we use condoms but should I?

I don't personally care what he does and have even told him so for threevery important reasons, 

1. I work 15 hours a day and make $1000 a week, my first place at 23 is to be a four bedroom house in a decent neighborhood. (the hood was never my class fortunately) 

2. I have no kids, I own my car that was NOT just given to me. I have a college degree as well.

3. Statistically speaking marriage and 'committed' relationships are bullshit and set up to fail from the beginning. I spent my whole caring about people who didn't give a fuck about me (see the post about the girl who sat in MY car on the way to take her home and told me I was no god damn body) 

I am not a lying when I say I don't like bullshit, and now more than ever I don't have time for it. Chasing after multiple men is something I no longer have time for, unlike women I've seen who think their the baddest bitch in the world, barely looking after four kids without so much as a valid permit or highschool diploma, I AM the baddest bitch out there. It's taken me this long in life to figure that out for myself.

I legimately DON'T need a man in my life. Anything they could possibly do for me I can do for myself. I haven't fallen in love with 'R' and mostly likely won't to be honest. I don't really see myself 20 years from now being with a man I met on POF. He's got a lot going for him as well, so I can see why other women would want him. 

Does this mean though that I need to get with someone else just because he might be? He works a lot like I do and is building his own truck so he doesn't have a car, making it hard for us to see each other. He also lives with his family that is on the sketchy side of the law, something he didn't want me around which I have always respected him for. 

I just wonder what I should do?",30Jun2017,0
174,"We are both in our 20s and moved in together after we both got our first jobs. Here is the breakdown of how responsibilities SHOULD go:

- we each write a check for rent, splitting it evenly down the middle
- electricity/gas bill is under her name and money is taken from her account, but she sends me receipts each month and I pay her half in cash
- Hulu/Netflix I pay for (compared to gas/electricity it's not much) and don't expect compensation 
- every 2 weeks we take turns on who cleans the kitchen and bathroom
- every Monday I take out the trash, every Thursday she takes out the trash which includes recycling that night 
- you clean the dishes you make and you have 24hours to do them (like if you're tired after work and you also had to make dinner type of deal) 
- you buy the food you want to buy and if it's something that isn't a basic ingredient (like eggs or milk), you ask to have it. If it is a basic ingredient, you buy the next set 

Now here's how it actually happens -- the every-2-weeks schedule doesn't work and it's actually driving me insane. In the 8 months we lived here, she probably cleaned the kitchen/bathroom maybe 2-3x and either I do or she ends up putting it off until it's my turn to do it again. 

She likes to cook, but doesn't do all her dishes. She cleans the pot and the plate she used, sure, like the big obvious things that point out ""hey, I've just cooked"" but leaves the knives, extra spoons, forks, and cutting board sitting in the sink (??? I don't get it either). Even little instances like using cups periodically pile up in the sink, and then I end up cooking, but all my dishes plus all the cups she use are now in the sink. So why not, I think, let me just clear the sink. But fuck me, because she never thinks like that and I end up clearing the sink every 2-3 days. Like I can be gone all day from going out and come home, sleep, and dishes are still there next morning. Even if dishes in the sink at that given time are 50/50, she still won't do them. Even after all the times I did dishes for HER, and dishes happen to be more MINE, she doesn't think to do them. 

But on the flip side, she buys a lot of food (like sometimes over 100$ worth of food), and I don't mean just necessities but a lot of ""personal food"", like food I wouldn't mind NOT having but it's in the fridge (like canned mocha drinks or caramel pudding cups) -- most of the time it's for her but she doesn't make a stink if I have some and she actually encourages sharing. The annoying part is I end up buying non-food necessities, like hand soap, dish soap, sponges, etc. and she doesn't think to buy them without prompting. For example, if we're missing garbage bags, she would say ""hey we're missing garbage bags"" instead of taking the initiative to buy them the next time she's out and just restocking it. 

Granted I did already try making comments here and there! I mentioned to her she doesn't do her dishes and that I do dishes a lot and she says ""yeah I noticed that actually"", but doesn't think to just clear the sink every once in a while so I don't know what the fuck that accomplished.  I mentioned to her that we need to clean the kitchen and the bathroom, and I even suggest making it every 3 weeks instead of 2, and she says ""yeah I don't think it needs to be cleaned that often""... But it's because I'VE BEEN CLEANING IT FOR YOU!! 

She's not a bad person, we just have different ideas on what ""clean and comfortable living"" is and her habits aren't very considerate. I need advice on how to approach this because I'm really getting tired of picking up after my sister and I know if I just sit her down and talk to her, I'm going say things I'll regret!!

175,"Reddit I'm at a very important crossroad in my life and I really need to make a decision about what I should do. I'm approaching my senior year in high school and I still have yet to develop a plan on what to do afterwords. As of right now I have either a 3.1 or 3.2 gpa and a 1040 SAT, I've always been bad at school and focusing in general, even when on my ADHD medication. That's why I find it hard to believe that I'd be good at being a good college student (please tell me if you have any studying tips btw for people with ADHD or people who find it difficult to stay focused btw). So as of right now I don't know if I should pursue anything in the business, finance, medical or any stem fields. But I do have what some would call a incredible talent, Ever since I was little I was always good at drawing and over the years my talent grew and I even have some professional recognition and awards that also accompany it. This is where I'm torn, I don't know what I should do though. I really enjoy art but I know generally speaking it won't give me a financially stable future at all and I don't want my parents to go into debt on a lousy art degree, and my biggest desire is to have a nice house and a family of my own that is well taken care of. I just don't see how that would be possible (please correct me if I'm wrong though).

178,"Hey there, so I tried looking around for how to do this, and while there are a few tricks known I'm not sure I can use them in my particular case.

I creating an ancient ""tome"" and have a large amount of pages I want to look and feel ""ancient"" The usual go to for this would be using something like coffee, and then perhaps burning the edges of the paper.

My issue with this method is that these particular pages were something I originally only meant to be digital recreations. I basically photo-shopped fake book pages to look aged and burnt. I plan to print them out and put them into a book. 

Therefore these pages already look ancient, marbled and burnt edges, however I would like them to also feel old.

Is there perhaps some sort of way I could soak these pages in a liquid and once dried the paper will have that old crumple feeling? I know if you accidentally get a book wet the pages do tend to harden a bit which is a bit of what I'm looking for.

If there is a way to do this with multiple pages at once that would be even better as I have a good 200+ pages to go through, though it isn't necessary.

Then the other issue arises that these pages would have color prints on them. These would be printed with a Laser printer, rather then inkjet. Not sure which would run more if put under water.

He asked some out and partially closeted people for nudes and offered them oral sex etc. He then asked some straight guys for nudes. When they said no, he constantly spammed people for days. However, when some people actually sent nudes, he screenshotted them and put them in on his phone. He did this over the space of a few months. He asked my friends and I for nudes and more. He spammed me for two days, and some other friends for a week or two. 

However, when he got as many nudes as he could, including people from other schools, and one picture from someone in the year below us (Everyone in this story are all 14-15, including John), he showed them to some his close friends. One of them, disgusted with his behaviour told us. The story is now circulating around the year group. He has shown many people disrespect, including some extremely close friends. We don't know now what to do. Whether to report him to the authorities, to our teachers, socially ruin him, or just give him a talking to.

John seems to have been very sincere about this, saying he's deleted all of his pictures and is now severely ""depressed"". However, we have no proof of this happening, and many, myself included, think he has self-diagnosed to gain sympathy.

2 weeks ago his wife approached my wife and I (while we were walking around the neighborhood) and said that her husband was going to talk to us about the fence. Well, yesterday I get a call saying that they will be starting, putting new posts in the ground but using the old fence boards and that my wife and I should come over for a drink and we can look at the bids Friday or Saturday (day of construction/ day #2 of construction) . 
Now, I just received a call saying that I have trees in the way (they were part of the reason why we needed a new fence, roots and stumps were pushing the fence) and that I need to take them down and stump grind them. They have taken down 80% of the fence, left the last 20% where the trees are at and will do that portion after. 
I have no idea what is fair and what I should do
1) We have not agreed to split the cost.
2) I still have no idea how much this is going to cost.
3) We did not agree to the fence design
4) We did not agree to have a contractor do the work (I was more than willing to do the labor)
5) There was only a 14 hr notice that they were starting.

I'm currently living America and my boyfriend and I have high school diplomas in terms of education. We were going to go to college here, but it's so ungodly expensive we've decided to move somewhere we'd truly enjoy while getting education and working. 

Realistically how will this move have to go? What steps should we take and what are some things about Denmark we should know beforehand that we may not have covered in research? (We also plan on studying here)

I just graduated from High school and I have 5 months before I'm join the Army.

I'm in my early 20's married, and know a lot of people. I can give a few people a call and ask them to chill and they are usually down unless they have plans. If I want to do a group activity like bbq or camping I would have to be the one that sets it up and gives everyone a call. The thing is if I don't reach out to them then I wont hear from them. Even tested it out a few times, made sure not to text anyone or ask them to hang out for about a week and got nothing. I even brought it up to a couple of my closer friends but that didn't change anything. Keep in mind if I need help with something I know a few people that would come through but in terms of getting a call from them to hang out it just doesn't happen.

206,"Some context.

I'm a 27 year old man. I'm a musician. It's the only marketable skill I have; the only thing I know to do well. I've done it since I was 11, and I've been making a living of it since I was 16.

I live in Brazil. The economy here has nosedived in the last 2 years. I used to make more money than my entire family combined (Mother + Father + Sister). Now I'm eating eggs and dollar store ground beef to survive.

To make it worse (or as I prefer to believe, better) I'm about to move to Canada to get a Master's degree in Music. I'm good enough that I may well be able to compete in the international market in two years time, and a Masters degree is the way to do it at the moment, but: 1) that is not by any means a certainty; 2) the market itself seems to be dying; 3) that does not give me the means to survive until the end of those two years and beyond (until I presumably land a good job).

I'm trying to think of an exit strategy. I'm aware that this is probably the very worst possible moment to do so. But I'd still like to try.

Important caveat: the Masters degree abroad is non-negotiable. I understand that many would suggest dropping it as Step One, but please try to understand this is the one single dream I've ever had: to leave this country (which I happen to hate with every fiber of my being) in order to study. If we want to be extreme about it, I am perfectly willing to die trying. As Eminem said it best: ""So here I go is my shot / Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got""

What would you recommend to someone who's trying to start anew in a different country, but whose sole marketable skill is sinking rapidly in value (and also happens to be below the poverty line right now)?

Sadly my parents do not know that I feel this way, and I am afraid to tell them, because I KNOW that they won't want to have me in their lives anymore, unless I become a religious muslim. How do I know, I have tried ask them small ""what if's"" questions every know and then, with huge let down of answers like ""we won't approve"" and so on. All this is giving me a lot of stress.

214,"I currently work for a company (Widgets Corp) and because I'm a freelancer there, I was reached out to by Contraptions Inc about a similar position there.  My job at Widgets isn't fulfilling, my push for a raise was rejected this week, so I interview at Contraptions.  They ask me about my work and bosses at Widgets,  I tell them good things, and overall the interview goes great.  Next day, I get a text from Contraptions saying they want to have me on, (great!) and they've also reached out to my current boss at Widgets to see if it's OK to poach me (...not great).  Apparently the two are good friends.  Small industry!  But, needless to say, my current boss didn't know I was looking.  

Next morning I get *another* text from Contraptions saying my current boss needs me for a major project coming up, so they're rescinding the offer out of friendly courtesy.  

I tried to explain to Contraptions that the project is not as pressing as it may seem, but it's pretty clear it's not worth it to Contraptions boss to jeopardize their relationship with Widgets boss.  

So now my boss at Widgets knows I'm looking and Widgets Boss is pretty passive-aggressive and vengeful.  A few months back my former partner at Widgets didn't get along with Widgets Boss, which triggered a search for a new Widgeteer, and her quick replacement.   

I feel like the Contraptions ship has sailed, got it.  Shitty thing on their part, but that loop is closed either way.  Now I'm torn between 1) letting Widgets Boss know that was super unprofessional to block my own career decision and 2) trying not to get fired since I don't have a job offer and have proven my ""disloyalty"".  

Not sure what to do, what would you all do?

I spent the last several days waking up early to attend job training before I was to start next week. Admittedly I didn't do great on the first day, but the people in charge noticed enough people were having issues that they basically said they'd discount it as long as we improved the following days. So I spent the next few days of training, and today at set-up, working as hard as I could, offering ideas and help to people, asking questions, and doing whatever tasks needed to be done. I got enough positive feedback that I genuinely felt like I was doing really well until this afternoon, when the supervisor took me and like 60% of the other people aside and said that they wouldn't need all of our help next week due to an overestimation on their parts. If they do need us, they'll contact us in a subsequent week, but what we'll be doing and where we'll be doing it are at their discretion. For the record, what all of us were told was that we were hired and there would be work for us, unconditionally.

I'm not somebody who has much of an ego at all, and to be honest, the times I actually feel good about what I've done are far and few between. For the last few days, I was pushing myself to work hard and really did feel like I was doing well, thought maybe I'd found something I'd enjoy doing and be good at.

I'm 22, never had a relationship in my life, although I'm pretty good looking and a nice person overall. I've recently started asking a friend of mine out, we went for some drinks and a meal two weeks ago, and a meal today before I brought her up to the train station.

We chat a bit, we have similar interests, when we go out together we both laugh a lot, and both seem to have a good time. However I can't seem to find how to show her I want to go further, how to ""make a move"", or just how to check whether or not she feels the same.

223,"I (M21) met my girlfriend (F23) online and had a long distance relationship for 10 months before I bought a ticket to stay in the USA and meet her family for 3 months (VISA WAIVER), then she's coming back to NZ (my home) to stay with me for 12 months. We'd only Skyped and talked over the phone and now that we are in person it is a wonderful thing. However, her and I are staying at her mom's house for the time being and to save money. Her mom said we'd be independent and able to use her car and do things... when in reality any time we want to go out for dinner, or even coffee the mom says ""Well we [mom and her boyfriend] want to spend time with you because you're going to be gone for 12 months, and you can spend time with your boyfriend then."" in a very passive aggressive tone. Every single time we want to do something as a couple. Keep in mind we are adults. She guilt trips us every time we want to go out and acts like we don't spend time with her but 99% of the time she is either in the bathroom (we need to ask her to leave so we can actually shower) or is in bed. She literally spends up to 6 hours a day if not more in the bathroom. An example is that I want to shower before I go out but her mom is in the bathroom doing her hair and makeup for some reason - she will most likely take 3-4 hours minimum so I have to resort to washing myself with a fucking wet towel, it's really degrading. I have the feeling her mom does this purposefully out of spite so we are less inclined to actually do anything. I'm experiencing the USA for 3 months. I've been here for 2 months and only gone out a handful of times. This guilt tripping isn't fair and not to mention my girlfriend's mom is helping us get a loan so she can come to NZ with me. That's why we have to basically kiss her mom's ass; otherwise my girlfriend will have no means of coming to NZ with me, even though her ticket is already booked.

227,"Currently my 27 year old brother lives with me (16F) and my parents while he's saving for grad school. 

My mom will often tell me to do favors for my bro. I generally don't mind. They're normally along the lines of ""tell your brother his dinner is in the blue Tupperware on the bottom shelf of the fridge when he gets home from work"" which is easy and fine. 

A few days ago bro woke up really late for work because of some weird thing that happened with his alarm clock (not sure if it didn't work or if he just didn't wake up) Our parents woke him up and he managed to get to work only 5 min late. 

Two days ago my mom wakes me up and hands me an alarm clock and tells me it's for bro and tells me to configure it for him. I mean, yeah, I can do that, but he already has an alarm clock. He has three, actually, including his phone + two physical clocks. I texted my bro that mom had another alarm clock for him on my bedside table.

I woke up this morning to find *my* alarm clock (it's a really nice one that I got myself) on my brother's bedside table plugged in. I texted him a picture and asked ""why do you have my alarm clock"" and he said he didn't take it. 

My mom had taken my alarm clock while I was sleeping and set it for my brother and put it in his room. When I asked her about it she said she thought I didn't like it (???) and that ""your brother needs it."" She said I could have it back next week.

I don't know. I'm irritated. First of all, it's my alarm clock and she took it while I was sleeping without asking. Second, I don't feel responsible for my brother. He's an adult. He can sleep in and miss work and it wouldn't be my fault, nor is it my responsibility to make sure he wakes up on time. Obviously I don't *want* him to get fired or whatever, but it's not my job to configure his alarm clocks or give him my alarm clock to make sure he wakes up. He's 27. 

Am I justified in being annoyed, or am I just being bratty about it? What do I do? I took my alarm clock back and put it in my closet. Should I just let it go unless something else like this happens/she finds out I took my clock back? 

My brother is on my side. He's never asked me to take care of him/be responsible for him, and he actually gets annoyed sometimes when I do stuff for him (like move his laundry to his room or whatever)  that he's capable of doing. He says mom was being weird.

229,"Hi!

I recently graduated with an education degree. Before I began college, I always wanted to be in the science/medical field, but what I wanted to do was too many years for me (for my 17 year old brain), so I wound up in education because I knew I was good  with kids. Fast forward to last semester, I did student teaching, and it was a pretty traumatizing experience for me. The kids weren't the issue, my mentor teacher was. That coupled with seeing the amount of work necessary along with other factors kind of completely turned me off to teaching. Right now I should be applying for my teaching certificate and looking for a job, but I'm up all night nowadays with bad anxiety, not even wanting to teach. 

With all that being said, I thought about what I do like doing. I love the medical and science field - always have. I kind of wish my advisers had pushed me in that direction when I first had doubts about my degree 3 years in. They had told me it was a better idea to just finish it. I've been looking into things like trade schools and alternate degrees, but honestly, I don't know what to do.

Are trade schools even worth it? I've been stumbling across some forums and such that make me wary of them. I'm not even sure what I'd like to go into. Does anyone else have experience with this? Sorry, I'm a bit scatterbrained. I just really am lost in life right now.",30Jun2017,2

So I go this year, and I'm at a birthday party. My sister starts talking about wanting to go out with her friends and invites me to come along. I said something along the lines of ""yeah, it would be cool to meet your friends"" and she walks out of the room to organize it over the phone. My brother then chips in with ""what do you mean 'meet' her friends? You already know them."" Of course I denied this because I didn't know them at the time. He then replies with ""I know you're messing with me, because I also know that you fucked Kylie.""

At this point I'm really fucking confused. I did not fuck my sister friend, just FYI. So I just brush it off and move on. The next day I'm chilling at one of my friend's who lives in Idaho's house, and I bring it up. I said how it was funny that he thought that and I was wondering who thought of the rumor. He then says that he thought it wasn't a rumor... HE THOUGHT I FUCKED HER TOO. To save you guys a bunch of side conversations, MY ENTIRE FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN IDAHO THINKS I FUCKED THIS GIRL. Then it comes up that most of them also think I fucked this other girl I was kind of seeing last year. Neither of which I banged, let me get that clear. My mom and the rest of the family just think that I probably got high and banged her without remembering, but that doesn't check out because I don't lose memory when I get really fucking high.

What are the things I can do at home from my computer? I have a solid workstation that can handle heavy-duty work. Where do I start? Anyone know any courses that can help beginners like myself. Anything helps.

PS: On an unrelated note. If anyone knows somebody that has chronolergic urtacaria, I can help, I've dealt with it for sometime now and I figured out ways to sort of deal with it or work around it.",30Jun2017,3
247,"So.. pretty much all in the title. But, I recently went through a breakup and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

I really wanted to keep the diagnosis private -- so at first I told her I was moving and that was why we needed to break up, but she started sending me really long word docs about why we need to stay together and she continued to show up at my apartment. Just randomly. Last Tuesday I literally woke up to her standing in front of my bed (my landlord didn't know we broke up and he let her in, I think). And on Thursday I left out my door to find her in the hallway waiting for me.

So -- I finally came clean about the schizophrenia (well, sort of. I told her I was afraid I had it but hadn't been officially diagnosed yet), and told her that I needed distance and to have her lurking around my building really freaked me out. She got really emotional, cried a lot and I caved and we made out for a bit which made it even harder to get her to leave. And now she just will not leave me alone. I told her I moved to a different apartment (even though I didn't) and she desperately wants to know the new address. I'm terrified she's going to show up at work. And I'm terrified if I'm too harsh she'll send my family our conversations or something. I don't know! 

And now she says she's accepted that we need to break up for a while but that she's going to now change her major to psychology and maybe hopefully one day find a cure for schizophrenia. But she also wants to meet a lot and keeps telling me she's got really exciting news that we should meet and talk about.

I keep telling myself my brain is in not-great shape, and I'm probably thinking too much, but it doesn't really help.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm literally at wit's end. I just want to completely detach myself from her (I've already blocked her on facebook but I haven't blocked her number).

248,"He really wants me to go, but I just don't want to. Mainly because I don't like him and how he acts. I also don't wanna make up bullshit excuses or make him feel too horrible by telling everything I think. Any tips?",30Jun2017,8
250,"Recently at a party my friend told me that she was on molly, and that she does it every weekend. I was kinda drunk and didn't know what to do so I made her drink some water and promise to be careful. I don't know what to do now, I think if I talked to her about it it wouldn't make a difference. She tends to keep her life private so if she wasn't high then she would never have told me anyways. As such, I don't think my words would hold much sway. She's a smart person, but not always the most responsible and she doesn't tend to think things through. We're also both teenagers, if that makes a difference. 

Can anyone give any insight to me of how dangerous or addictive molly is, and what I can do to help this friend? Should I even get involved?",30Jun2017,4
251,"Thank you for the help in advance; so this is what happened: My friend went out to drop another friend of with my car while I was asleep and ended up getting into a fender bender with another car. They exchanged information, my car is insured under my mothers name(and I am also insured under her) but my friend is not. He did not take pictures of the damages of the car and the police were not called. I am not sure what my first steps should be, any advice would be immensely helpful. Thank you


Edit* my friend let me know he was taking my car, which I said it was ok thinking it was only gonna be a quick thing",30Jun2017,1
252,"Hi guys/gals and thanks for any advice in advance. 

 I'm an officer at a California State Prison. Recently while at work, we had an officer get attacked by an inmate with a 9in inmate manufactured weapon, with the intent of killing the officer. I responded to the incident and played a minor roll in subduing the attacker and saving my co-workers life. Here comes my issue; it's been a few weeks, and now I'm having difficulty going back to work, not because of any physical injury, but realistically, I just become extremely anxious before I go to work and I've ended up calling in sick more than I ever have. My intention is to change careers because I feel that this is no longer something that I can do long-term. I've spoken to my union rep, who told me to call my doctor and have her put me out in FMLA, but after having spoken to her she will only give me a note for one day, and I'm attempting to get a week off, to hopefully calm down. My sick time would be used but that's fine. She's referred me to mental health, but the last thing I want is to get mentally disqualified or something from my job. 
  Anyone have any tips or similar experiences with this? ",30Jun2017,1
253,"Just some info: I'm 18, my girlfriend is 18, and the ex is 18. 
I've been dating this girl for a few months now and before we dated she was in a relationship with this guy for about a year. The relationship turned toxic as he became possessive, manipulative, and kinda crazy (he had issues with depression as well which kinda boosted his emotions). She ended the relationship and he couldn't accept the fact that she broke up with him so he would constantly message her, show up at her house (even after told to leave). He has become aggressive and apparently punches holes in walls and shit and it's starting to concern me. He's done a lot of other weird things that I don't have time to write in. And basically he hates me and according to others would want to kill me (I can't tell if they actually mean kill or just beat up) I don't want him hurting her or myself because of his stupid behavior. What's some advice that can help me protect everyone and avoid a potential violent situation. I have no problem engaging in a fight with him if necessary, but I would prefer to extinguish the situation. ",30Jun2017,5
254,"...or can I ask (more likely, ""tell"") him to leave?

Some background here;

My brother is an adult with paranoid schizophrenia. He also has a host of other things going that have culminated in intellectual disabilities, and the like.

My husband and I moved him into the unit so that he would have a more cost effective place to live, either long term, or until he was able to get low income or subsidized housing (if he didn't like the current arrangement).

My husband and I have been working with our county's HHS (brother moved to our state earlier this year) to get him further services, though it is a long process.

He is currently so delusional (though taking his RXs) and argumentative, that we can't even talk about the smallest things without them turning into insane arguments and hours' long tangents. My otherwise calm husband now bites his tongue, balls his fists, and just physically leaves when my brother gets like this, just so he can keep his own wits about him. 

I'm looking into getting him an ""emergency,"" appointment with a local therapist, meanwhile (as he could use the psychotherapy, and possibly a meds adjustment).

I know we are his only support right now, and we do what we are able within reason. He refuses to recognize it at all (which we look past), and demands that we be at his beck and call 24/7. He calls our house constantly, usually 7am onwards, and - if we do not pick up - our cell phones. Furthermore, if we are out, or were unable to answer the phone, he then walks or bikes over to our place, knocks on the door, loiters, and/or ""recons,"" to see whether or not we are home.

It's invasive, and we want him further away from us ASAP.  We're also concerned that he might be a nuisance for others living in the park.  We now do not trust him to respect others' boundaries or property, and do not want to chance it becoming a problem and escalating into anything else (also, the admin would have him put on notice and evicted long before that).

So, do I need to serve him a notice to leave a residence he does not currently own, and only pays lot rent on?? (I'll be asking the park's admin, for starters)

Any thoughts on where he might be able to go for semi-permanent housing without a long wait time, after he is asked/told/served a notice? His only income is SSI, and a weekly at a motel will sap it really quickly.",30Jun2017,20
