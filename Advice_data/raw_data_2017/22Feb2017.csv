9,"Today at work I found out that my boss mentioned to my other co-workers that he doesn't like me and at this point he is just looking for a reason to fire me.

I work at a mattress store along with 4 other people, my manager, assistant manager, and the two delivery drivers. I'm pretty cool with the delivery drivers and we often hang out after work. Our boss Brandon has been getting more and more jealous that we have been hanging out because our manager used to hang out with them. It's gotten to the point where our manager has suggested that it's a bad idea to hang out outside of work because it would compromise our professional relationship at work despite the manager admitting that he smokes weed with the delivery drivers on occasion. 

Today the delivery driver told me that they recorded our manager saying that he hates me and that he has been looking for a reason to fire me. I am always on time, I do everything im asked and more. The manager and assistant manager have history about talking shit behind each other's backs and talking shit about the delivery drivers as well. 

I don't know if I should talk to my boss about it or just let it go. Any advice?

12,"I know it sounds dumb but i've tried working fast food or walmart even a factory and I've learned that no matter how long I stay at the job I can't stand for more than 3 hours. My feet start hurting EXCRUCIATINGLY BAD to the point where I get light headed and dizzy, the pain is worse that child birth and kidney stones put together (I've experienced both). Everyone tells me I'll get used to it or to stop being lazy. But it's truly not that at all. I want to be working right now but I know I can't handle the pain of being on my feet. It sounds so stupid I know. I honestly hate myself for it. But the pain becomes unbearable. I've tried orthopedic shoes and Dr Sholes and everything I can to fight it and nothing ever works.

15,"I am an English teacher overseas. I mostly enjoy my job, but I know I don't want to do this much longer. My contract is over this August, but woe is me, I have fallen in love with another English teacher here. He wants to stay another year so he can get out of debt. I, on the other hand, (sort of??) want to go home. 

Here is my list of pros and cons:

PROS: pay raise, contract renewal bonus, extra week paid vacation, $10k (maybe more) in savings ($20k total from 2 years), boy I potentially want to marry, I am young (23).

CONS: I don't want to be an English teacher, homesickness, some of my friends are leaving, I want to go back to school (the longer I am gone, the more classes I will have to retake since my program is competitive), I am young and I worry I am compromising for a boy too early in life.

16,"So first and foremost, I'm a dog person. I have a dog. Dogs do indeed bark from time to time. I'm fine with that and even my own dog barks. 

My neighbor is strange. We're talking wear the same outfit every day and lock the door as they go in and out carrying groceries strange. 

They have had dogs that match their personality for years. The thing that drives my wife and I crazy is they just leave their dog out to bark endlessly. As dog owners, we find it incredibly rude. My wife not so nicely said something to them recently after politely mentioning it. They have been better since. 

However, they recently got another dog. The damn thing just barks endlessly inside. We live in an old townhouse so I hear it constantly. It seems to bark when they aren't home. I'm not hearing it late at night. But it is endless.

Any tips on things you can do if you feel like a weird guy at the office? 

This is terrible of me to say, I'm a horrible person for even thinking this, but the one saving grace I have is there's another guy who speaks very loud and has a tendency to get on people's nerves more than I do, and I guess in a way it doesn't make me look so bad. That's a horrible thing to say, I realize that, and I do try to be friendly and cordial with him (I remember what it's like to be the statue instead of the pigeon as well).

19,"Hi all,

So I saw my best friend for the first time in a while (we live in different cities, so it's pretty difficult for us to see each other) over the weekend, and he really opened up to me that he's feeling pretty down.

He's a good kid, he's got great prospects, a 2:1 in BSc Chemistry, lots of relevant work experience, lots of fun life experiences, but life's slowed down a bit for the both of us now- he's working pretty hard in the town we both went to University in, and I think not having that student lifestyle anymore has contributed to this feeling he's having.

It probably doesn't help that he's the only single one out of our group of friends. I keep telling him he has plenty of love around him, but he's after a little bit more than that at the moment I think and as he's tragically heterosexual, and I'm in a relationship, I can't provide :') 

Anyway, this kid's like a little brother to me, he's always there for me when I'm feeling down and he even saved my life once. If anyone has any advice on how he can stop himself feeling so unfulfilled, or how I can just help cheer him up, I'd be very appreciative.

Thanks,
Jake",22Feb2017,3

I've found the water meter in my front yard, but I don't have any of the tools to turn those valves. I can't imagine they would leave it disabled like that, and I'm wondering if you guys think that there may be something else I can do to enable it.

28,"Hey all.  31F.

I need to switch career paths.  I'm afraid I can't go back to school(hopefully someday, too much debt).  Most of my experience has been restaurants and retail, which means I'm a very hard worker, with great people skills.  Fast work? Can do. Bending and lifting? No problem! Basic typing and organizing? I'm your girl.

I just can't do the sort of nasty, yelling people you handle in customer service. My last three jobs have all been lower management.  I've had my life threatened.  I can't do it anymore.  I'm far from weak, but after a dozen years of smiling at horrible person after horrible person it's gotten to me. 

I keep having people suggest union jobs, but it seems like everyone knows they exist, but have no idea where.  The few I've stumbled on via indeed and the like have been trucking or require specific training (again, money).  They seem very guy-oriented, and are almost mythical in availability.

30,"Hey everyone,

I feel that I am socially awkward in most of my situations when dealing with others. 

I just feel that when I meet a new friend/someone new, how do I get to the point where we click or become 'best friends' so to say. 
I have never had a best friend to be reliable and such, most of my friends come and go. 

Also, I feel very awkward when talking to people, most of the time its cool but when something pops up and I panic with having nothing to respond or can't think of anything to say on the spot. 

Also, I know this is typical, but this coincides with friendships and girlfriends. Anyway, as I was saying. I am part of my cousins debut (an asian version of a Quinceañera but when they turn 18, instead of 15) and my debut partner is really cute, I don't like her fully yet but I don't want to butcher myself in the future due to my awkwardness. 

Any general help but if you want me to go more in depth just ask questions about it and I would be happy to answer. 

Is this normal most of the time for you guys? or am I just overthinking.

34,"I knew this girl from school where we had a class together and we always had a similar sense of humour. I found myself crushing on her later as we left school so I decided to message her. We got talking more and more often and eventually were talking everyday for like most of the day. At one point we were each other's top best friends on Snapchat (had that stupid yellow love heart thing lol). Anyway, my friends told me she's out of league so many times, but I thought I was in with a chance. So I told her how I felt.

Apparently she already knew I'd felt that way previously but didn't know if I still did. She never told me how she felt, but I suppose that was an answer in itself. I just told her that yeah I do, and that I'm sorry if it makes things awkward. She said it honestly doesn't at all. But it did. After having talked everyday we didn't talk the next day. And the day after. And the week after. I saw her the next week at the only club in my town (you see like everyone there all the time). I went and said sorry to her for making things awkward again. She has this look in her eye like she felt really bad for me, and she just repeated it was all fine and gave me a big hug.

After that I saw her in that club a couple of times. We hadn't messaged or anything. One time we outright ignored each other as we walked by. The time after we just smiled at each other. Things had for sure got weird. A few more times we bumped into each other but they all kinda merge together. Very little was said between us at all. I was just trying to avoid her in all honesty to get over her, and I assumed she was doing the same so she didn't have to deal with the awkwardness. One thing I did notice was that she would also retweet something I retweeted like a day or two after we'd been avoiding each other or whatever. Chalked it up to coincidence though.

I walked by her on New Year's night and she shouted 'happy new year!' At me, clearly drunk as hell. That was the first time we'd even interacted in a month or two, and I hate to admit but I still had a thing for her. Not as intense, but whenever I seen her it would all come back. Anyway after that I noticed her liking a lot of things I was retweeting, and then she retweeted a post later saying something like 'liking someone's tweets just to remind them you exist'.

I was a bit confused. Like I was sure she wouldn't want to talk to me anymore. I met one of her best friends on the way home university one day and got talking. The usual polite shit like what we're up to nowadays. She said 'you're at uni now aren't you?' And went on to name the subjects I was doing. This girl was like an acquaintance at best, there's no way she'd know this unless she was told by the girl, which means she's been talking to her friends about me. Things kinda dried up again until the other night when I saw her again. This time though she ran up to me shouting my name all excited, gave me a hug, and she was all like 'how've you been?' and we got talking at the bar for a couple of minutes, which is the most we've talked in ages. It was nice. After that, guess what, the last couple of days she's back to retweeting and liking what I retweet.

What's going on here? I'd given up on her but it seems like she's trying to drag me back in, or more likely, misses me as a friend. I mean I miss her too but even now I still have a thing for her and I know talking again extensively's just gonna feel like shit when I still have feelings and nothing's gonna happen. What do I do here? Am I looking into things too much?

 **TL;DR**: Massive thing for girl. Talked for months on end. Told her how I felt. She had known but never told me how she feels back. Things got awkward as we kept bumping into each other at this club at the weekend. At first we'd talk a little but eventually we were ignoring each other basically.

37,"Hey Reddit community! I need some advice. I currently own my house by myself and purchased it two years ago. I have an excellent job that affords me a relatively high standard of living. My boyfriend and I have been together for about ten months now. We have never lived together because he is in the Army and he was on temporary assignment in the city I live in when we initially met. He returned to his home post about two months ago and is getting out of the Army in about three months, at which time we have agreed that he will move in with me. However, when he gets out he will be going back to school and will financially dependent upon BAH and a part time job and will additionally have bills for his car, phone, credit cards, etc. The advice I am seeking is how we should split up our living costs. If we were to split my mortgage and all the household utilities bill down the middle, it would essentially leave him with no money to pay for his own bills. It also doesn't make sense for us to find a new place or anything like that and we know it would make more financial sense to live together than have him find his own place. So what would be reasonable and fair in your opinion? I've always felt as though relationships should be 50-50, but it's clear I can't expect him to be at the same living standards I've been at when he's separating from the Army and back and school.

I might have aspergers. My therapist says it could be schizotypical behavior rather.

Unfortunately I've been having strong desires of hurting women recently. It started just 20 minutes ago. I was walking at night on campus. A girl was talking on the phone behind me. At that moment I felt like attacking her. Not even sexually, just punching her face and pushing her. Thankfully I didn't.

Then as I entered the cafeteria I saw some girl talking on her phone and I felt like ripping it out of her hand. I didn't.

Then it started to occur to me that I've had these fantasies before. Three years ago I was in the woods with some friends, one of them was a girl. I could have attacked her. Then just last weekend I was with friends. Two girls and one guy. I was the tallest and strongest one there. I thought about how easy it would be to subdue them and hurt them. But I didn't. 

Basically, I identify with rapists very much. I never raped anyone but I desire it I think. I don't want to hurt anyone. I feel very depressed about this. It's not even misogny. It feels like something much more but I don't understand it.

And so because I have these racing thoughts of hurting women. I sort of want to kill myself so I don't do that. I'm disgusted and ashamed of myself. So much that I developed fetishes for humiliation where I desire to be raped by men.

I don't know what to do. I just think suicide would be better before I end up hurting someone. I feel like I might go insane soon or something, like have a break down and hurt some random people. I'm very scared of the future.

53,"I think my mother is incredibly narcissistic and overprotective. The rules she makes me follow are downright ridiculous. For the record I'm fourteen years old.
The worst rule I have is that I'm not allowed to go anywhere by myself. Not even school. My mother or my grandmother literally walk with me or drive me everywhere. Another thing is how much my mother tries to shield me from any kind of media. I'm almost never allowed to watch any TV shows or movies. Earlier this year was actually the first time my mother let me watch a PG13 movie. Outside of birthday parties or holiday parties, I'm almost never allowed to hang out with my friends. Another annoying thing is that I'm never allowed to wear makeup. My mother also picks out most of my clothes, she rarely lets me pick something out, but sometimes she lets me choose from a few options she's already picked out.
One thing my mother is obsessed with is always filling up my free time with all sorts of activities. There isn't a single day when I don't have something after school, and on weekends she makes me go to tutoring. Last week my mother put me into swim lessons and she got all freaked out about me going outside after being in the pool, so she forced me to dress like I was going to the North Pole. She always forces me wear way too much winter clothes because she thinks I'm prone to getting sick. I have to wear this giant Swedish parka that is extremely thick and heavy. Under the parka I have to wear a long down coat. My mother also forces me to wear snowpants and huge winter boots. The worst part of this is way my mother wraps up my head because according to her that's where you lose all your heat from. She makes me wear a really thick hat with ear flaps, a scarf wrapped around my face, my coat's hood up over that, my Swedish parka's big fur lined hood up over the first one, and another scarf wrapped over the hoods. This is how I have to dress when I go to school or anywhere else in the winter.

60,"I came home from college this past weekend (I go to college about 1-2 hour's drive from home). I met up with my close friend and a couple other mutual friends, and she ended up taking us to a frat party. Knowing that I would need to get the four of us home safely, I didn't drink or anything, but they did. I dropped the other two off at their dorm before driving my friend from the title home.

As soon as the other two got out of my car, she asked me if I wanted to make out ""in a non-romantic way."" This is something that we had done a couple of times before over the summer, but that we decided probably shouldn't anymore. So, I told her no, since she wasn't sober, and we agreed we wouldn't. 

We drove home in silence, until a few blocks away from her house, when she brings it up again. When I park, she asks again, this time kissing me before I respond. I tell her we shouldn't, but she lays down on my lap. I decide that we should actually have a conversation about it. During this conversation, we cuddle, and she kisses my cheek and asks me to kiss her several times. I don't.

During the conversation, she says:

* She thinks we would be good for each other's second marriage.

* That she wants to see how things work out with a co-worker that she's been on a couple of dates with.

* How she wishes she had been more honest with me, and that it was too late now.

* That she thought it would be too predictable for us to end up together, and that she was worried that if we did, it would ruin our friendship.

* Several times she said that I deserved the best partner possible, and that she knew that they would always be happy with me.

* Several times she asked me to have sex with her.

* Several times she told me that she wanted me to be with a couple other women and ""gain experience"" before being with her.

* She said that she thought we would be a good match, but that she wanted to see how things went with her co-worker.

* She thanked me for sticking with her for as long as I have. In addition, she said that I ""have always been good to her.""

The whole time, we're holding each other, and around halfway through the conversation she remarks that she doesn't feel drunk anymore, ""just high.""

I am somewhat interested in her, and to an extent I told her that - I said that if I knew she was interested in pursuing a relationship with me, I would love to give it a try. She re-iterated that she wanted me to get experience first, and that she wanted to see how things went with her co-worker.

That was Friday night, and now I am back at my college for a few weeks. She and I talked a bit more over the weekend, but nothing about the conversation, apart from her testing me ""I regret everything. I'm still fucked up,"" the next day during her break at work. 

Now I don't know if she was blacked out that night (she didn't seem like she was, since she didn't slur her words and she was fairly coordinated and aware, but I'm not sure). I want to know if what she said that night was really how she felt, but I'm not sure how to bring it up with her without it seeming weird, especially since she wants to date her coworker for the time being.

What should I do? Wait to ask when she and her coworker break up, or bite the bullet and ask her about it now?

61,"This is a thought I have been trying to avoid for a long time, but I can't ignore it any longer. I have a crippling fear of alcohol. I can't be around it. I can't be around people who are drinking. My hands start to shake, I get nauseous, and I start to breathe very quickly.

This all stems from my mother's alcoholism.

Now, of course, I plan not to drink at college, but I still want to have a social life, and it is an undeniable truth that at a fair majority of college get-togethers, drinking does happen.

As it stands, I won't be able to go to any of those. I'll lose it.

And so I'm left with a few options. I can:

* Only have friends who don't drink

* Not go to college

* Try to overcome my fear

The first is not an option because I will miss out on a lot of cool people and cool experiences.

The second is stupid for reasons that do not need explaining.

The third is obviously the best option but I have no idea how to achieve it. I am really terrified of drinking in any quantity. It really freaks me out.

I am not afraid of alcohol being used in food.

Now, I'm not saying I ever need to be comfortable drinking, I just need to be comfortable **around** drinking. Even that is a difficult proposition.

Now you might be thinking ""u/throwawaymnbvvbnm, how do you go to parties?""

I don't get invited.

""Not even-""

Nope.

Nor do my parents drink. Nor does anyone in my family when my mother is around (you know, because of her alcoholism), and I am only around them with her.

This makes any kind of exposure therapy difficult, and that's the only thing I can think of that could potentially solve my problem.

So here I am, at a loss. I obviously need to fix this, but I have no idea how.

One last thing; if you're going to suggest not fixing this, save it. You will be wasting your words.",22Feb2017,0

68,"I've finished both my bachelors and masters in accounting. I've finished all of the CPA exams and started working at a large accounting firm in September 2015.


&amp;nbsp;


Long story short, I had the worst experience of my life at that firm. I was eventually let go this past December.


&amp;nbsp;


I now work at a local accounting firm. The people at this firm are nicer and the work is more bearable because of it, but I still can't bring myself to enjoy what I'm doing.


&amp;nbsp;


I can't shake my feelings and poor experiences from the previous firm - they haunt me daily. As a result, I can't see the profession in the same light. I don't feel fulfilled by my work. I no longer have a passion for the profession like I did when finishing school and this is entirely as a result of my horrible experience at the first firm.


&amp;nbsp;


I'm considering going back to school to learn from a professor that I have tremendous respect for. The only issue is that the professor teaches computer science, which is a field where experience and skill are more relevant for getting a job than a degree. However, I do feel that becoming a programmer is more meaningful because I can create programs that others can enjoy or see as useful (programmers of Reddit, please chime with your opinion!). I'm also considering taking this professor's classes online or as a non-degree seeking student; thus not getting a degree but just fulfilling my desire to learn from him.

70,"20 Years Old + Recently lost virginity to a girl. 

Up to that point I had only made-out with girls and seen them naked. Never done anything sexually at all.

Since then, we've had sex numerous times and she has admitted that I'm the 1st guy she's really had sex with. (The other 2 were drunken hook-ups)

I told her I had sex with one other girl, but that wasn't true. Now whenever she brings up her sexual past, I feel semi-uncomfortable with the lie I've made. It's not really a big deal, but part of me thinks I should be honest. Still though, we don't plan to date, although we hangout quite often. Does it matter if I don't tell her and just avoid the topic? If she hasn't noticed by now, I must not be that bad in bed.. lol..

At a new school this year, and have a good friend going through the same struggle as I was some months ago. I really really genuinely want to help her, but she just won't open her mind up and consider new things

She is the unfortunate type to become easily misinformed... ""Vaccines cause autism, lemons are good for your face, Vaseline causes cancer, etc."" She tends to stick with whatever information she was given first, doesn't acknowledge any validity of studies.

She also doesn't ""believe"" in dermatologists, and doesn't end up using the stuff her derm tries to give her, because its ""unnatural""

Because of this, she does plenty of things that either don't affect or exacerbate her acne. She thinks that super expensive skin products automatically equal the best treatment. She also puts a majority of her focus on diet (especially diary, which only has a very weak link (if any) to acne), instead of focusing on her actual face. I am confident something as simple as using /r/skincareaddiction's ""SCA Routine"" will greatly reduce her acne.

A big problem here is that she gets pretty offended if i try to merely suggest her anything, or send her a study on an effective treatment.

Acne is a major self-esteem ruiner for her, and it really frustrates me knowing that I have the power and information to help significantly, but *she just won't give it a damn chance.*

88,"So basically, there is a girl (19f) Hannah that I (21m) have been spending a lot of time with over the past few months. She is my roommates best friend, and she spends pretty much half or more of her time at our place. Now, I definitely like her a lot in many regards. She is funny, cute, enjoyable to be around, etc... However, we really differ in one key area. She is a social butterfly that needs to be around people pretty much at all times, and I much prefer time to myself.

Now, I do not live my life in complete isolation. I enjoy spending time with my roommates and going out on a weekend for a fun day trip. However, I very much value my alone time too. I can only be around people so long before I feel drained. I love being by myself. A day alone just doing what I want, listening to my music, no one to worry about but myself, that is my idea of a perfect day. And if I want to be alone, I want to be. I'm an adult, and I feel like I should be able to decide if I want to be alone or hanging out with people. 

Hannah, on the other hand, wants to be with people at all times. She can literally not even stand the thought of having to spend time on her own. I honestly dread the days where she is over and my roommates have to do go somewhere. She will spend all her time around me. I have tried explaining to her that I like to be alone, but she doesn't seem to get it. She tells me shes bored, and acts like its my problem to fix. If i finally get her to do something by herself, she is back in my room a half hour later saying she gave up or is bored again.

Like I said, she is definitely interested in me and there is a possibility of dating her. But even though I like a lot of stuff about her, the clinginess seems like a deal breaker to me. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I honestly cannot stand people who need to be around someone 24/7. I love my alone time, and literally need it to feel normal and not burned out. I don't think that is wrong. My roommates tell my I am being too harsh, and that if I give her a chance I might start to enjoy all the time with her. They keep telling me I will regret if I let it pass. But I just don't think it will work. I honestly wouldn't go into a relationship expecting not to spend time with the other person, but with her its literally going to be every waking minute. Should I give her a chance or just let her pass me by?

90,"I moved into an apartment last month. I'm living with 2 other guys who were randomly assigned.

Roommate 1 is called Fargo, roommate 2 is called BusyBee.

Fargo has a drinking problem. I've never seen him without a drink. When he's drunk, he talks a LOT, and just keeps rambling without listening to anyone else. However, he's always been nice to me and helped me adjust to this new town (even though I don't enjoy his company).

BusyBee doesn't get home until 8. He keeps to himself, but has a loud party on the weekends. Last weekend, at one of these loud parties, Fargo got into a fight with another drunk guy. Since then, Fargo has been blaming BusyBee (who was not involved in the fight and found out later). I was also not around to see the fight, so both of us heard about it through Fargo and the other guy involved.

When BusyBee is not at home, Fargo continuously insults BusyBee. I can just stand there and nod because I don't want to take sides, though Fargo is really trying to get me to side with him. Fargo gets really loud and obnoxious and somewhat physical when super drunk.

When BusyBee is home, Fargo ignites some sort of verbal conflict and blames BusyBee for random trivial things. There's always an argument going on between them. BusyBee tries to reason with Fargo, but Fargo is too drunk to understand. He keeps talking without listening and just can't be reasoned with.

I tried to mediate the conflict by having both sides talk about their grievances, but Fargo would keep interrupting BusyBee and just highlight his own problems repeatedly. 

In the past, I've seen Fargo get really drunk and start playing with knives. He's always talking about how he's got into a lot of fights in the past. 

Last night, around midnight, I heard BusyBee talking on the phone with some friend. Fargo entered and started insulting BusyBee and his friends (he got vulgar and loud). BusyBee ignored him for a while.

Fargo continued this and started blaming BusyBee for a lot of trivial things again. He was obviously drunk. 

Then I heard BusyBee say, ""Hey put down the knife"" and ""Are you threatening me with that knife"" and ""I'm gonna call the police if you don't put it down right now"". Fargo just kept spewing insults. I assume he eventually put it down because their voices stopped being so loud.

---

I feel unsafe in this apartment because of Fargo (who keeps insisting that BusyBee is a bad person and that I should be afraid of BusyBee and watch my back). Fargo is always drunk and very obnoxious because all he talks about is how BusyBee is a bad person, and how many fights Fargo has been in.

I don't know what to do here. I don't think my landlord will be able to do anything about this. Also, I'm afraid that if I report Fargo and he finds out I did it, he'll come after me. It's a tiny town and everyone knows each other. I'd also feel some guilt because Fargo seems to trust me and thinks I'm on his side etc.

Since I was thirteen years old, I have had a passion for art. Sufficed to say that my favourite form is music. As I developed, my passion did too.

I started longing to learn how to play certain instruments: Guitar, Piano, Violin, etc. I've been playing the Guitar for a year, and the keyboard for half that, simply because my household is in no financial condition to afford something as expensive as a Piano.

I'm constantly hearing about these (usually) teenage ""music producers"" and how they think that they're the best of the best, that they're gonna change the game, but everything they release is pure, unfiltered rubbish.

Since I have a severely warped perception of myself, I just assume that everything I create is vile waste, so I started asking for second opinions from my friends and family.

""I said you dropped your smile, I was just messing with you, ha ha!""

I gave him a dirty look and looked away. I noticed him still staring at me a few minutes later and frowned at him again. 

His friend across from me whipped out his phone and it took me a little while to realize he was pointing his phone at me, appearing to take pictures of me from multiple angles. Shocked, I looked at him so he'd know I saw him at least and moved a few seats away.

At this point I paused my music so I could eavesdrop. His phone started dinging with the facebook messenger tone like crazy, and he went and sat down next to his friend, showing him the phone screen and said, ""He says yes.""

But we still hung out all the time. I meet my girlfriend and friendzone girl and I get in a fight. She basically said I have to pick one of them. I pick GF (obviously). So I stop seeing the friend stuff gets messy and ugly and we are on bad terms. Fast forward about 10 months. Girlfriend and I go to a friends birthday party and friendzone girl is there. Me and her start talking a bit. I'm drunk and she is drunk. We are just having small talk. And friendzone girl has her new boyfriend there. Nice swell guy. I'm sitting at the bar talking with someother friends and my girlfriend. Friendzone girl comes over and puts arm around me and kinda rest on my shoulder. I don't think anything of it and let her stay. BIG MISTAKE. Girlfriend gets pissed and goes and talks to other friends of hers. Night ends. Next day girlfriend and I get in a huge fight about how I lett that girl put her arm around me and GF says I basically cheated and that its a huge deal because I used to like that girl. I explain that I USED to like her. But I love my girlfriend and picked her over frienDzone girl. Girlfriend says I don't understand. 
Now every couple weeks my girlfriend will bring this incident up. All the time she does. Never let's it go. Doesn't matter what I say or do.  
That incident was almost a year ago. And she still won't forgive me for it. Last night she brought it up again. And said she will never forget or get over it. I asked ""in 5 years will you still be bringing it up?""  She says yes. Because of that night my girlfriend is extremely jealous of a girl that I used to like and be friends with. I've cut off all contact with this girl, yet GF is still jealous and brings incident up.
NOW here is my question I need advice about. I love my girlfriend and could see myself marrying her honestly. But she will never forgive me for that night. Should I just end things now and breakup with her? Because I can't stay in a relationship where the past is constantly brought up and forgiveness is non existent

I come home my feet stink, so I have to shower, I can't sit on the bed with my clothes on, so I need to change (we have one room). She tries to teach me a word in her language, and I don't understand it immediately (because I need to see it written down), and she gets frustrated. We go to a coffee shop, and she wants to move because she's been working too hard (fast food) and needs to sit. So she starts complaining about her body to make me feel bad for not getting the waitress in time to move us ... I move us. I put my bag on the floor and it has to be closer to the table so no one steals it. Then we start to chat and have a good time. As we left the coffee shop she was trying to get out but couldn't move because there was no space around the table. She was waiting for me to move the table for her to get out, but I didn't realize I had to do that, so she had to ask and then I did it. Then she tried to squeeze through two tables and couldn't fit easily while I was putting my glasses in my bag, and she raised her voice and expected me to move the tables more. I'm clumsy -  I did and almost fell, hit my hand and hurt myself a little. Then she walked out super happy, and I was upset because she didn't even say sorry for scolding me in public. Then she got mad at me for not holding her hand because I was in a bad mood. Then she wouldn't talk to me for the way home after I was grumpy too. I tried to make it up to her by apologizing and trying to have off the wall convo. I asked what I did wrong, and she said I don't think about us, together - I should be more aware of our bodies.

103,"I'm a freshman at Uni right now, and over my Winter Break I met this girl who I was between acquaintance and friend with in high school. We hit it up well, and hooked up, and we've been dating for a month now long distance. She had told me that she had dated someone when she first started college, but that they only lasted a month and he broke up with her. She claimed that this time frame was the month of November. She said that she already hooked up with someone in December for less than a week, and that at this point she's completely over her Ex. We're rather long distance, but we Skype for hours every day and more often than not it goes really well.

Today, however, she told me that the day after we hooked up (early January) her ex texted her asking her if she wanted to resume their relationship, and she said yes, but he called it off after ""less than a day"", and so we went out again the next day.

This to me suggests three things

1. She wasn't completely over her ex as late as January

2. There hasn't been a period of time over the last 4 months (Nov-Present) that she hasn't talked with her Ex at least once a week (she claims they're still friends and that is how often they talk).

3. Something tells me she's still hiding something, but I'm not sure what. I also don't know how to approach her with this.

I might get a little rambly here but please bear with me.

I trust her a lot, and don't think she'd do anything to hurt me. This is something I truly believe in. If she's not telling me the whole truth it'll be because she's afraid that I'll be super hurt or upset, not because she's actively trying to hide anything from me.

I understood going into this relationship that I might be her rebound, but I figured I liked her enough to take that risk. I truly do not think I am her rebound.

She's a rather emotionally distant person to everyone, and has trouble trusting people because of some issues when she was growing up. She does say however that she likes me more than she ever liked her ex (something I believe in) because he was incredibly emotionally distant and chose his friends over her and became upset over the smallest things. I'm none of these things as a person, and I really do think she enjoys all her time with me. She claims that around he was distant and uncommitted compared to me, and that she didn't feel like she could be herself around him.

She's secretive, but I'm 90% sure that's just her personality. For example, when we first started dating she wouldn't even tell me her Ex's name, and it was after a period of time that each detail finally came out. I don't think this is her hiding something, I think it's just her personality, but I figured it was worth putting in.

My basic question is what do I do here? I've brought up my concerns, but she just assures me I'm not a rebound.

I have a small hunch I'm not getting the full truth, but how do I even approach that? It's literally just a hunch.

I want to say that so far, I think it's going great despite the distance-- we have lots of fun, she's the best part of my day, and we Skype for quite a while every day. It's really nice to have her around, it's just that this little feeling of unease is creeping up on me, and I was wondering if it were normal/ what to do about it. I don't see terminating the relationship as much of an option here.",22Feb2017,1
104,"So I am working for a client who has a few issues with his online presence. He pissed off a dude who has made it his life's mission to post as much nonsensical slanderous crap about my client on as many blogger blogs as humanly possible. He has been threatened with legal action but he posts under pseudonyms which, according to the cops in SA, means we can't take legal action until we prove it's him and according to Blogger without a US court order they don't get to decide what is slander and what isn't and they won't take the websites down.

So is there any other way of taking these websites down or getting them de-indexed by Google? They have been inactive since 2012 but they are causing my client to lose a lot of business.

108,"Hello redditors. I do not know where else to say this, since I am not comfortable sharing this to friends and family. This week has been the worst I have had in a long time. It seems like all the bad things happening are piling up in a day's worth, and it feels like I am stuck. It feels like I do not have options on this. I do not know how to solve my problems. I feel alone, with no one to cling on to. With that said, I would like to point out all my problems that have been stacking up as of last night. To think that things couldn't get any worse, I thought twice as I am pretty sure things will continue on like this. Without further ado, I extend my asking for help to you guys by sharing with you my problems: 

**a. I am about to lose my job next month if I do not make a sale.** 

Quota month is fast approaching in my field of work. I have not made a sale yet and it feels like I am given a month's worth to make at least one more sale. Given the limited time that I have, I think it is nearly impossible to make a sale within a month's work. Albeit possible, I wouldn't give my maximum effort if nothing would happen. That would just mean that my efforts will go to waste come the time that I will be losing my job. Right now, I should be thinking of which company to move to so I can fast track my productivity. I do not know, please help me. 

**b. The gym I am working out at is finally asking me to pay.**

I know, yes I know. This is stupidity on my part. I skipped 2 months worth of pay for this, as I tried to skim my way til the 3rd month. 2 month's worth of pay is not worth running away from, but given my certain cash flow for the next 2 weeks, I do not think I am able to pay as soon as possible. This would mean giving up the rest of the week to work out, and that would mean skipping my work out plan. Hence, ruining my entire program. Again, I know. This is stupidity on my part, but it is making me feel REALLY bad for it.

**c. My closing deal might back out for this certain real estate contract.** 

I am an acting real estate broker. The seller is entertaining a different client, even if my buyer is already abroad in talks with upper management. Fucked up, right? Yes, indeed. :( This just means that I might lose the money that I expect to receive come next week. 

**d. I plan on taking my real estate broker review to prep up for this year's exam.** 

I just found out that this exam is now just for those who took the real estate course in college. In short, I am not eligible for this. Last year, they were accepting anyone as long as they pass the exam. I just knew about it last night, and this definitely amplified my negative emotions. 

**e. I am broke as fuck til next week's pay day. :(**

As mentioned above, I need to pay for my gym fee but will not be able to do so until next week. I can't spend so much for the remaining days and this would really affect my cash flow. Yes, I still find it hard to manage my savings. Stupid me. 

**f. My father (who never loved my family) does not want to pay for my brother's prom event this Friday.** 

Short background: I am part of a second family that my father left. He is only there to support us for financial needs. Emotionally, he was never there and I feel deeply sad for this. 

Anyway, my mother (who is a housewife with no job) told me earlier this morning that my brother had been crying last night because my father does not want to sponsor for his prom this Friday. She was asking me to help pay for it, but given my financial situation for the week, I am not able to help even if I wanted to. I feel really bad for him. 

Connect the dots and see how shitty this week is for me. All in all, I think it all boils down to my financial stability. I am helpless. I am the type to ""fake it til I make it"", but deep inside I yearn for success. 

Please please please, I really need your advice because I honestly do not know what to do. 

If this was karma, then definitely karma's a bitch. ",22Feb2017,2
109,"I'm a 20 year old woman and I have a lot of trouble asserting myself socially. It's also hard for me to loosen up and talk to people. I can't help being kind of fake when I'm talking to people I don't know well. I don't necessarily feel shy or awkward. I'm comfortable in my body, I'm comfortable being around people. I think.

I try not to give off the vibe that I'm giving off, but can't help using a super fake, chipper voice when talking to strangers. When someone bumps into me, I apologize. If someone calls my name, I jump. I have a hard time looking into people's eyes. I can't think of anything to say to keep a conversation going. Etc, etc, etc.

This has really started to bother me at my (fast food) job. When someone asks me to do something, I don't mind so I do it. But now some of my coworkers will constantly tell me what to do (which is a weird thing to do where I work.) This wouldn't bother me too much, but it's these small signs of disrespect that really get to me. I can see that they're bossing me around because they enjoy being in control. They don't talk to our other coworkers like they do me.

I feel like people see me as a child or something. I feel like they're talking down to me. Even my close friends have noticed.

I've been trying very very hard to make this stop. I've studied body language so I don't appear so vulnerable.  I practice making social habits at work because I deal with lots of customers.

I don't think I've always been like this. At least not to this extreme. But I hate it! Not only am I a doormat, but I can't make any friends. I go to parties, I meet people, and I don't know how to have real conversations! Its all superficial.

So I guess I need to know how to assert myself. How to earn people's respect. How to talk to people. Make friends. Any advice at all!

110,"For a long time, I've known that I'm a sadist and that I enjoy the dominant and sadist side of BDSM, but lately I've been feeling sort of scared by the fantasies and things I'm aroused by. I feel like they're potentially too extreme, even for fantasies. I don't want to go into too much detail, but ideas of sexual assault, kidnapping, rape, etc. pop into my mind a little too often for my own comfort. I would never do something like that, and I have control of myself, and I don't see myself as that kind of person, but I feel dirty knowing that if I could get away with it without consequence, I would. 

This also makes me wonder about the future of my relationships, because I don't know if I would be happy in a relationship with someone who wasn't a submissive. BDSM is certainly becoming more mainstream, and I am talking to someone who fits the bill for me quite nicely right now, but what about in the future, and if things with them don't work out? It's hard enough just meeting people period, let alone someone into or willing to delve into the things I'm interested in sexually. 

Also, unrelated from BDSM but related to the main point, I find myself very attracted to Millie Bobby Brown. Not sexually, but more so romantically? As in like, as impossible as this is, if I could kiss/marry/date any famous person it'd be her, but she's only 13, 12 when I first became interested in her. This is decidedly not cool as someone between the age of 19-24. I feel embarrassed and ashamed by it, but she's so beautiful. I wish I could just keep a poster of her up on my wall, or have her as my phone or computer background, but that would be unbelievably taboo, and the implications of that would be terrible. I know people already think of me as kind of strange, but they just wouldn't associate with me at all if they were to learn about something like that. I really don't know what to do about that. 

tldr; My fantasies of committing sexual assault/kidnapping and attraction to young actress Millie Bobby Brown make me uncomfortable, and I don't know what to do with these feelings. What should I do?",22Feb2017,4

113,"Hi there, so I am going to try and keep this as short as possible... but here goes. I recently moved from the USA to Italy to take up a job as a manager in a certain corporation. My pay is about 20k E per annum, and to put it simply I am miserable. I love the company I work for, but overall working for someone else is not what I was thinking it would be. I have been here 3 months so far and every morning I wake up with utter dread. 

  I have little time for myself, I don't particularly like my job and the only reason I am sticking around is because I need the money. Now, I do believe I have a plan B but obviously I want everyones advice on whether it's feasible. 

 In Spain I am lucky enough to have some family, in fact so lucky that my mother owns a home there which stays vacant for most of the year. My Spanish is fluent, I am also a citizen of the country and my Plan B would be to move to Spain (where I feel very comfortable and can speak the language) and try and teach English, as well as do some web related work while living rent free in an apartment.  I am sure I won't get nearly as much money, probably will even have to cut some corners to survive, but I will be living rent free so that's a substantial amount saved right off the bat. 

 Anyway I guess my question is as follows, do I stick around a few more months to get experience/money or do I try and head to Spain and leave Italy behind? If anyone has any questions, please feel free to drop it below. ",22Feb2017,2

121,"Hi there, I'm doing my final semester on geology in Australia. I'm only doing one unit this time around as I needed to repeat a paper in my previous years. 

Lately I've been offered a job opportunity in the mine site. I will need to spend 2 weeks straight on site, and a week's break. Then the whole process repeats itself. 

I had been told that I'll start work April. Meaning by then, I would only have about 2 months more of uni to do. Since the unit that I'm doing has 2 practical tests in the between the semester as well as a group project, I've decided to email my lecturer about it. He wasn't very kind on his reply and basically he said that I wouldn't be getting any extensions if I were to take the job. 

So now I'm so lost on what to do. Im very keen on getting a job that is related to my field of study, but at the same time I can't turn uni away yet since I have only ONE unit to do. 

So here are my options and I'd like some advice on the whole issue:

1. Do both the job and uni. It will be tough but it'll be the best of both worlds. I'll have to grind through for half the semester to make this work. I can ask for time off if I get test/exam dates before hand. 

2. Defer my semester for a year. I'll be able to save up and I can do it properly next year since the unit is only offered once a year. 

3. Don't take the job. Finish university.

122,"I'm a 32yr old single male. I have about USD $70,000 saved and I want to multiply this sum of money. At the moment I do not want to touch this 70K. It is like the only money I have apart from my monthly income, so I want to be quite careful with it. I want to figure out and test run a reliable system for at least 6 months to 1 year (on a small budget of less than US $700 per month) before expanding the system by injecting the 70K gradually into it. I want to reduce the risk of losing my shirt as much as possible.

I have skills in web/programming and systems stuff. I'm able to set up various kinds of servers / API, code scrapers, bots, APIs, web/backend applications and much more. I'm currently employed in this field.

I have experience setting up various businesses of service &amp; product oriented nature (alone and with partners), but closed them eventually because of poor or negative returns. I'm willing to start another business, and I think it has to be 'connected' to the Internet in some way because I see the Internet as a huge 'force multiplier'. It gives you much more exposure, potential customer base etc, compared to setting up a small off-line shop in a small town.

I'm quite comfortable networking with people for business, and giving presentations etc.

I also have an interest in financial markets and trading. I've explored intra-day forex, bitcoin/crypto-currency trading. I've heard of eToro etc but no idea how to get started 'properly'. I do not think I want to do intra-day Forex, because of the constant attention I have to pay to it and stress. I know of guys who do ""swing trading"" who seem to make a ton of money but again have no idea how to learn the knowledge and skills properly (is there a course?).

124,"So I've been at my job for almost a year. It's great and I'm so lucky to have landed with a great company. There's 3 of us in my team, and one is like a sister to me, and the other is a 'testing' kind of person. She started working there just over 3 months ago, and within the first week, I knew something was a bit off. She is a pathological liar and consistently attention and sympathy seeking. which is obviously a problem in the workplace, especially for me when she's in my team. (Went for a team lunch just after Christmas, she spent most of the time talking about all the things that have gone wrong in her life)

So within the week of having just started, this girl has told me her pretty much life story, along with everything about her fiance and daughter. After about 4 days she tells me I simply must go to her wedding, and my colleague and I sense something's a bit funky bout this gals social boundaries. This has only got much worse since, and now everyone in the office has copped on. 

 She has a really intense scalp problem and she is constantly digging her big nails into her head to scratch, and leaving big flakes all over her work area (chair, desk, phone, you name it, she's got her scalp on it) She keeps saying she's no longer smoking, while smells like ashtray. Plus she says she has diabetes, by the way she eats, I find this really hard to believe. The list goes on. 

My biggest issue with her is that she just won't take initiative and do things for herself at work. She asks me very mundane, repetitive and silly questions about decision making, so much so I'm just now asking ""what do you think you should do?"" I get about 6 calls per day to my desk phone from her, anytime I email or message her with a question. She is struggling to juggle simple tasks, such as organizing someone to come in and empty sanitary bins, and ordering catering. Prioritising work seems very difficult to her. But she won't speak up when she doesn't understand how to do something. Consequently, it reflects badly on the whole team. 
Big important part of this is that this girl is 8 years older than me, and socially we have pretty much nothing in common. I'm really trying to be nice. But I'm not even struggling the most here, I feel like my other team member is going to lost her shit at this girl. She is legit at breaking point.

I'm a pretty patient person, and I really try to be nice.  It when I give her an inch, she takes fucking 10 miles. I'm really coming to the end of my tether.

I've passed on to my boss that she should be more pro active, and I know the reason she's not is because she doesn't have that confidence to be proactive, but I can't keep holding her hand and at this stage I'm making excuses for her.

I'm living with my father. My job does not pay enough for me to live anywhere and still have enough to get by. I never finished my college education. I had to drop out of university due to depression and have been living back with my dad since 2012. I've been with this company for 3.5 years; the job was part of a deal my dad worked out so I could get some exposure to the work life. It's been nearly 4 years, and I have nothing to show for it, just credit card debt and an aching neck. 

I would love to take it all back and wish I powered through my education, but the best I can do now is learn and move forward. But I have no idea how to even begin. People tell me the degree is all that matters, not what you study, just that piece of paper.

131,"And here comes the context....

Basically we met in high school year 2011, hit it off and fell in love. 3 months later we discover she's pregnant and things begin to get complicated with our parents as we were in a Catholic private high school and our parents strict Catholics themselves. 

We overcame the odds and had our son, who is 4 now, and worked endlessly to make sure we could prove our pre marital relations were worth the investment. 

Family of 3 aside, I discovered she had been having, over the course of the first 3 years, some online relationships with 2 other men. Her excuse being ""she didn't know why she did it"" which I expected. We worked it out, I settled for the loss of confidence and we continued. 

2016 comes around and in march we moved into an apartment together and things were great for about 5 months until I discovered she was still having an online relationship with one of the men from before. I broke up with her, had a come to Jesus moment, and again after 2 weeks I settled to stick with her hoping she would come to her senses. 2 months later discover she's still having intimate contact with the same guy, still no sex as she says, though I have my suspicions. Still together.

Fast forward to February, and she has been leaving the house at odd hours of the night to visit her girl friends house who she works with. After a couple days, she takes our son to meet this a new male coworker at the mall and they have a day out while I'm home alone. And after 7 straight days of diss appearances in the middle of the night and making excuses not to come home while I stay with our son, I decide to have serious discussion about our future and she breaks things off with me saying she doesn't want to hurt me while ""she finds herself."" 

Bottoms line, I'm a broken man doing everything I possibly can to stay with this woman because I love her endlessly and she's mistreated me on more than one occasion with less than respectful actions and hiding. I am left and feel she's found someone else or doesn't care who her partner is. 

I'm alone, and all I want to do is work things out with her. She has HPD, histrionic personality disorder, but for whatever reason I can't fathom leaving her, being alone, and raising our son apart. I never wanted this and did everything in my power to help us succeed and I've been left in dust.

What do I do? Move on and see what the future holds? Continue to help her and try and work things out?

So I have a terrible sense of humour to start off with, and I take absolutely zero offence to people even telling me to kill myself, or that I'm gay (I'm not), or basically anything and I often think they're just trying to funny or friendly. Sometimes I say these things back, but incredibly rarely and I will usually say I'm joking straight after (I usually don't tell people to kill themselves though).   
  
I've also apparently got a problem where I like to take things into my own hands too much, like at work we have some terrible stats and our bosses have constantly talked about it and I'm trying to encourage the team to do better, and had someone snap at me tonight at work because of this.  
  
I also tend to say blurt things out and regret it later and force my opinions on other people or have it my way or no way (as some of my friends have said). And sometimes I can blurt out harsh things or things that I don't think are mean or anything but then have people not like me for it. I feel really bad and feel people don't like me for this and hate working with me and etc.

135,"I live in an apartment by myself in Hollywood.  I have neighbors all around me.  I am a waiter and almost all my shifts are closing ones. Most nights I don't get home until 2 or 3 in the morning.  I don't try to be loud, but when I get home I walk into my apartment and live my life.  A lot of times I change clothes, make food and get ready for bed.  It's weird because my sleep schedule is reversed from most peoples. I end up sleeping until Noon and that's when my day starts.  Not often, but somtimes my downstairs neighbor gets annoyed with me and will bang on the cieling, he's even complained to the landlord that I walk around too much.  I definitely understand his point, but this is how I make my living. I wish i didn't have to have this schedule but it is what it is.  On the other hand at 8 in the morning he will start blasting music and sometimes it wakes me up, but I just accept this as part of living in an apartment complex in the middle of hollywood. I have saturdays off and when I first moved in I used to have one or two friends over earlier in the night before we went out to have a few drinks. It would be around 7 pm on a saturday and he would bang on my door yelling for us to stop walking around. Basically since then I don't have anybody over, and I'm so uncomfortable even walking around my apartment at night.  I understand we have way different schedules, but for what I pay I feel I should be able to enjoy my apartment. I really dont play loud music or have people over or anything.  Some nights he'll have people over and it's loud but i really don't care, it's part of city living.  I hadn't had any sort of issues in a few months, but then two nights ago I get home from work and I'm changing to go to bed and he just starts banging on the ceiling.  I feel I try to be conscience of him, but I hate that I can't feel comfortable in my own place.  Am I wrong?

137,"So a few reasons I hate my job. To start out, I'm a salesman at Sprint. Now for the reasons:

1. The first day on the floor in the middle of one of my sales, (keep in mind this customer wanted to be in and out quickly, and told me that at the door so no one else knew) the store manager barges in and starts selling him 500 promos and not letting me talk in which the customer goes ""ok we're leaving"", and the store manager pulls me in the back and reprimands me on losing the customer.

2. The system never works. Ever. Every time someone uses it, a process that should take 10 minutes takes 30 because we have to call support all the time to fix things for us on the spot.

3. It's 45 minutes away from my house.

4. They have a mandatory weekly meeting every Thursday at about 845 pm (which they did not tell me about in the job description). If I finish my shift at 630, I have to twiddle my thumbs since I live too far.

5. The store manager constantly uses me as a scapegoat for when he sucks. Like helping a customer and he has no idea what to do and he will say something like ""sorry he's new, I have to walk him through some stuff"".

Should I quit? Really it's draining my sanity and I don't actually need the money, just wanted some sales experience. I'm just afraid no one will hire me ever if they see I have a sales job length of 3 weeks.",22Feb2017,1
139,"Due to reasons, I never really learned math past a fourth grade level (long story). Many years later (at the ripe age of 23) I've managed to struggle my way through 3 remedial math classes and I now find myself in a college level algebra class and I feel pretty lost. Math is something that never really came easy to me, and as a Computer Science major I find myself wondering if I'm swimming against the current. 

I have a test tomorrow, that despite studying my ass off for I will most likely fail - my foundational knowledge of math is incredibly weak and sometimes I wonder if I can catch up and go on to learn the calculus that's required to get my Comp Sci degree. A part of me has considered changing my major to something less mathematically focused, but Comp Sci is the only major which I have an internal inclination to pursue. Have I set an unrealistic goal for myself ? Can someone who failed Mth-98 twice go on to learn calculus ?",22Feb2017,3

141,"At the end of last year my sister was hospitalized for a week for attempted suicide. It really messed up our family for a little while and I ended up tanking the end of my university semester. Mind you, her suicide attempt &amp; hospitalization were on top of personal problems I was already having.

Apparently I can appeal to have these marks not count towards my final GPA but I need to appeal and submit proper documentation. I know how to get documentation for my own issues but where do I go to find documentation to prove what happened with my sister?
Do I ask the hospital? Our family doctor? 
Has anyone else had to do something similar and what was the process? Was the documentation you received specific? I have so many questions but I'm not sure where to go for answers so I figured I'd start here. 
I live in Ontario (Canada).

142,"My husband and I dropped off his car for maintenance on Saturday at the dealership we bought it from. The maintenance costed $200 more than we were originally quoted when we got the car and were told about the maintenance coming up, and on Saturday they wouldn't give us an exact number when we asked. It's a 2015 Chrysler 300 with about 30,000 miles on it, and in the 9 month or so since we bought it, it has driven like the dream car my husband wanted.

On Saturday when we picked it up, a drive about 15 miles away, parked in our garage fot about 30 minutes, then left to see a movie about 10 miles away. We didn't make it to the theater before smoke started coming out from under the hood. At this point, we noticed the trail of oil behind our car that we later discovered started with about a quart or two in our garage, and is still (four days later) a visible stream all the way to the parking lot we stopped at where we lost another couple of quarts. We immediately pulled off the road, called the dealership, asked to speak with the service manager and told him about the issue. He told us to drive it back. I guess he didn't understand that we had gotten so far, because when I told him where we were and demanded that they come pick it up, he obliged immediately with a free tow back.

The tow truck driver was from a third party and when he arrived and loaded our car onto his flatbed, he was surprised to see oil draining out of the car so quickly that in the few minutes the trailer was angled while he loaded the car, a pool of oil rolled the full 16 feet and started to dribble onto the pavement behind it. He told us that if we had driven back as originally suggested, it would have destroyed out engine and caught fire before we made it halfway there.

The service team greeted us politely and apologetically, and pretended to have a rental car ready for us, but it was actually someone else’s rental car and they switched them out while we were waiting on paperwork, so we had to wait 20 minutes for a rental even though it had taken over an hour for us to arrive at the dealership. They told us they would figure out what was wrong, fix it, and call us on Monday.

We did some research and found out that this incident could easily have cause additional damage to the car, and decided to take it to another mechanic to check over when we picked it up. We called our trusted mechanic buddy at another dealership and he advised we talk to the general manager. On Monday when we arrived at 5:45 (the earliest we could get there after work) we went straight to the receptionist and asked to see the general manager, who was in a corporate meeting. We waited too see him for two hours, asking different employees to see if he was out yet, and finally found out that he left during the first hour we were waiting. We decided to go back to service and get our car back, but they couldn’t find the key and had no idea where our car was. They told us to hang onto the rental and come back the next day. We asked the receptionist and four other people to tell the general manager we would be back at about 5:45 and that we would like to see him, and they all gave us their word and took down our names and phone number.

We returned yesterday, and saw the general manager. He said he had not heard anything about us or this situation, and kept asking us what the issue was and then interrupting as we explained (we were agitated, but not yelling, cursing, or even speaking quickly). We made sure he understood we had lost faith with them and would be taking our car to another mechanic and returning if there were any issues. We also asked to be refunded the full price of the maintenance, and to receive a writup of everything that had happened to our car in their care so that we could have the other mechanic check everything that was touched. He kept saying “Hey, I didn’t know anything about this, I’m just trying to find out what happened. I didn’t know you were coming.” And even said “Let me go get the paperwork and see our notes. You’ve been preparing how you were going to attack me with this for days, and I just found out about it. Wait here.” And walked away.

When he returned, no one that worked on our car was in, and they had minimal notes about the incident, so he told us that we could either take our car and leave his dealership, or we could keep the rental car and come back the next day when he had a chance to “her his service manager’s side of the story”.

We go back today. We are exhausted. This took up our full Saturday, all Monday evening, and most of Tuesday evening. We are frustrated, want a refund and want for at least one person in that dealership not to treat us like we’re lying and trying to rob them. When we go back this afternoon- what do we do, what do we ask for, and what is it reasonable to expect?

TLDR- Bad oil leak because of botched maintenance. Horrible customer service. They tried to tell us to drive our smoking car back, then lost it when we tried to pick it up. General manager keeps brushing us off. When we go back this afternoon- what do we do, what do we ask for, and what is it reasonable to expect?",22Feb2017,3
143,"I am 34, GF is 33 soon. We've been together a couple of years during which we had a very early pregnancy scare and a later, unsuccessful pregnancy. So we've been thinking more about the serious stuff in life, having children, buying our own home (we rent at the moment)...

When we've talked about where we'd like to live, I've had a couple of opinions, mainly borne out of what I've experienced living in different parts of the country. I am very conscious that there is a post code lottery in the UK, and depending on where you're born it can affect your life chances and opportunities. So I have voiced the idea before that it would be good to find work in a part of the country where those chances would be better. Having said that, I am happy to work and live anywhere really.

Anyway, my GF is not happy in her current place of work. She has recently found out that some colleagues are earning more than her, and she feels she does a lot of work for very little thanks. Sometimes she seems stressed and upset by things that happen there. Having said that, she likes the money. At the moment she earns slightly more than me, and she has said before she feels like if she left and tried to get another job she would probably have to take a pay cut. 

Last night while talking she took that one further. She said she feels like if she left, she'd be ""starting again"". She said it's ""too late"", and that unless I get a better job she can't really take a step down and start building herself up in another field. I suggested that due to the nature of her work, she has plenty of experience lots of other people have and transferrable skills -- she doesn't agree. She says she feels like she's ""reached her potential"" whereas she says that I haven't.

I disagree. I feel like she could do anything. I feel like I could. It's an important part of my personality to feel that way. I sympathise with her because I've been in a rut with employers before. I worked for 8 years for one employer, while they dangled the carrot of progression in front of me while never really giving me it. I was 28 before I jumped ship and started following my own interests, and I've not really looked back. Every couple of years I've taken new jobs and each has been better than the last. I moved from menial admin type work in to IT, and from there to programming. I'm a SharePoint developer working in .NET for the most part, but do a lot of front-end development. I'm on around £23k at the moment, and there ARE better paid jobs out there, but my current employer and working environment is super supportive. I have formed friendships here, I'm getting a lot of training, and I feel like I'm exactly where I need to be to learn and develop and ensure I get a better job when I'm ready to move on. I have no intention of spending another 8 years here.

Anyway, during this conversation, I just couldn't convince her that she can do whatever she wants. I mean she can, I'd do whatever I can to support her. The conversation ended in a kind of fizzle, and I just felt a bit tired, sad, and stressed out afterwards, like I didn't know what to say or do... then today, while I was at work I got a message to the effect of:

""If you find a well-paid job, somewhere nice you want to live, we can move and I'll just do whatever reasonably paid job I can find. But we need to do it quickly if we're planning on having kids. I can see that you're relied upon quite heavily at work, you could be earning a lot more, but I can also see you're comfortable so you're not moving. It's now or never"".

It's that last line that has me feeling super anxious and under pressure. That's the kind of pressure I don't welcome at all. I understand exactly where it's coming from, I just don't like the time pressure, or the fact that this started as her being unhappy with her OWN job, and now its transformed in to me needing to change mine. I feel as though, even if I get an awesome job, even if I was pulling twice what I'm earning now, if she's not happy with what she's doing day to day - the money isn't going to change that.

I know we're not spring chickens, but with retirement ages lengthening I figure we'll both be working until we're 65-70+. Surely there's plenty of time? 

Has anyone else here had these kind of underlying issues / conversations with their significant other? How did you deal with it?",22Feb2017,1

146,I started working for a company 3 months ago. I was hired as an independent contractor. After my first three days I told my boss I would need to work from home the next day to take care of my sick girlfriend. He told me that I absolutely was not allowed to do that. I did it anyway but he has since made it a rule that none of us can work from home even though it doesn't prevent our work. He has me and the other designers doing work that is integral to the company and has me working on his laptop at the office. I don't have any control over my scheduling. I am getting paid by the hour instead of the project. I have none of the protections employees get and none of the benefits of being a 1099. I called my state (Georgia) labor department to try and ask them about what to do and if there was anywhere I could learn more about being a contractor versus an employee. Instead of helping me she told me my state had no employee protection (Not what I was asking about) and then she refused to give me any more information. I am just trying to make sure that proper taxes are paid and that I am being treated correctly as either a 1099 or an employee. What can I do? Who can I contact?,22Feb2017,1

152,"I remember as a little girl I had frequent nightmares, causing me to wake up with sleep paralysis. My father noticed this as he'd be the one to wake me up in the morning, so he adjusted his sleep schedule to wake up earlier to wake me up, put me back to bed then head off for work- my mom would then get me up for school. This really helped give me a few hours of sleep I couldn't get in the night.

As time went on, dad gave up his side of the bed for many reasons, my nightmares being one of them. Mom would wake me up from my screaming and crying in the middle of the night to comfort me, but I'd still get nightmares almost every night.

The nightmares continued on to my middle school years, causing me to have big purple bags under my eyes- I reached the point of falling asleep in class. Those three years were terrible, but once I reached high school they let up a bit. I had maybe three nightmares a week at that point, and I woke myself up out of them a lot easier than the years before.

By the time I reached senior year I had almost no nightmares or dreams for that matter- I was finally getting sleep! On top of that I moved in with my boyfriend a few months after graduating and I started getting the best sleep of my life. I moved out in December of 2016 due to money problems, so I no longer slept I the same bed as him. This sparked my nightmares again and they've only gotten worse. I actually peed the bed a few weeks back because I couldn't wake up and I was so frightened.

My boyfriend spends the night with me a few days out of the week (two at most) and I've noticed I don't have nightmares when he's sleep beside me, and if I do he comforts me right away to where I don't always have to wake up to calm down.


I've read on the internet to not sleep with the fan on because cold air can generate nightmares, so I've turned mine off. I also think happy thoughts before I nod off. Is there anything else I should try? Should I go see a sleep doctor and see if they can help me?

I can't tell if I am having a life crisis or what but I know I need to make some kind of changes to help my situation, but I cannot figure it out.

As a husband and father to two amazing kids with a high paying job in a field I enjoy, I feel that I should be pretty happy most of the time but lately I am finding myself in spots where I get very sad and cannot pinpoint how to make things better. I want to give as much detail as possible regarding aspects in my life and I really do appreciate any help you can give.

Work: I work from home as an account manager in charge of a few clients. I started out in my company (7 years ago) doing more technical work before being promoted to where I am a few years ago. While I think I enjoy the work, I do feel that working from home is becoming isolating. I love the ability to spend more time with my kids by working from home but it is always nice to communicate with people in person more than I currently do. I find some days where I do not do much, due to the fact that I have nobody looking over my shoulder. My new boss is more demanding than my previous boss and is asking me to take on responsibilities I have not had to do in the past. My job is changing since our company is struggling to maintain clients and this makes me think I should begin looking around for other jobs before I get too much older or the job situation gets worse.

Home Life: I have been with my wife for around 15 years and married for 9 of those. She is amazing and is the perfect wife/mother, in my opinion. Sure, we have become comfortable together just like most couples, but our system works as we raise our two kids. She works part-time so her and the kids are around the house the majority of the week. My son is 4 and my daughter is 16 months. They are typical kids for their age. My son does not seem to be as into sports as I was growing up but I know he is still young. My parents are getting older and the fact that they will only get older scares me like no other. I know eventually they will be gone and I will be all alone in this crazy world.

My Opinion: It seems like I am not being present in my own life and see time flying by as my children grow. Each day/week seems to be the same thing over and over but I keep getting older along with my kids. As I play this out in my head, I can see that before I know it, they will be gone and have their own lives which makes me incredibly sad. I cannot figure out how to change this 'spiral' I have been in lately but I know I need to before it gets too late. I am not worried about myself doing anything drastic but I want to nip this in the bud before I wake up in 10 years and nothing has changed!

What do you think? Any questions that might help give me advice?",22Feb2017,1

The problem, however, is that he has a cat that lives here, too.

So all day, every day, she is walking around making this ""in heat"" noise, and trying to get attention from me and my cat.

161,"I'm currently 20 and in my 3rd year of a 5 year program at one of the best CS schools in the US.  Last semester, I had a lot of trouble with my work.  It came to a point of no return and I had to take medical leave for the rest of the semester.  I blame myself a lot because I really didn't take the initiative and lost a lot of motivation simply because I wasn't interested in the work (it bored me 85% of the time and I just found it extremely tedious).   

My parents were very understanding but I could still see they were still disappointed in me.  I took the next 2 months to work at home and saw a therapist during that time.  We made the decision to go back and try it again next semester (this current semester).  I was very nervous going back but I knew I just needed to stay on top of things.

Well the first couple of weeks went well, however the past 2-3 weeks the harder CS assignments started to fall in I found myself receiving very poor marks even though I really tried my hardest and even scheduled 1-on-1 tutoring sessions with my school. I got really discouraged and it really didn't help that I absolutely fucking hated the assignments.  I found no satisfaction in programming any of the assignments and whenever I looked at end results I was more worried about my coding style and formating then actually thinking ""wow this was interesting to make.

I'm literally about to bawl in front of all my roommates because I just can't stand going back to my parents and family and saying ""I fucked up. AGAIN.""  They already think I slacked a lot last semester, which is true but the truth this semester is that I put a lot of time and effort into my work and when I don't get the results I think I deserve I just say ""this is fucking bull shit, it isn't worth my time because I'm going to fail anyway and I hate every second it"" and I just find ways to take my mind off things.

This week I tried to get back into it and right now the material just looks like fucking hieroglyphics.  I have 2 midterms next week and have no idea just how to even START tackling the studying.  Just looking at notes is overwhelming.  I think I can still pass all of my classes for the semester, but thats only if I bust my ass for the rest of the semester leaving pretty much no breathing room for me.  And thats assuming I get above average marks for the rest of my assignments.  

I'm absolutely horrified to tell my parents (especially my mother who has MS and already has a terrible temper) that I failed Uni once again, but I have no idea how I am going to get through this semester.  I made an appointment with my adviser today and I'm just going to tell her everything about this semester and see what she recommends.

As I was selecting my courses for my first semester it came to the attention of my counselors that I have a large amount of credits.

Because of this my counselors have told me that I do have the ability to graduate around December of  2017 of my senior year. I haven't really made up my mind yet, but course selection for next year isn't too far away and I might have to build my schedule around this aspect if I did want to graduate early. I'm very conflicted though, because my dad recommended that I should complete the whole year because ""you only go to high school once.""

169,I have started experiencing this since 2 weeks ago....and every couple of days. I have IBS frequently but this was never ever a symptom. I would say the location is either right below or at the bottom of my rib cage on the right side. I keep getting this uncomfortable rumbling or gurgling there.

170,"Hey all, so I am planning to go into grad school for biology when I graduate. After I finish the current semester I will have 2 more semesters before I am finished with my undergraduate degree. I'll be graduating with a major in history, and minors in psychology and philosophy. I am making the switch to biology because I feel I will enjoy the work more than being a history professor, which I feel would get repetitive and eventually boring.

So my question is, what do I need to do to make this happen? What classes should I take and Books should I read to catch up? Any other things I should do other than catching up I haven't thought of?

Also, I haven't talked to my advisor yet but what does one do to get into grad school? And when should I start doing that? Any sort of entrance test I need to complete? If so, where do I go about studying for and taking it?

What are things I should be thinking about? Can one get into grad school with a 3.0662 GPA even?",22Feb2017,2

Now I have been told it's a panic attack or aneixty but I have smoked for at least 7 years with zero issues. Also ever since this has started I have also had stomach problems. Went to the doctor no ulcers nothing that could be causing the issue. Except my gallbladder has a 4 mm pylop on it and everyone on my dad's side of family has had their gallbladder removed.

I tried everything to fix the relationship.. i got ourselves a house, car, enough to live nice.. no need to worry about money..

We have been in a relationship since 3 years and a half now but things got weird lately. She isnt herself anymore. She is just annoyed by me. I cant talk properly to her, or do anything. She gets angry at nearly everything I do, even if I do things that nobody would cause anger. All in all, I dont really mind that shes leaving me, although I really love her. We had fights that kinda exploded, and I have scars on my throat and my hands because of her. But I never harmed her. All I wanted was to be a peaceful family.

I dont know what to do. Im depressed, sad.. i still love her.. and I love our son more than everything else. Im getting tears in my eyes when I think of him leaving my side.

184,"For the last 2 years my husband has been getting increasingly delusional. He is very intelligent, and has always been considered a ""genius"" and expected to do ""great things"". Two years ago he failed the qualifying exams for his doctorate program and this completely unhinged him. He began to believe he was being sabotaged, the only explanation for his unexpected failure, and started to see enemies everywhere. ""They"" are after him, watching him, reading his emails, preventing him from succeeding. His friends, family, coworkers, and even I have come under suspicion. He's a mathematician and computer programmer, so in his head it became a sort of game or program that he was ""playing"", but for his life. Recently he started to get more angry, and occasionally suicidal, saying the only way to stop the game was to die. He quit his job and has been getting worse ever since. I'm a stay at home mom of two girls (ages 2 and 4) and I've tried to help him, listen to his fears and not antagonize him while gently trying to get him to seek help, but he FIRMLY believes he is right, that these people are out to get him. And he's smart enough to have a very elaborate delusion that I can't really argue with logically. Things came to a head about a month ago, I forced him to go get help and he was committed, ultimately against his will. He still doesn't want therapy, still doesn't want medication, even though he's been in there for almost a month. He's been ordered to take medication until May 10, but says he will stop as soon as he can. The center where he is has not been communicating with me very much, and I'm finding it very hard to figure out what's going on.

I don't want him to go to this facility (it's much farther away and our visits are the one thing he seems to look forward to) but I'm not sure I have a choice? I want him to come home and build trust again, find a therapist that we can work with to come up with a plan, and hopefully rebuild our life together as a family. But, only if that's what is best for him. Since he was brought in against his will, how much say do we have in this process now? If he can come home, what do I do to help him?

193,"In my first semester of college I dropped out because I was working full time (40 hrs) at a felon rehabilitation facility. I used to enjoy my job because I was paid to simply keep an eye on my clients and interact with them. Compared to my previous job, working in the fields, this job was incredible, I mean I was getting paid to play video games with my guys most days.

Because I dropped out of college my first semester, I decided to take another semester off to set my priorities straight and pay off some bills, and figure out what I wanted to study.

During my 2nd semester off I have begun to resent my job.. These ""chill"" guys I used to enjoy ""hanging out with"" are really manipulative sex offenders and felons. Not only is my job taxing on my emotions, but it is also incredibly stressful. I'm the ""new guy"" at work, although I've worked here for 5 months. Everyone else has been here for 4-5 years. My co-workers like to gossip about the clients (HIPA violations left and right) and chastise me for not knowing every little rule.

Everyday consists of me wondering what my clients are going to try and get away with today, dealing with rude and disrespectful co-workers, then me going home. 

While I'm at my apartment, I just play video games all day.. Ill play for 5-6 hours, then eat dinner and spend the rest of my night with my girlfriend of 3.5 years. I've been using video games as a way to detach myself from a stressful work environment, and to ignore my depression about dropping out of school and not knowing when to go back or what to study. I'm not particularly good at anything, I have been wanting to look into coding but never really done anything beyond basic lessons. 

My life feels so stressful and disorganized.. I don't know what to do about it. I have started working out a bit but it is more of a hassle then stress relief. I want to find a new job but this one pays 9.25, fairly well for my area. I also want to go back to college without feeling like I'm wasting my time on pointless English essays. I obviously want a high paying job but I don't know what I want to study..

Can anyone offer advice on how to de-stress or to ""reset"" my life? I definitely want to try and find a new job, but even if I do I want to go back to school, this time with less than 40 hours a week. What would be some good majors for a high paying job? 

As a side note, I have toyed a bit with the idea of moving out of the US. I have always been able to pick up languages fairly easy, but again I would need a decent job..

194,"Hello Reddit,

I’m a progressive care nurse.  I was fired from my job after nearly 4 years.  I would very much appreciate some practical advice on what to do next, especially from nurses who have been there themselves at one point.  Specifically, I was fired for disimpacting a patient without an order.  The patient’s rectum was bleeding, and he was screaming in pain.  It was shift change, so I knew that waiting for an order would involve telling a screaming, bleeding man to lay down and wait for the next 45+ minutes, but that is honestly neither here nor there, as that is all spilled milk at this point.

I am facing a situation where I was fired for cause, and as this was my first nursing job and I was there for nearly 4 years, I don’t really have a way to leave this job off my resume.  I did call HR and confirm that my status is “not recommended for rehire.”  

I do believe I have a few things that may be assets in this situation.  I am PCCN and CCRN certified.  While having the termination conversation with my manager, I asked her if she would be willing to give me a good reference, and she said that she would.  Our floor would post complements received from patient surveys on the board, and I generally led the floor in complements by about a 5:1 margin over the next most complemented nurse.  I did copy and save quite a few of these complements.  I’ve been in the local paper twice, once in the “Cheers” section of the “Cheers and Jeers” column, and once in a positive letter to the editor.  I do have these articles saved.  I can provide references from other floor nurses, the alternate charge nurse, clinical educator and interim manager, and nursing assistants on the floor.  My actual charge nurse, probably not so much, she wasn’t a fan.  I like to think that I am pretty solid in an interview, although also visibly nervous.

It has been about a month since I was fired, and I honestly have done next to nothing to find a job, I don’t know what to tell prospective interviewers, and I feel paralyzed.  A few major names control most of the hospitals I could work in, and I am afraid of either lying and being caught, or admitting I was fired.  I am afraid that either of these things could kill my employment prospects for life with these companies, especially being marked down as caught in a lie.  I am going to a career fair today, and I’m still not entirely sure what I am going to say.

I guess that is enough wall of text.  Here are the questions I would really appreciate answers to.  What should I say to prospective employers about the circumstances of my firing?  Sure, I could tell them I left voluntarily, but they are going to call my HR and see my non-rehirable status.  Should I claim to still be working there?  I’ve been to one major employer’s application page, and as far as I could tell there was no option to say “I am still working, please do not contact my employer.”  They also had a specific checkbox asking if you had ever been fired.  Should I use my current manager as a reference?  She said she will give a positive reference, but I don’t know what she will say if they ask about the specific circumstances of my leaving.  Leaving off your manager and charge nurse looks pretty bad, though.

I really don’t know what to do.  If I gave a completely honest answer about why I left my job, I can’t see myself getting hired.  If I get caught in a lie though, I may be closing off a major career path.  Please help, if anyone here has successfully navigated a similar situation, I would really appreciate your advice/insight.",22Feb2017,2
195,"Right, so I'll start by saying that i have had a crush since 7th grade when a new girl came into our class, I was extremely shy, unathletic and pretty boring overall so i never actually did talk to her even though she was nice enough to say hello to me occasionally, i ofcourse said hello back.



Fast forward 4 years now, I managed to overcome a bit of my shyness and ended up chatting like once a month on Facebook, our conversations are never that insightful and long, mostly because I'm still shy and awful at talking to girls, I started going to the gym last year and now I'm pretty fit yet I still feel insecure.





Last summer I just said f**k it and asked her out, I got rejected because she apparently was going out-of-town for the summer, now she's back and yet I didn't try to ask her out again as my shyness has taken the best of me, I really don't feel like failing.

I had a choice to make, to go to community college or work with my father and help him grow his business. Since I was an immigrant with a difficult status situation I had to pay out of states fees and my classes were close to 1k for entry classes such as enc1101 and such. After persuasion from my father and school destroying me financially, I decided to just help him with what he needed. First working for a public adjuster to learn the kind of business he was in. I learned quickly and became one of the best ""estimators"" they had. After his relation with them soured they decided to fire me. He started working with another public adjuster, and he asked to do estimates for them to get his through more quickly, I agreed. Same scenario his relationship soured I was fired. After many fights with my family we started our own water mitigation business, which was doing well until recently due to certain partnerships and we dissolved the company. I am now married, I am working uber with a better status in the country, but my internal issue is that I always had a passion for medicine, but I am now 24. I plan to Start fresh from a college, become a paramedic to then go to medical school. I wouldn't even see a hospital until I'm 35-36. Not to mention the debt .

200,"I've been seeing a therapist and doing a lot of introspection on this topic for the past year or so, and I feel like if I can just finally fully believe this then I can have the paradigm shift I need to be happy. 
_____________

**BACKGROUND**: 
Without going into sappy specific stories, I dealt with a pretty neglectful childhood and had parents who were very hard on me so I find that I'm hard on myself. But I feel like this belief of mine comes down to two experiences:

1) I was very athletic as a kid and played a certain sport all through my childhood. As I progressed and got more serious, my parents would often compare me to other girls on the team who were better than me, so I became very competitive and horribly afraid of not being as good as the better players. 

After years of playing this sport, I got cut from the team in high-school but all of my friends made it. **Seeing all of my friends enjoying playing this sport while I wasn't able to join them on the team solidified in my mind that because I wasn't good enough I couldn't have the team/belonging/friendships I wanted.**

2) In college, I began to rock climb. And I still absolutely love it and now my community and friend group is based around climbing. However, because of this mindset of mine, I began to become very insecure about other girls that were better climbers than me. In addition, body image issues began to bother me and this insecurity also extended to girls who were skinnier/prettier/had a nicer butt than me.
 
For almost 3 years I dated another climber in college who was my first love/""soul-mate""/who I thought I would spend my life with. Long story short, after dealing with very real insecurities that I wasn't skinny enough or a good enough climber, he dumped me last year and eventually dated a close friend of ours who was skinnier, hotter, and a better climber than I am, and apparently bragged to our friends about how good of a climber she was. **This again, solidified the idea that because I wasn't a good enough climber and I wasn't skinny enough, I wasn't good enough to be with the person I loved and instead they would always leave me for somebody who is ""better"".** 

_______
There are obviously way more complexities (mainly got cut from the team because of poor grades in HS, and long-distance and normal relationship stuff caused the breakup) and I've come to realize that my ex was very shallow and an all-around asshole, but now I feel so afraid that my flaws will keep me from the connections I want. **I see these things I perceive to be imperfections tied to pretty big life-losses, and am so afraid that not being good enough=pain, loss, exclusion, etc.**

A lot of it is small: I procrastinate pretty badly, sometimes my room gets messy, there are things I could improve about my body, I'm not the most dedicated rock climber, I'm really bad at replying to texts. I've overcome the brunt of my body-issues, learned self-love and self-compassion, dealt with some childhood shit in therapy, and I can see positive things: I am kind, very personable, funny, passionate, and genuinely care for and love the people in my life. **But I'm afraid to be 100% unabashedly myself, flaws and all, because what if nobody will respect me/love me/want to be my friend/invite me on climbing trips when they realize all the things that are ""wrong"" about me?** 
________
**TLDR: Help me finally believe that it's ok that I am pretty bad at remembering replying to texts, have overdue library books, am 5 pounds over my ideal weight, and am never going to be the best climber at the climbing gym. Help me believe that I can chill the fuck out about my imperfections and people will still like me anyway.** ",22Feb2017,1
201,"Backstory: A friend (Kathy) of mine got raped by her boyfriend's (Kevin) best friend (ShitFuck). This occurred when she decided to end their 6 month affair and ShitFuck decided to try to blackmail her into sleeping with him or else he tells Max.. She agreed at first but then backed out and kept telling him to stop, she didn't want it. He didn't stop. She's been diagnosed with PTSD because of it and she's very pulled back emotionally from people. ShitFuck was pretty much rejected by all of us (only a handful knows what happened, Max knows NOTHING). 

Fast forward to now, ShitFuck is back in the picture. Kathy knows not to bring him around the rest of our group (especially me), but has been hanging out with him, her boyfriend a couple of new friends that know nothing about ShitFuck. 

I have been planning a giant group trip to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. My girlfriend (Scarlett) is best friends with Kathy, since high school. Scarlett really wants Kathy to go but Kathy and Kevin won't go unless ShitFuck goes. Our other friends are over it and don't feel bad for Kathy anymore so they don't care (or insist they just won't acknowledge ShitFuck at all).

My issue? Everyone knows how I feel about ShitFuck but I'm the one tearing the groups apart. Kathy and Kevin will go but they are taking their other group of friends (ShitFuck included) and they will bounce back and forth from each group. My girlfriend is upset because she wants everyone together and she knows that I will be on edge the whole time so she's insisting on me just letting it go for their sake. I cannot be around ShitFuck after what he did to Kathy and Kevin. Especially since Kevin still doesn't know anything, ShitFuck is considered his best friend and it tears me up inside.

I don't know what to do...I feel like I'm just going to be a downer for everyone if I'm anywhere near him. And this has been a constant topic of fights between me and Scarlett because, along with Kathy, they have forgiven him for what he's done. I can't.",22Feb2017,4
203,"Some context is obviously need here but essentially I have been working as a contracted hire for five months after graduation at a Pharmaceutical Company as an Analytical Chemist. As my contract lasts only for another month, I decided to politely and courteously inquire about my chances of continuing with the company. To my surprise, my current supervisor told me that I would not be hired on, and, in his humble opinion, he thought it would be best for me to consider alternative career options as analytical chemistry does not 'seem to be your forte'. 

First things first, my supervisor was actually quite polite about the whole thing and his statement was not said with any malice whatsoever. Second, obviously hearing that I am quite poor at my profession sent a bit of a shock to my system. Four years to get a degree and I was essentially told I wasted my time.

204,"As I said I'm 21, and just finishing up my undergrad. I live in one of the most expensive cities in Canada right now (average $1,800/month rent) so in the interest of having any savings at all I plan to move back home. My dad lives back in my hometown (45 mins away), where I have lots of friends, I'm familiar with the surroundings because I grew up there, and I have access to great internet which means I can maintain my favorite hobby. My mom lives in a new town (45 mins in the other direction) with her boyfriend of 2 years in a gorgeous home with tons of land, but I know no one, don't have access to internet enough to sustain my hobby (50gb / month limit), and would basically have to create a new lifestyle for myself. 

My dad has made it clear that he is fine with whatever decision I would make, because he is quite laid back and left home himself at 20. Also worth nothing that my sister has continued living with my dad because she continued highschool in our hometown and it was obviously easiest. My mom on the other hand, although doing her best to stay neutral, clearly would be upset if not hurt if I choose to move in with my dad because she believes if my sister lives there and I live with her that it is 50/50 thus fair and solves my problem. My mom and I are very close, and she was the money maker in my family, and paid for my education so I feel forever in debt to her. She has also taken on a lot of my stress and helped me through the ups and downs of university more than my dad. 

The final complicating factor is work, because I have to request a transfer to either a location closer to my dads, or my moms.

205,"Throwaway because I don't want this on my main. 

So me and this guy started talking about two months ago and a few weeks ago, we both made it pretty clear that we wanted to hook up. (We're not dating.)

We were supposed to be going out and getting a few drinks then going back to his place about three weeks ago, but he ended up saying that his depression was just really bad and can we rearrange. Which i completely understand! I have my own mental health issues too. 

But now that I'm trying to rearrange, it feels like he's just ignoring me completely. I'm jumping to conclusions, I know. But my last actual relationship ended like this so maybe I'm just too full of anxiety. 

I've sent him a few messages over the span of about two weeks to try and get this thing organised, but he's really not playing ball. He's reading the messages and then just not replying. Even when I asked him if we're still going to do this. 

How exactly do I even begin to get this all under control again? Is there even anything I can do? Because I honestly just feel like giving up altogether.

208,"Hi Guys, 

I need some advice. My dear friend (M/24) who I've known for over four years recently got diagnosed with BPD. I met him my first year of college and he was someone I was always able to look up to, he was always down to try new things, hear new perspective and was overall a crazy nut who was down to have a good time. Once he graduated college his manic habits started to come out (going to the gym three times a day/7 days a week, sleeping from 11PM-2AM, not being able to hold a job down, increase activity in social media then disappear, etc). He went on a party boat cruise and completely lost it after that, ripping bong hits at 6AM, downing mimosas with every meal, to going out and getting a buzz lighter tattoo. He ran up his credit card to a ridiculous amount and then came crashing down. He's been pretty low since April 16' by not seeing or talking to anyone, he quit going to the gym, won't look for a job, etc. I haven't heard from him in a while so I called him last week and his mom picked up (weird) and said he just stepped out and he'd call me back. When he did call me back he sounded so sad and helpless, I invited him to my birthday which was the next day and he said he didnt think he was ready to come out. His birthday is this week and I would like to mail him something to show him that there are people out there who care for him and want him to get better. Any suggestions, please and thank you! I appreciate it! ",22Feb2017,2

217,"Hello everyone! Basically, I'm feeling really lost. I went to college out of high school for sociology. Dropped out because it was a combination of parents pressuring me to go to school. I tried again when I was 20 for the same thing, and met a girl. I fell in love, and stopped going to classes to spend time with her like an idiot. I got a job at walmart and lived with my mother.

Fast forward 4 years. I'm still living with my mother. I married the girl, and she left me less than 6 months in. I'm still working at walmart, now as a Customer Service Manager, basically a glorified cashier, making 13 an hour. Except now I have a 300 dollar car payment and 4k in credit card debt.

I don't know what step to take next. I feel like I've wasted the best years of my life. I desperately want to travel. I've done a little bit of travel, to Rome and a few places in the US. I was considering going to school for photography, and attempt travel photography, but I don't know if that's even viable. I have like a blank slate for what I want to do, I just know I want to see as much of the world as I can. Especially interested in Japan. 

I live within commuter distance of Ohio University, so I could possibly go to college there. I was considering something that could get me in the door of management consulting and taking electives in photography so I could travel for work and enjoy taking pictures while I'm there.

Conversely, with my spotted track record, I was considering trying to move far away from middle of nowhere ohio, to really push myself to learn and grow.

What I don't know is... where do I even start? I've done some googling of local counselors but it's much different than checking Yelp for the best burger.

219,"I'll try to keep this as simple as possible (my family is a mess!). Please note that this takes place in the UK, so all questions relate to UK law.

My grandmother's mother (we'll call her Doris) passed away recently. My grandmother was not on good speaking terms with her mother due to a very nasty issue about 14 years back (which isn't relevant to this story). In all, only one of the children was still in contact with their Doris, and it was she who dealt with the death. We'll call her Lizzie.

So to reiterate: Lizzie is the only one who was in regular contact with her mother (Doris) for the last 14 years. One sibling was in a mental institution, two had irregular contact, and the other (my grandmother) had no contact at all.

When Doris died, only Lizzie knew about it. Lizzie is NOT the eldest sibling: she is the third eldest. Lizzie dealt with Doris' will, and arranged her cremation. After Doris was cremated, Lizzie sent out a copy of the will and death certificate to each of the siblings via recorded delivery.

When my grandmother received this package, she then contacted the only crematorium in the victinity and discovered that Doris had already been cremated there the previous day.

My question is: were Lizzie's actions unlawful? Should she have extended condolences and invitation to the funeral to the other siblings? If so, what is to be done about this going forward?

TL;DR: Lizzie cremates her mother and tells her siblings after the fact that her mother is dead. Is this unlawful in the UK?",22Feb2017,1

223,"TL;DR got out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship, still struggling with guilt and depression regarding the break up

I was in a relationship with my ex for almost a year before she broke it off. She ended it through text and then continued to lead me on for about 6 weeks until I had enough. At this point she freaked out and called me the bad guy of the situation for not continuing to sleep with her and ignoring her messages. She was extremely emotionally abusive and on occasion physically abusive. For example, one time I accidentally stepped on her foot and she punched me in the stomach in front of my whole friend group. No one said anything, so I assumed I deserved it. I also thought since I am a man physical abuse doesn't really matter. Even now I still feel like a horrible person for pushing her away. I see her around my campus constantly and I haven't really had any time to move on emotionally because of classes and work. I've been a wreck and I really need advice on how to get out of this hole. I have her blocked on all social media, and I haven't contacted in months. ",22Feb2017,10

231,"So, on December 1st of this year, I was arrested for Operating a Vehicle While Under the Influence of Marijuana. Just last week, I signed a plea agreement for 60 days license suspension, and 1 year of probation. To be honest, I don't think I failed any of the sobriety tests, but they could clearly smell the weed, as I had just finished smoking in my car.

Now I am a person who has been smoking weed daily for 10+ years. My probation officer just has me call in once a month, but they said I ""might"" get called in randomly for a drug screen. If I fail the drug test, I have to serve 56 days in jail (technically 28, because you get 2 for 1).

So I'm posting here to try and get some advice on how to cure the boredom. I've never really felt bored before, marijuana could make almost any activity fun for me. When I was able to smoke, I would read books, play video games, watch movies, etc... Now I just find myself staring at random cable television shows. I haven't had any physical withdrawals from stopping, but I definitely feel the mental withdrawals.

Marijuana has always been a huge anti-depressant for me, because for some reason, my genes will not work with almost all anti-depressants. I know this because my doctor did a gene test on me that showed which medications would work, and which wouldn't.

So, if there is anyone who maybe has been in a similar situation, or has any suggestions, please let me know. I need something that will allow me to pass the time, and get this year over with so I can get my anti-depressant back.",22Feb2017,1
233,"A bit of backstory first, I grew up in South Africa and my family moved to Canada when I was 14. My family is pretty religious which is fine but the values that I was taught along with the completely different culture made it impossible for me to make friends. 


So for the first two years I stayed at that school unable to make any friends, throughout that time I became extremely depressed and the only source of escape for me was my computer and playing video games online. I played A LOT of video games and I didn't feel like doing anything with my family or anyone really. I just made sure to get good grades and then I'll play video games for the rest of the day. 


It was also around this time that I realized that I was bisexual, this took quite a toll on me originally to accept. Eventually my parents caught on to my depression and decided to send me to a small Christian school, this worked out well because I made good friends, however I still played a lot of video games, I feel like it's still in some way keeping me happy but I would more frequently start to have arguments with my parents regarding the amount of time I was on the computer. 


This became a massive source of stress for both of us, and pretty much every argument we had was due to this. In my final year I told my mom I was bisexual to which she responded by telling me to only date girls and it'll all work out. Not quite the response I was hoping for but much better than a lot of other kids get. However keeping that part of me hidden from my parents and friends was also a massive source of depression and stress for me. 


I graduated high school and got accepted into my university of choice but all the friends I made went to different universities so I was going in all alone. The university I chose was highly regarded in its academics but it's also a big party school, which is not something I ever got exposure to growing up so I felt really uncomfortable. I started losing my faith (which is incredibly depressing for me to say the least), I still haven't made any friends really and I started to relapse on my old video gaming habits. So my days basically consist of going to class (maybe) doing assignments and then playing video games for the rest of the day just to keep my mind off everything. I've told my parents that I'm losing my faith which I could tell hurt them a lot and every time I go back home to visit (2 hour train ride) we end up fighting again because I'm not taking enough responsibility for my life. I still need to find a place to live after my first year and I need to get a job over the summer to help pay off my education.


So this is where I am now, unmotivated, depressed, probably addicted to video games, no friends, desperately craving a relationship, my grades are slowly starting to drop and every time I go to visit my parents we end up fighting.

239,"Just to preface, some elements of this fit into the relationships/heartbreak topic but I find that the answers people get over there are primarily focused on emotional reactions, and this is just slightly more complex than people being heartbroken or being confused about the problems in a relationship. 
With that out of the way here is the core of the problem: arguably the closest friend I have at the moment is also the only person in several years I have had a genuine interest in romantically. Now in most cases this would be a simple matter of finding out if she feels that way about me and getting over the emotional backlash that would hit from a negative response, but in this case it gets a little weird. She knows I am very romantically interested in her, as she is quite intelligent and I am a very transparent guy when it comes to people I care about. Add to the mix that she has had several HORRIBLE experiences with past relationships, mostly from the fact that she has bi-polar disorder (not the angsty teen kind, but the, ""I need to take medication and do therapies"" kind) and when those relationships end she falls to dangerously low emotional points. For those reasons alone I cannot resent her at all for avoiding relationships (she has made it clear before she is not interested in that right now) and have taken a pretty laid back approach to my interactions with her. 
Everything was fairly straightforward at first, I am pretty good at controlling my emotional output in logical situations. I helped her make better decisions during some of her manic moods and one of her oldest friends told me, ""I have helped her more than she will probably ever admit"". I have spent much time around her family, and even know her grandparents pretty well from the time they came into town. She got me to decide on going back and trying college again and is one of the only people who can get me to stay up when I know I probably shouldn't. In numerous aspects of my life she has had a dramatic effect beyond that of most people I have known. It was pretty much a guarantee I would become seriously attached to her, and being normal got quite difficult in the past couple of weeks. 
It finally got to a point where I could no longer resist trying to get her to tell me her feelings. Usually she is one of the most straightforward people I know, and smart enough to know how her words and actions affect other people. This time I had to push her to be open with me and all she was willing to do was imply that she doesn't want a relationship and that its not that she doesn't want one in particular with me, just that she doesn't want one period. I was in a bit a of a pushy mood and asked her to tell me if she ever did want one if she could have one with me (The extent of my feelings being that I could wait for her as I really have no interest in anybody else and thus far she has been nothing but a benefit in my life) to which she responded with, ""I can't see it because my feelings for you aren't as strong as yours are for me"". Cue sad music, roll credits. For the first time in years I felt genuinely upset. More than I thought I would be. I spent a day or so away from my phone (plus she was leaving for a trip to Hawaii) so I got to start dealing with the heartbreak process and feel all of those wonderful feelings. Cut to two days ago, and she messages me, "" I don't know why I said those things to you idk"". My brain of course jumps at the foolish idea that maybe she was just upset or something else in the first place but my brain quickly told me that, no I am just reaching in the hope that maybe she could feel how I feel and just not want to say it. She spent some time trying to make sure we could be friends, talking about how close she feels to me and how she doesn't want to lose that. Of course this conflicts with how I should be handling this by avoiding serious contact with her for a while, but I cannot bring myself to stop caring for her romantically or not. 
The next morning she says, ""Idk.... when you talk to me it makes me really happy"". For reference, she NEVER says anything that sappy in regards to her enjoyment. Several other times throughout the day she leaves hints that maybe she really does want to open herself up in that way to me, but never the directness I am accustomed to from her. She comes back into town on Friday and I am for the first time in my life scared of both my instincts AND my logical decisions. My emotions are all over the place as a result of my love for her conflicting with my romantic attraction towards her, and her reactions to me have only kept me in the dark as to what to do. Most of her family, interestingly, are very difficult to read. Her sisters and mother always feel like trying to grab at mist when you try to communicate, and her father and grandparents are just straightforward nice people. In other words I can't really talk to her family. My friends haven't really seen how I have gotten closer to her than I should have and their reactions to my emotional strain was simply, ""just stop talking with her"" or, ""you will get over it"". Both of which are too simple for how complex the problem is for me.

240,"I'm currently a sophomore in high school and it wasn't until recently that I really began to question whether going to college is the right decision for me. I'm a mediocre student; I take all honors and AP classes but my grades are usually somewhere in the B+/A- range. My standardized test scores have always been those of someone you'd expect to have a 4.5 GPA, so I know I'm intelligent, just not a good student. 

My parents both went to an Ivy League college and have expected the same from me. Up until now, I've assumed that this is what I wanted as well, but seeing the cost of tuition I have to wonder if college is worth the price. 

I see people who don't attend college and are doing just fine. I see people who attend less prestigious schools than my parents did and could be considered far more successful. I'm finding it hard to strive for the same future I used to want just because it's expected, while I'm surrounded by people who proved this notion wrong. 

I know I have a few years to make this decision, but I really have no clue how to approach this. Should I pick my grades up and get into a top school? Should I worry more about learning practical skills, like coding? Or should I settle somewhere in the middle and attend a less prestigious school for half the tuition?

243,"Hello everyone and sorry for the huge post, I'm a 23 year old guy aspiring to work in film however I live in Wisconsin where that isn't exactly viable. It's something I'm 100 percent certain I want to do. I've been pretty dumb and irresponsible over the years and have gone back to school and ""taken semesters off"" numerous times. I'm still in a tech school here in Wisconsin and I'm taking classes in a liberal arts transfer program. My overall goal when I joined the program was to transfer to a four-year university and study film since I have almost 0 film experience and I felt that those classes would help me network and learn essential skills.

 However, the more I read up on it the more it seems like a four year school studying film will just put me in crippling debt with no guarantee. Not to mention that I absolutely cannot afford to attend any school with a reputable film program, hell I can't even afford to attend school at a lot of the universities in WI with the in-school tuition.

I'm struggling in school except for the classes relevant to what I want to do (Music in film, creative writing, really any english class). I just feel like I want to be done with school and start working. I know in the end I'm going to have to move to Los Angeles but I'm pretty much broke and I think just quitting school now and working my ass off and saving up would help me be able to up and move to LA and try to figure it out from there, even though I have no experience.

At best I have 2+ more years of school, and then I would hopefully start working in film based on what I learned in school. But it just doesn't seem like that's the most realistic option seeing as I can't afford the schools I want to attend and I probably don't have the grades.

I'm pretty miserable at school but I can't pull the trigger and drop out because I don't want to make a big mistake, hence why I'm here asking for advice.

I mostly put up with it. I will admit I have a problem with overreacting to things which is my achille's heel, I get worked up kinda easily and I am a pretty serious person. At first I could not put up with this at all. He began to start ignoring me, hopping from the channel, making things awkward. After a week, he sorta gave up his stupid act and got over it.

Recently, it happened again, where I was getting annoyed with something going on in the game we were playing and on top of it there were so many things being said by john and another pal. I also just got off a really long shift and was tired in general, making me just not want to put up with it, so I mute my speakers and keep playing because I wanted to focus without distraction. Then john floods me with private messages like hey hey why are you muted hey, and I didn't respond because I was trying to play rather than prolong this. I thought it was rather obvious honestly :P

After a bit I turn my speakers back on, and start talking, even though I know I sound completely done with his shit. The other pal and I then decided to play more afterward, but he faked being afk just to not speak to me, which I know is the beginning of the ""I'm ignoring u!"" phase. So we play a bit, I figure I'd give him time to calm down. I then join the channel he's in on discord and ask if he wants to play and he instantly disconnects. 

Now, I know I have my own bias to this story, and I am aware I kinda became a ragey nerd by getting annoyed at all, but I don't like playing poorly :( . I did try to get over it quickly, and I didn't like try and make him angry or confront him at all because I understand it's all in good fun. 

But now I am being ACTIVELY ignored, as in I join the discord and he doesn't say a word to me even if we play a game together, then another person joins the discord and he instantly talks to them.

Is this my fault? Should I try and fix something about myself? Am I ruining a friendship of 8 yrs over nothing..?

tl;dr A friend of 8 yrs is ignoring me because I got annoyed during a video game and muted my speakers.",22Feb2017,2
252,"New York, New York, USA.

I was classified as a 10-99 Contractor when I started my job about a year and a half ago. I spoke with my boss about reclassifying me at the beginning of this year (2017) as a W-2 employee. He agreed and I am now a W-2 Employee. Going forward, this is good, but I'm uncertain how to speak to my boss about how this effects my taxes for 2016. I plan on filing an SS-8, but am having trouble rustling up the requisite courage to broach the topic before filing the paper work.

I would appreciate any advice on how to move forward. 

Thanks.",22Feb2017,1
254,"Hi Reddit,

I am applying for a very exclusive class/group at my University. I know I am qualified, and have the GPA required. However, as the title states, the application asks a question that reads ""Is there other information that you would like to convey that may impact the admission decision?"" I am not sure how to best answer this question, as the application has already asked about my strengths that could benefit the group, why I want to be a member, and one question that is specific to the group. Any advice for what I could write about would be greatly appreciated, as I would rather not leave the question unanswered. ",22Feb2017,2
257,"I'm a 23 year old girl with a pretty traumatic past, and now I have basically no self esteem and therefore zero confidence in myself. I just need some advice on building self confidence.

I'll just give you a bit of background info:
I've seen a few counsellors and psychiatrists in recent years, I have come to understand and accept what's  happened in my past, So I don't necessarily blame myself for much, it's more like I just can't get away from it. Anything in my day-to-day life can trigger a memory.  
I really dislike myself. I wouldn't be friends with me. 
Apart from all the obvious problems this can cause, the biggest one I have to face right now is having no confidence in myself.
I'm 23, I really don't want to be like this anymore. I'm ready to grow up, I need to be preparing myself for my future, I can't be a scared, timid child lacking confidence anymore. I just don't know how. 


Any advice, anecdotes and/or questions are welcome. Please be serious in your comments. 
Thanks for reading ^.^ ",22Feb2017,3

His depression worsened and he surrounded himself with people who didn't care about him. He stopped paying bills and insurance. His car and one other is totalled. I'm having a really hard time dealing with the aftermath and staying strong.

259,"I'm not gonna go on long story details because I don't want to remminece in my past to feel like even more shit but, I recently broke up with my ex because she had cheated on me but how do i forget about her, so far it has been a month now but it's so hard because most of everything reminds me of her or about her, I just want to forget about the 3.5 years I spent with her and all the things that came with those years but I just want to cry myself to sleep at night because I loved this women and I was goikg to propose to this women.

But now my life just feels like total ass, I work 8 hrs and I'll forget but as soon as I leave work it just fucking hits me, my brain just goes into this mode that I can not get the f**k out off and same with my heart like they are in cohoots with eachother, sometimes I don't want to exist no more but then I think.of my dogs and my dad! (I almost did commit suicide but my friend came and took me to the hospital). 

I have tried going out on a date but it didn't feel right, I just feel an empty void that stops me from being motivated even though I try to be, also I've draken every weekend to try and forget about her since this happened.

Sorry I didn't mean to go on a rant but I have no one to talk to about this. Please someone with similar experience help me.",22Feb2017,2
261,"I bought a handgun about a year ago, the day I bought it I took it to the police department to register it. They confiscated it because of a misdemeanor paraphernalia charge I received when I was 18. I managed to get the gun out before they could destroy it by registering it by my brother, and filed an appeal but was denied. I looked into the law and the statute says a 10 year wait from the date of conviction, which is outrageous. Has this happened to anyone else? If so do you have any advice (aside from not doing drugs [snare,snare, hi-hat]). Is there any way around this statute? Is it unconstitutional say I can't have the gun when I'm not a felon? I do plan on filing another appeal soon.",22Feb2017,2

265,"I love my friend, but I am not a therapist or her secretary. Yes, secretary. It boggles my mind that she cannot do this thing by herself. Problem is she needs help with her laptop that I cannot help her with. She needs to go to Apple. She has anxiety and depression, and has a meltdown. I have been there for her and tried to help her, but being with her for too long leaves me depressed and exhausted. She has called me several times today for help with this. I cannot go over there. How do I say no? I can't say I am working because she knows I'm not. She needs a techie which I am not. She leaves me a voicemail which basically saying she expects me to go over there. Not so much as a ""please"" in there. Do I text her? I can't speak with her and listen to her go off on the phone. I have been doing this for a couple of years and it is getting worse. She needs therapy. I have suggested it. I cannot be her secretary and install anyting on her laptop if I don't have the password. She doesn't have it either. She is freaking out because she has a video chat for an interview. I want to help her, but after the three hour call the day before, I just can't do it. Why am I the only one she contacts? Because everyone else faded away. I feel bad, but I just can't take an hour bus ride to go there and go through it again. I do want to help her, but I am not professionally able to.

267,"So. Hey, Reddit!

1. I was looking through young violinists and I saw Tedi Papavrami play Paganini and OH MY GOD. I was taken aback. I was speechless. Which got me wondering... there's this guy at my school who's obsessed with cars and he's great at identifying, drawing cars and goes to car shows. He's got a passion, and getting hired into a car industry is relatively easy(I think).

He's the one who got me into aircraft. I'm 13. He started liking cars at 2. Every genius started young, under the age of ten. Is it too late to be obsessed with aerospace engineering? I have had an interest in astrophysics since i was young( but not like an obsession) and I am better at writing than most of my peers(I'm trying not to sound stuck up).

I also made it my life goal to end climate change. It is so frightening to see the only Earth we have being wasted away... How can I do this through aeronautic engineering? I want to be known for ending climate change, and I also want to pursue aeronautical engineering. My mother says I need to be in an influential job to do this. Is aeronautical engineering the place?


Thank you!",22Feb2017,4
269,"I have 3 friends who are going on vacation together.   Friends A and B fly free with a specific airline. The 2 who fly free choose the specific vacation based on the fact that they did not have to pay airfare.  Friend C has to pay over $750 extra to cover their plane tickets.  All other costs would be split equally. None of the 3 friends are wealthy. 

My question is how would you feel about this arrangement if you were on the trip?

 Do you think it's fair for everyone to take care of their own airfare costs? Do you believe A and B should equally pay the airfare cost with C? Do you believe they should have picked a trip that was equal in cost for everyone? Do you think C should refuse the trip? Do you think A and B were fair in choosing a trip that was cheaper for them but more expensive for C? Do you think C would be wrong to expect the other 2 to help pay their airfare? 

*edit* I wanted to keep the details vague, but decided to clarify the free flights.  The free flights are because A's parent was a pilot and has A and B listed as dependents so they get free/discounted flight.  It has nothing to do with them earning points to cover the cost. ",22Feb2017,2

276,"I'm a freshman in college and I met a great group of friends in the fall, I love them all to death. One of the 2 girls I'm closest to has always been super touchy and flirty but in a normal friend way. She also has a boyfriend back home but she doesn't see him often because of the drive. But recently (like in the past couple months) I've felt like I might like her. I've had the idea that I'm bisexual before, but I haven't told anyone yet because I want to be sure and it hasn't mattered. I said something the other day about how she makes people question things, and she went straight to joking ""like your sexuality, ha ha ha."" Since then she's made a lot more jokes about it because she's that kind of person. We're really close so we also tell each other a lot about issues with our life/family/friends (and on her side boyfriend/sex life), and she's been exactly what I needed in the past few months when I went through a lot at home. I want the best for her and so I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but she's not really making it easier and I have no idea what to do.",22Feb2017,2
278,"Hi everyone, I'm a senior in college who was recently accepted to two universities. My dream school, University of Minnesota, and a smaller school in Wisconsin named Carroll University. The problem is that I really only applied to Carroll because it's near where my grandmother lives and I'm familiar with the area. It's a nice campus, but not nearly as enticing to me as Minnesota is. I reviewed my financial aid and to my surprise I'm eligible for a 19,000 per year scholarship, and a few thousand in grants (it's a private college), so effectively I would only have to take out 15,000 per year. On the other hand, I would have to take out close to 30,000 a year to go to Minnesota, and would likely graduate with well over 120,000 dollars in debt. 

I know that I have it better than other people and I'm really not trying to complain. It's just sort of disheartening because like I said it's been my dream school and I loved it and the city when I got to visit, but I didn't really think it would be that much. Also, the school is planning on raising out of state tuition about 15 percent over the next 4 years (great timing, right?) I'm honestly just so torn, I want to get out of Illinois, cause people here generally suck, but I don't really want to be in Wisconsin much more. It's like I have to choose between having the ""college experience™"" that I want, or having manageable debt. Just want some advice, thanks in advance.",22Feb2017,2
