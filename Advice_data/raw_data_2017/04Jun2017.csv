0,"I guess this is my last bastion of hope for advice, throwing it all out there onto the internet to see if someone can tell me something to get me out of this pit that keeps getting deeper. Yes, this is a throwaway account--I don't like admitting I have depression, and I don't want it tied back to... me.


I'm 28 years old. I live with my parents. I can't hold down a job--it's not that I'm lazy, don't go to work, don't want to. I keep getting fired. They're all temp jobs that, because I got fired before even a few months, I can't put on a resume. So my resume gap gets bigger. And that's not appealing to employers.

The beginning?

I got an associate's degree in graphic design at a community college. Obviously, no work. So I work at a retail store. Stress and customer harassment get to me. No opportunity for full-time or advancement--I keep getting turned down. Several attempted suicides. A friend talks me into going after my dream of working in animation. There's a big college near him that is good for it. Yea, half the country away, but maybe a new setting and life direction is good for me.

Lots of scholarships, federal loans, all that stuff. I'll be in debt up to my eyeballs, but hey, it'll be worth it, right? Best years of my life, going to that school. I opened up. I came out to my family. I was accepted. I was going to make it, I was going to thrive.

Couldn't get a single internship while at the school, kept getting turned down for other applicants. No worries, that's fine, keep going. Senior year. Can't get accepted just for the interview phase with visiting companies. Too many people want it, not everyone can go... it's okay. I'll be fine. Graduation comes closer. I apply all over the place, with a resume and reel and all that tailored thanks to a required class.

Only dear john rejection letters.
Graduate. Bachelor's in Animation. Move back home.
More applications.
More rejections, if any reply at all. I hate online applications--even calling in to 'be sure they got it' as a way to make them remember you doesn't work.

I can't work on my dream career's skills--I can't afford the programs. The school provided those while there, but not anymore. I thought I'd at least have a part time job, an internship, something by now?

So I apply to regular jobs.

I can't hold onto them.

Why do I get fired? Mistakes. Mistakes I can't fix. Example. Job was to test parts to be in allowable limits before finishing touches and shipments. Month working there, all fine. Some issues, but could be fixed and put into the right limits. Eventually, two are not--they had microscopic cracks. I get blamed.
Rinse repeat. Now I doubt everything I do. I'm afraid of doing things. What if I mess up again? I can't even find where I do mess up when things go wrong.
Not like it matters, the 'work gap' in the resume keeps getting bigger. No one is going to want me. Even less if I put I only worked at jobs for a month or two.

I can't get a job in my field because no one told me I wasn't good enough when I was still in school, that maybe I should stay and work on it more. I maxed out two credit cards just so I could go to school there, not to mention all the student loan debt. They've all come due. I have to borrow money so I can pay my minimums every month.

Some people claim that I can't get the job because I don't live anywhere near the 'hub cities' for the industry. I can't afford to just move. I'd be homeless and starving. I haven't been on my depression medication either, I can't afford it. No insurance.

I don't know what to do.
I'm at my end.
What should I do?",04Jun2017,3
2,"I feel like I might really be overthinking things and it's nothing, but I think there might be something wrong with me.  Specifically I think I have dissociative identity disorder, but it might be something else or nothing at all.

From http://mayoclinic.org :

&gt;Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by ""switching"" to alternate identities. You may feel the presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as though you're possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. People with dissociative identity disorder typically also have dissociative amnesia and often have dissociative fugue.

This basically describes me, except I don't experience the amnesia or fugue and I haven't like named the different personalities I've started to notice or anything, and I feel like I don't have it *that* badly if I do have it.  Also apparently people with DID tend to experience depression (check), anxiety (check), mood swings (check), drug abuse (does weed count?), and sleep disorders (insomnia, check).

I'm a 19 year old guy and I don't want to get into the specifics of what led me to believe I have DID, but I feel like I do have these symptoms.  Also as I just said, I'm 19, and this is right around when I'd start developing the symptoms if I do have it, so maybe with the things I don't experience, it's just too early for that, and these things have been getting worse over the past year.  The thing is I feel like it's entirely possible what I'm experiencing is normal, and I'm just reading too into things.

Should I just go to a psychologist about this?  How do I even bring up that I think I have something like DID?

EDIT: As I said before, I'd rather not get into specifics, but I guess I can be a little more clear.

I feel like my brain is a conference room with completely different people with different desires and different opinions all vying for control.  It feels like one of these personalities is always leading the discussion, but they often change, and sometimes I feel void like none of them are really doing anything.  Each one has different career paths they'd like me to go down, different physical desires, different ways of talking, different favorite subjects, favorite books, favorite movies, favorite TV shows.  Another thing is for a while now I've thought I was bisexual, but as this has developed over the past year I've noticed it's entirely possible I have gay and straight personalities each in control at different times.  I never blackout, but when different ""personalities"", if that is indeed what they are, gain control, I feel like memories gained while a different personality was in control are blurred and like these memories are movies I watched rather than things that occurred in my life.  I also often feel like decisions aren't decisions I would've made.  But I'm always aware that something happened, I never flat out lose memories.

I also feel like my symptoms aren't incredibly strong, like it's not like you see in Fight Club or Switch, but I do feel like I have a watered down version of what's going on there.  Not sure if that means I don't have it or if I just have a more mild case than what's portrayed there.  Also those are movies so not entirely accurate.

I was bullied a lot as a kid, I spent 8th-11th grades with literally 0 friends, no social life, and I was kind of the scapegoat of my family, so that might be the ""trauma"" that triggered it as is often the case with DID, but I don't know if that's bad enough.

Also to be clear, I don't want you guys to diagnose me cause I'm sure doing that over the internet with a bunch of strangers is a bad idea, I just want to know if you think there's enough here that I should talk to a professional about it.

11,"Tl:dr I want to be girl, should I ask my parents if I can start identifying as a girl at school?

So I'm in middle school, and I'm having issues with my gender identity. I am born a man, yet feel like it's too wrong, I know I'm right as a girl. My parents found out about two months ago, they found out about this issue when looking at my phone and finding an LGBT support app. That same day they found out that I'm considering suicide over my gender struggles and body image. so they took me to a therapist to help me with these issues. I've came out to friends, and they're all increasingly supportive. I luckily live in a very safe and liberal area of the country to be LGBT. 
Right now I know I want to be a girl and just want people to call me by that and treat me like that! I just can't deal with being a man anymore
With summer coming around the corner for me, I'd have a good amount of time start. Should I ask my parents if I can start identifying as a women?

But they're things I'm worried about if I start identifying

•""passing""
•people accusing me of being edgy or trendy

19,"I met my boyfriend in 2005, and started dating him in 2008.  We've been together for 9 years.  As time went on he took less interest in talking to me or wanting to go out to do things with me.  This was probably 2012.  I reasoned that most relationship that last a fair amount of time experience this.  No big deal.  But it never got better and as time went by I found myself making all of the important financial decisions such as financing some vehicles, getting a good rental property, taking care of legal matters, taking care of medical stuff for myself, and most of the chores like mowing the lawn and keeping up with laundry and house work. All the while he grinds away at videogames and whatever else compels him to stare at the computer screen constantly.  

At this point I can speak to him but he won't even answer me.  He's not mad at me or anything, he just literally has done so well as tuning ME out that he doesn't realize I'm speaking or needing help with something I can't open or can't reach or whatever.  I have to beg him to do anything more than help take out the trash and help me with the litter boxes (bending can be hard for me).  I file our taxes by myself and if I need to fill out any sort of form it's always me.  

I'm chronically ill.  I have a disease that makes me utterly fatigued and exhausted and I really don't have to do anything to cause it.  Some days are better than others.  

My boyfriend works full time, too.  He works night shifts 4 days a week.  I work swing shift 6 days a week around 97 hours every two weeks.  He went on night shift without asking if I would be okay sleeping alone in a house in the middle of nowhere with a registered sex offender and child molester living next door... for $0.80 more per hour.  Best trade off I could think of...

I'm used to being pushed around and taken advantage of so I never notice how much it happens to me.  Yesterday, I wanted to talk to my boyfriend about buying a house and to look at some pictures of a house I liked.  He didn't want to look at the pictures and he told me I talk too much about the same stuff and he gets tired of hearing me.

Today I decided I will not buy a house with him.  I knew there was something wrong with the idea of buying a house but I never thought it would be this.  I mean, I complained about having too many chores and not enough time and he has started doing a lot more but now I feel like he does it out of resentment or guilt instead of because he wants to.  

He knows he's about to lose me.  He used to never text me and how he's blowing up my phone asking me if I'm okay and whatever.  I told him I'm better off dead since I think I can't make it on my own despite being able to take care of him and myself, pretty much.  I'm just so stupid and dead inside and so full of shame and self loathing I don't even want to put in the work to make myself feel reasonably okay.  The illusion has been spoiled and now my once sweet and loving partner of 9 years is now my embarrassment.  I'm so used to being treated like a dog that just the fact that he could hold a job and not hit me in the face was enough for me.  Now I realize how messed up that is. 

I don't know what to do.  It seems like I'm willing to do the work and he's more than willing to allow me to do it all myself.  The worst part is that he is so inept that when I ask him to do something he messes it up and I have to redo it and usually it takes longer than if I had just done it myself.  What do I do from here?  He acts like he's ready to take over all the work and let me rest now, but how long will that last?  How do you trust someone that let you basically work yourself to death and did nothing about it until they were threatened?

22,"I'm 19 and live at home with my mum and siblings. I used to be obese but in a span of six months I've managed to get down to a healthy weight. 
My mother is very manipulative and loves the feeling of being in control of every aspect of my life. I have never spent a night away from home and have never been allowed to go to a friends house without her. 
If I do something she doesnt approve of she spits on me, hits me with sandals and constantly berates and insults me. I feel trapped at home and I have little self confidence out of home and don't have any close friends. 
My weight loss has been a way of taking back my life and trying to be independent and happy.
She is borderline morbidly obese and gaining weight. She has been desperately trying to get me to stop losing weight by calling me names like skeleton and policing everything I eat even though I'm not skinny. (Bmi of 23). She's insulting my appearance, saying I look like I'm dying and my teeth now look too big. She also insulted my weight when I was larger. 
Today she force fed me food by not letting me sleep and threatening to call the police and kick me out. I have no where to go if she does. She also hit me and spit on me.
She is totally convinced I have an eating disorder and that I am anorexic because I choose not to eat the huge helpings of food I used to. She is constantly staring disgustedly at my body everytime she sees me and keeps saying that I'm dying. She thinks I will collapse and die. She is genuinely concerned for my health but I know she shouldn't be.
I have no where to go so I can't just leave home. I find it difficult to talk to people and theres nobody I'm close enough to talk to. I feel depressed all the time and like I'm not in control of my life, and that there's no point in even trying to regain control. I feel and look disgusting and I don't want to end up anything like her, but she won't let me leave the house until I get married.

25,"Hi so I have several problems with my roommate but I’ll just ask for help on 1 We’re both 20 and this is my first apartment! We lived together in a R.V for about 7 month prior. A R.V has a different set of things going on but I feel like we should be better living in an apartment. Also, note that. I am VERY conflicts-averse. It gives me huge anxiety. Not that I don’t get into conflicts, but very very big ones that affect me and others in big ways gives me panic attacks.


We got the apartment through an organization that helps with rent and such. Even though we both live there we are on 2 separate leases. My rent and lease is separate from hers, and hers is separate from mine. Guests are only suppose to stay for 3 days. That’s the rules. I have a one year lease so I can’t just move. 

My roommate, who we’ll just call Kate, is  vegan, bisexual, and polyamorous. She is selfish and a narcissist. Things have to revolve around her. 

Okay, the first big thing is the ever present roommate. This one gives me the most anxiety because it’s directly affecting someone's life in a big way. Kate told somebody, Chris, that he could stay because Chris was in danger of being homeless. I told her I didn’t want him there and didn’t feel safe with him there. I already knew him from being in the R.V and he’s told Kate he hated me. He used to live in storage container next to the R.V. Kate tells me he’ll only be here for 3 days out of the week for a month, thereby not violating the lease. I protested but she brought him in anyways. He turned out to be a better roommate than her.

She didn’t even keep her promise. He’s been here for over a month for 7 days a week, a direct violation of the lease. I can’t bare to throw someone out on the street and he’s nicer but yeah. We could lose our housing. My mother told me I should report it and I’ll go down with her but i have feelings against that. If I try to talk to Kate, she’ll make excuses and issue another “well by this date” that’ll never come. If I get the case manager involved I’ll feel dirty and risk the wrath of Kate. I’ve been putting this off because it gives me huge anxiety so help would be appreciated in this manner.

Again she has a very strong personality but these are important issues so I can’t kowtow to her. 
Thanks for reading!

I then politely texted Mike asking where the game was and he did not respond for hours. Then, I texted him with a more authoritative tone by saying if he does not respond by 3:00pm tomorrow I will get his parents involved.

55,"Hi all,
I'm new to reddit but I see you guys give really good advice.  I've been having a lot of difficulty figuring out what I want to do after I finish college.  It may seem silly stressing about this, since I just finished my first year, but I'd just like some peace of mind and a plan.  Right now I have three plans, but each of them has weaknesses and strengths.  What I want out of my career is a) something science-related preferably. b)reasonable salary, doesn't have to be high at all, as long as I have some extra cash and money to save up, and c) not too many hours, 50 at most preferably.  I'm wondering if there is a possibility that I might be able to get all three with a biochemistry degree.  I'm very determined and do very well in school, but have no idea what I'm going to do when I leave.  I'd appreciate any advice you guys have to offer!

Plan 1: Medical school
This plan is good because it guarantees that I'll make a good living when I finish.  The downside is that I'd also like to have a life outside of work.  I've heard workweeks are usually 60-80 hours, which is too much for me to be happy with, no matter what the salary is.  I wouldn't mind doing this for five years after residency, but is there a way to work 40 hours after that? I'd love to just be working in family medicine even if it's for a lower salary.  It seems less stressful but also rewarding as I can build relationships with patients.  I always planned to go to medical school, but the perceived stress has weakened my enthusiasm.

Plan 2: PhD
This I feel is a huge risk, but if it is successful it might pay off.  Working as a professor is the most desirable for me, but I'm afraid that I won't make as much money as I'd like, or even worse I might be denied tenure.  How stressful is it to be tenure-track?I think I might become a PhD student if there is something I'd really like to research.

Plan 3: Find a job out of college/master's degree
This one I like because the hours are typically fixed and manageable.  However, I have read that biochemistry majors often have to find jobs outside of their field because of competition.  It's foolish to make assumptions, but if I apply myself I think I can achieve a 3.9 GPA by graduation at a prestigious school with lots of research conducted/shadowing.  Would that make me competitive, or will I always be outdone by people with master's degrees? And if I can't find any good jobs, I could also try medical school or a PhD program.

So these are the main plans, but if you guys think there's something else I should take into consideration or if I missed any important details, please tell me! And thank you! I'm probably stressing out over nothing.",04Jun2017,1

57,"I will begin this post with the admittance that for the past decade I have been lost. Lost in alcoholism, drug addiction and self loathing. I fell into the wrong crowd would be nothing more than excuse as I know I did it to myself. I am here posting this today on the one year anniversary of my recovery to ask whoever may be reading this for guidance on becoming who I want to be.

For 10 years I drank, smoked, and snorted each day away in an attempt to do nothing more than occupy my time. I can't say that I was running away from trauma. I can't say that I was self medicating a mental disorder. I cant say that I was trying to fit in. All that I can say is that I was never challenged in life. I was taken care of. I was healthy. I was bored.

Fortunately for me, I never hit rock bottom in the sense that I blew my means to survive or wound up with any serious health concerns. I was born well to do and knew nothing of the tribulations faced by those less fortunate. I woke up one day, looked in the mirror, and realized that the man I saw was not who I wanted to see.

My goal in life, as young as my freshman year of high school, was to be a volunteer doctor. I wanted to be a doctor that traveled the world and delivered medical necessities to citizens of impoverished nations. I never planned to make a dime, I knew I would never need it. People in the world needed help, I knew that I could provide it. 

I failed them.

It is in my highest hopes that I, a man who graduated high school and nothing more, could in some way, as insignificant as it may be be a volunteer for an organization that does for humanity what I had always hoped to do. I ask only for recommendations on where to start my search and necessary education.

I ask only for guidance.

Please, if you have any suggestion at all, reply.

58,"So, basically. I have issues with learning, and issues with not giving up on projects I've started, or things I want to learn.

I have a really bad history with this, the most I usually keep up on projects, or learning things such as guitar, is about 2 weeks to a month, some things I give up a day or two after I decide to try them.

It really gets to me. I don't really have any talents, nothing I am very proud of doing, and I just don't have the motivation or love, or enjoyment, or whatever, to learn skills that might be helpful for me.

The few things I haven't given up on are league of legends (which I suck at) or, that's pretty much it. The only reason I haven't given up on it is because I actually enjoy playing even though I'm bad at it.

If I don't have a natural love or talent in the things I try, I give up.

Take for example guitar; I wanted to learn guitar to finally learn a skill and maybe have some interesting aspect to me. I learned a few chords, a riff or two, and got disinterest. I wasn't fun for me, and it was discouraging to see other people play it so well when I struggled to keep my fingers in the correct positions. I know skills take months, years or even decades to develop, but I don't want to spend months or years of my life on something I'll view as a chore to do/ practice.

It's effecting me really badly now as I'm trying to learn how to drive, and both a fear and lack of skill has pushed me from consistently trying to practice. I NEED to learn how to drive, but I don't even know if I'll get the practice I need before my permit expires (as reference, I only have 10 hours under my belt 7 months into me having it).

It's very difficult for me to learn anywhere past mediocre

69,"I really thank you guys/gals for reading this!

I'm 33, not married and don't have any children.  I work in IT, and I love it.  It's definitely the career for me, there are a ton of different facets of information technology, and I could spend the rest of my life in classrooms learning everything.  

I'm at a bit of a crossroads, though.  I recognize that I need to push my education further, which is where I would like some advice.  I went to a vocational college, graduated on the Dean's list, and have my A+ certification, which is basically a certification that at least gets you interviews.  It's entry level, and to be honest I've gotten a lot of mileage out of a simple certification.  Getting certifications are great, they aren't super expensive, they get you interviews and you're recognizable because of your certs.  

I'm fortunate enough to live in NY, and our Governor signed a bill that allows anyone that has lived in NY for more than a year to get a Bachelors tuition-free as long as you go to either SUNY or CUNY, and you work and pay taxes in NY for four years after.  I sincerely have zero plans on leaving NY.  It's expensive as FUCK to live here, yes, but upstate NY is amazing and the career I've chosen allows me to work remotely if need be.  

The reason why I'm asking for advice is because I may be disillusioned by the idea that going to college for four years is still a better option, because it's ""traditionally what you do"".  I am diagnosed with GAD, OCD and Depression, I take medication and have gone through CBT, to a point where my therapist happily said she doesn't feel I need therapy anymore, and frankly I agree.  I mention this because if you or anyone you know has mental health issues, you may be aware how easier it is for us to become exhausted and mentally drained.  If I go to college, it would have to be full time in order to qualify for the program, and I would absolutely have to have a part time job to support myself.

I could see myself burning out if I went the latter route, college and working part time.  

I guess what I'm asking is, is it worth it?  I really feel like if I just put in the effort, the four years would really pay off, but at what cost?  I'll be at least 37 by the time I'm finished.  Would I be draining my battery too much? ",04Jun2017,1

71,"So every since I was young I was raised as a Christian and taught that God was real. My entire life I believed in an afterlife and that there was a heaven.  

Fast forward 20 years and I'm a biology major.. After learning about evolution, the immense scale of the universe, etc. I finally realized God doesn't exist. I always suspected it in the back of my mind as I was growing up but after obtaining more knowledge about biology and science, I put two and two together... That God simply can not exist and that there are so many contradictions in the bible and that there are so many inconsistencies. Now realizing there's no after life and the meaningless of existence my entire view of the world has been shattered. Now I feel lost and confused. Kinda bummed that there isn't anything after death and kinda depressing I was really banking on going to heaven ( this sounds incredibly dumb but that's what I believed in for 99% of my life).

72,"So I just had a talk with my boyfriend about a friend of mine. I was with her and a couple of friends at a party and she was either tipsy or drunk. I wasn't drinking at all only because I was driving, and I was enjoying having a conversation with a really nice old lady who owns the house we were at. 

My boyfriend and her met once one time at a party that I invited her to. Nothing bad happened, they spoke a lot and seemed to enjoy it. I didn't mind at all. I actually like it when my friends and him get along! It's nice to see and I'm also cool with his friends :) 

That was the only time they ever spoke and this was since Halloween. Although in the back of my mind, I feel like they would make a cute couple if I never existed... whatever lol, the things I think about xD 

ANYWAY... so she was drunk and she kept telling me that she really likes my boyfriend, and that he's awesome and would want to hang out again someday. It wasn't even that, she just kept repeating his praise and how much I picked the right apple from the tree. She was drunk I know. I thought it was funny and I shared it with my boyfriend. 

I actually like it when girls like him and think he's sexy and such, it just makes me feel like ""yeah he picked me and yeah he IS sexy"". So I was discussing this with him and he told me that the only time that he would hang out with her alone is if he wants to hookup... took me back for sec and then he added that she's my friend, not his, and he wouldn't hang out with her alone without telling me. And  that he wouldn't hang out with her without me regardless. 

But idk.. that comment kinda makes me feel ... confused. I mean what is he trying to say? That he can't be alone with girls unless he wants to hook up with them? I mean not the obvious such as: going to their house alone, or doing bf/gf things together (movies, carnivals, beach, stuff), but idk..

79,"first time poster so might be misformatted. skip down to the TL;DR for the real question, because the first few are background.

let me give some background. there's this kid who we'll call x who i used to think was my friend. he and i used to hang out quite a bit earlier this year and last year. however, things changed very recently.

there are so many reasons that prompted change for this pettiness. this kid, x, likes to cause a LOT of drama and emotional turmoil. for example, there is this girl in our class who we'll call y. she's a very nice girl and has no reason for anybody to dislike her. however, x and his group, especially a kid who we'll call z, like to make jokes about her makeup. z even did a dare where, if he lost, he would have to (god forbid) say that he liked y on x's snapchat story. also, x pretended to ask her on a date just to embarrass her later on. the list goes on and on, and this has gone on the whole year.

eventually, i got fed up with this, and i decided to do some snooping. a few months ago, x asked me to keep his streaks so i know his log in information for snapchat. i decided to read some of his conversations to get some dirt in case i needed it. (i know i know moral boundaries et cetera). anyways, i found out that he did this sort of thing at many other schools he went to, and there are loads of people whom he has called wh*re, h*e, b*tch, etc for petty reasons such as breaking up with him, spreading rumors, and gossiping. 

deeper down, i discovered something worse. x, who i still thought liked me, had been spreading rumors about me to everybody i knew. this included almost any possible rumor that could ruin my reputation such as me talking about people behind their back or talking up their girlfriends. the real rumors are not important, but their impact on my social life started to make sense. i realized why my close friends started feeling distant and why nobody hung out with me anymore.

TL;DR the real question i have for the redditors is how to best get petty revenge on x. although y isn't my close friend, she did nothing to deserve this. also, z would be collateral damage in this takedown because he is a social leech on x. please help me figure out how to do this subtly but effectively on his snapchat account, which is basically his life.",04Jun2017,3

84,"I am a few months into my first role where I am leading a small team of six people.  When I first heard out that I had gotten the job I was very excited and did lots of study about managerial theory and leadership.  I was really keen that I would be the best manager I could be, as I have never felt that any managers I have had in the past have really attempted in any way to go 'above and beyond'.


On starting, I spent time getting to know each employee individually, sitting with them and understanding their work (I was completely new to the area).  I also bought them access to a 'pay-for' self-assessment test (MBTI-like) so that I could learn more about their preferred working styles and strengths.


I thought everything was going quite well, and I was being careful to try and do all the things that previous managers had never done for me (schedule regular catch-up meetings, ask them how they like to receive feedback, check in with them to make sure their work-load is acceptable etc).


However, I am meeting a lot of resistance.  This team has never been 'managed' before and they are used to sorting everything out amongst themselves.  They see my coming in and asking them to do these tasks as taking them away from their day-to-day work, and all they want to do is come in in a morning, get on with those jobs and go home.


It doesn't help that the organisation itself doesn't appear to have any formalised performance measures as a whole (no appraisals! no departmental objectives!) which again I am trying to institute on at least my team's level.


Anyway, concerning my team's attitude, this is obviously quite demoralising to me, especially as I feel that I am trying to give them a top-flight managerial service and they are rejecting it.  It is made worse by the fact that I am unable to do the job that they do (i.e. get some coalface experience) due to not yet having the necessary courses etc to be able to access the required systems that they use.


Could someone please reassure me that I am not going crazy and trying to impose unnecessary things on them?  It's my opinion that I'm doing everything as by the book as I can, and as a bare minimum 99% of people in work need to have goals, objectives and some sort of personal development plan.


TLDR: I am trying to 'manage' my team by instituting what (to me) are pretty standard things to have in a workplace (i.e. catch-up sessions, setting objectives, learning about them as individuals).  However, my employees see these as unnecessary distractions from their day job.  Am I going crazy trying to implement these?",04Jun2017,2
85,"I really don't know what to do about anymore about my roommate. She moved in with me about a month ago in place of my old roommate, who was an angel. I was really hesitant to let this girl move in from the start, since I know her history. She crashed at my house before and was a constant mess, drunk all the time, and getting hospitalized and even arrested. However, she was going through an awful breakup with a psychotic boyfriend, and I felt compelled to help her anyway I could. I still do. So, now she is my roommate. Sadly, I think I am just now realizing how serious her drinking problems are. She has no problem paying me for rent, but doesn't have a job. Her ex no longer supports her, and her parents want almost nothing to do with her so I wonder where the money is coming from, but am too afraid to ask. 
I can deal with a messy roommate, but this girl is out of control. I have caught her at 3 am cooking drunk and butt naked on more than one occasion (we live in a neighborhood, with children). As funny as that might sound to some, I'm absolutely mortified and embarrassed that someone has witnessed this. I've lived in the same neighborhood for years with no problems, and want to keep it that way. If my landlord only knew... oh boy. Worst of all, she is incredibly loud, slamming things and stomping around at all hours of the day AND night. I feel so so sorry for my neighbors (who I know must hear this commotion too) even if they haven't said anything yet. In her drunken stupor I hear dishes clattering to the ground, amongst other things and it makes me cringe, and really angry. I think she must drink every day but I'm not home enough to know for certain. I left to visit family a week ago, and came home to every container of my alcohol empty, which was a bottle of vodka, a handful of beers, some airplane bottles, and even some of the cooking wine. I did say something to her but I think this showed me the depth of her problem. She has left the front door unlocked and even wide open on some occasions. I sincerely worry I may come home to find the house burned to the ground some night. (She smokes too, but thankfully not inside the house.)

Personally, my friends think I'm insane to be living with her or be her friend since she has such a terrible reputation. They always tell me they see her black out wasted at some bar or restaurant etc. 
I really want to help her, but I think she is unable to be helped. When I ask her about the drinking, she claims it is because of her depression. I know she hasn't had the easiest life but neither have I so I find this a poor validation for her drinking. I no longer want to help someone who wont change their ways. I DEFINITELY don't want to live her any longer. 

So how do I tell her to either clean her act up or get out? I don't want to abandon her completely like it seems everyone else in her life has, but years into our friendship she hasn't changed or even really made a sincere effort to improve. I really don't want to give up on her. But at some point I feel it will come down to my own wellbeing or hers.
 If there are any recovering alcoholics out there, is there anyone or anything that someone did or said which helped?

86,"Hello! i don't know if this matters enough for people actually respond to this but here we go

First, context. I'm a 17-year old teenagers. Male. I'm currently attending high school, 11th grade. Love to play video games, watch movies, browse reddit once in a while, interested in science even tough im not that smart. All and all I'm just a typical teenagers.

Just like i said in the title, I've got this crush on this girl from my class. She's really nice, attractive, smart, polite. And i would like to approach her and maybe ask her out.

The thing is, I'm very shy and insecure, especially when dealing with stuff like this. Honestly, I'm not very attractive, my face is if not below, average. I'm not very fit either, weighed around 85 kg which is large for people of my age. And I'm really not the best guy to talked to, mostly because i can't keep a conversation without me mumbling or running out of things to say. I don't have any particular talent to speak of, or any really, and often get bullied or picked off mostly verbally by my classmates. While i can handle it, it's one of the reason why I'm insecure about myself.

● Where me and her currently standing, we're friends, if not good friends. We often chat, even if most of the times about school materials or assigments. Everyday she would greet me and i would greet her back. But since i like her, i can't bring myself to talked to her directly for a long period of time without me being a pussy. And I've got this feeling that maybe she trying to getting away from me, which is really distance us as a friend.

So, what should i do about this? How do i approach her? Is there any way for me to increase my social skill? And should i even tell her about my feelings for her?
That's all, can't wait for your responses. I know I'm just a teenager and I shouldn't think about it too hard, but hey, you gotta start somewhere no?

I had a boyfriend that lives in different country, and I can say that LDR is not really our thing and I'm getting fed up of him not being understanding with my depression and anxieties. I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Type 2, and sometimes think I need somebody who would listen without judging myself a 'drama queen' and 'looking for attention' or even 'making things up', something that my boyfriend would've done all the times, because I think that's a horrible thing to do to someone with clinical depression. 

With him, I feel safe. He is mature, kind and smart. But the end of semester is around the corner and I may/may not see him again. He is a lot older and I think he's looking for a girlfriend at the moment. I don't know why but for the past weeks I have been thinking about him.

My friend's father just died yesterday because of a lightning strike.

He's currently enrolled in a K12 Basic Educ. System under a TVL track here in PH and tomorrow as of June 5 is the official start of our Grade 12.

He's... Currently leading his father's necessary papers and other essential stuff for the funeral and burial. As the resident eldest male in the family, of course its to be expected... But I'm currently worried that he's gonna stop his education. I mean, its understandable because of his situation; he's now the only one left as the ""father"" figure of the family, but what I want to point out is that there's only 1 year left of our Senior High and if he's gonna stop right now, he might never be able to graduate... Plus, he's a really good friend of mine who brought color to my SHS life and I kinda look up to him and all.

His decision on whether to drop-out or not will be based on the agreements and talks between him and his father's employer... If it turns out good, he'll continue but if not he's probably gonna work somewhere faraway. So, yeah... What I wanna say is that I really need some advice for him and for us; his friends on what to do and also some prayers to help his situation to turn around for the better.

* He tends to go out at night, come home late and most of the times, sleep over at his friends', giving me obviously lame excuses like ""It's raining I can't go home"" when it's...not raining, or ""I'm doing a group project"" for the third time this week, especially when it's 11PM.

* He brings guy friends to sleep over without even asking me.

* He spends too much of his weekly money too quickly that he runs out before he should, then asks me for more money for food.

* On weekends, he takes his motorbike and goes everywhere, all day all night, nowhere to be found.

95,"First time posting here, I think I should give a little background. About a month ago I finished up my first year away at college at my first choice school on a full ride scholarship. The thing is after probably the first month there, it turned out to be one of longest years of my life so far. I spent the entire year dealing, from a distance, with the same family and financial bullshit I was dealing with all through high school. I thought things would get better with one less person in the house but every week I was getting phone calls because there was something new that needed to be paid for or someone needed help and I was too far away and broke to do anything about it. Ended up blowing through my refunds both semesters in a couple days trying to pay random bills for my mom. Things kept getting drastically worse and that weighed heavily on me even though she kept telling me not to worry. I couldn't help it. On top of that, I was kept down by what I'm assuming is a deep depression. Tbh I'm a little apprehensive to call it that because it kind of gets thrown around a lot and I don't want to take away from anyone actually going through it. But it's like for the past 3 or 4 years I've cycled through these same moments from my childhood that I wish I could just forget. I can't sleep with these thoughts unless i smoke weed which knocks me right out. Otherwise these moments come to me and I get intensely angry and then I get sad because I can't help but think about how different things could have been for my family. How different of a person I could be right now. Like I said I've felt this way for years but for some reason when I got to school it over took me. I quit the sport that I specifically when to school for within a week. I gradually stopped going to classes till I was going to maybe 1 or 2 a week out of 7. Instead I would either lay in bed all day or stare at my laptop because it's not socially acceptable to lay in bed all day. Didn't eat. Didn't work. My roommate probably hated me because I didn't leave the room. I was just stuck. 

Anyway a few hours ago I got an email saying that since I failed 2/3 of the classes I was enrolled in I lost all scolarships, grants and financial aid. The thing is I knew this was coming several months ago while in school and didn't care. I stopped caring about a lot of things and that by itself was scaring me but I couldn't do anything about it. I just didn't see a point to anything at the time. Well I think I'm finally seeing the repercussions of my actions. Where I am it's 6am and i haven't been able to sleep yet because I see how I fucked up now and don't know what to do next. I know i could just do what everyone else does and get a loan but the thought of being in that much debt is stressing me out already. I really don't think I'm in the right mindset to be in school right now, which sucks because academics was the only thing I was ever good at and the thing anyone that knows me expects me to excel at, but ive failed massively. I've been thinking of getting a job and just staying home this next semester to think some things over but I don't know. One issue with that is my mom doesn't know any of this. She thinks I'm content as can be and when she brings up school and my scholarship I just say yeah and roll with it.

Didn't expect for this to be this long, but any advice on what I should plan to do over the next few months would be greatly appreciated.",04Jun2017,3
96,"To pills. 

This time it's different though, she was clean for two years. And in the span of the one month that she left the halfway house and got a car she has managed to wreck said car, on the verge of losing her job, ( I work with her) and her mother is about to kick her out of the house. 

Backstory: I recently moved back home from Colorado this past March and I have talked with her off and on the past couple of years that she was in jail/rehab/halfway house over the course of time so when I moved back we met up and she was my old friend again. I was absolutely overjoyed to see her back to her old self! I finally had my best friend back.

She had worked her way up with a new company and had her own car and a place. She was doing great! I was job searching with my move so she offered me a position and about 3 weeks ago I started at the company with her as my boss. Things were going great! For about a week and then she started coming in late and falling asleep and disappearing for hours at a time. Employees started asking questions about what's going on with her and that I need to talk to her. She was obviously high. I tried talking to her.. she was defensive and starting fights with everyone. I backed off and hoped she would come to grips. Thursday at work she was falling asleep outside at the pick nick table on break and I woke her up and said I thought it was best if I drive her home. She refused. She totaled her car that night and got a dui. 

What really makes me mad is she has a 10 year old son and he just got his mom back, now she's gone again. She doesn't seem to care and it's breaking my fucking heart! I drove her to the hospital tonight and wound up leaving her there because she was too messed up to even know who I was. I called her mom to come get her. 

Now, this bothers me so much because usually when she starts back on pills I can simply fade away until she either goes to jail or rehab but this time I'm on the frontline and I don't deal well with these kinds of things. I'm simple, work, home, life blah blah... now since I'm basically all she has, how do I help her? She's stressing me out to the point where I'm thinking maybe I should look for another job. She has been a LOT of drama at work for me! I just don't handle dramatic situations like these well and I'm grasping at straws just to figure out my next move. I'll be driving her back and forth to work now as well. I really feel like I stepped in a huge pile of unwanted shit. 

Sorry if this isn't formatted so well. I'm on mobile and haven't had any sleep.. I have a pic of her car that she crashed that I want to attach but I'm not sure how? ",04Jun2017,2
97,"My husband, myself, our 2.5 year old, and our 2 week old are going on a trip to Montreal and Toronto in mid-July. Our point of origin is Halifax, Nova Scotia. Our youngest will be just about 2 months old and will not me immunized yet. He is breast/formula fed combo. 

I am worried about him catching a disease on our trip. The trip cannot be scheduled for later in the year due to work commitments.

We are planning on taking the train at least one way. It is about 22-25 hours long. We are trying to decide if we should take a plane or a train for the other way.

A plane is much faster but I'm worried about the younger one catching something like measles or whooping cough on the plane.

We can control the environment of a train ride better because we would have our own cabin and bathroom. But it would be very long for our 2.5 year old in such a small space. He would be fine once because of the novelty, but twice might be hard on him.

So a few days back I made the decision to leave home with £25 in my pocket and a train ticket to my girlfriends place. I couldn't stand been around my mom for much longer, especially since she has increasingly become more violent as of late. 

The issue is now, I don't know what to do with myself. I finished my exams a few days back, I was considering going to college again in September so I can get into a policing course. However the problem is, I will have no income and no place to stay, therefore this is not an option anymore. 

I do not want to return home. (Nor am I welcome.) I have barely any money left and my girlfriends parents don't exactly appreciate me living at their place so I'm essentially stuck for options. 

If I sign up for benefits my mom will stop getting help with the rent and will subsequently go homeless, on top of this, the government will not fund my college next year so I'd be essentially stepping into the world with the qualifications I have. 

My friend works at a night club and has said that it is a possibility I can get a job there, however it's not a certain thing, plus the wage from this will not be enough to pay rent.

110,"So, my boyfriend has recently started playing SL and our relationship seems to have taken a turn for the worse ever since. For example, he will never spend a whole day with me without nagging to game. It's like the game is always in the back of his mind and I can tell that because of this he isn't really enjoying our time together as much. He'll spend one day with me, shuts down every suggestion I make so we just end up watching netflix again - then the next day he will insist he's playing games for the entire day and justifies it by telling me ""I spent the entire day with you yesterday!"", this happens every single time I see him - he will not spend 2 or more consecutive days with me. 

He refers to the people on the game as his family and he's even made a separate facebook account just to add his ""family"" as friends. He'll receive a message and I'll ask who it was and he says ""just my mum""...as in his SL mum? To me that is pretty odd. He's also added one of the girls on snapchat and regularly snaps her - she has a husband and child in real life btw.

Every time l try to speak to him about how he gets irate and says that he just likes to game. Which I'm well aware of and his gaming has never come between us as badly as it has since he got into SL. But half the time he isn't even playing the game, he's sat there messaging in the chat box - usually speaking to the girls behind the keyboard of the half naked avatars he's seeing. 

I can't relate to him in anyway and I cannot fathom why he happily chooses talking to these people he doesn't know over spending time with his girlfriend. It's making me extremely insecure and frankly making me feel like crap. I've actually cried to him a few times and he sympathises at the time and tells me not to worry and that he loves me but then makes no effort to spend quality time with me. I sit there bored whilst he spends hours and hours on the computer ignoring me.

The time we do spend together, he makes me really happy and I'm still as in love as I have always been - I fear that he doesn't feel as strongly as I do. I'm always excited to see him whereas I'll ask him if I can come over and he'll say no because he wants to game! I would be over the moon if he asked me if he could come over to see me, I would never refuse him. 

Am I overreacting or is anybody else in a similar situation?

117,"We live in an apartment complex and I used to see a cat in the neighbors window (we live on a corner). Now that same cat just lives outside right next to our windows and roams and pees and poops in the mulch nearby. One of the other neighbors has put out a water dish and food dish for it. Neighbors have reported it to the apartment complex several times, but I'm assuming nobody has responded. The cat is very nervous, but sweet once he trusts you. His fur is getting a bit matted and his meow sounds sickly. But otherwise, he seems fine. I can't tell if he's old or just ... bitter that his owners threw him outside to live forever. 

My question is... do I just leave it alone? Do I tell the complex I know who threw him out?

I'm worried that he might have a better life just living outside here, than going to a shelter. It's been several months at this point. The area that he ""lives"" now is pretty secluded from the road or most danger. It's very grassy. Lots of bushes. It's enclosed by our complex and there's a pool nearby.

150,"Hey, guys, I have a question. I don't know if you guys know anything about writing papers, but I would still like your sincere opinion and advice. So I wrote an essay for my college English class that was supposed to be about prejudice. As I wrote my essay, I got help from various tutors online so that I wouldn't get off topic. I recently turned my essay in, and in a couple of days later, my instructor graded my paper. She gave me no credit at all because she said that it was ""way off base"". The essay was supposed to be about prejudice and we were supposed to narrow the topic down to one group. The prompt states that we were then supposed argue whether or not prejudice can be prevented or contained between that group and another group. I wrote about how the prejudice between Republicans and Democrats could be prevented, by working together, accepting each other's differences, etc. I can show you guys the prompt, my essay, and what she said about my essay if you guys want to. So, what should I do? Should I ask her to look over my essay again, or should I just accept no credit for my essay. This essay really killed my grade in that class, by the way.
Edit:
Here's the prompt: http://docdro.id/PG4bi2V
Here's my essay: http://docdro.id/aRJ3XYq
Here are her comments: 
""This is most unfortunate. The essay instructions were quite clear that the essay should be narrowed to one group. Looking at 'prejudice' between members of political parties is far too broad. Assumptions made about various people's political beliefs is not really prejudice, since political beliefs vary with current world and local events. 
For example, not all Democrats support abortion, and not all Republicans are against abortion. There are climate change deniers in both parties. It is  is difficult, and unwise, to look at all members of any political party as having 100% the same beliefs. This is why the assignment said to narrow the topic.""",04Jun2017,3
151,"My son is 17. This August he is ""losing"" his older brother because of college. So I don't know if this is a way of acting out or what but I have compiled a list of items that I know he stole, mainly because the kid tries to be sneaky but fails horribly, and he leaves some of it in his car.

I've tried talking to him, and he flat out denies it. Hell I caught him stealing one time and he said ""I""m not stealing"" while attempting to hide a box of plastic food utensils behind his back.

So how do I fix this issue and can someone help me figure out why a 17 year old would steal the following items.

4 boxes of plastic eating utensils

2 bottles of laundry soap

a bunch of plastic containers

a bag of plastic cups

2 bottles of generic Pepto Bismo - which I found empty in his car.

a case of 20 water bottles

a bottle of carpet shampoo.

I for the life of me cannot figure what the hell he is doing with this stuff. Asking him leads no where, he won't tell anyone at all. He's also driving after curfew which since he is under 18, is 11pm unless he's at work and his work hours during the summer are 10am til 4pm. So it's not work.

I just don't know what to do here.",04Jun2017,13
152,"I was in a new city for work and I wanted to blow off some steam so I checked out a local massage parlor. I have been to parlors in the past and know the drill, this time it was different.

The provider sprayed something on my member (must've been antibacterial stuff) and started giving me a BJ with no mention of a condom. I then fucked her bareback and came inside of her because I was overwhelmed. There was no haggling over prices and I tip well in general, so maybe she assumed I was paying extra for BBFS. I got an STD test afterward and came up clean. My concern is her getting pregnant and tracking me down because I didn't use a burner phone.

I feel very stressed and have some questions that I'd love answered, but please don't feel obligated to address them:

She was probably on birth control, right?

I know for a fact she was between 40 and 50 (I have a thing for older women), the odds of her getting pregnant are low, right?

What would your average massage parlor girl do if she ended up pregnant, get an abortion?

I feel even more paranoid since I saw her ads disappear from online sites about two weeks after the encounter, is this because she found out she's pregnant?

Basically, how do providers view pregnancy and should I be on babynames.com instead of Reddit? I haven't slept in days.

**EDIT:** I've done some research on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2hqydm/request_what_is_the_chance_that_any_given/) and found that...
&gt;Taking these numbers and assuming the woman has a 29 day cycle we get a **2.7% average chance of getting pregnant from a sexual encounter on a random day.**

...and that's when the partners are at their ""optimal"" age for baby making and no birth control. Worst case scenario is she was 40 (as opposed to 47) and not using birth control, so it's gotta be lower, around a 1% chance, right?

158,"It’s been almost a month since my first suicide attempt... and I'm still here.  My family was out of town. I was home alone. I measured out 6L of water to try to water intoxicate myself. I drank a ton of water I thought that I was going to drink enough to die but all of a sudden I just started throwing up.  I threw up all the water I drank. I cried for 3 hours after that.  I'd been thinking about committing suicide a long time before that but I couldn't find a method. I guess I kind of doubted that it would work but I want to die so bad I had to try. I had found a pro suicide website and had been talking to people on there. I looked thro all the drugs in the house and asked them if any of them were lethal enough but they said all they'd do was cause damage to my body and make my life worse.  I want to be dead so bad but I can’t find a way to kill myself. I don’t have access to enough stuff to complete any of the methods I’ve researched.  I got really scared when I started throwing up and I texted my parents and told them. My mom just said to go lay down.  That was a long day. All I did was think about how I had failed, how I wanted to die but had no way of killing myself, and the pain. When they got home my dad just told me not to do anything stupid like that again and my mom talked to me and said that was awful, how I need to ignore those thoughts, and that she loved me, how that was wrong of me and how it makes her so sad and she doesn’t ever want anything to happen to me.
2mornings ago I woke up early and I tried to hang myself, but I failed at that too. I just want to die so bad. That’s all I think about all day.  
I’ve had chronic headaches on and off for 3 years. And have been to a bunch of doctors who couldn’t find something to help me.  I’d been putting off braces because of this.  I’m in high school and everyone is getting them off. I finally begged my mom to take me to get them.  I started to clench on them and told my orthodontist that I was in a lot of pain but it took him a while to figure out that I was clenching and to take them off. Now the clenching has caused severe TMJ. Every day I have pain in my head, jaw, face, neck, and throat It’s been like this every day for 5 months. The pain is just so strong. I’ve now just been going from specialist to specialist to try to get help. It takes forever to get into a specialist and then they never give me anything to help. I’ve tried different splints and medication that have either not helped or made the pain a lot worse. I hardly get to school or go/do anything anymore. The pain is there constantly.  None of the pain medications that I’ve gotten have done anything.  Seriously no pain medication works. I haven’t had a painless day in over 5 months. It’s hard to be nice. I try so hard to be nice but the pain can make me bitchy. I just want a break from it.
Since December I’ve really been awaken to the fact that I think I’m bisexual (more like homoflexable).  People at school are homo/biphobic . There’s someone in my class who I like but I know that they’re straight (and dating someone).  My family are strict Christians and my mom says some kind of offensive thing every day. I can’t tell anyone that I bi. Just the other day we were watching the Ellen show because there was a celebrity that I wanted to see. Then my mom started to say how Ellen was a lesbian so all she wears is suits and she was the man in her marriage and how her now exwife was the girl. How the hell does that even make sense? We were also watch Glee and one of the characters is gay and his dad was being accepting of that and my mom said how none of her kids better tell her that they’re gay. Damn that hurt.  I love my mother and I know she cares a lot about me and is trying to take care of me but it’s hard to like my family, especially her.  I’ve never been close with anyone else in my family except for her so it only bugs me when she says it. A preacher she was watching was telling people that of they didn’t know their gender they should look between their legs, and how gay people are just confused by the devil. Fuck that.  I’m gonna get kicked out when I’m 18 and when I tell them. I’ll be 15 in a few months. I don’t know what to do until I can move out. It’s not that I want to move out but I can’t handle living with people who are like that.  Even my extended family is anti LGBT. Everywhere I go people are like this.  There’s a girl at school who I know and she gets bullied. People make fun of her and call her a lesbian and say that she sleeps with women. I know that this girl isn’t gay; she’s told me and everyone that. People still just use that as an insult though.
My brother is rude to me most of the time. Only  rarely nice. He makes fun of me a lot and the pain. He’s always found a reason to make fun of me my whole life.  I got mad at him for making fun of me. I asked him to be quiet and he would not stop and my head hurt so bad but I couldn’t take it so I threw the TV remote at him. He charged at me and shoved me into the TV wall unit which is wood at the bottom then glass. I was lucky that I just went into the wood part but I completely went thro it. I had a bad bruise and small scrape on my leg. He keeps threatening to shove me into the glass part and to break both my legs. He’s 18 and 5’11. I’m only 5’1 and 95 lbs. He’s told me that I’m useless countless times and that I should be on the streets.   
I don’t get along all that well with my dad for whatever reason.  Never did. We get along off and on. He’s said before how he just should have had 1 kid, maybe 2. That would be my older sister who everyone adores and my brother.  When he gets mad at me he just swears. I was screaming because of the pain last night and my mom and dad threatened to spank me, hard if I didn’t stop. 
All my friends go and hang out at this teen night club on Friday nights. I wish I could go. Even if I felt good enough to go my mom wouldn’t let me, no sense even asking; I’m not even allowed to hang out with friends unsupervised or go anywhere alone.  My friends are all straight and easily find people to date. Nobody likes me. I don’t have any close friends, just some people who I hang around with at school.  I’m not considered weird or get bullied and I’m not popular either. A lot of time I spend working alone but I do prefer to join in with people if I can.  
I miss going out horseback riding. Parents are too busy taking me to appointments to take me and doctors cost enough money.  My family is stressed out and don’t want to deal with my health. In the summer they’re going on vacation and I’m stuck at my grandmother’s house because I probably will be in pain and ruin their time. 
Every morning I just wake up and think I need to die. I keep looking up different methods but none of them are doable for me. I went to emergency to get some pain killers which didn’t help. The doctor there asked me questions like if I had had sex and what was my sexual orientation.  I just lied and said I was straight.  She also asked about if I had thoughts about wanting to die. I said yes that I had been wanting to die for a while. When she asked if I had been thinking of ways to commit suicide or if I had attempted I got scared and said no. She said that shed give me the number of the local crisis center to call in case but she forgot to give it to me. I don’t want to call because they’ll just call the police on me and I’ll be stuck in the hospital.  All I really want is for the pain to go away and they gave me the only drug they could. I’ve taken so many drugs and all I get is the bad side effects.  Thanks for reading, I know it was long. I just wanted to blab.

159,"Hey guys, so I need some advice about my mom. I live in a house of 3 people, my mom, my brother and I. My mom and I are severely depressed, but I've managed to cope with mine without pills or anything, and she's reliant on her ""happy pills"". If anyone in the house is having a bad day, she automatically gets in a bad mood and tries to make it about herself, complains if she has to do anything around the house (I'm not the best son in the world, but I make sure I pull my own weight, clean, help all I can with bills, wash dishes, ect). She's extremely self centered, she only ever cares to talk about what she wants to talk about, which is usually talking about herself, and anytime wants to talk about anything else she tries to control the conversation. (We're all smokers so it happens a lot). She's also a very angry person, I remember one night she dented her car then we got home she threw a glass ash try at me.

167,"[21M] here that's had awful luck with the ladies. I've never had a girlfriend and I've only ever been on two or three dates. I'm also depressed and I often feel lonely. But something pretty amazing has been happening to me recently.

I went on an actual date with a wonderful girl yesterday. She's smart, ambitious, and has an A+ personality. We met via a mutual friend and SHE hit ME up on social media just a couple days ago (unexpected for a guy like me). Yesterday we took a walk in the park and then I took her to my favorite coffee shop. We just talked for hours about random stuff and enjoyed each other's company. It was cathartic; It didn't feel real, like it was too good to be true. I really like her and she seems to really like me.

But here's the catch: she's 17; an incoming senior in high school, and I'm an incoming senior* in college. We live in Ohio, where the age of consent is 16, so there legally isn't really anything wrong with this. But I still could hardly begin thinking about the ramifications of the age difference should our relationship get serious. My family, whose opinions of me I respect, would likely disapprove of us, and I'd imagine hers would as well. I also don't want to be that creepy 20y/o+ guy that hangs out with high-schoolers.

If our feelings for each other hold-up, then it would be difficult to ""just be friends"" until she graduates, and it would be similarly difficult to hide a serious relationship from our friends and family for that long. I know this hasn't been going on very long and I could very well be jumping the gun on this, but I think it's a good idea to ask for advice sooner rather than later.

183,"X-post from wildlifeecology.

I'm an undergraduate student graduating next spring and looking to go on into a master's program in fisheries or wildlife science. My number one choice for school requires that you have a faculty advisor before applying, and the professor I reached out to advised me to get some research experience under my belt before I submit my application package to her.

Here's my dilemma: none of the faculty at my small, rural school conduct research in herpetology (my goal field) and none of the faculty who are currently doing other research have any room for me in their labs. One professor suggested that we could start a project together in the Spring, but I'll be graduating then and won't be able to spend enough time with him for it to matter. 

I want to tackle a research question on my own, ideally measuring local aquatic salamander population dynamics, and I'm really confident I could do the field work without funding. My issue is my professors have given me mixed advice on whether or not this is a feasible project for an undergrad. Some say I simply lack the experience to get published, and some say there's really nothing stopping me. There are other graduate programs that I could pursue, but this opportunity is with my ideal professor at my ideal school and I'd love to be able to pull this off and impress her!

189,"I'm gonna make this short and concise: I graduated HS in 2010, and got about 60 credits for college in the immediate years following. In 2013, I realized I didn't know what I wanted to do and dropped out. I didn't do any college until last semester when I took some online courses, now about 75 credits, headed towards a business degree.

I chose business because I legit can't decide what I want to do with my life and business degrees are kind of catch-all for jobs that just require a degree or whatever.  I do have it in the back of my mind that after I get this degree, I can take pre-med classes and go to med school, but I can't, and don't need to, decide that now.  I actually just found out I'll be able to get school for free since a family member works at the school. My plan is to go 3 semesters at 20 credits each (roughly) and graduate by this time next year.

Given my situation as someone who doesn't know what to do and isn't really going towards a passion, what is the best business degree to get? As in, what will give me the most money, I guess... There's marketing, management, finance, accounting, information systems, communications, and a few others. I think I've ruled out management, accounting, and communications. Information systems and finance seem like the best bet, but marketing has some appeal.

After years of thinking about this and not talking to anyone I decided to try and reach out. I don't really have many regrets in my life. I have made plenty of mistakes, but those mistakes made me stronger and I learned from every one of them. I would say that I have one regret. I have single scar on my wrist from when I was incredibly depressed as a 16 year old. For anyone who is or is thinking about participating in self harm, please look for help. It may seem like things will not get better, but they will and you don't want that evidence on you for the rest of your life.

199,"I work in the Sunday School of a large church and there's one child in particular who seems to suffer from depression. He's four years old and he doesn't talk or smile. Sometimes he sits and cries. His mum and dad are divorced and the dad is the one who goes to the church. The mum and dad divorced because she snapped and started talking to 'the voices'. She was able to convince the custody judge that she was perfectly normal and she won most of the custody of the kids. Not sure if she's abusing them and I'm really concerned. Their other kids, a six year old boy and three year old girl are also seemingly disturbed. The oldest seems mostly adjusted, yet he sometimes lashes out on other kids. The three year old girl doesn't talk or smile, ever.

In short, I'm really concerned about these kids. What can I do?",04Jun2017,1

I finally tried self publishing with Amazon but No one is reading my book and I feel like I've failed somehow.

Same with screen plays, movies, tv shows, and it's not that their not good, people who read them tell me how great they are, but I have no idea how to proceed with them.

I'm also a comedian, I'm a small production actor, a song writer, I make games (board games, card games, table top games, and the scripting for video games cause I can't code for shit) and I sit at a job I hate because I have no idea what to do with any of this stuff!

When I was kid my mom tried to push me into medicine and I tried my best but I never had a knack for it so I never saw this as anything other than a hobby. Now that I realize that it's something I could use to make money I have no idea how. Now I've spent my whole life bouncing from one shitty job to the next and I never do anything. I'll be thirty one this year and I sit in my house, with my wife and kids, and just feel depressed because we live paycheck to paycheck and I could be using this talent to give my kids a better life.

Sometimes I even act out a bit or joke around too much with the friends I have just to feel like I have someone's attention. I don't understand why I'm like this.

but my plans are as so, i plan to get a job and get some money and then leave whoever's house im crashing at and find someone that is looking for a roommate. i then plan to work until i have a enough money to put myself through college.

She uses a voice that is just below yelling, and keeps her phone on maximum volume, and usually her calls last at least one hour. Normally in a situation like this I would first confront the loud wall mate, then go to my RA if it continued, but due to the circumstances neither of these are an option. I feel like confronting her may open my roomate and I up to retribution, seeing as she can hand out violations as she sees fit, and I have a hard time thinking that residential life would side with a resident over an RA, and getting them involved would only lead to more retribution.

I recently as of 31 May 17 separated from active duty military after 5 years and i am now in the air national guard and I am getting a part time job while going to college. The question i have is college related in that I'm interested in the cyber security career field but I'm not sure where to start. I'm not going to lie I'm very overwhelmed at the moment trying to get back on my feet, get a job, apply for school (i know nothing about college) and find a place to call home so I'm asking for help. 

As far as cyber security if anyone is currently in the career field could you answer me these?

1. Would i be better off going straight for the cyber security certifications versus a bachelors? (I've only heard of these i am not sure what it really entails when said though)

2. Should i even bother from a local school (ECPI) that isn't nationally accredited to start this process of getting a bachelors?

3. is there anything i should know before i start the schooling process in this career field ?

4. What are big company's looking for when hiring a cyber security specialist? 

5. Has anyone here worked under a military division in this career field versus a civilian sector? 

I apologize for the very noob related questions I just dont know a single person in this career field and I'm not sure where to start. I really appreciate all the advice and thanks for your time!",04Jun2017,1

Luckily, I'm in a pretty comfortable spot right now where I can actually work towards something. I'm single and have no kids, I don't have many bills. Nothing but free time to work towards something and advance my life.

I just have no idea where to even begin. I'm 30 so I'm hoping it's not too late.

When I was in my early 20s I sort of aimlessly went to college because ""thats what youre supposed to do."" But I had no goal or ambition. So I kind of wasted my 20's. I don't want to waste my 30's too.

A big problem was also that I never had any idea what I wanted to do. It's been 10 years of me thinking ""what do I want to do with my life"" and literally can only think of a few things that I want out of a career. I want to work in a place that has a lot of employees and has a very social atmosphere. I don't want it to be physically demanding, and I want the hours to be steady. Literally none of that has to do with types of jobs though.

240,"So this is quite a long one unfortunately but hopefully someone will read it and have some advice to give. Also, throwaway account because massive embarrassment and I sound like a bit of a psycho. 

#**TL;DR**: (in light of the story being really long)
 Split up with gf of 6 years, started watching more YouTube. Became a massive fan of a similarly-aged female YouTuber, met her at a convention, now an (obsessive) emotional wreck that can't handle not being able to hang out with said YouTuber except in brief 15 min intervals every few months. Want to know if anyone's experienced that and knows how to switch that feeling off!

#Quick intro
 I'm a 20-something male who is also a fledgling Indie game developer. The YouTuber in question is a 20-something female from about 50 miles away from where I live. She does game-related vlogging and also has a 2nd channel with some other people covering video games. We'll call her ""**Bella**"" (not her real name).

# Now to the story, if you care for it:

So 2 months ago now I split from my girlfriend of 6 years because we'd grown apart and it wasn't working. I saw it coming a ways off so it wasn't a surprise and I took it pretty well, though I was understandably a little down. 

One night I was browsing YouTube and I came across **Bella**'s videos - mostly vlogging about video games but also talking about politics and various other mutual interests. One video in particular spoke about how she'd split from a boyfriend a while back and had taken the time to pour her newly-found free time into playing video games and making a vlogging channel; basically doing the things that she loves to do and being a bit more creative. It sort of resonated with me and I took her advice - I started playing more video games (which is what I also like to do), and being a bit more creative with my own video game development.

By now I was a big fan of this girl and followed all her YouTube uploads - and started following her on Twitter too. I'd got a bit obsessed, I admit, at this point - but it didn't seem too unhealthy, and it kept my mind off things a bit.

So fast forward to last month, when I went to an anime/games/pop culture convention in ""Town where Bella lives that is ~50mi from where I live"". A day before I'm due to go there she tweets that she'll be there and not to be shy about subscribers saying hello. So on the day I managed to find her, said hello, had a nice chat, took a few pics, got a hug, and was on my way.

After that, I literally felt totally and utterly overwhelmed and the happiest I'd been in forever, having met someone with such similar interests and who was a genuine pleasure to speak to (and who, while maybe just through courtesy, seemed to be taking an interest in what I was saying, which was sort of refreshing for me). After I got home, I tweeted out the picture of me and her, @mentioning **Bella** to say I had a great time at the convention and also thanks for saying hi, and she ""liked"" my tweet.

And that brings us to now. Literally every day since meeting her at the convention I've cried because all I keep thinking about is how I want to hang out/spend time with this woman but owing to her being fairly famous and probably having already forgotten me, it'll never happen. I find myself imagining myself in situations with this girl and feeling overwhelmingly sad that it could never be. And as we ""speak"" I'm planning on going to further conventions later in the year which I tell myself is so that I can immerse myself in more game-related goodness (which is partially true at least, for sure) but if I'm truly honest, it's in large part because of the chance of bumping into **Bella** again and hanging out/chatting for another brief 15 min window.

Has anyone ever felt like this before? I've never felt this way about someone like this before and it's absolutely killing me! My friend says it's sort of natural because I'm just subconsciously swapping my ex girlfriend out for this woman and that it'll come to pass eventually, which sounds fair enough. I just want to find a way to not cry all the time because I have no way of actually being her buddy IRL.",04Jun2017,1

243,"So I have depression, anxiety, and a heap of relationship troubles. I feel like my mental health is suffering right now and was thinking I need to sign up for therapy. I'm currently waiting to see what health insurance I qualify for to see if my I can get a plan that will help cover at least some of the payments. But I was thinking I may want to try to go even if they don't cover it for me. 

My dilemma is that therapy is so expensive and I'm so broke and what if it doesn't even help. I'm not a gambler and $150 for 45 mins of talking to someone is A LOT to me. I'm currently living with my parents because I'm too broke to afford my own place. I have a job and will hopefully be able to save up soon to move out, but I'm debating what's a better use of my money. Paying for counseling that I probably need or being able to afford my own place, pay off debt and have a savings for when my car is going to break down again, which will probably happen soon.

Did anyone ever go to therapy for depression, anxiety and/or marital issues and have it totally save you? Did you think wow, they really helped me I'm starting to feel like a whole person or did you think that it was just okay but you could've just talked to a friend or read a self-help book instead?",04Jun2017,2
