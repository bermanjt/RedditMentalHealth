2,"So I'm 19 and recently transferred to a big college in my state from my local cc. I've only been here 2 weeks and it's extremely overwhelming and I feel like giving up.

Growing up I was very anti-social. I never hung out much, dated, or had many friends. I even took my Junior and Senior year of high school online. Being here at college made me realize how much far behind I am in the social department.

Seeing people with their SO's and friends makes me realize just how lonely I am. Since I've been here I have been socializing but I still feel hollow inside.

I am usually always anxious in public situations because I have a stutter. It's hard for me to talk to people b/c in the situations I do, I often get strange looks when I block on a word I try to say. When I go to my dorm I get extremely depressed when I realize how much of a loser I have been in life so far which makes me feel like just giving up.

I've joined a few clubs and met people but I still feel depressed. I was thinking about going to a volunteer club that meets this Sunday however.

I'm now having thoughts about whether my major is even right for me. I want to try and stay here and see if I can make new friends as its only been 2 weeks but with my depression and anxiety it feels as just living is impossible so I'm not sure how I can handle all my homework and the volunteering I am thinking about doing.

At this moment in my life I am completely dumbfounded on how to move forward. Everyday at my college I get extreme bouts of anxiety and depression. I have thoughts of how odd it is to be my age and never dated. I realize how little friends I made back home and how stressful this new environment is as I have usually been in my room 24/7 or at a my small school in the past. 

My mood often varies throughout the day. At one moment I feel as if I can concur school and get by. In other moments I feel like crying and think about dropping out as I feel as if I just can't handle the fast paced nature of school, the people who go here and the homework I have been given. I find it hard to do my studies as I can't concentrate at all. All I can think about are negative thoughts or nothing as my brain feels fried from my depression which makes me unable to focus.

I guess what I am unsure of is, is if I need to take time off school, go home and get help. School seems impossible for me to handle; be it the environment, or the homework. I don't know if I should go home and get counselling, go volunteer and brush up on my social skills and think about what field of work I want to pursue or stay at school this semester, push through my classes and then think about what to do with my life during the summer.

Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks.

5,"So my girlfriend might be pregnant. Sore breasts, vaginal cramps, the smell or thought of a lot of foods she finds repulsive, missed period, and fatigue. Every single one of the signs is there. Here's the thing: 

We took two at home tests one was on the cheaper end and one was the exact opposite on the higher end and they both came back negative. Then today, we went to an actual doctor and he did a test and it came back negative as well.

She also has some symptoms of being sick. Sore throat, coughing, congestion, and swollen tonsils. 

Any advice?

8,"Hey guys :)

My mum has some serious problems in my opinion, not trying to make fun of her but I really want to help her. 

She didn't have the best childhood and after that some other traumas happened that seem to have affected her. 

She usually seems very detached and distant. Her two chronic diseases may be a reason for that as well, she is constantly afraid of causing pain with a motion. She has little to no self-confidence. Moreover, she recently told me she hears two people discussing with each other. I am not a professional but this doesn't sound healthy to me. Additionally, she is easily distracted and lacks concentration. She overeats and overspends, she has trouble setting boundaries. Most of the time it's impossible to have a proper conversation with her, she sometimes seems a bit childish (selfish, can't take on responsibility, talks about herself only,..). When I tell her she needs to get help as kindly as I possibly could, she nervously laughs it off, feels ashamed (of needing help? Being flawed? Idk) or at worst she starts crying. I could add more symptoms but I guess it isn't really necessary.

How can I make her actually want to go to therapy? I tried by saying she will be happy (have never seen her happy), she will lose weight, be able to afford nice vacations, become more concentrated, which really annoys her now. 

Thanks to everyone, having to see my mum suffer makes me feel kinda desperate",29Jan2017,3

10,"So I've applied for journalism courses to uni's for September and the subject is something that I'm interested in but I know that it's not the best profession in terms of making money. What I fear is that I'll basically end up with high amounts of student loans, making a shitty wage and basically be surviving rather than living. Additionally, I'm starting to doubt whether I've made the right choice. Before I applied I also thought about applying for something like economics or something like that where there is more of a chance of getting a pretty big wage, or at least bigger than with journalism. However, I know that just because I could've studied economics rather than journalism doesn't automatically mean a bigger pay, but I think it's fair to say that the chance of that would be bigger. On the other hand however, economics is not something that I'm interested in. I fear that if I had chosen that I would've ended up being miserable mentally and I would have sacrificed my passion for a greater chance of financial independence, something that would relieve a lot of stress. However, like I said earlier, now that I've chosen journalism instead I fear that I made the wrong choice by sacrificing financial independence for a passion that might make me broke and might lead me to have a tough future. 

Since I already applied for journalism I can't really back out of that, but I just want some opinions: would it have been wiser to do something like economics where I'm not really passionate about it but there is a higher chance of making more money in the future or was what I decided the wiser move, by sticking with what I'm more passionate about and potentially having it tough financially?",29Jan2017,1

I can't risk telling her because she likely doesn't feel that way about me.  She would likely say no and tell my wife.

20,"I [18/f] and my boyfriend [18/m] have been dating for 1 year. Whenever I bring up breaking up he cries. We went on our first date in middle school, he was my first everything and I have always been enamored by him. After 5 years of on and off hooking up/ being best friends he finally asked me to be his girlfriend, I was ecstatic. My dreams of dating him had finally came true and I wanted to be the best girlfriend I could be, my goal was to make him happy, to lift him up and make our relationship as good as it possibly could be. Things were great in the beginning I truly felt he loved and cared about me, but over time things have certainly changed.

I know relationships have honeymoon periods where couples are madly in love and do cute things for each other. I still enjoy doing things for my boyfriend though, I try to write him cute notes and do little things for him but my actions always go unreciprocated. I simply feel that he no longer loves me, and whenever I vocalize that with him he assures me that he does love me. We used to be able to talk for hours but now he just looks on his phone and I find myself doing the same. I've been snapping on him a lot because I just feel like I'm in a one sided relationship. I'm trying so hard to make him happy and make our relationship work but it just feels like he doesn't love me. He gets mad at me about little things like not making decisions fast enough and always yells at me for doing things such as falling asleep. 

Example: Yesterday was our one year anniversary, and he didn't do anything or even really acknowledge it. For the first 6 months of our relationship he would take me out and tell me how much he loved me. Slowly this started to fade and I assumed it was because our relationship had grown and monthly anniversaries were small in comparison to how long our relationship would last, nevertheless I expected he would do something similar to what he used to do for our past anniversaries for our one year (Like I said before we have been friends for a long time and I know he did something special with his last girlfriend for their one year) We decided that we were going to go to a local restaurant but there wasn't any parking except for a spot about half a mile away. I had recently hurt my ankle so I asked if he could drop me off at the door so I could make our reservation so by the time he got back from parking the car we could just sit down and I wouldn't have to push my ankle. He refused, told me I had to walk because it would be good for me and began to walk to the restaurant without me. When it took me longer to get out of the car he turn around and told me he didn't want to deal with me and he just wanted to go home. This lead to an argument. I made him a photo album of our year spent together, got him a gift and wrote him a nice letter but he didn't seem to care much. 

His actions and seemingly lack of care is really starting to hurt me. I feel like I should just end our relationship because he always seems upset with me. I'm tired of always making him mad and him yelling at me to change so I don't hurt him. He promises he loves me and begged me to give him a second chance but I'm really hurt and don't know how to handle this. 

TL;DR My boyfriend and I have been having some issues, yesterday was our 1 year anniversary and he didn't really acknowledge it. I feel like he doesn't love me anymore and we've been fighting a lot over stupid things. He used to be my best friend and confident but now I find myself scared to talk to him because I don't want him to yell at me or make him upset. He cries whenever I bring up us breaking up. I just want him to be happy but I can't seem to do that. I don't know what steps I should take. ",29Jan2017,1

I am a 20 years old guy which chose to study in a different country. Now I'm starting the second semester and been almost 6 months since I am here.

Before getting here, I felt a pressure from my parents to accept this challenge of moving and studying abroad. And I'm still feeling it because they don't accept the fact that I don't like being here.

Don't get me wrong, they support me, but I am always feeling miserable due to that pressure that are putting on me to enjoy this place and this opportunity. 

I am feeling lost and weak all the time and even though I like what am I studying, I don't think this is the certain place to do this thing.

I grew up in my country and my city and I really love it, even though it's not giving me the opportunities that are here. 

My parents invested money in me, but I am not feeling good in this place and the feeling that I am going to disappoint them is killing me.

I want to get back home and study the same thing by my own or even at a college in my country.

From day one I couldn't stand it.  My coach was an absolute nazi and drove us into the ground.  I endure through two years of it before quitting for multiple reasons.  Firstly, I quit because I wanted to focus on my studies.  While I got A's in high school, I was getting C's, D's and even a couple F's.  I needed to focus on studies.  Secondly, I hated every second I had to commit to the sport.  Practices sucked, games were stressful, I just never wanted to be a part of it.  I don't think my quitting would be such a problem if it weren't for my little brother joining the team the year I left.  It's been almost a year since I told my parents I wasn't going back to play, and they still haven't let me forget about it.  I've tried telling them everything and anything to get them off my back but it seems like they say things just to hurt me now, like how much of a quitter I am and how I abandoned the team.

38,"In August I met a guy online who had the same kinks as me. I let him take my virginity. After that, we've met up almost every week for a smoke sesh and sex. I've dated guys before, but I've never been in a relationship. I'm really into him, but I've always respected that our relationship was only for sex. We don't see each other in our daily lives. We talk over video on Skype sometimes. 


When we first started having regular sex, he was really interested in me, like always texting first and responding almost immediately. He usually initiates(messages me first), but we haven't seen each other for three weeks so I texted him asking if he wanted to meet up. He usually texts back within an hour, but it's been three days. I went on skype this morning to see if he was online, and he logged off(or went invisible) the moment I got online. He's expressed to me(over Skype last week) that he still wants to see me Im worried that he thinks that I'm not interested in him and because of this he's losing interest in me. 


I don't know what to to text him. I really hate being the one to double text, but I want to see him again or at least have him stop ignoring me. 


How can I do this without appearing too clingy or persistent? I want to say things like ""I miss you"" and ""I really want to see you again"", but our texts are usually ""what are you doing tonight?"" Or ""what's up"". Again, I've never been in a real relationship not to mention ever had a fuck buddy before so I'm not really sure of the boundaries. 

Also, if he really is ignoring me, is it okay to ask him why? Or would that make him even more uninterested?


Is it okay to communicate that I'm frustrated that he doesn't text back or would I come off as obsessing over him for that?


Or should I send something really suggestive to get him interested? I'm not above sending nudes.

I never went to school. My parents gave me some weird kind of ""homeschooling,"" where they taught me to read and write, along with some basic math. I'm still great at reading and writing, but the math has almost entirely slipped my mind by now. Their excuse for not sending me to school was because they didn't want me to experience bullying, or have to go through the education system's boring routine. I feel disgusted by this, since now, I have no experience with bullying (and have to learn to toughen up to it as an adult), and also have no experience with strict schedules. I don't know what their train of thought was, and I wish I could have gone to school.

**Summary:** I haven't had any formal education whatsoever. I only really know how to read and write. I don't know any history, geography, math, or anything.

------

The fact that I don't have any qualifications or formal education really stresses me out. I'm not sure what to do about it. I know that lots of people say ""Well, people forget what they learn in school anyway, so who cares!"" but I'm sure that employers care about the credentials. Many of them (probably rightfully) request that you have GCSEs in certain things... but (for example) the information for the math GCSE seems impossibly hard to learn in a short amount of time, and I'm not sure I'm even allowed to take them at my age. I haven't researched that much, because I get overwhelmed when I look into it. I'm not sure if I even need to do it. I don't know.

**Summary:** I'm nervous about what I'll present on a job application. First of all, I'll have to avoid any job that requests a GCSE. Secondly, do I just leave out any kind of school name? Would that be questioned? How do I answer them if they question it? Etc. I'm also nervous about just not knowing any of the things that normal people that went to school would know.

------

I've also been isolated from society, in more ways than just lacking school. I've only really been around strangers when I go grocery shopping, and even then, my parents are still either near to me or in the same store. I've never been very far away from them. The first time that I checked out an item without my mother being extremely close by was early 18's, and I was freaking out the whole time. My mother has also instilled an intense fear of strangers into me. She has always warned me as a child that I could get abducted and taken advantage of. That's normal - parents always over-warn their kids about that type of thing. However, she still does it to this day. I suggest that I want to take a bus or a taxi, and she will start talking about how I'll get raped and murdered and how terrible it would be for her if that happened to me. It's terrifying and I believe it on some level. It makes me feel small and weak, and like it's GOING to happen, and that I won't be able to defend myself.

**Summary:** I've rarely been around people other than my parents. When I am, I get anxiety attacks because I'm being constantly told that I'm going to get raped and murdered. My mother still tells me this, even though I beg her to stop, and tell her that I just want to be an adult.

------

The main reason why I've been isolated is because we live very far from anything. She moved to the countryside so that she could own horses (which has been her life-long dream). I feel betrayed that she would move to the middle of nowhere to fulfil a dream of hers, when she had a child that she had to take care of and expose to normal life. Either way, that's how my life has been. I grew up on a farm type of thing, with horses and, at some point, chickens and other such farm-ish animals. We still live here. But now, all of the animals except some cats are long dead. The house is in an extreme mess. She's a hoarder, so there are so many unneeded things stacked everywhere. We own the house, not rent. It's disgusting and unliveable here. There's mold in many places. There's a huge stain and swelling in the ceiling in my mother's room. There's dirt and decay everywhere. The inside and outside of the house is in an awful state. And, like I said, it's in the middle of nowhere. This makes me feel very alone, lost, and bad. She has said for years now that we've eventually going to move, but she puts it off every single time. I desperately want to move somewhere that's simple, downsized, and closer to civilization, but it just keeps getting put off. She gets angry at me and accuses me of doubting her if I prod her about how we still haven't moved or done anything to change our situation. Going back to how the house is basically derelict, we also have no money for any kind of repairs. My parents haven't had an actual salary-based job since I was born. They've survived off of small one-time jobs and, in the later years, benefits (since my mother has been considered my father's carer for a while now). We still just live ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" on these benefits, and have none left over for repairs. If we have any money left over, she spends it on more things to hoard.

**Summary:** We live very far away from civilization. It's hindered me a lot. I grew up basically just interacting with my parents, pets/farm animals, and no one else. The farm animals are now dead and we don't need the land that we have, but she still keeps putting off moving. The house is in a state of decay that constantly gets worse. We also have no money for repairs.

Regarding my father, he's around 70 and has had multiple strokes in the last 10 years (or thereabouts). However, he still drives us places. I've had extreme trouble getting my driver's license because of the location (far away from everything), my instilled anxiety about strangers, my lack of anything that might be helpful towards it (like a passport; my parents never got me one), my nervousness about people questioning my situation, etc. I don't even know where to start with it. I want to fill out the online form for it, but I feel like it might somehow mess up. I tried ordering a form to fill out, but you needed a picture for it. I waited months to be able to go somewhere with a photobooth to take a picture for it. My parents argued outside the entire time and kept prodding me with ""Done yet? Is something going wrong in there?"" even though it was just taking me a while. When it was done, I was given a sheet of 6 images. I then wasn't sure how to cut them. Cut them really close so that all the white is gone? But then I might mess it up and cut into the non-white part. Cut them with white around them? But the instructions have such a specific requirement for the sizing. I don't know. It was simple but I got so stressed out and haven't faced it since. I tried cutting some pictures up but I ended up butchering the cutting on one of them and then bending the rest while I did that, so I think they're useless now. If I ask my mother to go back and let me take more pictures, she'll bully me about how I messed up this set. That'll really affect me, because, well, she never let me get exposed to bullying as a kid like everyone else was, and secondly, because it's a real insecurity. Getting bullied over it will really hit home. I hate how I messed up the pictures. Just getting to the place with the photobooth is also an ordeal, due to being so far away from everything, and due to needing to have my father drive us. We also can't really take buses because 1. they take an extremely long time to get anywhere since we're so far away from anything, and 2. because of the aforementioned fear I have of being in a bus/similar places. I'm sure I'd get molested or something, even though I know that's unlikely. I can't even think about it without having an anxiety attack.

**Summary:** My father still drives us everywhere, and is basically our only method of transportation, but he's very old and not suited for it. It feels like a death sentence every time we drive somewhere. I haven't got my license yet due to location, fear, confusion, etc.

**&gt;&gt;&gt; Kind of a TL;DR here. &lt;&lt;&lt;**
That's all I can think of right now. Here's a slightly more concise list of all of the things mentioned above.

-No formal education. I never went to school. I don't know how to present this to future employers, friends, and strangers. I don't know just how much normal knowledge I'm lacking. I'll have to avoid certain jobs entirely since they require GCSEs.

-I have an extreme fear of strangers, because my mother has instilled in me that I'm going to get raped and murdered if I even go outside onto our safe, self-owned property, let alone go out into the world. I have anxiety attacks when going anywhere because of this. She still tells me these things constantly and won't stop. I've very rarely been far away from my parents when outside.

-We live in the middle of nowhere. It takes forever to get to any civilized area, and in order to do that, we need to be driven by my elderly, unfit-for-driving father. It's terrifying every single time. I also can't use public transport due to my extreme fear, mentioned in the above point.

-I've had extreme trouble getting my driver's license due to being so far away from everything, and due to confusion about how to really do it. I'm not used to doing professional things like this (again, thanks to my parents never exposing me to anything like it) and it gets very confusing and stressful very fast.

-The house is a mess. It's full of hoarded stuff and is literally falling apart. My mother keeps saying that we'll move, but puts it off every few months, and has done this for years.

------

I'd like any advice that anyone can think of. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to start, and it's all so overwhelming. I've been kind of violently repressing for my whole life, pretending that this is normal or acceptable. Only recently did I realize that my living situation isn't normal and that it's going to mess with me a lot and that I don't know how to move forward. It's been really stressful to realize all of that at once, and I'm very lost.

51,"First off, I want to say that I'm normally a happy and friendly person who gets along well with pretty much everybody.

Here's the issue though: My house mate always watches Fox News and those murder shows on discovery ID. It's not that I care about the contrary political opinions they and I have, but how hateful they are about everything (including non political things). They can be a nice person sometimes but generally they seem to be selfish and rude. On top of this they can't stand any contrary opinions and always have to be right. 

Their negativity over the past year has really started to affect me and have a negative impact on my life. I really don't want to be angry at this person, or negative in general, but they are always angry, negative, and it's starting to bleed into me. One last thing I want to mention is that I beleive that the murder shows they watch contribute to their negativity as well Fox.

Tl;Dr: I have a house mate that is hateful/negative because of their tv viewing habits (fox news, and murder shows) and their hatred/anger has been bleeding into me. I want to be positive but the way they act is really taking a toll on my attitude.",29Jan2017,2

Tuesday morning I woke up saying my usual stuff like good morning how are you doing. Everything went fine she told me, she passed out early and we're talking like normally we always do but little by little she stared talking about her brother  (btw he's and ass) and it got to the point that she told me that something happened on Monday night that she got pissed off about her brother  ( she is living with her older brother) that she she was so upset that she went to bed early. All I said to her was ""You're a stong person to live with him"" and ""that's good that you're not letting it get to you"" that's it and she went on a vent on me and told me last ""this is why I don't like talking about this with you "" and "" every time I talk about this I always feel upset and uncomfortable"". Than she stops talking to me for a few days and steered talking to me again with one word messages. Just now she message me about her brother again. What shold I do. Should I ask if she wants to talk about it or move on to a different subject. Because the first time I don't think I said anything bad to make her react the way she did it stop talking to me for a few days. I'm at a lost here.",29Jan2017,2

I am a genius. I have a number of inventions, some of which would make millions of dollars. When I speak of innovations for which I have no prototype, it is only because I lack the funds to make it happen - the innovation over what already exists is so well-placed and minor that, were I able to elaborate publicly, you would agree - for the invention to prove impossible would be... impossible.

I furthermore have identified a number of opportunities in the market to make hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.

But I have no formal credentials, apart from top ACT score and National Merit Scholarship.

60,"This isn't a slam against games or gamers, I did this to myself.

I feel so lost and aimless.  In high school I got big into drugs and drinking.  While I had fun and many memories it got me out of sports and focus on academics.  I got arrested a lot and decided to stop all abuse after I thankfully graduated high school.  The fall I graduated I got introduced to MMOs.  As moderation was always a problem with anything I did, I fell majorly for allowing many hours of my free time and my life to get consumed.  

Over the years I've had many jobs and relationships.  Ended up even meeting my wife on WoW and we are still together today.  I love her and we haven't had any major problems and that hasn't changed with my new outlook.  I have, however, squandered good career opportunities I had no business having because I could never prioritize my life correctly.

I've skated by with my ability to learn, comfort in adapting, solid charisma and a lot of luck.

I experimented with a drug last week because I had been having a rough time with my job and gaming schedule pushing sleep as a low priority.  I've come out on the other side with a completely new perspective.  I can't continue my life as it is because I'm not healthy or happy outside of my wife.

Trouble is I don't know what's next.  So many years have gone by that not only do I not know what I want but I don't even know what I like to do for fun.  I have no real friends outside of work companions or online and my high school friends I'm still in contact with have either moved on in their lives with families or moved away.

68,"Hey guys, 

I have a very… unique situation. It all started while I was still in elementary school (I’m 24 now). My family and I moved out of state, and my family during that time became very close with one of my Dad’s co-workers and her family. This co-worker had a daughter who was about 5-6 years older than me, and I immediately wanted to be friends with her, because, you know, I was just a kid and I thought it would be so cool to be friends with a teenage girl, plus I just moved and didn’t have any friends.

I was always very shy, especially during this time since I was a VERY awkward preteen, lol, plus I was bullied and was hurt by ex-friends which made me very paranoid about how I acted, but I still tried really hard to communicate and talk to this girl and her friends because deep down I really wanted a friendship with them, but I kept finding it harder and harder to talk to them because they VERY rarely involved me in the conversation and basically treated me like I was invisible. They would talk to me once in a blue moon, but again, it was very rare. I always felt very inferior to them. They always looked so pretty and I felt like the “ugly duckling” so to speak. Whenever my family would have company over and she was invited, I would put on LOADS of make-up and the nicest clothing. I always felt like I had to impress her and her friends and prove to myself that I am grown up, which leads me to another thing - whenever my family would have company over, they would just invited this girl and her Mom, but this girl always felt the need to invite her own friends without letting any of us know, which is not only extremely rude, but it gave me the impression that she invited them so she wouldn’t have to be stuck talking to me.

As much as I wanted to be friends with this girl, I always assumed it wouldn't happen though because I know it's not considered ""cool"" for a high school girl to be friends with a kid, and by the time I was in high school, she was legal to drink and it would've been a bit of a hassle if they couldn't go clubbing because of my age, so I understood why she never asked to hang out with me and that's one of the two reasons why I never asked her (the other being my fear of rejection). I constantly gave her the benefit of the doubt and told myself that she was not intending to hurt me. However, one day shortly after I graduated high school, she posted a bunch of photos on her Facebook of her at a party, and I noticed that some of the girls at that party that she was hanging out with were girls from MY GRADUATING CLASS!!! That really pissed me off and that really bothered me. Why do you make me assume for years that our age difference is the reason for us not being closer, when you’re partying with girls I graduated with?

Another thing that left a very bad taste in my mouth was the way she treated my brother, whose around the same age as her. She lied to my Mom about a situation that happened in school and made my brother look like the bad guy, and also told him to stay away from a girl he liked because he was, according to her, “bad news” and “involved with drugs” – we later found out that they were close friends.

I had a much harder time adjusting to this new city than she did, and she has SO MANY opportunities over the years to help me feel better and be a good friend, but in my eyes, it seemed like she couldn’t care less. The final straw for me was the last time I saw her when she invited me to an event and her and her friends had a separate table from everyone else and they barely talked to me. I had suicidal thoughts that day and have resented her since.

I actually moved away to another city in the same state about two hours away for a few years, but now I am back to finish school, and I am VERY afraid to run into her. I don’t know if I should be nice, or if I should snub her. I am also afraid if I see her if it was trigger me and bring back bad feelings that I used to have.mI’ve talked to my parents about this and they believe that there were some situations where this girl was in the wrong, but there were others where she didn’t actually DO anything to hurt me, but her actions made me feel a certain way given how I was feeling and things I was going through at the time. She recently sent my parents a Christmas card, and according to my Dad, ever since I moved, whenever he has seen her she has asked him about me. It’s very confusing because there’s a lot of evidence showing that she is a fake bitch, but there’s just as much evidence showing that it could be a complete misunderstanding.

What do you guys think? Do you believe this girl is bad news or do you think there is a logical explanation for everything, and how should I handle a possible chance encounter with her?",29Jan2017,1

Usually, each time I see him I fall for him all over again since I haven’t seen him for a long time. But now it’s no longer like that. I’m not sure if it’s because if we’ve both grown up and haven’t seen each other as much or that I personally feel he likes someone else. I’ve still always wanted to confess. Now that I am in high school, I’ve been building up the courage to because I’ve grown as a person. The thing is, I can never find a time to confess. Each time our families meet and I get to see him, I can never get a chance alone with him. I have an urge to just spill all my past feelings and have it done with. I’m even prepared for rejection.

79,"Background: 27, M, Vancouver Canada

I work in a industry with lots of hot guys and girls, and I respect that all, never met a bad one. I love my job, I hope I will for the rest of my life.

But...

Recently I realized that I have a huge jealously problem. So, long story short - Because I often come into contact with hot guys (and even I'd admit, yeah, they are good looking) female friends, family and of course colleges will start raving about how attracted they are to whoever on set or in the studio.
A few years ago, when I was in school, we had to put shows and make shorts, so we needed actors. We would get these personalities, and all the girls would start gushing like ""he's so hot... He's beautiful... I wanna to do... I'd let him..."" (and so on). At the time, I fell into a deep anger that caused me to miss a few days of school and that progressed to full blown depression. I never knew why, just assumed it was unrelated.

Later...

Get into the film industry here in Vancouver (proudly born and raised). Recently, same thing happens; extras get on set and all the girls on crew are all over themselves. They would talk to me as if I was girl, telling me how pretty this guy was. Then, I finally realized that I was actually jealous, and angry, and i had a small panic attack... again.

These girls are my work friends, and I don't have much contact with them outside of that, so I don't want to date them... but I realize now that I got so jealous, because I know that I never have a girl (or guy) say those things about me. It really hurts because I like people, and I want them to like me (and I want women to say nice things about my looks, at least once in a while).

Now, I get it... these guys are paid to be looked at... and I'm the ugly guy in a normal crowd, but still... it hurt.

Thanks for listening it really helps.

TL;DR
I'm an ugly guy, who gets jealous whenever friends gush about how great looking a guy is, because I don't inspire that sort of thing in women myself. I'm sure they don't mean to hurt me, but it still hurts to know that women do talk like that... just not about me.

A year ago, I worked at a semi-local planet fitness. Pretty sweet gig. Was able to use my laptop and even game at work, as long as I got everything else done (clean male bathrooms, trash duty, wipe down the machines twice a night), but after working there for 2 and some change months, my sleep schedule started shifting (I'm an insomniac), so I started noticing myself drift before my shift. It became painful, to say the least.

The reason I -gave- for leaving was that I had to take care of my girlfriend for 3 months due to foot surgery (The lie was the surgery. She needs to have it but we deffers can't afford her taking off that many months), but I left because I felt bad that I kept nearly falling asleep on the job and from day one they said ""Don't be that guy who falls asleep on the job"" in reference to a previous worker.

I chugged 3-4 energy drinks a night near the end, and I (and my heart) couldn't take it anymore, and had to leave so he could hire someone who could easily stay up for that.

I have always been mostly up to date on politics, (although I'm admittedly not an expert), and had an opinion about what's been going on, but always feel so helpless and like I won't be able to do much. I am at a breaking point, I can no longer stand by and just quietly stew in my anger.  This is getting pretty serious,  and I only see it getting worse.  Luckily we have seen people begin to stand up to it as much as they can,  but is it enough? I feel as though this time is my call to action, but unfortunately our society has made us conveniently ill-equipped. A lot of the people in power are so corrupt, and way more savvy than the general public.

I just want to help change the direction in which we're headed.  Reviewing my options even leaves me feeling more helpless. I have gone through the many stages of denial, anger, confusion, disbelief and detaching from what's been going on, but the horror has pushed me to want to make a change.  But how can I do that?! Right now, all I feel like I can do is:

1. Share my voice and facts on social media in hopes of calling others to action. But that's often not very effective,  and gets annoying fast. 
2.March and protest as the opportunity arises. But this seems ineffective and too easily ignored.  Makes you feel a bit better and somewhat accomplished, but what is it really accomplishing? 
3. Call my representatives. But does this make a difference? They already know what is going on, so they're either on the same page, or so detached that a phone call from a citizen doesn't mean a thing.  They'll turn off their phones,  and do their normal shady dealings that will line their pockets or further their career. 

I've already tried to prevent this by voting in all my local and national elections and try to elect those that I have more faith in,  but this is not really an option to improve things right now.

It's narcissistic, I admit.

 I've hardly every seen anyone from Grindr in person by coincidence so I always just sent my face and... er... 'other' pics to people without thinking and had fun doing that... 

Well that's been nice for the past little while, that is until now that a guy I messaged... Who's new to my country from Lebanon... Goes to my gym and saw me there a couple of times.

He messaged me first, before I knew he went to my gym... He was decently attractive so I sent over a few face pics, body pics, dick pics, etc etc... He sent his... I was kind of horny when we first chatted so we had a pretty intense conversation where I guess I gave him a strong feeling I was interested... But this was like any other conversation to me... Hot in the moment, i'd never see him and we'd carry on with our lives...

Well he messaged me the next day saying he saw me going into the gym and instead of making some shit up like ""no that's my twin"" or some B.S... I said it was me... Well then he *immediately* delved into how it's hot we go to the same gym, how he wants me to meet up with him in the showers to feel each other up, etc etc... So immediately I was like ""uh, not so fast"". I started to get a bit panicky now that this was becoming really real haha... I told him not to go so fast and that i'm a pretty shy person and that I prefer not to be bothered when I workout so not to come up and talk to me... Well he replied that he would definitely talk to me if he sees me again... Fuck!

He kept messaging asking for more pics and was really excited at how we go to the same gym... I tried to ignore him for a bit on Grindr, but he messaged me everyday with dick pics and the same shirtless pics of him... He finally told me to stop ignoring him so I replied and just told him straight up that I wasn't interested in fun, that I want to just be left alone in the gym, etc etc... But he kept replying the opposite saying he'd chat to me and how we'll shower together... NO!

I went to workout the other day and saw him in the workout area, and quickly left... OMG, I couldn't handle it I knew he'd talk to me...

Then tonight I went and saw him briefly, we made eye contact... But he left right after.

He messaged me on Grindr and said he saw me... I said I saw him too... 

It's pretty inevitable i'm going to have to eventually speak to him when he comes up to me and I need to be honest... I've tried being honest to him on Grindr and giving the vibe i'm not interested... Shit, tonight I even straight up told him to ""look for someone else"" and that ""I just want to go to the gym to workout""... Well he's sent a string of 18 messages telling me to send more pics to see if i'm his type (despite me saying i'm not interested anymore) and that he's looking for friends and wants to get drinks sometime... Fuck, I don't know what to do... I feel for the guy because he's new here and is probably looking to make friends, but I really am not interested... I'm an asshole I know... But i've been honest to him and it seems like he won't take no for an answer. He keeps giving mixed signals... He sends cock pics but then says he's not looking for fun either... 

So again it's my fault for getting into this situation, now I need to figure out how to get out... I can't keep avoiding him at the gym and he goes for hours at a time... So it's inevitable i'll run into him a few times... Tomorrow i'm even driving 25 minutes out of my way to go to a different gym in the same chain just so that he won't be there to make me feel awkward and ruin my workout... 

So what should I do? Keep being honest and hope he finally takes the hint? I'm in a bit of a predicament. Thanks guys!

**TL;DR chatted with guy from grindr, turns out he's a new arrival to my area and goes to my gym. Wants to befriend me and potentially hook up but I don't want either with him. Been honest but it hasn't worked, trying to figure out how to back out.**",29Jan2017,2
102,"Hello everyone, I have made a couple of posts on here and gotten some good advice, but I still don't know what to do. I am guessing you are wondering what my dilemma is, and I will tell you now. So I currently am a freshman at ""school a"" and I am looking to transfer to another school, ""school b"". school b is a bigger school which is something i really want. The school I currently go to is small and not in the area I want to live for the rest of my life. School b one the other hand is. Well at least in the same state. 

Reasons I want to transfer:School a has a good program, but I feel I would get much more exposure and experience at school b, as I feel there is more classes that i am interested in there for my degree. Another is that I live in an apartment off campus and I am looking for that college life, at least for one year. I sit in my apartment, go to class, get home, go to work, repeat. Every single day, and I am just sick of it. I want to change it up. I also want to work if I transfer, but I want to have more of a social life. 

Reasons I want to stay: I have a contract with my braces (I got them on in 8th grade, and will be on my 5th year in march. I am getting frustrated with them) that ends in December, but I am hoping I can get them off in July. Also, I like the area I am living in, not much for 18 year old me to do, but 21 year old me would have a lot of fun, I can tell you that much. 

I know this doesn't give you much too go off of, but I am just not sure what to do. I really want to go to school b, but I keep thinking, what if I don't like it? What if it is terrible and what if school a was the right place for me to go. Thank you for helping, and if you have anything I could consider, please let me know. ",29Jan2017,1

105,"I'm 16 years old only, and I know that a ton of this is gonna be very childish, but I just don't know how to cope with it. I have felt super inadequate since I was about 8 . I was never someone's ""best friend"" I was the child my mom wished she never had(overheard a conversation when I was 10 where she admitted it) and all my siblings just turn away from me, don't take me seriously. I've in a sense, always been the ""leftovers"" or a third wheel, and anything of that sort.

Recently(known for past 6 months or so), I have made a really great online friend and being that she's an online friend, I managed to tell her a lot of what I feel behind the barrier that is the internet. However, I got carried away and got really, really close to her, and whilst she has assured me that we are very close, I feel that she says that only to make me feel better. Back when we first talked, we would talk deeply and for hours. However, nowadays she responds in short bursts of one or two words and responds very late. This would be normal of course, maybe she's busy... If not for the fact that without fail, every time that one friend of ours(I'll call him B) logs on, she's suddenly always up to talk. Never stops talking to B, and whenever we talk alone, she always talks about B. I wouldn't mind this, she's made a closer friend, if not for the fact that she's constantly reminding me that I'm her best friend, and that she only talks to B, because B is hard to talk to. Whenever it's us three, I'm always ignored, and whenever I come close to ignoring her, she confronts me about it. I don't know is how to go forward with this. I feel a lot like a third wheel, and I kills me every time that she goes on to talk to B, simply because she just puts so much more effort into it. Any thoughts Reddit? Should I leave it the way it is? Or am I just overthinking it? Jealous?

107,"Hello! This is my first time posting something like this on reddit and wasn't sure where to post it. Also I seek forgiveness for the long post below.

So let me start by telling you about myaelf before I tell you what happened. I am a grad student at a university in the US. I also work part-time at a local gas-station for a little pocket money during my free time. I make about 100-200$ weekly depending on how many hours I'm willing to work. I have been doing this part-time mainly because I didn't want to ask my dad for money for every little thing and getting a job oncampus seemed highly competitive and unlikely at the moment. The part-time honestly sucks and the guy keeps demanding me to work whenever I can. This was getting stressful due to which I told him I could just work for about 10-15 hrs a week. Does not seem likely as I don't have a fixed schedule from him yet. This led me to do what I did and will help probably help you understand.

So coming to what happened, I was intimidated by a guy claiming to be my alumni last month. Well he found me on the college whatsapp group and was telling me about the University before I joined here. So I assumed he was just a kind senior helping out.
Coming to what happened last night, he calls me up and says he was in town and wanted to meet. I was free and agreed to meet him , so here he gets talking about how he is looking for students like me for doing some business to earn money. He said it'd be like a business internship where they'd teach me what it waa and how it'd work. I was skeptical as I'm not a business student and hardly know anything about it, he noticed that and reassured me that he was of the same kind and his senior helped him out.
Upon talking, he told me working at gas-stations is risky and the money you earn is little compared to what he has to offer. 

So I asked him what sort of business was he talking about, he tells me of this business model where I've got to purchase something and sell it myself and keep the profit. Here he brings in one more of his member, they tell me more about this business and tell that they are from Amway. They told me that it is very simple once I learn it and get into it, here they ask me for my information including my debit card details so that they can register me into their program (Red herring; I should have stopped here). But they convince me, ( I have to tell you these guys were professionals at what they do, they were the most polite people you'd meet and everything they said seemed too positive and too good to be true).
Now after coming back home i was charged $180 for registering into the amway network. Now I'm already an idiot for giving them my details, I call up a few friends and ask them if they were approached too, they told me all about the business and how it works  and I realized that I was hooked into a large pyramid scheme which I absolutely don't want to get into. 

I feel like I've been cheated as I lost all the earnings i made the last week for a single.meeting. I know i'm mostly at fault here for not doing anything after recognising the signs.I just wish somehow i could have been aware of such things before they happened. But now I can't sleep and feel like quitting my part-time too as I'm sick and tired of trying to make money.I just feel like concentrating on studying. I am going to get my card blocked asap and request for a new one now.

Any advice and questions are requested.

Tl;dr: Looked for better prospects and lost money on something I dont really want to do. Feel like quitting.

1. I finally graduated with a degree in nursing, don't have much of an interest in nursing as a job and feel stuck in now having to work a nursing job soon (that is if i can even get one).

2. I barely any work history, which i only have myself to blame for.

3. Living at home, moving out once i get full time work which will then force me to rely on a job I might not be into just to survive, this is not something I ever dreamed my life to be and I want more from life now rather than later.

4. Painfully lonely, I haven't had friends in years cause i have pretty much spent most of my waking hours on the computer and avoiding people for the longest time, in fact the only person i only ever really talk to is my mom, in my mind I just don't seem to get alone with anyone else and don't know how to change this to make genuine friends. Last thing i want to be is to be considered a ""momma's boy"" but i guess that's what i've become.

5.

6. I've never had a girlfriend and I'm still a virgin and I can't stand it, I don't consider myself all that ugly but I feel like noone will ever want me or that the person I end up with will just be out of convenience - them being the only one to show interest in me, it sucks cause that's something that dominated a lot of my thoughts when I was younger and cause it hasn't happened yet it still continues to, can't even look at porn now without getting frustrated that I'm missing out.

7. I have chronic issues with anxiety, especially around people, i struggle even making phone calls and doing things as simple as going for a run outside cause of what strangers might think of me and driving is a nightmare for me so i also have avoided that, i know it's pathetic and i hate it but the feeling of anxiousness is just there and i can't escape it even with deep breathing exercises.

8. My mood feels like it's getting even worse now, i don't want this to be a wasted year, i don't want my 20's to be over and have been completely wasted but at this point i feel like my entire life has been wasted and that I've missed out on so much already.

129,"I am currently in a long distance relationship. Have been for, about three months. Before that, we were together, in person, for three months straight. So it's not like an online thing where we've never met. 

A couple weeks ago, and before that, I got very bored, and used tinder. Usually I would use it for a day, have fun swiping, then feel guilty, and delete it. I did this multiple times and couldn't resist the thrill/addictive appeal of swiping and easy fast companionship.

Recently I made a couple matches and even exchanged numbers, and now my guilt is pretty much all-consuming and I feel like I potentially destroyed a relationship with a girl I care about very much.

Context: 

I do not have many friends, read: no friends. Literally, I have pretty much two people I text and communicate with, my girlfriend, and my xbox friend who I met before but lives a state away. 

At the time, I was unemployed, so very bored, and isolated. This is no excuse, but to give you some context that I was craving social interaction that I wasn't getting in life. That is very hard to deal with and related to my depression and social anxiety.

I felt like I was texting my girlfriend way too much for company and becoming ""needy"" - and I wanted to have other people to talk to and text on my phone so I wasn't constantly hitting her up to fill the voids in my life.

There's a certain ""rush"" or dopamine hit that comes from texting people and I got tired of not having anything on my phone to give me that ""hit""

Subconsciously I guess I was seeing what else is out there that would be achievable and not long distance. I didn't really have any intentions to cheat in the truest sense of the word - meaning hook up or go on a date. I was kinda seeking companionship and someone to talk to - while simultaneously being curious in what type of girls I would be able to be with off of there. 

I want to tell her and be upfront about it, because my guilt has gotten the best of me. I feel absolutely terrible and haven't used tinder in weeks and definitely have a resolve now not to, ever again. I want to tell her to clear the air, and my conscious, and work it out. Because I want to marry this girl one day (I think) - and I don't want this to be in the back of my mind when we do. 

But I'm afraid she will only view this as me wanting someone else and not her. And not understand fully the context that part of it (a large part) was from boredom - not boredom with her but just life in general. And I had a quick easy, cheap, fix available on my phone with just a couple taps and swipes. And I used it. Again, there is pretty much zero chance I would have met with someone.

I know I wouldn't cheat on her physically or date around while with her because I had the opportunity to sleep with a girl before present itself. An attractive female, and it would been very easy to have cheated then as this was an airbnb host who made very obvious advances toward me. 

But I didn't. Because I love my girlfriend. But I used tinder.

What do I do? How do I tell her? Or do I not? 

Any questions or clarification feel free. I don't mean to justify my actions with boredom/loneliness/anxiety/depression - but I have done a lot of soul searching and those are very much parts of the reasons I used it. I am not denying the other part of me that was curious what's out there for me and likes to flirt. But I also know I would never cheat by going on a date or hooking up - but I do view what I did as cheating, just a milder form. It's made me never want to do it again, at ALL, and I've definitely learned from the experience via my guilt.",29Jan2017,0

I know one foreign language, which is just English. I'm learning another, but I'm a beginner. I'm not a monster, but I don't care much about my appearance and thus I look like just average nerd, save my fancy yet neglected hair.
Sometimes I think that I am awesome and I should just keep doing on whatever I'm doing, because there are tons of people I see as worse than me (I mean I just wouldn't want to be them) and sometimes things obvious for me are unattainable for them, still there are masses above me and if I reached a little higher I could achieve a lot. But on the other hand I feel this is an infinite ladder and no matter how many steps I take, I can take much more, so I should just find an middle-class comfort zone and settle in. What do you think?

And unless I turn my major into a passion I won't be able to go abroad for Master's degree, which would be really nice considering my plans to move in a few years.

I am a 27 year old Canadian male who has managed to strand myself in Bournemouth England (long story). I have no money, no working visa, and desperately need to find a way back to Canada. I haven't been able to eat, and my health is starting to dwindle. 

I am open to any suggestions.

It's been suggested that it's possible to get passage on a shipping freighter across the ocean, I am just unsure as to how to arrange such a journey.

Please help.

Thank you,

137,"So I'm 24, getting married in march, and working full time. I've just failed out of my 4th college and I don't know what to do next. I enjoy the job I have now, it pays bills and I love my bosses, but I don't wanna do it forever. They say find something you love and make a career of it, but all of my passions are creative based things that I either need a degree for or I'd have to be discovered. I'm a musician and a pretty good one, but to make a career I'd have to get lucky and discovered. I love writing and would love to be an author or screenwriter, but again I'd need luck or school. Lastly I was in school for game design and I'm sure I could figure the rest out on my own, but if I want to be truly successful in any of these I'd have to pick a priority and become great in it while still balancing my 50 hour work week and family life.

142,"  This sounds petty but I'm honestly about to fucking lose my shit. I have three younger sisters, and my problem is mostly with my first younger sister, who is fourteen. I'm seventeen and struggle with anxiety and depression (that's going to play into this). My sister wears clothes size large or 12/14 (UK), but she constantly takes my clothes which are small/medium or 8/10. Any time I get angry that she's taken them-often out of my wardrobe- my parents act like I'm being selfish or stupid. And christ for fucking bid I point out that my clothes don't fit her. Then I'm the bitch in the situation. And she often goes in my room and takes things like headphones, my gaming consoles, expensive perfume and lotion and makeup, jewelry, art supplies, books, you name it. No matter how ducking hard I try to hide this shit, she goes through my entire room looking for them. I even have problems with her taking my fucking bras and underwear. Ofte when i finally get her to give things back theybre either all used up or broken. I 've tried telling my parents, but they won't listen. And I'm not allowed to have ANYTHING with a lock on it because I ""shouldn't need one if I have nothing to hide"". Great, dandy, whatever. Issue with that is, she takes things that she knows I fucking need.  On multiple occasions, I've gotten into trouble at school or not had something I needed because she's taken it. I have to constantly worry and check and check and check again to make sure things are still there. She once went through my dresser and found my diary. Any normal person would have just fucking left it alone, but you know what this cunt does? She takes it to school with her and reads it with her friends. I keep things in there because my therapist says to write them down so that I can better assess and deal with them later in my own private time. Which doesn't fucking exist anymore. I get in trouble when I go into her room and take my things back, but little to nothing is said when she's taken them in the first place. Not to mention she takes food and shit from our pantry and my parents, along with sweets from mine and my sisters stashes, and usually we'll all get into trouble for it. I'm honestly beginning to hate her and resent my parents for not listening to me. My littlest two sisters are offenders too, but she's by far the worst. Am I just being ridiculous? What do I do? I can't just move out yet. But this is to the point where it's making everything a pain to do, and I have no privacy in my own bedroom.",29Jan2017,13

155,"Hello everyone. I have to give some background: I am a 19 yo undergraduate working on my AS for pre-engineering. I'm an ex Mormon living and attending school in Provo Utah. I graduated highschool early and left home to attend college at 17 as my home relationships had become strained due to my falling out from the church. 

Things were difficult when I first started school. I had a hard time fitting in here and found it difficult to completely move on from various events that took place while still at home. I have tried my best to suppress these feelings and simply stay occupied with my academics and over the past 2 years I've, for the most part, been able to do so with only a few breakdowns along the way. Now I'm finding it harder to keep moving unperturbed. I'm noticing a decline in my academics and ability to stay focused and motivated. I've become apathetic to just about everything. I have no motivation to date or maintain the few relationships that I've established. My routines have absolutely crumbled and I constantly find myself stating at the wall and sulking. I don't have anyone with whom I feel comfortable enough to talk to about my dilemmas but I'm apprehensive about seeking out councilling. I'm afraid that giving attention to the problems will only validate them and distract further but af the same time I feel as though my mental health is in real decline which is very scary. I'm beginning to feel like a stranger to myself. 

My question is, if I were to seek out councilling what sort of help could be offered to me in my situation and what's the likelihood of it actually helping?  

The fact that I'm asking the internet for advice is evidence of my concern. I'd really appreciate it if people respond with thoughtful and founded advice. I'd also really love to hear from actual psychologists if they happen upon this post. Thank you. ",29Jan2017,2

I've come to realize that I don't need any profound solutions or magical life-changing advice. I just would like comfort and affection. I have good friends who would be receptive of me bluntly asking for things like that, but... I don't like doing it. It feels a little weird.

Do I have to be blunt about it, or is there another way I could seek out comfort from my friends? Or maybe... is there I way I can word everything just once and tell them that I'm at a point in my life right now where I'd just like a little extra affection and comfort, and not have to bluntly ask whenever I'm feeling upset?

I know that I mean the world to her and we're always texting when I'm not busy at work or training. Obviously the distance has somewhat affected us; not being able to see each other regularly hurt at first but I feel like the distance has only strengthened our connection. So here we finally come to the fork in the road, and some things I feel the need to mention. So after I came home on a four day pass I got the impulse to buy an engraftment ring, for better or worse I acted on the fancy of buying one.

I made terrible decisions and messed around with some chicks at a party while I was intoxicated and the whole thing was pretty messy for a while.

I care about her more and more each day, but I can't help but feel like I don't want to be with her anymore. She's my best friend and my girlfriend but I just want to experience more. Im so young it seems too early to settle down with someone and have a family. Especially if I'm not 100% sure they're the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. She's amazing and I care about her very much, I don't want to crush her world, but I don't ever say anything. I know it sounds stupid, but whenever I date someone I always say it's not over until they say it is. So now I'm somewhat stuck. We want kids and a family the both of us, but I can't be trapped in a marriage I'm unsure about and especially with kids. I grew up with a single mom, so if I'm getting married and having kids I would never leave. My worst fear is to have a family and loose them.

Having international experiences is a very crucial step to getting started in the work field. Here is my motivational letter, hope someone can correct it or give his/her opinion on it. 

By the way, does anybody have a site where I can rent places for normal prices with furniture and not looking crap. And a good site where I can find internships?



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to explore whether an opportunity might exist to join the internships program at the University of [Name University], England. The implied program would be the eight months’ internship starting in September 2017 until April 2018. My ambition to apply for the IT Network progamm is driven by the increasing importance of digital technology in a hyper-connected world. I strongly believe when given the opportunity to join the intense program the university offers, I will be able to gain an extensive knowledge base in the IT-field and enhance my English which is needed in this globalized world where borders are fading by technological advancements.

I am [My Name], I am in my final year of my studies Media Technology at the Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, in The Netherlands.  During my studies I have had the pleasure to gain knowledge in the area of IT networking, IT security, server management, documentation and communication. These fields have been subjected to a lot of changes over the past years, which have given me the ability to tune very quickly into new challenges and adapt quickly to new surroundings and situations. I feel comfortable working both within a team environment as on individually basis. My focus is an international environment with several IT related projects. The program offered via this internship gives a perfect opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge in addition to the theoretical knowledge I will be gaining and already obtained during my studies. 

My ambition is to work in an environment that fuses together different perspectives to develop integrated solutions. Hence, the program the University of [Name University] offers would help me obtain various methods and creative techniques to better the IT-field. Finally, and maybe most importantly, I can see myself delivering significant value and results because of my commitment to achieve both personal as professional improvements which I will be doing with great perseverance 

Currently, the requirements for a successful completion of my internship would imply that I have to work every workday (Monday until Friday) and I would be needing a suitable working place at the University with a supervisor.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the possibility of entering the Internship program and look forward to hearing from you. Attached you will find my Curriculum Vitae for your viewing.

Yours faithfully,
[My Name],

169,"So the thing is, I know this guy, we've been friends for almost ten years, and recently he's become delusional. Throughout the past week he kept telling me how he's the most intelligent man in the world and everyone is an idiot but him (""and maybe [me] and a few other people"") and a few weeks past he told me that one day he will be the ruler of this world and he showed me his completely nonsense plan to do so. Now he thinks he is some sort of a genius philosopher. He's also extremely insecure and paranoid. If it takes me more than an hour to reply to his texts he starts desperately calling me because he thinks I don't want to be his friend anymore. He's also very short-tempered(though he's 100% harmless, he wouldn't hurt a fly), and sometimes has outbursts when he tells me I'm a fake person and I'm not a real friend even if I'm probably the only person who keeps listening to his gibberish. So the point is, obviously there's something wrong with him(even though he strongly believes he's perfectly fine), and I want to advice him to seek professional help, but I have no idea how to tell him. Since he's so insecure, if I don't deliver this the right way, he will end up never talking to me again.

So I've been living with myself since 18 years old (I'm 24 now). My mom and my family kind of pushed me by guilt tripping me into living back with my mom. (Ex: ""Don't you feel sorry that your mom is old and she's living alone? You're her only daughter."") The choice was either I move to her city (which I know nothing about and have no friends there) or she move here (which I also don't like) because:

a) I can barely finance myself here, what if we both end up homeless here? My mom already have an ok job in her place. Not sure if she can get a better one in my city and I would still need to be able to provide for us both here in case she doesn't get a job;

b) We have so many disagreements. The way we think is different, the way we see and handle things is different--in other words I can't stand her.

I bet my whole family is thinking I'm a mean, unthankful daughter for 'ditching' my mom--I can't help it, I'm too scared to live with her. I don't wanna hear her judgments and disapproval about my life choices, critics about my body, especially about what I do for life--which is what always come up everytime we met or talked on phone. We can barely get along on short term, how are we supposed to live together?

I have a law degree but instead of making use to that degree I chose to be a teacher because my heart is on it. She (and her whole family) thinks that I'm a failure that I'm wasting my life. I tried working in that field and it killed me, so I went back teaching.

I was in advanced art all through school and won all of the art awards at all the school assemblies. I have a BFA from an amazing university and the ability to work in several mediums. (I know I sound like a huge douche, this is not to brag, just giving context that art. Is. My. Life. It's all I have ever been good at. It's all I have ever had.) I currently work at a job where I get to use my skills every day and it's celebrated and encouraged. I'm so lucky that I get to to what I love but that kind of art isn't MY art. 

I'm having a really hard time producing anything on my own. I always have an excuse as to why I can't do it (my studio is messy, my hands hurt, I don't have time, I don't want to clean everything up after, I don't know what to make, etc.). On top of that, on the rare occasion I do actually sit down to try to create something it feels forced or fake and about 90% of the time I never finish it.

I feel pressure from myself and others that I'm not using this ability that has been given to me. My friends and family do their very best to motivate me but it almost makes me push it away even more (the other side to that is that I would be devastated if they stopped trying, I need it in my life, whether it's working at the time or not). I also feel pressure from thinking I'm not good enough and I don't have anything special to offer, I'm kind of all over the place with different mediums and once I use one for a while I lose interest and add it to the list of things I feel guilty for not doing. I don't care if people buy anything from me. I still can't even produce things for myself. 

I have friends who create all day every day and it makes me feel inadequate and like shit because I've worked my whole life for what? Excuse after excuse or bouts of severe procrastination? It's fucking killing me.

179,"To give you a little background. My sister and I have been having the same kind of conflicts recently. My sister is one of those people that is very passive aggressive. Instead of talking about her problems she is having with me, she will let me know how irritated she is with me in other ways. For example, she likes to throw me under the bus alot. We could be talking about anything and she will find a way to make fun of me one way or another. Sometimes my sister likes to just pick at me for no reason. She will start conflicts with me and when I react she starts crying and calling me a bully. I tell her that the only reason I ever say anything rude to her, is when she starts fights with me on purpose. My sister tells me that she does not like when I call her names when we argue, so I told her that she does the same to me. She just shrugs her head at me and keeps trying to blame me for everything. I am one of those people that likes to apologize. If I am wrong for something I give a genuine apology. My parents have taught me this since I was young, and I try to be as self reflecting as possible. My sister is a polar opposite, she doesn't like when she is told she is doing something wrong. Whenever my parents try to correct her about something, she will start to get hyperdefensive and begins to scream/cry at people. She has a very hard time at admitting when she is wrong which is very frustrating. I can't keep apologizing all the time and never get anything back. Even when I do apologize and she does not, she will say my apologies mean nothing and that I'll do the behavior again. She has promised in the past that she would not pick at me anymore, which she has not kept. Now I love my sister very much, and normally things between her and I are ok, but the only time we fight is when she starts to pick at me. It has gotten worse over time and it seems like nothing will be fixed. I would just like any sort of advice anyone has on the matter, because it seems like my sister is too stubborn to admit when she is wrong and will not try to change her behavior. My mom and I are not passive agressive and either is my father, the only one that is like this in my family is my sister, and it causes a ton of problems. I am made to seem like the bad guy, because her crying deflects the attention away from her behavior and brings the attention over to mine. Just because I do not cry over arguments, does not mean I don't have feelings. Thank you again for any advice on the matter, sorry this was so long of a background.

180,"I've been reading a few reddit posts about the subject, and I feel like none apply to me and my SO. So allow me to describe the situation. My GF and I always argue about grinding. She claims that she wouldn't grind on strangers during a relationship, but she's ok with grinding on her friends even during a relationship because she trusts them enough to not be sexual about it, rather silly, almost satirical. She claims that it's alright for me to grind on another friend as long as I maintain no sexual desire. My standpoint is the opposite, of course, I think that just because her intended grinding is not sexual doesn't mean that it isn't visually sexual. I'm simply not ok with other guys or girls touching the more intimate parts of my partner in any way shape or form no matter the intention, and I've told her that if she decides to grind with her friends, she'd be disrespecting my boundaries. She would then say that I'm disrespecting her boundaries by not allowing her to be herself with her friends, that I wouldn't be accepting her for who she was. This is probably a good reason to break up, but I don't really want to at least not over something as silly as grinding, especially when she does have a point about her not taking it sexually and thus remaining faithful. It is probably me, being overly jealous which isn't a good thing either. I guess I need some evaluation on the situation... I need some advice. Is there anything we can do to compromise this? Is there anyway that we can both get what we want?  Neither of us want to break up, but we're both very stubborn in this position. I suppose if you guys think breaking up is the solution, I'd like to hear why as well. Also, just FYI: we are doing a long distance relationship. Sorry for the bulk of text!

Edit: Reading the post out loud kind of made it seem like I'm the only one that cares and I made her look like the heartless one in a way. That's not true at all. She does care a whole lot about me as I do with her. She doesn't want to upset me but she also doesn't want to change who she is.

181,"I come from a pretty small town where everybody knows everybody. I have known everyone that I go to school with since kindergarten. I have always been the shy girl. Every time I do something slightly out of the ordinary for me, people make a huge deal out it. For example, if I were to dress up nice one day or if I spoke up in class, everyone would say ""Whoa! She actually speaks!"" It actually causes me to want to talk even less. I don't go to school dances because if I started to dance and have fun everyone would look at me super weird and I would just be awkward. I feel like the only way to shake this image is to just wait until I go to college and start over fresh. I still have 2 more years of high school, however, and I really want to make friends and have fun. Any advice?",29Jan2017,3
182,"This girl that I like is on a vary serious volleyball team that has a qualification tournament on the weekend of prom so she can't go. She told me that it made her very upset and that she cried about it. I'm upset too for her. 

So I got to thinking last night. What if I made my own prom for her? Just her and me, some music, and a night of dancing and fun. I want to do something special to make up for her absence. Is that something that I could plan or what? Obviously, it's not going to be huge like the full prom but what I want it to be meaningful to her. 

Is this something that a girl would want to be surprised about? Is this weird? I haven't told anyone yet but how could her friends and mine work together to make this happen? 

I'm not sure where to start or how to go about this.

tl;dr She can't make it to prom so I want to have my own prom.

186,"Hi, stopped longtime lurking on Reddit to seek a little advice, Im in Vancouver BC - I brought some replacement headphone earpads from their Website in the middle of November. By Dec, I assumed the delay was Christmas postal delays. The Tracking link stopped showing any updated actions on the 6th Dec, and has recently become a dead link . I have repeatedly written, politely ( I am Canadian after all!) - and while it is pretty clear the item is lost, Brainwavz are not being particularly helpful, and essentially fob me off. 
The last reply from them was in response for me requesting a refund, as this has been going on for 2 long - this is the reply -----

I am extremely sorry you feel this way.
Unfortunately we can re ship or refund the order only after we receive the return Or if the parcel is confirmed as lost.
We will keep following up with our shipping partner for updates and keep you informed.
Thanks
------------------
As this has gone on so long, my option to reverse payment through Paypal has expired, I have written to them to see if it is possible, at this stage, but not heard as yet. But Im wondering about the legality? - and are parcels 'confirmed as lost' ? Ive not heard of this  - This seems a very non committal response, just meant to encourage me to walk away, and leave it. 
Already this is a lot of aggro for a $30 item, but unusual to run into such arrogant disregard, so I want to resolve this as simply as possible, while letting Brainwavz know Ill consider any alternative to avoid using or recommending them in the future. 
I can not say, if their Headphone pads are any good, as Ive never received any, but, I can say, Id strongly recommend avoiding the company based on this - 
Any advice is very welcome- lurker out! :)

191,"I received an offer in Business management for uni. Im a young person, that just finished college(uk term for highschool).I applied to this course:
1)As a stepping stone to a marketing career?(Which I'm not as interested as before)
2)Secure layback in case things didn't turn out as I want to
3)Career base or foundation from which to develop my career.

Advantages: This offer would be great for my personal development as an adult. It would also enable me to temporarily disassociate with my religion for me to discover other beliefs or lifestyle. Management itself would benefit me on a daily life and also if I want to establish a business at some point.

Reasons not to: I'm not specialized in anything. I do have normal base with my high school qualifications. But I believe this degree would be useful for someone who already has a skill or trade and wants to convert it into a business. Or someone who wants to manage employment. 
My desire to move out and be independent has great influence in me taking this course. But I think it be a waste to ""have fun for 3 years"" end up with debt, no guarantee of job and not sure if I will enjoy what I will do.

This is a lifetime decision. I want to be sure I'm taking the right steps and not repeating history of others.

192,"Hey everyone! Hope your day is going good! Brief story of what is going down in my life: 

I'm 25 was going to school, had a good connection with my family, had friends, girlfriend had money. I was living ""the dream."" Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago. I had just gotten out of a rebound relationship and was meeting another girl at her house. We were going to go to a hot springs for the weekend and really heal from everything. Only thing is, i accedenlty stepped on and killed her hamster, so yea that didn't work out so well, regardless because of that incident I didn't go to the hot springs and somehow by chance, met my cousin who I Had not seen in years.

I guess some background at this point would be good, I never knew my father. I've never met him before, my mom doesn't really tell me about him. I grew up just my mom and nana my granddad died when I was younger. Anyways so yea,

My cousin fills me in on some stuff that my mom kept from me about my dad who apparently was looking for me but my mom was cray and ditched out west. 

My mom told me completely different stories and when I heard this stuff form my cousin everything clicked, all these repressed memories of what my mom did to me as a kid started to come up and float in my head and I realized I had to get away. I called my mom about these things and she denied and hasn't really reached out to me about these topics at all. 

After all of this went down, my life was completely shaken up. I didn't know what to do. The only connection I had was my cousins mom, so I flew to the city she was in and tracked her down and got more information which did confirm a lot of stuff. I could go on and on about this, like I was a really troubled kid but now I know it wasn't my fault. 

I'm waiting on an inheritance from my nana who passed away, the only thing is the family is accusing my mom of stealing money from Nana it's a whole huge mess. Anyways here is where I need advice

I dropped out of school for this term as there was no way I could deal with knowing my whole childhood I was manipulated, lied too, emotionally and sexually abused by my own mother. I spent my savings figuring out the truth, my rent is due in like 3 days. I have no money, no food, I go to the food bank tomorrow. I just don't know what I can do. 

On top of this all my friends have decided to turn their backs on me during this time when I need them the most. 

On the brightside, I am finally able to start to become myself cause I realize there was a huge history of problems that were not my fault. I can recognize them completely, I am moving city's next month where I will be able get a job and get away from all of this trauma and my past and start fresh. I feel amazing and I'm grwatful. I just need some help with what I can do to not go homeless ",29Jan2017,4
193,"Hello! I made a throwaway for this just in case. 

So me and my best friend decided to move in with an acquaintance about 6 months ago. It is the three of us in this apartment sharing just the kitchen and living room. We're all students and all girls. 

One of my roommates bought one of [these](http://alphamom.com/legacy/bossy/Picture%20293.png) to clean her dishes when we first moved in. We don't have a dishwasher, so we clean everything by hand. I had bought a bulk thing of scrub daddies already, so I use those and change them out about once every 3 weeks or so (they get dirty quickly when you do dishes ~2x a day). My best friend (the other roommate) also uses my scrub daddy. 

So my roommate has been using her same brush-sponge to clean our shared dishes the entire 6 months. It now looks like if you used a toothbrush to scrub the bathroom tile really hard. We share pots, pans, plates, cups, etc., so this is really concerning to me. I have to admit I am a little bit of a clean freak when it comes to the kitchen, but I wouldn't mind if she used my sponge as well because I switch it out so frequently. 

I know the most adult thing to do is to talk to her about it. She is actually a really great roommate besides this and she always cleans up after herself. I am actually shocked because she seems like the last person to do this. However, I don't know her well at all. She keeps to herself and I rarely ever see her. I don't feel comfortable texting her about this or leaving a passive-aggressive note. I don't have a problem with buying her a new brush-sponge thing. 

What I need advice on is how to go about replacing her sponge. I don't think it's right to just replace it and hope she doesn't notice. Do I make up a story about how I accidentally ruined it so I replaced it? If so... how do you reasonably explain how you ruined a sponge? Am I being unreasonable? My other roommate agrees that this is getting gross and we need to do something about it. I just need some outside suggestions here.

Thank you for the advice!",29Jan2017,1

The coffee shop is incredibly busy usually and when I came back I handed her the change with the receipt. She turns around and tells me she handed me £50, not £30 to which I obviously told her she was wrong. She can be quite nasty and blunt and told me  she 100% gave me £50 and even wrote it down on a piece of paper showing it to me. Customers are all looking round at me as well as the rest of the staff after she's effectively implied I'd stolen it in so many words. She in not nice way takes the till to do a cash up to see (where the cash was taken from to see if it was down by £20), comes back and realizes she was totally wrong and had indeed only handed me £30 but doesn't apologize and just yes, it was £30. 

On top of that, she complained I got 2 pint milks instead of 4 pints as she hadn't given me enough money and because we're a fairtrade organic coffee shop they all need to be organic and complained I should have just got the 4 pint cheap stuff and somebody else will to go back even though I clarified with her I would get organic before going.

She had threatened to beat her and her boyfriend up over the phone yesterday (which is legitimate because they live walking distance away from each other). It didn't happen after my two older brothers talked her out of it.

Then this morning, my sister's (the one being terrorized) car tire has been deflated. We won't be entirely sure if someone deliberately did it or it was just a random needle until we drive it to a mechanic

Either way, my older sister (the Terrorizer) has been envious of my other older sister for years. She (the Terrorizer) has seen been hateful to me and her because we are adopted, and she believes we owe her something because her biological parents raised and us and cared for us.Not to mention we have become more successful in our careers and social life.She (terrorizer) has just got her car repoed, and my gut feeling is that she is set to go down a downward spiral.

I believe my sister (victim) is in danger because of this, but there is no evidence to call the police to have my sister (terrorizer) detained. What should I do?

He has a very bad life while on the other end of the spectrum mine is a lot nicer and more straight forward. He has a or had a girlfriend that I had met in real life a few times and we started talking just about random things. While I was talking to her the entire time they were fighting and it was causing a lot of trouble. Somewhere around this time is when my best friend stopped talking to me. So skipping ahead a bit his girlfriend ends up starting to like me and when he figures this out he blames me for ruining his entire life. He wanted me to stop talking to all of the friends I met through him, I didn't.

201,"So, I am staying at homeless shelter for elderly and vets, and there's a computer room that the residents can use. I am an aspiring musician, and I often come here to do some research personally for my self development as a person and for my music. Due to being a broke ass bitch, I don't have money for headphones at the moment. So, I have to listen to my music off the CPU's built in speakers, which can carry a little bit if it's relatively quiet but not by any means clear or boisterous and I always try to keep it at about half for the sake of others. Not loud enough to put vocals down or anything but enough to catch the gist of track and get my creative juices going. But, there's this guy who for all intensive purposes call him Tom.
Every time Tom walks into the computer, I sigh a breath of impending aggrevation to myself. He has an affinity to only use one computer (Background Info. Digression: the shelter is pretty run down, but in comparison to the other options in town its the ""Taj Mahal"" of homeless shelters), anyway, the computer room has bedbugs. (Some Taj Mahal, js.) I know someone has seen the a bed bug in the chair on the left side of the two man station where the computers are situated.
So Tom tends to lean toward the left side of the computer station. {Which seems ridiculous to me, since the bedbugs are just going to stay to one side of the room when the whole shelter has them}. If someone happens to be on the right side of the station when I arrive, and leaves before Tom does, or right as Tom does. Her will wait, and for me to get off the right side of the computer even though there is a completely and equally infested computer right across from me. He tells me that he saves his files on the computer on the right side. But the computers are wiped daily at two in the morning. (shelter doesn't want people saving on the computers). So I doubt that is the reason. In any event he argues that for some inexplicable reason it saves his files on this computer.
But the real kicker is that he plugs his LOUD speaker to the CPU, and blasts his music or listens to news and conspiracy theories for HOURS at a time with no consideration of anyone else at all. If I turn the computer up to a 100 percent I can't even hear my music, and if I could it's a conflict of ODDISEE and Issa Gold from my side and Stevie Wonder and The Whispers and various country artists and Alex Jones that swell into this ear bleeding cacophony of soulful hell.
I can't get any work done with this, and unfortunately I don't have an ID (lost my wallet) so I can't just escape and go to the library to escape. No phone either. Life is pretty ass atm, but I know it will pick up again. But, what I don't know is the bigger asshole in this situation? Him or I? Should I ask him to turn it down? He's a pretty bitter, admittedly negative, and just overall surly. I feel like he's just seeking attention, and if I ask him to turn it turn he's just getting the attention he wants (negative or positive). I don't know. Reddit, help a brother out please ?? Who gets the asshole of the day award out of us? And more importantly, what do I do about it ?
Sorry for the long post, I didn't think it would get this deep tbh.
Appreciate you guys\gals who decide to answer.
TL;DR: I play music off the CPU's relatively quiet speaker so I can write music. Tom comes to a shared computer space\personal shelter library and blasts Alex Jones and Lenny Kravitz (currently), until I have a headache. Who's the asshole? And what to do about?",29Jan2017,1

When I graduated high school, I went to college for Computer Engineering. Since I took college classes in high school, the first semester of actual college should have been my only semester of general education classes. Throughout the semester, I realized that I wanted to go into computer science because it fit me more. I transferred schools because the current school did not have computer science. I just learned that instead of this semester being my last of general education courses, I have to take 1 year worth of them before I actually get into Computer science. I have 45 credit hours and because of the schools arts and science program, I have to take extra general education classes and it's currently draining me and costing more money than I thought. I was recently told about online school. I've taken online classes before and I know I could do it. Also it's cheaper so that would help. However do employers not think highly toward online degrees?

I rent my home and my landlords would not allow a big dog here. I have tried all the shelters in and around my area and they are all full. I have contacted a few rescue groups with no response. I have a craiglist post and subreddit post for my area with no responses.

208,"Adults of reddit, no one takes teens seriously. And I feel like schools treat us unfairly. I don't know if all US schools are like this but starting this year they have a bathroom policy.

My geometry teacher takes this very seriously. She has out a pass at the beginning of the school year or the second semester depending when you actually take her class. But you can only go to the bathroom 3 times during each 9 weeks. Even then she can deny you going. 

I understand some people go to the bathroom to fool around but that's only a small percentage. If you ask why you can't go she says ""You should've went before changing classes"" then we would have been late and got sent to the office. We have a 5 minute bell. The halls are crowded always because everyone is trying to make it to class before an unforgiving teacher shuts the door.

Our geometry teacher is also a ""the bell doesnt dismiss you i do"" person. So every class of hers sits in there for 2 minuted after the bell rings. And then some rush to their lockers while others rush across the campus to class. Traffic gets backed up and sometimes we literally have to stop.

So how can we have time to go to the bathroom, wipe, go to lockers, and rush across the campus in 5 minutes? 

If you have one foot in her class when the bell rings she tells you to get out and go get a tardy pass.

She's not the only teacher with them. A woman on the board pushes for them. Like why? No one tells you when to piss. Sometimes our teachers even leave class to go pee. But I can't pee? I can't go change my pad?",29Jan2017,1

211," I am a teenager. I may not be the most sociable but when one on one with someone I'm usually fine. I find I'm good at making jokes I get along with people and I can usually make a good connection with them. Being in groups is a different issue, if people already know each other but I don't then I suck. Guess what everyone does as a teenager.

 I have made some friends. Just not many feel that personal. I am able to count 3 close friends and a fourth that I haven't talked to in a while (am attempting to organise how to meet up) but only 1 seems close. The other 3 are mainly just banter.

 I am in a group however I am attempting to distance myself from them as they are kind of changing into a group I don't like to be with. (Aka hooligans/troublemakers/offensive memes/isolating certain people from group) the majority as I said I get along with just together they seem to bring out the worst in each other.

 I have been in a group I do like in a kind of club during the summer. The group had 4-5 people in it including me. In those 2 weeks I made a better connection with them than I have with the ones I'm with now. It's been half a year.

 Out of that group I have contact with 3 of them online. One we talk every weekend, one we talk every on and off usually I start it nd the last rarely with me always asking. Once we start talking were fine they keep it going and ask questions it's not like they try and end it.

 No one lives in my estate so a lot of my friends come from clubs or school. Just hanging around outside doesn't really appeal to me. I want someone I can be friends with beyond just banter. I want a good friend or a group I can match up well with.

Most of the women I know are utterly materialistic and deceitful as to probably reach a better social status, and this completely drives me away from them (misogeny), which made me a skeptical introvert. So, I seem to find myself in a social void where few best male friends rarely accompany me due to their relationships. Additionally, a friend's amateur research showed that most women engage in things that have high status or beautiful imagery (materialism), while men aim for the concept of the thing rather than its value/price/look.

213,"Alright, made a throwaway for this. I will try to be clear and give some context on the situation I'm in. 

* Was contacted on Linkedin a few days ago from a man who is bringing a new product to the US market. 

* Based on my research, the company is legit, the products for the US market are undergoing all the right certification steps, and all seems correct. The company is from overseas. 

* He wants me to help him with US marketing for this new product. My degree qualifies me for this so this is my area.

* We meet in person, he shows me the products, how they work and so forth. All is well, but my trust factor is kind of in the yellow. I feel sort of like he is trying to sell me a bit on the product. 

A bit more context: I've been looking for a full time job now after having graduated from school about 9 months ago. It isn't easy. Unlike many of my other fellow graduates, I was older and have an O.K. amount of years of experience. I can't find work and suddenly out of the blue, this man messages me on Linkedin and we agree to talk and meet in person. 

Here's where I start to feel a bit over my head: the company is a startup (after all it is entering the US market for the first time) he asks me to consider a salary range but is open also to me taking a stake in the company in the form of a commission % based on US sales. He made mention that he did something similar at the other company he worked at before this new one and he ended up with a $150K year end bonus. 

I have never been in such a situation like this. I'd be doing your basic social media marketing for this company and I'd also be doing writing and videos as well. Basic content marketing type stuff. So far it is just him in the US and he is looking to put together a team and eventually (3 months as he told me) wants to have a physical office location, warehouse, and so forth. 

He also mentioned that he'd need me to go with him overseas to the company HQ at the end of February and also wants me to go to investor meetings with him an stuff. I've never been in this situation. Why would I, a content marketing person, need to be going with him overseas and to investor meetings? What? 

I'm just concerned that this isn't what it appears to be and that some how or another I will get screwed. I know if I commit, I will need a contract to be agreed upon so that it will be official, but how would I even go about deciding my % commission? If this is legit and so far I'm inching towards YES, it is...then there is the potential to make a very large sum of money which...well I need, no doubt. 

What do I do here? Am I just naive and not seeing that this is just an over promise, under deliver type situation? Why does he need me to go to such meetings, is it because it is a startup and showing the investor that they have brought me aboard shows growth? I have questions...but no one to ask about this. I feel lost and thus hesitant to commit. ",29Jan2017,1
214,"Let my start by saying I am a high-school student with supportive friends. **I don't need people telling me how great I am.** I am considered smart by my peers and they understand and respect my accomplishments and opinions. I hear that I'm smart nearly every day and it's annoying and kinda pisses me off.

I need somebody to tell me how to be okay with who I am, and to tell me how to have self-respect. I always find I hate myself and it's likely partially in part because my friends are really successful socially (even if it required my help to get them there), and in other ways, and while I'm successful I can't help but look at them and see my own flaws.

I can't help but envy what they have that's good in their lives, and it leads to me seeing my own imperfections. It makes me feel so pathetic and worthless, and then I end up hating myself for having that thought and then suddenly I find myself just fading away from them. Often times, when I feel like shit, I'll just walk away from them or stop talking to them, sometimes for more than a day.

I often times find that it can be hard to let myself hang out with my friends because I feel greedy when I do, almost as if I am wasting their time. All that even though I know they'd be willing to talk to me for hours on end just to learn what they can about what I think about things, and to see things how I understand them.

I understand there are ways that I'm successful, and even many where I am more successful than they are, But I still feel like I could be doing much better and that everyone else is generally all much better and more important than me. There are no cases where I would choose myself over somebody else.

I don't have friends so I have no one to talk to and she's just taking advantage of me not saying anything and I can't write this on fb or something and ask my family and friends because I'm pretty sure a mutual friend of ours tipped her off to stalk my fucking fb and I know that wasn't right but the reason I wrote on fb that one time was because she purposely turned on the light when she left at 6am and I was asleep. I consistently have sleeping issues because of her behavior.

I was pissed and she has the nerve to come up to me and confront me about that saying it ""pissed"" her off. I need help. Sorry for the rage, this has been going on for almost a year now and attempts to get her to stop have not worked, I can be more specific if anyone ask.",29Jan2017,3
216,I think my mom is an enabler. But please someone explain her response or try to understand it. I don't. I just have to walk away from her crazy. Any time I bring up how bad he treats us she just tells me I'm not perfect??? Like that's not what I'm saying I know I'm not perfect nobody is but some behaviors are just unacceptable point blank!! ,29Jan2017,1
217,Hey Reddit. I am a senior in high school and prom is coming up soon. I've liked this girl for about 2 years now. She knew I liked her but then I told her I had no feelings for her. And I still like her although I told her I didn't like her. We are good friends now. I just need advice on whether or not I should ask her to prom or will that ruin our friendship and I have 1 less amazing friend like her? Any advice would help thanks.,29Jan2017,1
220,"I'ts really annoying me, I am 18 now and have an apprenticeship in August. The problem I have with them is that they think I'm 10. Whenever I drive off to work my mum tells me to be careful, lock the house, put warm clothes on, switch on my bicycle lights, remember to not buy any sweet ""shit"" stuff and you name it. Whenever they get to bed I'm mostly still up for an hour or 2. There was a time where she would come in every 10 minutes telling me to go to bed. At some point I was pissed off, getting loud, waking my dad up; he got mad at me, told me to shut it and sleep. I  told them far over a hundred times to cut that stuff because it's just annoying. But no, it keeps going. My dad also often wants to do some boring things with me, like drive to the gas station together or checking where some firewood is laying around(he processes the wood in his free time to use for the chimney). I kind of voluntarily help him quite a lot with the wood, he knows I dislike doing it but appreciates my help. Another things that pisses me and my dad off is the fact that my mum is nagging about 80% of the time when she opens her mouth (excluding the annoying unnecessary talk), often enough searching for things to get mad about. She wants to be complimented and acknowledged for **everything** she does. I often enough have to leave my room to save myself from embarrassment in front of my friends. They come in and start talking this unnecessary ""trash"", leaving my friends annoyed or laughing. There is literally no way to talk with them about this without it escalating into a big argument. It's really robbing my nerves, any ideas?",29Jan2017,1
223,"I'm almost 20 and I haven't finished high school yet due to mental illness. My homeschooling program allows me to work at my own pace. However, my pace is excruciatingly slow, and it's getting harder and harder to find any motivation when it seems like most people my age are so far ahead of me. All the friends I used to have are going to college or have jobs. I don't have a job. I don't even have my drivers license. I feel like being so far behind everyone else should motivate me to work harder, but instead, I just feel stuck. It's not like I have any specific goals to strive for. I'd like to go to college, but I have no idea what kind of job I want in the future. I just don't want to be dependent on my parents anymore. I'm sick of being the fuck-up of the family; the bad example that my younger siblings shouldn't follow. At this point, I'm considering just getting my GED. It's going to take me at least another year to finish high school and I can't keep living like this. I don't know what to do. Can I still get into a decent college with a GED? Should I even go to college? I don't know what I want to do with my life. Would it just be a waste of money? And how am I supposed to get a job with literally no experience and without even a high school diploma? I could get some job flipping burgers but that's not going to get me out of my parent's house. Do I need a degree to get a job that pays well enough for me to live on my own? How the hell does health insurance work? How the hell do taxes work? Why has no one ever taught me these things? Ugh... I don't know how to be an adult. Does anyone know how to be an adult, or is everyone just pretending to know what the fuck they're doing? Help! Being an adult is scary and confusing and I have no idea how anyone does it.",29Jan2017,1
224,So a year or two ago I grew apart from an old friend. He started ignoring me because he had a new girlfriend and he had some closer friends. I didn't act on it in time and now I don't think he even knows me. He still seems like a really cool dude and I want to become friends with him again but I think it would be awkward to even talk to him. Any tips?,29Jan2017,1
226,"Hello! I've been thinking about buying noice cancelling headphones and if someone have used any of following products it would be awesome to get review! 

Sony MDR-1000x 

Bose Quiet comfort 35 

Parrot zik 3.0 

Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC 

I know that Sony and Bose are propably the best of those but 400 euros is much to pay for headphones 
Thanks already! ",29Jan2017,2
227,"I have the tedious job as working as a IT assistant for a photographer, which means I have to spend hours editing photos and touching up models in photoshop. This is very boring and I end up doing something completely different after a while. However, when I'm in the zone ( or the ""flow"" ) I can do 20 photos in less than two hours. ",29Jan2017,1
228,"

I don't know where to begin. I guess a lot of me comes from some strong genes on my father's side. Then there's my mother's big, vibrant family(she's the youngest of 9 siblings so I have much older cousins) but I don't think I got as many genes from them. I'm Indian for one(Asian not Native American) &amp; I've never even felt like I belong with them, it SUCKS. I've been raised very strictly. Even to this day: no tank tops, no short shorts, no love songs, the list goes on. If it wasn't for my mom's family, who also told me loudly(my aunt) &amp; my cousin(who has kids a little younger than me) I couldn't use a straightener(I don't even ask for one but I can't do anything else thanks to a bad haircut). I have to fight so hard for that too. The point is my upbringing confused me a little too much. It wasn't until recently I realized I can do what everyone else, I had no idea I could. I still have no idea. It's hard when now everyone's suddenly expecting me to be like everyone else after years of conditioning to not be, &amp; still some. I understand, they want to keep me safe but it's so hard sometimes. I think I get depressed though sometimes I'm also doing ok. The problem is I feel like they can't accept that I'm a girl. My sister-in-law, sure she's fine. My brother gets to yell at me, he doesn't talk any other way. I was even told that if he yells I have to listen to it. Did they tell my sister in law that? Not that I'd ever want that for her. But still... I feel like I can't always get along with my family. It's annoying to be around them, then again I'm ALWAYS around my parents. I can't live alone &amp; I don't go out too much but that can change, maybe. I feel like everyone is trying to persecute me for being a woman(you can ask me if you want to get in a woman's mind). Even my religious group. I don't even get it! But I feel like I wouldn't want to change anything even for less hassle, b/c I might just be in the right place.

I feel like all of this kind of messed me up. The biggest example of that is my taste in guys. I was actually afraid of them. Being raised so strictly then being so small &amp; quiet, though I can be loud , vibrant, &amp; fight well sometimes if I wasn't so alone; makes it so intimidating. I KNOW many guys are great people, in fact they inspire me. But honestly getting close to them is unthinkable, even if they're very nice &amp; are willing to protect me. I turn to liking girly guys. And that's not all, I have sexual fantasies about them, I can't discuss it but I'm surprised to learn I wouldn't mind almost anything(this was all in my head). I even wanted to, though my hormones fluctuated as my period became regular at a later age(mid 20s). I always thought I didn't. But only them. And by girly guys, maybe not girly but soft, sensitive, &amp; maybe soft features. In fact I like them a lot &amp; have the highest regard for them. I'm just attracted to them, I can even work to get around the fear of guys I have for them. I don't hate other men but I'm just attracted to those kind of guys. By those type of guys I mean guys like not actually Tanzin Norgay Trainer(at 2017 &amp; if he were a bit more older, I'm not a pedo), Nolan Gould(he doesn't seem soft enough), Ron Weasley type(Rupert Grint is also not soft enough), Jason Dolly(also not soft enough even if he's so nice), &amp; Paras Arora(I feel like he could be my type if he wasn't so d*mn manly). This probably sounds completely mental, &amp; it probably is. But I just can't figure anything out &amp; have no one to talk to. I'm hoping someone is nice enough to explain things to me even if I'm a complete idiot. I feel like understanding my strange taste in guys might help me figure out my issues, lol. I think after years of suppressing feelings for whatever reason &amp; lack of life experience then doing the reverse might have something to do with this. I also haven't interacted with a lot of people, except for ppl whom I'm not too close to. I'm also slowly realizing some people are right &amp; not being so depressed anymore. It's hard to accept everything at once though. And what do you guys think of my taste &amp; obsession? Does it feel offensive? Another thing to note is I can't relate with barely any women b/c of my taste. Am I just discriminating? Or is it something else that underlies maybe a deeper issue. I just want to apologize in advance to any guy who I've offended with my taste. I see a lot of guys of all types with great personalities that are most definitely worthy, I just am drawn to the small group right now. I wish I knew why I feel the way I do and what to do that's right. But I can't change myself so easily.
