0,"This is in America. I am a white male who is dating a beautiful African American woman. We met after it turned out that my grandfather (now deceased) rescued several black families from the Ku Klux Klan when he was younger and provided shelter and food for them. One of the families he rescued was the family of my now girlfriend. 

This woman came to contact my family and met me and we struck up a rapport and have begun dating. I love her more than anything and I get on very well with her family. However, they are very deferential and almost everytime we meet they let me know how grateful they are to my family and I.

It is a bit jarring and I am just thinking is there anyway politely to let them know that neither my family nor I expect them to repeat over and over how grateful they are to my grandfather? We don't feel that they have an obligation to us and we are adults and don't need constant praise, mutual respect will do just fine. I imagine that they would do the same thing to my family if we were ever in such a situation. Basically, is there a polite way to tell them to move on without hurting their feelings?

I love history and I love discussing past events, but these can be done objectively without a need for them to keep telling me how grateful they are to me for my grandfather doing what really any decent person should have done.",23May2017,1

3,"Just some background info:
Still pretty young, college student. I dont really NEED to work. I have a bit saved up in my bank account. I still heavily rely on my parents. College is being paid for by them. Yes I'm very lucky. 

My barista friend introduced me to her manager a while back and I'm pretty much guaranteed a job there. However the work is much less, therefore the pay is less as well. My friend describes the job as ""chill and fun"". The pay starts at 9/hr and it's just making drinks. Flexible schedule. 

At my current workplace, however, I feel as it's seriously a toxic environment. Coworkers are serious stoners and alcoholics, and boy do they love talking shit about each other. The pay there averages out to be 11-12/hr. depending on the day. I don't work weekend nights, even though i know that's where the money is. Most of our food is quite cheap. Schedule is not flexible at all. 

Money-wise, I know being a server is overall more money. However being there makes me feel stressed out since everyone is yelling at each other all the time. I don't know if i pushing through it will help me at all in the long run. Will being in that kind of tense environment help me develop a stronger character or a better work ethic? 

So reddit, what should i do? ",23May2017,1
6,"I (20 f) live with my parents when I'm on break from university. Our house is perpetually cluttered, but like... Extreme Clutterâ„¢. I'm talking dirty dishes piled up in the sink, freezer stuffed with things at least four years old, expensive cherry wood dining table covered in random papers stacked at least an inch high, mail piled up on a chair, a massive cupboard drawer under the oven completely full of Tupperware that never sees the light of day, etc etc. Not to mention our entire basement being also filled with stuff (baby clothes, Christmas decorations, 80s decor from my parents' condo, electronics boxes from decades ago, other miscellaneous junk). The end result is that our house is almost unlivable. There's nowhere to prepare food because all the counters are covered in junk, so I've been eating out of a microwave. There's nowhere to eat the sad microwave meals because the table's covered in a laundry basket that's been there for a week and more junk, so my dad and I take turns eating at the computer desk. It's really terrible. I'm so sick of microwave food that I've started just not eating.

The only thing I can really do here is tell my parents that I'm finding it impossible to live in our house, except... I can't. My dad, who makes very little of the mess, doesn't take any responsibility for it. I suggested that we clean out the fridge and he replied that he didn't want to throw away my mom's stuff. Any my mom has frequent migraines and depression and is fully aware that the house is disgusting, and very guilty about it, but she can't push herself to clean. Last summer they paid me to clean the entire house once a week, but all I did was put stuff in increasingly cramped cupboards and drawers. The issue here is that we have too much stuff, and cramming it away is a temporary fix that will never be sustainable. Plus, it shouldn't be solely my responsibility to clean up everyone else's mess. But this house is becoming so awful that I dread coming home... does anyone have any ideas for how I could approach this with my family, or if I even should?",23May2017,2

8,"Yeah, like the title says, I'm in a long-distance relationship. We're both 17, so we're still underage, which is why I don't want to send inappropriate pictures of myself.

I keep telling him that I don't want to and that it makes me uncomfortable but he keeps asking. He says that he ""doesn't want to force"" me but still keeps asking. I don't know what to do at this point.

Another big(read: HUGE) concern of mine is that he told me that his ex-girlfriend is pregnant with his child. Yes, pregnant with his child. He says that she's keeping the baby. I don't know what to do about this. I really like him but it's obviously a big fucking deal that he's a soon-to-be parent.

11,"I've been on academic probation for a couple years now, but the university has apparently had enough of my shit and I got an email today that I will not be returning for the Fall. I can appeal the decision, but I was working in a student job, and I'm going to lose that even if the dismissal is repealed.

I was doing better this semester for about a month, then I got  a homework assignment I didn't know how to do. I sat down, I wrote an email to my professor asking for help. Then I double checked it, then triple checked, then revised and checked again. Then I just deleted the email. I just couldn't bring myself to send it. I could have turned in what I had, but I didn't because I wasn't happy with it. I was ashamed of not completing the homework so I didn't go to class the next day. Then I didn't go the next week. I kept telling myself that I'd make it up, but then I'd just go straight from work to home. A couple times I got as far as the door, then I  would have a panic attack and leave before I could open the door. I have the appeal form open on my computer, but I don't know what to say to justify myself. I lose nothing by submitting it, they either repeal the decision or they don't, but I'm still fighting with myself to not just let the deadline pass uncontested. 

I've told my parents that I've been dismissed and I'll be losing my job. I told them that I just couldn't concentrate and that I got test anxiety, which is true but far from the full story. I know I need help, but I don't want them to know about it. My mom works for my doctor's clinic, even if I ask them not to tell her, she has access to my notes, she can just look it up. 

Moreover, my employers do not know that I've been dismissed yet. They took a chance on me, despite my lack of experience, and I feel horrible for failing them. If I send an email with my notice, my boss will want to talk to find out why. He asks a lot of questions and I'm certain that I'm going to start crying and panicking if I have to talk to him about it.

13,"Hey so I apologize in advance if this isn't the correct forum for this sort of thing, I'm just really looking for some advice that i have otherwise been unable to find. 
I'm currently at the end of my spring semester at a california community college, from which I am graduating in a little under 2 days. I still have a class i need to complete post-graduation, but like many other universities they're allowing me to walk as I have completed the majority the classes for my AA. Anyway, on to the point. Im enrolled in 4 classes, 3 on campus, and 1 online math class through a different sister school. I originally thought that I would be able to complete this math class easily, even though it was online, as i had worked with this program before in previous math classes, and knew my way around. Well, I was very wrong. So here I am at the end of my semesters at a JC with an overall gpa of 3.9, A's in all the rest of my classes and will be beginning the process of applying to 4 years this fall. My question(s) are: What will happen to my chances of getting in to a 4 year if I fail this online course? does it matter that the online class is not through the college I am getting my AA through? Is there any way to remove this blemish on my record? and lastly does it make in any more forgivable to an admissions office that it is an online class rather than an on-location one? All in all: what should I do?
Thanks for reading and for possibly taking the time to answer, I'm just feeling a little lost and nervous.

extra information:
-I have never received a failing grade on any of my college transcripts before.
-This math class is a transferrable course.
-I will be retaking the class in the fall along with the other class I have yet to complete.

15,"Hey guys,

Life is hard. I'm 17, and about to be off for summer break before my senior year. I've been struggling a lot lately with a number of things, ranging from my courseload to family issues to a lack of trust from a number of people due to mistakes I've made in my life. My biggest issue is that I don't have a lot of people around me who want to  support me, as it seems like I have burned bridges with both my friends and family. Sometimes I break down crying at random moments and yell and scream because I feel really helpless right now to be honest.

Well someone in my group of friends told him I was the one to make the joke(he's been dealt with stupid but can look past it) but the guy I made a joke about, We'll call him 'K' has taken this chance to try and pick a fight. I know how stupid the situation is believe me which is why it's getting to me. I know that the guy is having to look for a reason to fight me as this is all he could come up with. But the thing is he has a lot of friends in low places that truly don't give a fuck and are trying to egg him on, He's known for being a mega douche but he'd have me up and down the street if he could. The issue I'm having is I've tried to apologise to him but the reply I got was ""Fuck you cunt meet me, lets settle this like men"" not gonna lie I did laugh at that but I live in a small town where we could run into each other every day and being an introvert with depression means this is taking its toll on me. I don't know how many of my friends I can trust bar 2, I have to alter how I get to college so I don't pass the bar where he always hangs out.

She still physically abuses me by constantly pull my hair as hard as she can for no reason, knowing I can't hit back considering I would get in major trouble for even thinking of hitting a girl, and she emotionally abuses me by constantly making fun of me.

I'm currently a rising senior in college back at home for summer break and I have been trying desperately for the past week or so (having gotten a head start the month before) to find a job over the summer. However, I botched an interview for one job, never got called back for a follow-up interview for another, never got called back for another, and have heard nothing back from anyone else. It's getting to the point in my search where I have no idea where I can search; I've walked around town, I've tried Craigslist, I've tried Indeed, but every single lead I think I've had has come up with nothing. I even went to a temp agency today, but I feel like I scared them away with my own personality/ interaction with them. This has got me down for two specific reasons:

1. Job Experience. The last job I worked was two years ago as a cashier at a supermarket, but quit at the end of the summer to commit myself to my studies in school again. I was unable to find something last summer, which bummed the shit out of me, but ultimately, I could rationalize that as me being too busy preparing to go abroad to Vienna to study music in the fall. Now, I'm facing the same situation again and I'm horrified. The cashier gig is the ONLY paid job experience I have on my resume, and if I graduate from college with only that under my belt, internships/relevant volunteer experience be damned (and trust me, I am keeping up with volunteering in the meantime), I'm terrified that employers are going to look at that and deny me at every turn and the cycle is just going to repeat over and over again.

2. Money. I want to start earning a disposable income again and not rely on my mom to provide for me. God bless my mom, she's been nothing but supportive of me financially, but I don't want to burden her forever with buying me things I want. I want to do so many things over the summer - go to some conventions, hang out with friends in New York City - and I want to get some things for my dorm room next semester, but I don't want to put all of that on my mom. It's not fair to her.

So that's where I stand, and I've been growing more and more pessimistic over this search to the point where I'm borderline defeatist. And the most infuriating part? There are so many jobs open to people with driver's licenses, but I do not have either that or a car to drive with. tl;dr, I can't get a goddamn summer job in my hometown, and it's making me feel scared for my future. What do I do?

I feel like I've left out some details in explaining all this, so if any of you are confused as to the nature of my situation, please ask questions.",23May2017,1

If you think this belongs in a different sub, let me know.

I'm a 19 year old Canadian male fresh out of college, living with my only parent who has a low income and small apartment. I have a minor form of Asperger's syndrome, and 2 - 3 friends who don't live near me. I think I struggle with repetitive behavior because of Asperger's, but I can never really tell how its affecting me. To compound this issue, I have extreme difficulty forming relationships, or even starting them by talking to people.

But to the point: I'm lonely. I've never had a girlfriend at any point in my life, and now I'm sitting here realizing that I want a partner. I want the companionship, having someone to trust, to confide in, to be there for me and someone I can be there for, as equals. There have been a couple people I was interested in over the years, but I could rarely force myself to talk to them. I'd work up the courage for days, telling myself that I wanted to talk to them, and get to know them, that it'd be fine if they blew me off. But it was like the closer I got to talking to them, the higher my fear grew until I just panicked and bailed, telling myself I'd talk to them tomorrow.

So I've never been able to form a relationship with a woman, and never been able to have male friends I can confide in.

However, a person in my family has just recently passed away and I would love to get a tattoo commemorating that person. I don't want to get a tattoo on my back shoulder or another one of my chest because I really want this one to be able to be shown off because I really am putting some thought into this tattoo. 
The place that I decided I really want to get this tattoo is on my outer bicep. The tattoo would be probably about 3-4 inches down my arm and the width of my bicep. The tattoo would be able to be hidden under my short sleeves most of the time. However this one is easily viewable compared to the one on my chest.
So really what my dilemma is is that I don't have the biggest and most toned biceps. However I really want to get this tattoo on my arm. So I'm asking y'all, is it dumb to get a tattoo on smaller biceps? I can't help but think it would look silly to get a tattoo on average sized arms. I feel like whenever I look at pictures of tattoos on biceps the guys are usually pretty jacked. I look nothing like those guys and probably never will. So is it dumb to get a tattoo on my bicep whenever I don't have some serious guns.

I live in a 2 bedroom apartment in Chicago. With the rent, utilities, and internet, I pay about $900-950 a week. I was living in a halfway house and moved out with a friend there. He's 30 and his girlfriend is 30. Anyways she sleeps over like every night basically, at least 6. She will be out of the house at like 6:00am and come back at around 8 to hang out with my roommate... they usually watch TV in the living room and go out to eat a lot since their parents are rich... my roommate works but he works for his Dad and he will wake up at 10-11am and sometimes just stay at home working on his laptop. I honestly have no idea what he does and it is annoying because he acts like he's better than people sometimes. She doesn't seem to shower here, and she is generally respectful of the place... however it is a bit annoying because I am an introvert along w/ having social anxiety and don't really like her here all the time. 

anyways, I am a little upset because my roommate complains he spends $50-60 on cleaning supplies a month which he counts as paper towels, tissues, clorox wipes, and swifter wet jet refills and saying I need to contribute for that. He claims cleans the house a bunch. I don't really agree, and he has 2 cats too here for the matter so most of the messes aren't mine.  I don't know why he doesn't ask his girlfriend to pay. She doesn't pay any of the utilities or the rent. I kind of want to say something, after seeing other threads of this similar issue people said that she needs to pay while others saying this is normal and going to have to just deal with it.

44,"As a previous note, im sorry if this goes against the rules.

I met this girl 3 years ago. She is 31 and Im 25. When I met her I was studying law and she was a former student from a specific subject (these kind of students go to classes along with the professor either because they like the subject or because they are good at it and they get invited) I then got invited and got to know her. 

When we first met she had a boyfriend that basically was ""the man of her life"" (I didnt have any kind of feelings for her back then, we got along tho). Sadly, this guy died this year after fighting against a very serious illness for a very long time. I went to his funeral and, overall, tried to be as supportive as possible. A month ago something changed and I started to have feelings for her. She has the nicest personality and I sincerely feel happy when Im with her, even if I get to talk to her for only 2 minutes I cherish those 2 minutes as if they were 2 hours. 

She is Still trying to get over all the shit life put in her way and, even if she was over it, Im pretty sure she is not ready for another relationship (and also dont know If she will be). I also think that even if she was ready, the difference in age and social circles, as well as the fact we dont see each other a lot during the week, indicates it wont happen.

54,"So for the summer my school is providing housing in an amazing area. There was a 50% chance that we'd get placed in a not so great apartment and a 50% chance we'd get placed in a luxury apartment.

Lucky for me, I've been placed in the luxury one on the top floor and have an amazing view of the city. I've been working my ass off all year with three jobs to afford the rent which is crazy high.

So last two semesters I had a roommate who was pretty gross and I couldn't really stand. He'd get drunk a lot on the weekdays and fart twice every 3 minutes or so and would just febreeze it away, but that was the only bad thing about him besides being obnoxiously loud playing his baseball video games with his friend.

I just found out I'm sharing the apartment with his friend. His friend is even worse. His parents have big money and pay for everything that he owns. He's never had a job before, is very obnoxious and talks a lot louder than a normal human being, is extremely racist and disrespectful, and doesn't know when to shut the fuck up. The kid thinks he's tough shit but he's not.

Last semester my girlfriend and I were in the room and he came in and called her a bitch out of nowhere, which ended up having me picking him up and slamming him onto the ground. We've had a lot of tension since then and really hate each other. One of my black friends stayed a night too and this kid, who is the whitest kid you can possibly imagine, kept saying ""nigga"" to my roommate (because he knew my black friend was in the room since he's a racist fat fuck) which pissed off my friend who told him to watch his fucking mouth.

I was pretty ecstatic to find out I got the top floor. I'm not exactly having him as a roommate, but he's going to be in the same apartment sharing the same living room. This kid stays up until 3AM drunk off his ass since he doesn't have to worry about working even a day screaming at his stupid baseball video game.

I really love the room that I got but I don't want to back out and risk having to be put into the other apartment that is a lot worse or be put on another floor where I can't see the view that I have now. He's going to try to be in the living room with the few friends that he has all the time (including my old gross roommate). What should I do? The kid is a fucking pig.",23May2017,1

58,"TL;DR - my best friend of 22 yrs asked me to give a speech at her wedding b/c she felt guilty when I awkwardly assumed no one else had been asked to give one (she doesn't have a formal wedding party). She'd already asked another friend to give her *de facto* MOH speech. Is it more uncomfortable for her if I say yes or to politely decline?

****

Background: 
My best friend (we'll call her Rosie) and I have been friends since elementary school. We went to college together and now live in the same town. I also introduced her to her now-fiance -- he was a friend of mine and I loved hooking my girl up with a guy I knew would treat her right. As moony-eyed highschool girls (""BFFs forever!"") we promised each other we'd be the maid of honor in each other's weddings. 

After college, she and I went into different industries, and the trials of being a 20-something trying to claw your way up the the corporate ladder (also out of debilitating debt from tuition, in my case) took a toll on us. I didn't have as much time to hang out because I was so busy, and as a super-extrovert, Rosie ended up making new friends who had more free time (as a super-introvert, I just made better friends with my cat). She grew close to a college friend of ours (let's say, ""Selena"") who now has her own wedding planning company.

I accepted that I'd probably lost primo standing as her BFF, even though I still considered her mine --  I didn't have many close girl friends I cared about in besides her (I have close guy friends, but our heart-to-hearts are about whether our fantasy laser tag championship teams can include characters with time control/multiverse powers, and if so, can they use them during the lasertag match?). But no matter how busy I was, I made sure to be there for all the *important* friend stuff.

When she got engaged, she diplomatically told all her friends she wasn't going to have a bridal party. I was a little bummed, since she didn't address the whole ""Maid of Honor Promise"" thing we'd obsessed over back in the day, and I'd been so excited about it (I know it's silly -- it's a lot of responsibility and so forth, but hey, it's not like I'd be MOH in anyone else's wedding, because I just don't have any other close girl friends... so I wanted the experience at least one time! I've never even been a bridesmaid!). Anyway, I'm an adult so I got over it. I just asked her if I could still give a speech at her wedding, and she said she hadn't even though about speeches yet, so I didn't bring it up again. 

Ten months go by, and her wedding is approaching in two months. I've been to a ton of weddings but never in the wedding party, and I wasn't sure if I should ask her about speeches again, so I would know whether to start preparing one. I'm guessing now that it's usually something you're invited to do -- but I just didn't know the etiquette rules, like some non-wedding-expert peasant.

So instead of Googling it like a smart person, I just casually brought it up over coffee a few days ago. I tried to play it off super cool, like that I'd just started thinking about it, but secretly had started an entire outline. I'd even picked out the jokes that were totally tasteful and still hilarious! (Despite being an introvert, my job requires me to be good at giving kickass speeches to big audiences -- so I swear, this thing was GOLD). 

She responds with some really awkward dissembling about how she needs to check with her fiance's family since they already have four speeches planned. 

Me: ""Oh, wow! Well that's cool, I just figured since you didn't have a wedding party, that maybe I could give the maid of honor speech for you.... because I wanted you to have one...""

Rosie: ""Actually, I already asked Selena to do it. Just because... she lived with me and [fiance] for awhile... and she's a wedding planner... and I know she could do a good job.""

I quickly dropped it by brushing it off like it was no big deal. Then later in the day, she texted me to say that she'd love for me to give a ""second"" speech at the wedding. 

It quickly became clear that even though Rosie hadn't formally picked a MOH, she was having Selena do all the traditional MOH stuff.  She just hadn't brought it up because she didn't want to hurt my feelings. So to be clear: my feelings *were* hurt, but as a big girl with big girl pants, I can live with it. I mean - I went home and cried and ate a lot of cheese, and then told all of Reddit I did that - but otherwise I handled my feelings in a very mature way. 

It's obviously awkward enough for her, and the last thing a bride needs is an uncomfortable situation to feel anxious about before her wedding.

66,"Started talking to a woman online with no intentions of anything. She was in the area, but just visiting, so she actually lives pretty far away. But I honestly just messaged her because I thought she looked interesting. She was very unique and different. We found each other interesting and just kind of kept talking like friends do, just casual conversations. We both ended up talking about some pretty deep stuff, I think knowing that there probably wasn't anything there. The more we talked though, the more we started to really like each other. It's been about a month, we've talked everyday, and we've started to send pics and get pretty sexual. I've always kind of been attracted to older women just because the conversations were always deeper and older women just seemed more carefree and confident, but I never really thought anything of it. We just connect on a lot of levels. I don't feel like she's lowering her mentality to connect with me, and I don't feel like I'm having to raise my mentality to connect with her.


We brought up the idea of meeting halfway and I'm really tempted to say yes. I'm really into this woman, but I have this thing in the back of my head telling me it's strange.

69,"Forgive me for lack of structure. I'm not a very good writer.

I'm 19 and my brother (22) and I sort of got kicked out. It all started when my brother and myself confronted my mom about her behavior towards us. We wanted to confront her hoping to enlighten her in order to make all of our situations better. He's always talking about how my mom's stupid and that she ruined our childhood and that she's the reason we live a ""bad"" life. He thinks that because we're not very wealthy, that we're very poor which IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL. He's just friends with people more wealthy than he is and it's obvious that he compares himself to them and is very envious. Anyways, what happened is that my mother and father got divorced when we were small, he rode out on us for other women, and my mom's been raising us on her own ever since. He's somehow convinced himself that our father leaving us is all her fault and that our living conditions are all her fault as well. To tell you the truth, we live in a very decent home with a dog. My brother goes to Nursing school and works a student assistant job. I only work a part time job (taking a break from school). My mom works a full time job (main income of the house). So, what bothers us about our mother is that when things get a little hard or she gets a little stressed with us, she begins to threaten us to leave to her home country in South America because it's too hard for her in the US. But she does it ALL THE TIME.. it starts to get into our heads. I understand that she's a single mother trying to raise us but I also believe that there are certain ways to handle things. Anyways, when we confront her about her behavior, I try to tell her in hopes of us understanding each other to improve the situation so that we can comfortably go on to live with each other and prosper. My brother goes Sigmund Freud on her and starts telling her about her flaws and how she's messing with our mental health and how she's an ""animal"" that acts out on emotions and is stupid and how she's the reason we're fucked up... Honestly, it isn't even all that bad. She puts a roof over our head in a nice neighborhood, pays the bills, and puts food on the table. It makes me furious that my brother doesn't acknowledge the fact that everything she does, she does it for us even if it's not perfect. She's not the devil. So, she brings up the fact that if we're not happy living with her, that we're both welcome to leave because we're both well over 18 now. But, we just wanted to talk with her to improve our situation to be able to live with each other better. If that wasn't possible, then we thought it would be good for her to go back to her home country in South America where all her family is because we know she would be happier there. She doesn't like the sound of that and after a very long back and forth session between the 3 of us, she tells us that we have 2 weeks to pack our shit and leave. She disconnected both of our phones and has just locked herself in her room. I only make 1,000 a month and my brother even less than that. Over 600 dollars of that money I make per month goes toward my car payment and insurance. What do we do? I have a dog, how are we supposed to take care of her? My brother is in Nursing school in one part of the city and my job is located in the opposite side of the city. I'm afraid of being in bad terms with my mom, well because.. she's my mom, I love her to death and I don't want us to be bitter toward each other. Plus, my brother is still going on with his elitist bullshit about how we're both ""fucking stupid animals"" and about how he's so perfect for getting an education.... that my mom's helping him achieve. So, I'm a bit of a crossroads and don't know what to do. My brother's scorn towards my mom is a huge problem. He's extremely ungrateful and I might even say that he's a little spoiled. How do we change his way of thinking? I really just want us to be a happy family. Please don't be judgmental and give me some real advice. Thank you.",23May2017,1
70,"I am 24/F and heterosexual. Let me preface this with saying I have a VERY healthy sexual appetite. When in a committed relationship, I want to do it constantly. That being said, I personally find it hard to have 'no strings attached' sex. Not knocking it, I've done it, but I've learned the hard way it's not for me. That being said, whenever I find myself 'talking' to or getting to know someone with the intention to date them, I always make it known that I don't plan on sleeping with them until I'm certain the relationship could possibly go somewhere, or until we've reached the exclusive to each other milestone. The last few times I've been interested or pursued by someone else, I either somehow brought it up myself or waited until they made a sexual innuendo to give them my disclaimer, if you will, and it's turned out awfully. The last time in particular, I said it, the dude was nice (attentive, sweet, fun to talk to and overall romantic) for a few days and then tonight, after I have told him twice, completely flipped. Now he is asking for nudes and talking about all the things he wants to do to me, after saying he wouldn't pressure me or even bring it up because he was intent on getting to know the real me, and build something deeper. Is it the fact that I make it a topic of discussion early on and therefore maybe 'entice' them, is it just the people I pick, what the hell is it? This current situation is honestly no different than them all. In my opinion, letting someone know I'm not up for casual sex gives them the opportunity to duck out gracefully before they try and end up getting denied, but apparently it's just a fast track to ending shit righttttttt when I begin to be excited about the possibility of a new relationship. Any advice? Should I continue this disclaimer or let things take their natural course?",23May2017,1

He said I provoked him because I made noise when feeding the dogs and closing the door when coming back in the house. Sure I'll admit I provoked it because he called me an idiot first and said to be quiet because my neice is sleeping in the living room (when other rooms were clearly available) and I didn't close the door as quietly as I could have when coming back in.

He then started cussing in Spanish and pushed me and threatens to beat my face next time. My mom just happened to get home the second he was yelling so she was arguing with him.

In November a new judge and team were assigned to the case and it sounds as if progress was made and now all that's left is to inspect the house ourselves and turn on the utilities so we can likely move in by June. However, I suspect my mom is lying, or at the very least, sugarcoating things. She is not a bad person. She loves me and my sister and has raised us well, unlike my dad. However, she seems a little too protective sometimes. She doesn't want our relationship to go sour in the future, and I perfectly understand. But whenever I mention the house, she sounds exasperated and changes the subject as fast as possible except for when she gives me an update. When I begin to talk about packing my things to prepare, she scolds me, telling me to never pack unless she says so. When I create a plan to move efficiently, she dismisses it and claims it won't work. These aforementioned updates seem like they delay the move at oddly convenient times for her, such as when I have a test in school, which she stresses about a lot. There were some things in the past that she delayed in the same fashion. When we moved, we, for some reason, had to give one of our twin cats to a neighbor. She claimed we would go look for him,and get him back, but we never did. He was indeed still alive; I heard people still saw him around for some years afterwards. She hasn't brought him up in the seven years since then, and I don't want to yet because it's a very touchy subject. When I was about 6, she sold some of my old toys. I said I wanted them back, and she told me she'd call and see what she could do. Years went by and that was obviously a lie; why would we be able to steal some toys from somebody who already bought them? Her behavior now is very similar to the times she sugarcoated in the past, likely as an attempt to ""protect"" me from the harsh truths. I want to stand up to her this time. I want to ask if she's lying this time, but I can't. I tried hinting to it in the past by asking ""What's really going on?"" and she nearly went off her rocker, so I abruptly ended the conversation before things escalated to unhealthy levels. There are so many signs pointing to her sugarcoating or lying, but there is also evidence that she really is working hard; she *has* told the truth about stuff like this before and things have really happened as she said they would, but still, I'm not sure about this: I searched pictures and drove there myself twice and the windows of the old house have all been closed since our eviction, yet a strange red car is always in the driveway (may be the landlord living there for now). The dates on the Zillow history align directly to some days where my mom signed papers for the house, yet she never lets me see any physical evidence of this move. The process she discusses now almost exactly matches most move processes I've seen online, yet it seems oddly stretched and overly complicated in our case sometimes, conveniently delaying it when she wants My focus off of the house. There's evidence for and against this move, and I'm not sure what to believe any more. I want to believe we really will see our old home again, but there are times when it seems she isn't telling the truth. Is it really possible we are close to moving this time? Would she really lie about such a thing, knowing what it's putting me through? Can we ever just have our permanent home instead of being on the run from apartment to apartment, backstabber to backstabber?

86,"Tl;dr I hate my job. I have job options and want to quit, but I don't want to hurt other prospective jobs when employers see I'm not currently employed. 

I absolutely hate my job (yep totally first person ever to say that /s).

I've been planning to move to a new city and have already gotten a job interview there with a strong likelihood of a job offer.

The thing is I'm still not 100% certain I'll accept this new job. I initially planned on staying employed where I am currently until I found the right fit elsewhere, to avoid being in the same situation I'm in now. But it's gotten to the point that I feel extreme dread going into work and I worry for my mental health. 

I have money saved up. It is feasible financially for me to be unemployed while continuing to search, if necessary. The thing I'm worried over is that I know employers prefer you to be currently employed while you're searching. 

I really want to turn in my letter of resignation asap (like tomorrow). The thought of even continuing those last two weeks sounds horrible. I'm miserable. I've already typed up my letter to hand in.

If it was just not making money that was the problem, I'd just quit immediately. I 100% plan to leave no matter what at some point in the not too distant future anyway. But I feel anxious about hurting job prospects just because I couldn't tough it out a little longer. I just really don't know how much longer I can stand it there. 

How important is it I stay currently employed while searching for a job? ",23May2017,1
89,"Above all else, id like to just mention I have aspergers, so if anything seems like it's over explained or I'm overreacting, please forgive me.

I'm 13, male and live in Ireland. Recently I've been having a ton of anxiety, an existential crisis and I've now learned that a friend is moving home and therefore moving school. She's probably the only female I could confide to, and to see her moving away upsets me greatly. There's a small chance she doesn't move far enough away to not be able to go to school, but it's an 98.8% chance she does.

It may be trivial for others but I find it pretty hard to make friends, and only have one other male friend. I know the term 'only' shouldn't apply to friends as it's the quality not the quantity, but I feel the need to have one male friend and one female friend, so I can:

1. Get the best (and worst) of both worlds
2. If I get into an argument with one, I can go to the other until things calm down
3. Having a female friend would help me understand more of how their worlds work

There are no other people (for now) that are female and I feel I could confide to, and the thought scares me being completely honest. Others are just not the same, which is good I suppose, but it's not helpful.

Things I already thought of to try and calm myself down:

1. She's moving county, not country.
2. I can still text her
3. I still have until the end of the school year (this week and next week)
4.i was lucky enough to get to know her even if for this limited time (not including the times I'd tear her afterwards)

But it still worries me sick (literally sick), and I'm going to Italy for the summer and will probably have no internet. I fear I'll be forgotten then.

Again forgive me for the fairly long post, I know it seems like such a small thing (because it probably is) but it's been meaningful enough to me to distract me from my anxiety, and my anxiety is pretty strong. Thanks in advance.",23May2017,1

97,"my mom has been married 3 times now, let me just do a quick summary. she got first married in 1998 to my biological dad who she only knew for 2 weeks (because she was 18 and a Muslim straight from Somalia) and they had me. fast forward to 2006 and they had 2 more children which didn't help their broken marriage. my parents thought, how do we fix our marriage? have another kid of course (i love you Najib). guess what? it didn't work, so they got officially divorced in 2013 and i thought that this was the best day of my life (i live with my mom because my dad is a huge dick).

it's 2015 now and we're getting ready for the summer holiday but wait... my mom tells me ""i've been seeing a guy"", good for you mom, ""and he's moving here in 3 weeks""... what? stop me if you've heard this before, she's only known him for 2-3 weeks and is marrying him because of her religion forbids dating apparently (my mom is the only Muslim in our family) ... fucking hell. anywho, he comes and spews this dumb philosophical bullshit at us every second he gets. he kicked his daughter out because she no longer was a Muslim, so i'd like to take this time to say fuck you, you worthless shit head. fast forward 6 months and they are getting divorced, he was cheating on my mom plus we found out that he was arrested for carrying an unlicensed gun, fuck me, right? i thought finally i can just finish going to school and moving out without having to live with a stranger.

it's 2016 and i've just started my therapy meetings (h-ocd is a bitch). my mom asks how my meeting was and i say good, ""that's great honey, ummm, i'm getting married"".... holy fucking shit, this is tiring. i'll skip the unnecessary stuff. this guy was very quiet and he seemed nice but after 2 months of marriage, he wanted to control everything my mom did. he didn't want her to talk to people or look at them in the eyes. she divorced him (big shocker) and i found out that he was in a prison for 3 years in Paris for smuggling illegal goods.
don't get me wrong, i want my mom to be happy. it can't be easy raising 2 suicidal kids and another who never listens but she jumps into relationships. i just literally found out 2 hours ago that she's been seeing a guy. i just want to live a peaceful life where everyone is happy. what should i do? would you guys maybe move out? tell her to maybe finish her school (she's got 2 more years) before she thinks about relationships? it always changes the dynamic of our household and all i want to do is go to school, watch movies and read my books. it just makes it soooo complicated.

99,"Hello, I am a 19 year University student (male)  home for the summer, and I have had trouble making friends my whole life.
I don't have any friends in my hometown...and I'm not sure if I have any friends at all. Usually, I always let school get the best of me, and I am so concerned with keeping up my grades and doing good on exams that I neglect making friends. 

When I was younger, I was the odd kid that got made fun of in Gradeschool, and in HighSchool, I was so awkward and clumsy, I didn't even know how to make conversation. Even after two years of being done with High School, I still remember all those days that I sat alone at lunch.... not having anyone to talk to. 

Living off on my own at college increased my social skills, and I don't think I'm as awkward, clumsy, or ugly as I used to be, but I don't have any real friends. Sure, there's people I do schoolwork with, and people that I see at church/club meetings, but I don't have any friends to hangout with, any friends who invite me to activities (I don't think any of these people would hangout with me... they're just nice to me in the hallways or want to do school work with me) . How can I make friends both here in my hometown, and back in college? 

School was always so important to me, I always got by in life focusing on the next exam, the next test. In highchool, I spent my weekends focusing on the SAT and AP testing. I was filled with a desire to get into an Elite School and prove my worth to all those who had ever made fun of me. When I got rejected by the elite schools, I focused all my time and energy into getting into my major in college. I was determined to get into Mechanical Engineering at my current University. Now that I have no more goals left in academia than to graduate, I realize how meaningless all of this is without friends. I realize that I've never had any friends and now I desperately want to fit in. 

Is it possible for me to make good friends, people I can joke with and laugh with? I've also never been in a relationship with a girl is it possible for me to get a girlfriend? I want these things so badly I think i am going to cry. Being lonely sucks, I hate this constant emptiness. I literally can't stand it.... sometimes, I think about suicide.... but  I wouldn't put my family through that suffering. What can I do? I'm willing to do almost anything to end this pain.

TL;DR : I've never had friends or a girlfriend and now I desperately want these things, how can I get them?",23May2017,1
100,"Wow. This is a pretty heavy first post. I sound mad. 

Background: From a very young age I was manipulated by someone very close to me. Told how to feel and what to think, what to say and how to do things. Literally groomed to act a certain way. I've always been more observant than actually engaging and functioning. I eventually got out of the situation and out of that small town. I met my boyfriend and he is the best thing to happen to me. I value many things in my life, but he truly makes me happy.

Why I Feel I Might Be Depressed: Whenever I feel strongly about something, I sometimes physically feel that I cannot act.  Mostly during intimate situations, my chest tightens and my jaw locks. My stomach sinks and I instantly blame myself for being uselessly stubborn. I feel exhausted all of the time and must actually force myself to be enthusiastic.  But, is this overwhelming anxiety and pain what depression feels like?

Where I'm going with this: He and I both have our quirks and our own independent nature. I've never (of my own volition) wanted to be close to someone like I do him. I'd almost rather cut my own tongue out than bring up something he doesn't want to talk about. I try to reason that if it's important to us, he would talk about it. Yet there's always the malicious discontent and feeling that he's not actually open with me. I do my best not to over react or reading into things.  I don't ask questions about his previous relationship, because I'm afraid it would hurt him. I only know that there were some odd issues and that the parting was frustrating for him. I have tried to use Reddit twice before, because many of my close friends use it and find useful and humorous endeavors here. Both times I found myself stalking the username he too often uses, and both times I regretted it. The first was early in our relationship. He had an old (now removed) post about his trouble with the relationship he had with his previous girlfriend. The second was over a year ago, talking about how his ""cheating ex"" still sends emails wanting to get together.  Neither are significant about how he actually feels, yet I cannot help thinking that he is hurting or still feeling some regret toward their relationship ending. It has become increasingly difficult to get past these crushing thoughts when I want to be close. My mind always swims and I feel like I'm going to vomit every time that I want to bring it up, or anything else that involves my feelings. It's incredibly hard for me to express. I tend to either gush about insignificant feelings as a default or shut down entirely. I only want to know how he feels and to be sure that he is open about things that are important to him. I have brought up the feeling before, but usually fold from the pressure of the conversation without really getting my point across about what I want to know.

Just trying to sort out the real problem.  I want to bring up the posts soon, but fear he may misunderstand me again. Thoughts?",23May2017,1
102,"I would say I am a patient person who can usually brush off annoyances and not let others affect my life. I have a problem that I feel makes me look very selfish and uncaring but there's only so much patience a person can have. 

A colleague I've been working with for four years now has really gotten under my skin. This has got progressively worse and is at the point now where she can say something quite normal and I will instantly be annoyed. I work in a small open plan office of around so there's nowhere to escape.

Examples of her 'annoying' behaviour:

- Showing off at any opportunity. Including singing and dancing around the office.

- Fishing for compliments. Or, on receiving a compliment, repeating that story to everybody multiple times for days, weeks, months.

- Exaggeration. If she has a cold she is the sickest person in the world and will take every opportunity to mention said cold to anybody and everybody.

As an example we are going though a very busy period in work. This girl has the least work on her plate (I know because I organise the work schedule) yet insists on loudly complaining about how busy she is. This is really insensitive to other staff who are so busy they have had to work weekends. 

- Major mood swings - one moment she will be skipping around the office, another she will be crying at her desk about being stressed. 

Now, I do actually feel there is something not right here and that she should go to a therapist. I feel really bad for getting so irritated by her but it is bringing my own mood down at work. I'm quite a reserved person so a major worry is that one day I will snap and act unprofessional. 

At first I was really friendly with this girl. We went to the gym after work and spent lunch times together
I slowly started noticing her behaviour and started distancing myself. She seemed to become more intense after this, either that or I have just become more sensitive to the behaviour that I find annoying.

Anyway fast forward a couple years and I now avoid speaking to this girl as much as I can. I check that she is not in the bathroom or kitchen before I leave my desk but she usually follows me and tries to talk to me. My main problem is that it affects my mood daily having her in the office. On days when she is off I feel much more relaxed. 

I don't feel it's really my place to tell her she needs to go to a therapist.. Even so the main reason I haven't 8is because I'm afraid of the emotional backlash. She's overly sensitive, I have seen her cry over a lot less so I don't think anyone in the office could deal with that reaction. 

What would you do?

TLDR; I have a colleague who is very annoying. Some behaviour is worrying and I do think she needs to see a therapist. It's gotten to the point where everything she does or says annoys me. This is affecting my work and is unavoidable as we work in the same team in a small office.",23May2017,1
103,"Here's what I've tried on my cat:
Revolution - one month, he's almost due for the next one. It didn't seem to make a difference
Baths - he absolutely HATES water. Freaks out when we try so they're usually rushed and we never find any fleas after
Dawn on a brush without water - this went decently, but I worry about it drying out his skin so I didn't do it again
Brushing - this works okay, but really it just seems like they jump off and onto everywhere but him, so it doesn't seem like it helps any. We kill a decent amount but they always come back. Maybe we don't do it often enough?
Lemon spray - I've heard this works, something to do with the citrus. He just gave us dirty looks and ran when we tried to spray him
Flea collar - I didn't see much of a difference, and after doing more research wasn't a fan of the reviews so we didn't try again

On top of fleas he has super bad dandruff/sensitive skin, so I don't like to do anything that could irritate it. I've heard baths are good, but then heard that baths once a week will dry out their skin. It seems like if you don't do it at least once a week it won't help anything though? I try to brush him at least 3 times a week, but really it just seems to make the fleas mad and then they bite us. He sheds SO much, I'm ready to just shave him at this point. I don't like using a ton of chemicals on him, I didn't really want to use the Revolution but I figured I'd give it a shot. It didn't seem to help any. Also, we don't have carpet and he doesn't go outside. Not sure if it really matters but I figured I'd include it.  ",23May2017,1

107,"So I tend to probably be a bit more of the serious and used to change in order to better myself as I've learned that the good things tend to come to me through harder work and usually doing things we don't want to do. I've dedicated myself to keeping my health in order ever since i had medical issues in 2009. I had a simple discussion about this morning when I was looking to wake up at a decent hour in order to prepare for the day and tasks ahead. I had quite a few things I wanted to get done because I own my own business, wanted to get a workout (as well as help my girlfriend achieve the workout goals she set for herself), and was going to cook a meal for my girlfriend and I to take to lunch in order to save some money. We have entrusted each other to wake up on time primarily via her alarms because I'm the annoying guy who sets 4-6 alarms in the morning spaced out because I sometimes don't hear them and want to make sure I get up. Things have been fine however i noticed that we tend to wake up later and later and later. We didn't wake up because she decided to ignore her alarms in order to sleep in and I literally didn't have time to do anything that I needed to complete before driving her to work. 

Fast forward to literally awhile ago...

We're about to fall asleep and I let her know we were going to wake up at about 9AM (8 hours of sleep) and I set my alarm in order to make sure we start getting up on time like we've been wanting to. She stated that she saw me set my alarm for 8:45 AM and began to pretty much complain about it. My response was pretty simple, stating that I'm just going to make sure we get up on time. She tends to set several alarms before waking up but they're spaced out nearly a half an hour, mine are every 5 minutes till I get up. She then responded saying, ""Well then I'm not going to stay here anymore if that's the case"". 

I responded with, "" Well, I don't want that to happen, but if that's what you want to do then I don't really have a choice in the matter.""  (I know, this was very blunt and came off like I don't care. But the reality is if she really meant what she said I don't have a say in whether she stays or not)

So then she basically gets quiet and I told her I love her and goodnight, basically she doesn't respond and does a pouting flip to sleep i suppose... and I asked her what's wrong and she responds with what i wrote up top. 

I'm the kind of guy when i feel there's a problem I speak up and share what is being portrayed or at least an interpretation that i receive in the hopes of a better explanation so that we communicate on a deeper, sincere, and honest level. All it seems like is whenever it's appropriate or good for her she will let the pot stir and plays the blame game on quite a few things if not everything that goes on. 

Am I crazy for always wanting to solve an issue at the source with honesty? Or am I still being the insensitive one simply because she doesn't want to talk about something and would prefer to go to sleep or for a whole day without discussing a solution or communicating the way things are being perceived?

111,"Hello Everyone,

New account here, mainly because I feel like I am going to be needing a new one in the upcoming weeks.

As of, 5 hours ago my girlfriend of 3 years and the person I am currently living with dumped me. Obviously, this has shaken me a bit to the core and I honestly feel a bit helpless. I've stayed up all night doing various things because I can't fall asleep on the couch and there's no way in hell I'm going to share a bed with someone who doesn't love me anymore. So here's the scenario.

* We just renewed our lease for a 2 bedroom apartment. The lease is set to start on June 1st and last until May 2018.
* I do not have many friends anymore. Most of them have gotten married and moved to other parts of the state (easily an hour or two away from my current residence and job) and others have just grown distant.
* I can't move home with my family.

Throughout these five hours, I've thought up of a couple scenarios, but I feel like I am clearly dumbstruck, and rightfully freaking out. I mean this was a girl I was genuinely considering marrying and she, out of the blue, decided that she's not into it anymore which is fine... she's entitled to do whatever she wants with her life, but I need to react to it and try to give me the best chance of success.

Anyways, here goes

* I've run the numbers. If she were to move out, I could afford the rent and not be dipping into my savings unless there is an unexpected expense. The downside to this is that I would not be saving as much (if any).
* If she were to say we could be roommates, I could get a bed and fit it into the second bedroom (that I've been using as an office). I fear that this is a bad scenario for both of us because right now I'm sad and definitely heart broken but I don't resent her.
* I've started looking to apartments using Padmapper, and one bedroom apartments that allow me to bring my cat along are about 600 dollars cheaper per month, but are a lot farther away from my job.
* I still have absolutely no idea how to make friends. This is something I'm worried about but unrelated to this.
* I could move to a new apartment, but I genuinely dislike my job. I was staying here to be with her. However, if she decides she wants to break the lease and move out, I won't have any place to live, so I need something, even if I were to try and leave.

Thankfully, I can leave for work in an hour, then I am going away for a couple days to celebrate my mother's birthday. I really do not expect us to get back together. It seems she's pretty set on it.

I apologize for rambling, I've been up for almost 24 hours now... But any advice at all?",23May2017,3
112,"Ignorance is bliss.

Some background info: I am one of those people with an existential crisis. I'm extremely afraid of death and the fact that my life is going to end. Sometimes I have panic attacks in the middle of the night due to this fear. 
And recently, the notion that life is meaningless has affected my daily life. I can't appreciate things as much anymore. When Arsenal misses out on top four or my Melbourne Demons lose a match I don't feel the frustration that I used to feel. When I walk home from school by myself I am almost emotionless. Talking to my friends is like a type of antibiotics, it helps short term but doesn't solve anything and eventually I'm afraid that it's effectiveness will wane.

I understand that many morbid people have come to reddit and posted their depictions of their fears of death, and what occurs after death.
I've read many of these posts, and thus have been pointed in the direction of different opinions and views on death, including philosophically and scientific articles about death.
I recently read some Richard Dawkins article and blogs about Richard Dawkins' views on death, and the ensuing responses and comments. And to be frank, I find them incredibly pretentious and unfathomable. And frightening.

One commenter said that we are just the result of chemical reactions occurring and that we are all part of a grand process. And that is the most fucking scary part about life. It's a process. The Big Bang occurs, the universe is born. The universe collapses. Rinse and repeat. This process has occurred infinite amount of times and will occur an infinite amount of times. We don't mean anything as all historical records will be abolished.

Richard Dawkins expresses delight at the thought that one day, someone will sit on the grass that grows where his body has been buried. He expresses excitement that the universe is going to continue to grow?

One of my friends told me his philosophy on life. That life is what you make of it. It's like the plank on a pirate ship, that you keep walking and walking until you eventually fall off. How is that supposed to calm my fears? There's still the bloody jump off the plank to be afraid of.

The above notions are terrifying. Completely terrifying. No matter how much I love my parents and my sister and eventually my wife and kids, no matter how much I try to achieve for human society, no matter how much money U earn or happiness I obtain, I mean nothing.

I can't summate into words how fucking ridiculously scary this is. Sometimes I just scream at these prospects; my family asks me what's wrong and I just say that I saw a spider. But obviously it isn't true.

I've considered going to my school counsellor, but I don't think this is an issue for them. They aren't proficient in neuroscience or philosophy or chemistry or physics. Why should I heap this burden on them?
If our consciousness is an illusion, then why have we been given the ability to learn, to change, to adapt, and to mature. What's the point of maturing if there isn't an end result. 

Going back to my first statement. I completely agree with this adage. The joy of being a young boy, the pure anger when I fought with my sister, the pure taste of my parents' cooking. The sadness of my dad leaving to work in China. The disappointment at losing a tennis final. The pure frustration at my teachers.

I'm not even 18. I'm barely mature, but if at this stage of my life, I'm already so scared of the future, then what am I going to be when I fully mature.

Is immaturity a virtue and a blessing?

I really just want to go back to a couple of months ago. No thoughts of death. None completely. Just pure emotions. Pure bliss. Procrastination. Getting slapped by my dad. Punching, and getting punched by my sister. Crying and getting consoled by my mum. The pains of learning Chinese VCE

I can really understand why people are religious. Ten thousand years ago, there is no doubt people were afraid of death, and so they created a fantasy for them to believe in. I completely endorse that and tbh, I'm considering taking up religion. But I really just want to live a normal life. Find love(or not). Have kids. Watch one of my favourite sports teams finally win a title. Get sad after watching an anime.

I also can't understand why our emotions exist in their current state. Our brains are capable of processing so much information and so many thoughts. Why are we equipped with this when it is irrelevant in the end.

To conclude, one of my group of friends on the train said ""That's a depressing topic to talk about,"" when one of us mentioned war and death. And strewth, that's true. 
So how should I go about this? How can I rediscover that ignorance? How can I accept death? How can religion save me?

I did somehow, but I figure I need to make some type of move irl. Do I just say hi, or be casual about this? I'm not sure what I should do. I know she's extremely anxious too, because she told me.

128,"im a 25yr female i work at a bar and just recently got out of a long relationship. it was girls night out my best friend had planned. went bar hopping, had quite a few drinks ended the night at my bar. having my last drink and talking to my boss she introduced me to a guy i have never seen in the bar before but she seemed to know him so i felt comfortable. me and my friend (also my roommate) end up leaving to go to a different bar already been to 4. the guy wants to come. ok we leave in separate cars and end up the bar is closed. decide to get ciders and beer and come back to our apartment. end up playing a drinking game listening to music...have a pretty hard buzzed at this point. friend makes us all some food and end up going to lay down in my room....the guy follows me. 

*meat of the story*
we start kissing and touching. we take our clothes off etc. fooling around. he starts being really dominant and using a lot of force. he starts choking me (ive always liked that) but hes doing it so hard and long i cant breathe and am literally gasping and pulling at his arm. he sucked on my boobs very hard, and kept spanking me a lot to where i was saying ouch. he was biting me and at times holding me down to where i couldn't move. usually i like things a little kinky but he was very aggressive. he goes down on me and tries licking my butt which i am so not into butt stuff at all..i tell him no i don't like that. i would try and kiss him and rub gently down his arms to make him be in more of a romatic mood...it would work for a little. he finger fucked me so hard at first it felt good but he made me bleed (which i didnt notice until today) and it would hurt. he then was holding me down and tried sticking his finger in my butt and it hurt so bad i told him stop and had to push him off me. i cried and stood by my dresser and he asked if i was ok and said sorry and was hugging me. i put my clothes on and told him i was going to bed. 

this morning i woke up and had bruises all over my neck, boobs, and ass. my legs have bite marks on them and im very sore. he was gone when i woke up but left me his number on a piece of paper in my room. im feeling so confused right now.

is this normal behavior for a guy to be so rough? i want to text him and send pics of my bruises and see what he says and block him. i feel he was being abusive and didn't care. i hope he doesnt come into my work bc i dont want to see him.
has anyone gone through a rebound hookup like this? ive never had a bf leave me with bruises and so hurt. i told my roommate and asked her what she thought and she said maybe he was a little too drunk (which he was) and didn't notice how rough he was being. what am i feeling, what should i do?

TLDR: had a hookup with a guy who was very aggresive and dominant and ended up hurting me and leaving me with bruises all over my body. bad bruises. is this normal? was he just drunk? do you think he knew what he was doing? should i contact him and tell him how bad he hurt me? i dont want to see him again.

129,"I've been talking to this girl for about two months now and things have been great. We text and Snapchat each other daily and whenever I'm in town we always meet up and do something. She just got out of a relationship and has told me she's not ready to start another one just yet. I've told her that I'm okay with that because she's worth the wait. 

However, yesterday we were talking and I asked her what she considered us to be because we aren't just friends. We hug, kiss, and cuddle and do all things people in a relationship do without calling it that. She said we should slow things down because, again, she's not ready for a serious relationship yet. I said that I was fine with that but asked her if we should stop kissing and hanging out like we do. She said that she never said that she wants that to stop and she just wants things to be good between us.

131,"A couple of my friends, let's name them Bob and Sue, have been having a number of... disagreements lately. Sue has depression and anxiety, and last spring when she came out as gay, she was harshly bullied and Bob's friend was a main offender, even doing some potentially illegal things. 

Fast forward to January, and Bob tells Sue that he needs a break from helping her out. The original problem is gone, and the main focus now is helping Sue recover a bit from the things that have been happening. At this point, Bob has become one of Sue's absolute closest friends, and even though it's a bit strange, we agreed that it made sense to take a short leave from the situation.

Except he never came back.

A few weeks ago, Sue decided to try and remove Bob from her life as much as possible, as she realized that the reason it hurt so much when he vanished was because she felt too close to him. Bob went off the rails at this, saying that the entire thing was her fault and that he was the victim.

I've been trying to fix these relations, as I don't want to have to choose between friends or have my friend groups fall apart. In texting Bob about the situation, he revealed his reasoning on what was going on:

""Listen, I'm going to tell you something. You're going to call me a liar, and then I'm going to tell it to you again. You are being manipulated. You have become [Sue]'s unknowing pawn and you don't even see it. [Sue] has this ability to make situations like this, force two people against each other, rally others against them and tear friendships apart.""

What should I do? It seems like he's trying to stay out of the wrong by making Sue into a comic-book villain, and he's dead serious.

133,"I have extreme DPDR and mild depression. I have no idea who I am, who I want to be, what career I want, what people I want to be around, what I am interested in, anything. I don't feel human I have no natural instincts I feel like a consciousness in a vessel.

A few months ago I recently decided to lose weight and so far I've lost 100 pounds in 4 months, I mention this just to show I am capable of doing good things when i decide I want to do something. The issue is, I can't decide on anything.

Nothing in my life is what I want it to be. Relationships, location, career, spare time usage, hobbies and interests etc. I don't know how to improve my life since I have no better idea of what is better in my head.

I practise mindfullness every day, I bike 15km every day, I only drink water (or whisky when I go out with friends), I don't want some cutesy bullshit like routine and all that to get me out of a rut, don't get me wrong it's been great for me it just doesn't even nudge the fundamentally broken parts of me.

I earn Â£6 an hour and can't afford therapy, and the wait list for CBT is upto 18 months on the NHS. 

Every day I get closer to snapping and I'm not sure what that even means but I can't continue with the routine where I am, who I am with, and what I do.

I have about Â£2000 saved but I don't know what to do with it. I was thinking of either moving away, but where? and what job? Or I was thinking of solo travelling, but where? and why? and to do what?

I don't want someone to tell me what to do, I want someone to tell me what steps I should take. Eg, ""go to South East Asia for a month, it will change you!"" something like ""Travelling could benefit you because __, ___, and __.""

136,"Hi guys I've created this throw away account as it's important this doesn't get back to a lot of people in my life the why will become clear shortly

Also disclaimer this is a bit of a sob story I'm not after sympathy just advice

I am a single 32 year old father of two kids (details of kids kept obscure on purpose) we lost their mother a several months ago and I'm struggling with the loss as well as the isolation. I work in London two days a week the rest I work from home. I stay in a hotel in London over night when I work here leaving my kids with their grandparents (on the mothers side) the rest of the time they are at child minders or with me. 

I adore my kids I will do anything for them which is why I keep this job (that I hate) that takes me away from them one night a week (which I also hate), it means they can have everything they will ever need as I get paid well which makes it worth it. 

I have no family or what I would call friends and their grandparents are trying to find reasons to take the kids away from me (they have no reason besides me being away one night a week and them believing a single dad can't cut it and that I'm dealing with depression) so our relationship is strained, this is why I'm writing this on a throwaway as if any of it got back to them they might use it against me. 

None of this is the problem, my problem is the isolation. I crave every day human warmth and affection, I miss it more then anything from my partner but I am no where near ready to try for another relationship or to deal with those kind of emotions which is why I thought I'd try what me and my partner always talked and joked about.....swinging 

We had a lot of fun talking about this and what we would do and were both very close to actually taking this up before she passed, we were both very open minded, adventurous and, well, kinky!

I've looked into sites etc that advertise this kind of thing but have no luck meeting anyone because (I think) I'm so secretive about my life away from that side of things plus I only have one night per week where I'm actually free 

I'm not looking for multiple partners or one nighters and I don't want to lie about my intentions to get what I want. I was thinking along the lines of a friend with benefits type thing where we can go to swingers clubs and stuff like that just for fun and to help me escape the pressures on me while not giving my parents in law any more ammo to use against me

So the advice I seek is this:

How do I go about finding someone like this if there even is anyone like this?

Or should I even be trying? shouldn't I just deal with the isolation so I can do right by my kids and not risk giving their grandparents a leg to stand on

Or am I just being a knob? 

I go back and forth on this a lot also, in advance of people recommending it, I refuse to pay for that kind of thing (other then in dinners and gifts and things of course!) 

Your advice will be greatly appreciated ",23May2017,1
137,"2 years ago I lost my sister in a freak accident. Ever since her death, I've become depressed and had no motivation to do anything. My sister passed away in the beginning of my final year of highschool, so each day after her passing I grew less and less motivated to get out of bed and go to school, days grew to weeks then became months. (I was absent for a total of 52 days straight. Because of this I was not able to graduate on time with the rest of my friends. In my previous highschool years I hung out with the generic ""wrong crowd"" ; kids who cut school to hang out and what not. But around my junior year I got my life back on track, all I needed was to ace my senior year to get out with everyone else, but clearly I couldn't. I decided to keep the ""I wasn't able to graduate"" conversation from my current 2 year long relationship while he/she went off to college. The only people who know are family, my best friend of 16 years and it's significant other. I trusted them all to not to tell. They never did. Now I find myself in a program for young adults who failed highschool but still have a shot at a diploma (not a ged). In the beginning it was okay, I would go 4 days a week monday-thursday and sit for 3 classes each day. Sooner or later depression hovered heavy over my shoulders, I began to lie. I would tell my parents ""i didn't have class"" or ""class is cancelled today"" soon it became an every week excuse. When I did ""stay home"" I'd sleep. *note my sleeping schedule is very horrible (staying up till 6-9am and sleeping till 8pm.)if I wasn't asleep i would sit back and distract myself with drawing art and playing online videogames. Now that it's coming to the end of the term for the program, I lied even more, I convinced my parents that I was graduating, I had instant regret as soon as I did so. I hate myself that I've become this way, i also know I need to face the truth eventually. But that truth is I can't see myself doing this program without attempting suicide. In my mind, i shame myself everyday on how terribly i act. (Think the devil and angel on each shoulder scenario). I'm currently trying to find a way to get a Ged through online courses (even tho I have a bad record at doing Any online courses through highschool) so I can at least get a good job and provide for a family in the coming future. I want to make my parents proud, but I feel I've lost that ability after I lied to them about being able to obtain my diploma this August. I want to make things right and I want them to understand that doing this program has been the worst experience for me, and help them see that this is the only way I can truly be able to succeed. All I need is their support but I don't know if I can get it. 

*thank you to anyone who took the time to read this*

Tldr; I'm a depressed/suicidal highschool drop out who lied to their lover about graduating, and lied to to their parents about ""going to be able to graduate this summer"". Who also wants to fix their mistake and get their GED because school just isn't for them anymore, but doesn't know how to go about doing so.

138,"I did quite well in school, but it really isn't translating into any real life success for me.

I graduated college in 2013, I took accounting and had a fairly decent GPA of 4.12 (out of 5). I thought I was pretty much set at this point.

I considered taking an accounting designation at first, but I figured I should get some basic experience as a bookkeeper or accounting assistant first. I came to find that when I entered the workforce, I was incredibly sloppy in my work, basically dysfunctional; I couldn't hold a job in that field for more than a few weeks. See, I've always been quite absent minded, I can't focus, I can't keep track of things and lose shit constantly, I'm extremely forgetful; one of my teachers described me as ""The man who would find the cure to cancer and then lose it.""

 I ended up just working as a cashier at Walmart for a few years.

Fast forward to 2015, I (for some reason, even though I already had the college diploma, what was I even thinking?) thought it would be a good idea to pursue a bachelor's in commerce majoring in marketing, so I moved back in with my parents and did just that.

2017, my parents move, I need to start making money again ASAP, so I withdraw from university. I moved in February and I've been through 3 jobs since then, a door-to-door job which was commission only and basically a pyramid scheme (I left this one, wasn't fired), A warehouse job where I didn't make it through training because the trainers considered me a ""fucking hazard"" on the machinery, and now I've been a shift manager at a Pizza Hut for 2 weeks.

I feel like I'll be losing this Pizza Hut job any day now; no individual task is really that difficult, but I keep forgetting how to do certain things correctly, I'm forgetting to put things away, my work is just outright sloppy, I'm having a hard time working at the pace that I need to work, and I can't multitask as well as the boss would like me to. The boss is getting incredibly frustrated with me, telling me ""we're slinging pizzas, not making rockets"" and ""If you can't think for yourself then how can I expect you to tell other people how to do their jobs?""

If I'm too stupid to work at a god damned pizza hut, then I don't know what I'm going to do with my life. I just want to be a productive member of society.

139,"So about 2 months ago, by best friend from Grade 5 had a farewell party, to which I was invited. Too many people didn't pitch up, but the person in question here (whom I shall call Dave) did. That Monday at school, Dave was having a conversation with his friends (including me) about a party he would throw for his birthday. He was chatting with me too so I assumed that I would be invited too.

A little background about me: I am in Grade 11, and I was (still am to an extent) a very antisocial person. I used to spend breaks at the library and never really talked much to anyone. I am trying hard to become more social and come out of my shell. Dave is a person I started hanging out with and making friends with.

fast forward to yesterday, when I found out from a mutual friend that Dave was throwing a HUGE birthday party, inviting pretty much everybody from our grade, but I wasn't invited. I even walked up to him and asked: ""So when are you having that birthday party?"" to which he replied ""I haven't planned it out yet"" and walked away. I found out from the mutual friend that it is this Saturday.

At this point, I'm quite hurt. I don't even know if I have any good friends that I can count on, the friend I thought I had lied to my face about a party that he didn't want me in. maybe he thinks I'm too ""uncool"" for his party.

142,"I've recently run into an issue with my direct manager at work (I work in IT services for a major bank). Recently, this manager has started acting hostile to multiple team members; as the lowest ranking, I seem to get the brunt of it. Sending nasty/passive aggressive notes, calling out (apparent) errors in open meetings, etc. 

Today, I called in sick for the first time in 6+ months. I sent an email in the early AM to my manager letting them know I was feeling ill and would continue to work from home. 

The note was then forwarded to EVERYONE in the department, in a way I feel was meant to make me appear as a poor worker to the executives. This isn't the first time he's copied execs in messages trying to call me out; however, the execs tend to like me and I can usually respond appropriately and quell any potential fires.

-
I'm in my final year of middle school and the 8th grade always gets to do fun stuff. This week is the annual trip to Washington DC and I'm not able to go because my family can't afford it. It's $800 for one person and I knew if I went my brother who's going to college this year would get short handed. We're pretty low income all around. My dad's too sick to work and my mom works 3 jobs. I love my parents with all of my heart and I know that they try their best to get me what I want but I knew it was too much to ask, so I let it go. I am a straight A student and I was kind of bummed that all of the kids who are failing school and disrespectful to teachers get to go just because they can afford it, but I'm not trying to get upset over it. I know the money will go towards my brother's tuition and I'm content with that.

What I'm not content with, however, is the kids at school. I live in an area where many families are upper middle class. Personally, I live in a mobile home park on the outskirts of my town. I want to live in a bigger house that doesn't have the negative connotation of the one I'm currently in, but once again, I'm not going to stress over it.

Today in school, I was sitting, minding my own business when a kid in my grade asked me if I was going to DC. I said no, and he said ""Why? Is it because your family is poor?"" I was shocked that he said that. Ive been friends with this kid for a long time and his mom is great. He says racially motivated stuff (I'm black) but I've always just brushed it off as typical immature behavior. I was deeply hurt by what he said so I just told him to go away. Later in class, I was scrolling through social media and a post from my neighbor popped up. The same kid came behind me looking over my shoulder and said ""Is that your neighbor that lives in your trailer park too?"" He said it so loud and everyone was looking at me and I wanted to die. I was so embarrassed and tried to ignore it.

This kind of thing has happened before too. Another boy in my grade, separate from today's incident, was walking with me. We were talking about the bad weather that day and the weather warnings and he said ""Watch out, tornados hit the trailer parks first"". I cried a bit that day, and today too. I don't know why the racist jokes didn't get to me, but the ones about my living situation did. I'm a nice person and friends with a lot of people, so I don't get it. I know my family is struggling but I would think people wouldn't let that define how they look at me and instead choose to look at me for me.
I guess my question is how do I get thicker skin when it comes to this? I'm really not that emotionally sensitive person but I just feel really betrayed by kids I thought I was cool with and they turn around and hit me where it hurts. Sorry if this is incoherent.

Just to clarify, the trip is this Wednesday and with all of the complicated forms and arrangements it just isn't possible for me to try and go at this point. Buses and rooms have already been set in stone. I'm disappointed but it's out of my hands at this point.

**tl;dr**Kids at my school are being rude over my being low class and not able to afford fancy things and trips. How do I cope?

145,"I was caught with ecstasy in my house which I was using to support myself and my addiction. I left school before finishing earlier this year and ever since then it has all gone downhill. I made excuses for myself and was surrounded with a lot of stress which lead me to use drugs regularly and in turn sell to afford, which brought on even more stressful situations. Finally my house was raided at night and they basically got me for ~500 eur worth of ecstasy and a gram of marijuana. This was very recent and after it happened I realised my life has taken a huge turn downhill. I want to sort it out, but I don't know how.. I'm awaiting to be questioned further, the police caught me off guard and lead me to incriminate myself, also waiting for a court date and I'm not in a position to give them anyone either..

146,"So I have two jobs to pick from. One of them is Frito lay. The hours are long but I receive overtime and a pension. Sadly it takes awhile to get in. I'm waiting on a phone call to schedule the last part of the interview process which leads to a job. I recently called the gentleman who interviewed me and he said he had to talk to hiring manager but ""Things are moving in the right direction for you""
Now I also interviewed and was offered a job with a beer merchandising company Amoskag. They give me a company car with guaranteed days off. Now the benefits are the same for both companies. Matching 401ks but Amoskag offers no pension. 
Though Frito Pays more but it's 50 hours minimum working up to 60. The beer company is 40 hours during the winter but summer time I can get up to 60.  
I image the heavy lifting must get old after awhile. While frito is just chips.

148,"I am currently in my last semester of my masters in business but I don't feel even slightly excited about any of the jobs that would be relevant to my degree. I have always loved animals and have wanted to work with them my whole life but when I chose my degree after high school, my mum who has a lot of control over me discouraged me from taking this path as it wouldn't generate much income. Also I'm really squeamish when it comes to blood and guts so this was also an influencing decisions.

When I finished my bachelors in business I just wasn't ready to slave away at a job that I wouldn't even like so I decided to go onto my masters. I do enjoy it a bit more now that it's more specialised but I still can't get excited about the potential jobs I could be getting into. 

I am not interested in becoming a vet as I'm not keen on having to deal with people and I'm just not strong enough to put down animals on a regular basis. I was looking at some animal related courses and there was a degree called wildlife science which sounded like something I would love. My concerns are however that I am now 25 years old, in a shit tonne of uni debt with virtually no experience (I have been supporting myself with retail work). Should I just stick to a job related in business? Maybe I could try that out for a bit and see how I like it? Or should I follow my dream so that I don't regret it down the track? Is there anyone with experience working with animals that could perhaps give me an alternative solution?

Lately I've had a few down points in my life. (recent death of a friend by suicide, ongoing serious illness in oneself) 
I used to like being comforted with hugs, but now I just get annoyed at people who hug me when I'm upset. 
This is quite confusing for me, as I still like hugs when I'm feeling happy/fine, just not when I'm sad or angry!
When I am in a negative mood, I still like the presence of a person to talk to, but I don't know to say I don't want to be hugged without getting in a worse mood or more upset.

150,"I am a 24 fresh out of grad school. I was offered two positions yesterday and the HR people said I had 24 hours to decide on both.

One is an entry level position at a large cool company that does really interesting things. It has a large beautiful office and lots of young hip people work there. The position is probably more for someone fresh out of undergrad. I am really excited about the position because it is on a team that does innovative research. In addition there are lots of opportunities for advancement at the company once you worked there for two years. The company is in the city that I would like to live in but only pays around $50,000 a year.

The second job offer is at a slightly smaller company 30 minutes outside of the city. It is very specific to my graduate degree and they are expecting me to be a whizz kid and figure a lot of stuff out. I'm a little scared to take on that much responsibility and the last person who was in the position was fired. I would be coming in at a level that it would take me three or so years to advance to at the other company. However I would be the youngest person in the office by far and I am scared I would make no friends at work which is important to me. The job pays $70,000 per year with bonus.

I know I am extremely lucky to have two job offers, but the stress of having to choose between two great opportunities is making me feel a bit sick.

152,"Hi - 

I know there are tons of different opinions on what I should do with my money right now, but I want to know what would be the smartest decision. Currently I am in college (4-year) and will have around $30k worth of debt from student loans. I live with my parents so I have a part time job year round. It sucks because I missed out on all of the college experience, but having a job is rewarding because I get to make some money and I'm saving money living at home. Originally, I had hopes of putting my money into a nice newer car since I live at home and spend most of the time in my car between school and work, but I would have not a lot left over. However I had second thoughts, because ideally I would rather be buying a nice house in my mid 30's. How do these people in their mid 30's / early 40's afford 600k even 700k homes? What did they do to afford such nice big houses, and at the same time drive Audi's, BMW's, Mercedes, etc. and have money to buy nice things?

156,"My dad died today. There is a long history but basically he was an alcoholic and violent towards my mum and later us (his kids) before we left him in 2006. We had on and off contact. We haven't spoken since 2013. The last time I saw him he was so so skinny, so frail and drinking 6 bottles of wine a day. We had a good time together but it made me too sad to carry on our relationship. I just couldn't bear to look at him. About a year ago he messages me on fb saying something like ""my beautiful daughter, so grown up, I am so proud of you"". I blocked his profile and deleted the message because it was too painful to drag it all up again. A few months later I kind of realised life is too short and I wanted to contact him and try to have a relationship. I looked for him everywhere, even finding our old family home up for sale and calling the estate agents to try and pass along my details. I never found him. Today my mum calls me down and tells me my dad died of a heart attack in the early hours of this morning. I can't cope knowing that he died thinking us (his old family) hated him and didn't want anything to do with him. He was a monster sometimes but deep down I think he was a good person. He just didn't know how to show it. Any advice on how to cope with this? I'm devastated. RIP Dad I'm really sorry and I love you :(",23May2017,95

168,"So basically, all my life I've made friends who have turned out to be low-key... less than savoury.

I'm not one to judge people based on other people's opinions unless they have actually done something. (""One time, she punched my two-year-old sister in the face!"") I speak to people and make the judgements based on what I see and not rumours. If I hear a rumour, I'll confront them about it and see what they say.

My first 'best-friend' until I was about 12, but I'd decided I wasn't really his friend from waay before that. I started realising he was weird when he wouldn't wash or wear deodorant and had his mum wash him down instead of just going to shower himself (we were on holiday together and when I saw that, I decided I wasn't lowering my standards just because we were 'friends'). He was boring to hang out with by this point because he kept isolating himself - even from me.

Next friend, when I moved into her class, she was nice and I thought she was only coming across as an outsider because she had different hobbies. A gamer - we were meant to go out when I slept over at her house but she was glued to Minecraft (something that reminded me of my first friend). She kept claiming this girl was being 'horrid' to her when really all she was doing was getting along with her friends better than she was. So basically, an overly-jealous introvert. 

I remember at one point we were walking to her house past another school and she started panicking about how they were dangerous and how she was carrying (a knife, we're in England) and she threw her knife behind a neighbour's bush. Self-defence isn't weird, it was just the way she was acting at the time, which is hard to describe and similar to how she acted when she was telling me about how horrid the girl who was taking her friends was. 

It wasn't until after I un-friended her that her behaviour got weirder. She side-lined me for this other girl and would make comments at my expense all the time (I was busy chatting up this guy in my class with her, so I didn't really give a shit lol) and I remember one time she had this outburst saying she asked her parents if there was something wrong with her or something. Then there was her lack of enthusiasm towards anything except for picking on this 'lesbian' (They came out as a trans man later but said he was a lesbian at the time - he told a shit ton of lies about effed up things and ended up an outcast) as if she was somehow better - nobody laughed at her 'jokes'. Especially when he wasn't even there. We could just be talking anything and she'd always make a quip.

So I made friends with this boy and asked if it was okay if I could start hanging round with his group because the girl was... I can't remember what I said, but I just said I didn't want to hang out with her anymore. So I leave class and she comes up to me accusing me of 'chatting shit about her' and I was like ??? Then she said the boy I'd started speaking to said I didn't want to hang around with her any more and I had to ask him what the fuck he was saying (First alarm bell, I should've let it).

The boy goes from being insecure and sometimes saying awkward things to throwing me under the bus all the time when we were around his friends. I could be out of literally nowhere. One thing in particular I remember is him and all his white friends were talking about tanning and they said he doesn't need to tan because hes Chinese. I'm just sitting there, not even in the conversation and he turns around to me and goes 'Why are you tanning for? You're dark enough already!' and then he tried to repeat himself because nobody heard him/paid attention.

His group were always really racist and homophobic towards him so I thought his behaviour was just him not ever having real friends before. I told him to leave the group, but he couldn't. 

The this thing happened where his 'friends' brought up these ancient but fucked up lies he made about his dad being dead and his sister having cancer and his brother getting raped. There went my fucking reputation and friendship.

Before I knew it, him and his mates were just bitter and racist towards me but I didn't really care because I was already out before the time they started getting into bloody fights lol. Bunch of weirdoes.

So lastly, when I was hanging around with that group, this boy would always come over and chat but never actually stay in the group. I started speaking to him more and when he said he was tried of the drama, I agreed and left to hang around with his other friends. Now this boy always got comments saying he was gay and etc. because he's soft spoken. He always remained oblivious to everything going on around him: rumours, events, changes in people's behaviours, etc. I always found it weird that a quiet person wouldn't at least keep their ear to the ground.

He didn't even make an effort with this group he was in. One thing that I found weird when we left school was that I messaged him asking him if he wanted to go somewhere like a week after we finished our exams he was like 'I thought you'd stop speaking to me now we've left school' in this serious and negative kind of way.

So we stayed friends a few years after school and some of the little things he did were just really strange. I didn't really pay attention until after I turned 18. He expressed no interest in getting a job yet complained all the time he had no money. If he said he couldn't be arsed or 'I need a job!' from time to time, it wouldn't come across as weird. I think after he came out to me and told him his parents would be against it, I stopped with the questioning. But later when I realised he wasn't ever talking about himself, I started to keep questioning him and got a bunch of 'I've been up to nothing's and 'Just exams'.

The worst thing that happened was he made an out-of-character and really strange offensive joke about a guy I liked and when I questioned him about it he said 'Well everyone in my college talks like that' which makes literally zero sense because the comment he made wouldn't even make sense coming from him. After this comment, he then went on to tell me that, in few word, the person I'd always seen him with was a pedophile (non-offending apparently) and then started acting like he had no choice but to hang around with him. How many years of 'friendship' a fucking waste.

So I'm thinking to myself there must be a reason why I keep making these 'bottom of the barrel' friends. Maybe I should listen when people call them 'weird'. The boy friends all used to talk about how loyal I was and act like I was Jesus just because I wanted to be friends with them. Maybe that's a sign too. Because it meant they thought they was something wrong with themselves and who am I to disagree?

This is long lol. And I know this isn't the best place to ask but I can't ask someone IRL because it's a hard thing to explain. It's not that I can't make decent friends, it's that the 'weird' friends are always just easier to get a hold of on a weekend and next thing you know, you're spending a lot of time with them without questioning why they're always available. Please ask me some questions if you want me to explain myself more because I don't want to make this any longer.",23May2017,2

179,"Hi guys,

My dad recently lent me $25k to invest/trade (as I had shown consistently shown solid returns on simulators) and it was going fairly well (~$400 in profit) until today. Due to how high-stress day trading was, I wanted to transition to less volatile stocks that are better over a long term. I was tired and anxious, so without thinking I bought ~$8,000 of Google stock, ~$14,000 of Amazon stock, and ~$2,500 of VRTX. I ended up buying on highs for all of them, and now have lost $600 (nearly $200 negative overall). I sold VRTX pretty quickly to cut those losses and have held on to AMZN and GOOG. However, there is a FINRA rule that you cannot make more than 4 trades a week unless your portfolio is greater than $25,000, and mine currently is not, so I am unable to make this back through my previous day trading strategies (with leveraged ETFs). What should I do? I'm currently planning on just letting AMZN and GOOG sit until I break even, but I'm not sure if I will be able to do so. I haven't told my dad yet.

181,"Let's start from beginning. Be warned, some people will not agree with my stance but I am here for advice on how to handle it.

Rewind about 20 years ago, my grandmother pitched ~70,000$ towards buying a cottage with my family. I was about 5 years old, I do not remember much. 

The lot we bought was run down and had no features. No house, no dock, nothing.

My father ended up building the house, making large addons, building 2 docks and maintaining this lot for 10 years. Now, I do not know how much extra she chipped in, but it basically grew into a really nice cottage at her initial investment of $70,000. 

One day we realized that we didn't have time to go to the cottage anymore so we decided to sell the lot. My grandmother at this time was living with us because my grandfather had passed away. Since the lot was in my grandmothers name, she pitched, hey why don't we move to this location on the water. 

Even though my father built the house and maintained it for 10 years. My grandmother insisted the money was hers. It sold for $250,000.

We used that money along side with the sale from our old house to buy the house they are in now. 

Now after ~20 years of my grandmother living with us rent free, my parents are deciding to move into a smaller home. The kids are gone and they do not need so much space.

My grandmother says that they owe her $250,000. She is using that money to get her own apartment. 

Now my grandmother is very, very VERY dependant on my father. She is the type of grandmother who is like ""How do I turn on the Wi-Fi?"" 

Basically she is recieving a giant wake up call as to how much the world cost and she is crying and throwing a fit everytime we say, get out. 

She is 75 years old and very capible. She is very agile and cooks and cleans by her self. She is not ready for a home. 

I believe that she is lazy and refuses to learn how the real world works. She honestly thought that we got tv and internet for free. 

For the past month I have been trying to help her recieve tv and internet for her new apartment. The problem is, its too expensive.

120$ a month with Bell. I am going with Bell because I have gone with 3rd party ISPs in the past and it has not gone well. I do not want her calling me everydays saying ""Oh the internet is slow."" 

I told her its expensive because you want it to be expensive. You want, Channel X and channel Y, and you want unlimited and you want 2 PVRs. ETC ETC

I told her that I am willing to sit down with her, for as long as it takes to teach her about the internet and how to get good deals and how to download etc. But she says its not worth it, because she is too old.


So my final question, is... is being old and excuse for ignorance. I strongly believe that she has no physical or mental borders preventing her from doing this. I strongly believe she is just being lazy and wants to continue to rely on others. 

Not to mention, everyone in my family has a lot of trouble dealing with her. 

Just for some perspective, I just got off talking with her on FB and she said that she doesn't want to move anymore, because all of her neighbors are old. -_-'

183,"Boo hoo, right? So I went through a pretty bad breakup in November - she was my 'The One;' it was one of those almost able to read others' thoughts type of relationship. We were discussing moving in and building a life together after being together in one form or another for 4 years. I'd been in a number of relationships before her and thought for sure that that one was it. Then we broke up after a month long particularly rough patch. Shit. 

So in the wake of that, I moved to the next city over, traveled, did a bit of counseling, had a few flings, reconnected with friends and family, taking care of myself (drank too much but I think that's under control now), etc. Doing a breakup by the book. 

However, I can't shake this feeling of complete aimlessness and disinterest in life. I can literally do anything I want and go wherever I want to now, but none of this freedom or situation is anything that I wanted when it was given to me. Up until 6 months ago I had this future that I was building towards with a woman I loved and loved me in return, but now everything is a blank slate. 

I'm in a dead end job which will end next May (I've interviewed for 10+ jobs in my 'field' in the last two years but it's nothing I went to school for so I'm not nearly as qualified as others and also I can't stand the work :/ ), the relatively successful band that I'm in is dissolving next month, I have no interest in women right now or for the foreseeable future, I'm exhausted all the time but can't really sleep at night, I'm terribly lonely but don't feel like being around people, I'm just.... I don't know.

I don't think I'd kill myself, but there are definitely days where being dead sounds like one hell of a relief. It feels like I've been treading water since November and my legs are getting tired.

186,"Basically, my sister is babysitting her little sister (not related to me due to being half siblings). My sister kinda sucks at her job and often leaves her with nothing to do and gets snippy when she complains about being bored. I've known the kid since she was three or so, and now she is six. I really enjoy her company and think she is a great, plus I have no life at all. So I decided to try to help

The problem is, she is hyper, loud, and doesnt listen to anyone except her parents. Expecially not me. I'm 22 and while kids like me, I'm not good at taking charge.

I have no experience with this. How do I do this babysitting thing?",23May2017,2

188,"Hey,
A group of my friends just pulled a joke on me that was not only alarming but also scared the shit out of me. They prank called me pinging the call from a location on the other side of the country pretending to be an electoral office official. Now I don't like answering un-named calls full stop, let alone when they are from the other side of the damn country. So r/advice I need your help. How do I get them back?

This may seem petty and unnecessary but I **WILL** be ridiculed for weeks about this and am seriously considering if they are my friends (especially how I stick up for one of them horribly often and this is how he returns the favour).

I don't care what it means I have to do nor how much money it will cost. I don't care if it hurts them physically or mentally (I don't want to seriously hurt them though). All I care is to make them the laughing stock.

Again I know it sounds pathetic but this is more than just a return prank.

189,"So a month ago I bought my first sketchbook and decided I want to learn how to ""Art"". At that point, I basically had zero experience. I want to learn how to physically draw/paint, as well as learn digital art further down the road once I become more familiar and confident. So far I have mostly been taking images of things from cartoons/video games I enjoy and try to draw them as accurately I can. Just pencil, no color. I have done a couple acrylic paintings the past 2 weeks as well. I have been drawing probably 2 out of every 3 days on average. It's been fun and I think I have learned a good amount, but I just feel like there are so many techniques and methods I need to start learning and it feels really overwhelming. I don't know where to begin. 3D shapes, perspective, shading, and color are all things I don't really have a grasp on or have learned about. I'm sure there's a lot more that I don't even know about.

What should I be doing myself to improve my own abilities and knowledge? Are there any good resources you recommend? Any habits or practice routines that I should start doing? I try searching for videos on youtube and there seems to be an endless supply of them and I have no idea where I should begin. Should I be learning about these things in a certain order? 

I am having a lot of fun but I feel like a blank slate and I could use a push in the right direction. Any advice you guys have is greatly appreciated. Thank you guys!",23May2017,3
190,"I've been friends with this person for a minute... but I've just started to probe their social views, and it turns out they don't believe anti-black racism is an issue in modern day America; not only that, but if racism DOES exist in America, it's actually only racism against white and Asian people, as it is harder for them to get into college.  

When asked about the history of racism in America, they say that racism truly ended when racism was made illegal through things like the Civil Rights Act, and therefore has no impact on modern day America. When asked about hate crimes after that (for instance, just recently threats of lynching to a black congressman) they say it's individual incidents that don't imply an issue through America. The KKK only proves this, to them: small membership counts show that only a minuscule percentage of America actually is racist. When shown data that presents a disparity between black poverty rates against the average rape of poverty, they attribute the difference to a ""culture that holds them back,"" as well as ""democrat policies and ideas that keep them poor."" When shown a study that proves black sounding names get less callbacks for job interviews than white sounding names, the studies are dismissed due to location (the study included data from Chicago: a city with high black crime rates). It's very ignorant but they are very deep in their mindset.

I feel that I've run out of options to try and persuade them. I really feel that it's necessary to make sure racism isn't glossed over like this, so I am willing to make a large effort to persuade them. But I can't continue arguing when I continue to be shot down. What can I do to prove that racism (at least, anti-black racism) is still an issue in America?",23May2017,6

192,"My mom just told my 5 year old daughter she can be the flower girl in my cousins wedding. The problem is when I was 9 my cousins dad fondled me. No one believed me when it came out, including my mom which was very hard. She is best friends with her sister who is married to my uncle so I guess she felt loyalty to her over me? In school they teach you to reach out to an adult in these situations but not how to cope if nobody believes you. Anyways this incident left me traumatized for years and is something I have had to learn to come to peace with on my own and with the help of a therapist. My mom chose to ""forget"" such things ever happened and continues to ""not remember"" to this day. I am now 34. She is very caring and generous to me and my kids and husband besides this incident. I will probably attend with my husband and keep my daughter safe at home. Until my uncle dies I will never feel safe around that family. My question is how to confront my mom about this with out her getting upset. I could just not attend the wedding altogether but I feel it would be disrespecting my cousin who was a baby when all of this happened. I don't think she even knows and wouldn't want to hurt her.

Long story short: in a few months there will be the 18th birthday of the girl I loved for more than 4 years.

Now we did not end up together but we are still good friends and she recently (1 or 2 months) got into a relationship. Needless to say that this doesn't really make me happy but I don't really show it because it'd be just childish to get all sad and angry because someone is going on with their life.

I'm trying to let this all behind and it's going pretty well but I don't know if I should go at this birthday. On one side it's her 18th birthday and it's a special thing of course, on the other side I don't really want to see her with her new boyfriend let alone get to know him.

233,"For context I am in my mid-thirties and have a very sparse dating history - I have dated less than 10 people over the past 10 years.  My longest relationship is the one that I am currently in, and we are nearing the year mark.

I have been dating this guy for nearly a year now.  He is a great guy - smart, kind and caring, we share some similar interests but not too much to make it seem like I'm dating myself - the kinds of things most people seem to look for in another person.  We get together at least once a week and our outings range from basketball or soccer games to having a night in with Netflix to visiting a park or other attraction.  Things started off great, I was really attracted to him and for lack of a better phrase he really ""turned me on.""

The problem I have is that for at least the past six weeks I haven't been interested in him romantically.  He's a great friend, but I have a very difficult time reciprocating his feelings.  He is passionate and adores me, and I'm just no longer feeling that toward him.  I think I'm losing interest in him.  Heck I'm even losing interest in making out and other such activities with him.  I keep looking and fantasizing about other people.  I keep wondering if I should continue our relationship, hoping that the passion will restart itself, or if I just need to take some time off for myself to reflect and think.

I've been trying to think about why I have been losing interest in him lately.  I'm not sure if it's the little things that keep bugging me, that I am placing too much focus on them, causing them to be a turn off.  Maybe I just need to be more assertive and communicate these things.  Maybe despite my age I'm just not mature enough for a relationship.  Or maybe it's that ""past the honeymoon"" stage when the  butterflies go away and ""real life"" comes back in and I just need to figure myself out and realize this is how it is now, that those butterflies and initial attraction will fade away no matter whom I am with.  Maybe it's one of those instances where despite everything else being great the connection is just not there and I should be moving on, that we are good friends but not lovers.

To complicate matters, there is clerk at a store that has been catching my eye.  I find him attractive, he seems sweet and kind, and over the past two weeks his actions and comments indicate that he is interested in me as well.  I get those butterflies when I think about him, something I no longer have with my current date.  A part of me really wants to get to know this guy and follow through, a part of me says I need to avoid this store and get away from this temptation and that these feelings are only temporary, and another part of me says I just need to take a ""time out"" from both guys and reflect on what I really want and need.

I would really appreciate your advice and/or similar stories.  I just feel like a mess.  Do I work with who I have and hope to rekindle or rediscover the interest and passion I thought was there at the beginning?  Do I need to have a good sit-down talk with this guy to air my frustrations/concerns and work together to find a solution?  Do I see where this new interest leads, or should I forget about him?

Sorry for the massive amount of text.


Edit/addendum: after some marinating time thinking about comments I've received so far, I have a follow up or clarifying request for advice.  Is this kind of feeling with a significant other normal, do your relationships go through these ""on off"" again kinds of attraction or romantic interest, and how do you weather these kinds of feelings and not ""jump ship"" with the next shiny thing that crosses your path?",23May2017,1

I'm graduating high school next month and currently live in an extremely toxic environment (emotional abuse is rampant, walking on eggshells all the time). I've made a plan to move out with two good friends - money and travel isn't an issue as we've been planning and saving up for almost two years.

This doesn't sound like a big problem, but I'm expected to attend a university nearby and the fall semester starts four days after my 18th. This has been my biggest stressor for a while.

I was trying to motivate him after he gave up but then he starts telling me how he doesn't want to think and was extremely lazy.

242,"I understand that this might seem minor and it is in the grand scheme of things but I am over all feeling like I am making a bigger deal out of this than I should. 
So a few weeks ago I was dog sitting for a sweet half terrier/half rottweiler for a coworker. While I was dog sitting, I brought the dog my boyfriend's parents for a day because we were celebrating Easter and they have a large property for her to run around. Well, we were doing introductions and she has a tendency to growl when people she doesn't know loom over her. I warned against it but sometimes you can't really help it especially because she is so small. 
Anyways, boyfriend's Grandma forgets this and the dog growls at her. Doesn't lunge or anything, stays right next to me and is just asking for space/stop looming. Totally freaked out his Grandma. Wouldn't come near the dog otherwise and apparently as I found out today is scared to death of the dog and is refusing to let her dog, Spencer, interact with my dog (my coworkers dog became mine a couple days ago. Different story for another time). And it isn't like I have a problem if she doesn't want the dogs to interact but I am very defensive over the dog and I just cannot stand how dramatic she is being over my dog. We have explained to her multiple times that some dogs do this when they haven't been properly socialized or trained and she has never done anything that would make me worried that she was being aggressive. 
In addition, her dog is not well tempered either. Whenever her dog meets someone new, he barks almost nonstop but of course this doesn't bother her or register as the same type of behavior. 
The whole point to this is that I feel like she is being dramatic for no reason at all and this is not the first instance in which she is being dramatic. And it isn't just exclusively the dogs. It is just the little stuff ends up being a big deal and nothing you say seems to have any effect on her. I usually just ignore it because there is nothing can do but this specific occurrence involves my dog and I hate to think of anyone feeling so negatively towards my dog. 
Am I being crazy? Should I just let this go? I am not going to pressure her but I just need to know if me being defensive about this is justified. ",23May2017,1
244,"Hi everyone,

I live in an apartment in Germany with my baby and our neighbors in the adjacent building are male refugees living in bunk beds. They are very loud after 22:00 (quiet time in Germany) and they yell and have loud music and my baby wakes up frequently from the noise. I can't tell them to pipe down because they don't speak German or English. What should I do? Calling the cops feels wrong and hanging up a sign seems as pointless as talking to them. Any ideas?",23May2017,1
245,"So I just got a job from Kroger, and take in mind this is my first job but it's crucial for me to pick up a second job (Home Depot).

The interview for Home Depot is in about a little over a week from now and I'm extremely terrified of conflicting schedules.

The manager at Kroger said one mistake (conflicting jobs counts too) and I'm done. ðŸ˜°

I have questions for all Kroger, Home Depot, and part-time employees: 

As a part-time employee can you reschedule?

Will they schedule days out of the blue? (ex: boss says to come in to work within the next couple of hours randomly).

I have my hours set for Kroger from 4:00 noon till 12:00 at night (everyday).
I was thinking about setting my hours for Home Depot from 12:00 morning (if they let me work those shifts) till 12:00 noon (everyday).

I applied to Home Depot saying I was available morning, afternoons, night, and overnight. 
ðŸ˜” I really screwed up.

Any extra advice would be appreciated.",23May2017,2
246,"Here's the context.

Friend 1 ( a guy friend, not the one upset with me ) and I wanted to hang out, as we both are trying to be more social in our lives. For me at least, I preferred meeting up 1 on 1 so I would be putting myself in a new situation with someone I have only interacted with 3 times before.

So we met up at a coffee shop and then had some lunch and talked for a while before we decided to invite Friend 2 ( a girl, someone we are both close with ) to come join us. Friend 2 declined, and we later heard from her saying she was upset that she was invited so late, as if we didn't want to hang out with her at all. She is now ignoring any forms of communication from me or Friend 1. 

Now, I can understand why she would be upset. But I also feel as if she is over-reacting as she says she doesn't want anything to do with us. 

What do you all think?

248,"We've countlessly had to replace different tubes and pipes in our sinks, dish washer and washing machine. It chews through them to get to the water and no matter how many/different types of traps we set, it's smart enough to go around them or get the bait without setting it off. Sometimes sets it off without getting trapped too. My dad refuses to hire an exterminator. We also have cats and dogs so certain types of poison we can't really use. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Anything out of the ordinary that worked for them? ",23May2017,2
250,"So there's this girl that goes to my school that I like, and know for sure she likes me back. A few days ago, I finally get the nerve to ask her out and she said yes. But, today I find out she has a boyfriend, one of my good friends. I knew this friend liked her, but I didn't know they were dating. I asked the girl about it, and she claims to planning to break up with him, though she couldn't do it today, because she was sick and wasn't at school. I believe her, because we've been friends for a while and she's proved to be a trustworthy person. I still don't know what to do though. Am I fucking over my friend? Sorry for the long read, thanks.",23May2017,2
251,"I'll try to get to the point of my situation. I work at PetSupermarket for $8.00 an hr. I just started 3 weeks ago. I am happy that I got this job but something came up at the 1 week point of my job my dad surprised me with a surprise move. Basically he never told me we were moving and while I was at work moved all he stuff out of the apartment and told me to stay with my mom who lives quite a long way away from work while he is traveling. Just in case you are wondering he never warned me that we were moving. 

So come to today it has become apparent that this may be too much of a drive for me considering gas prices and being late to work. I got in trouble with my boss today because even though I left 1hr 30min to get to work I was still late by 15 min because of bad traffic and raining on top of it all. My car also can't drive past 70 mph because the engine is starting to go bad. My boss in short kind of gave me an ultimatum of finding somewhere else to work or to never be late again. I'm not sure if I can fulfill this obligation even though I'm leaving earlier than usual. 

If you are wondering if I need this job to live, I will be fine because I'm being supported by my parents. I don't really need the money but it just helps support myself with what I want and need. And of course I can find another job but it would take some time. Another thing I'm kind of concerned about is how working only 3-4 weeks would look on my resume/record. 

So what is your advice? Is it too much of a drive? Should I find somewhere closer to work where I won't be late? What are your experiences and thoughts on my situation?",23May2017,1
252,"I just finished my junior year as an IT major. I've been doing one internship for a life insurance and other financial services company since February which is really simple, mostly scanning papers. It's my first internship. The pay is bad, but I like my supervisors. I recently accepted a full time internship that seems to be more inline with my major, helping clients who have technical issues with a software basically. It pays great but 40 hours a week seems like a killer for me, especially in the summer. I also feel like I'm not prepared for the work at hand. I didn't lie about anything on my resume of during the interview, though. For some reason, I felt terrible and so out of place my first 2 days there. I don't know if it's because I'm nervous or if I will continue to feel this way. I'm much more at peace at the older internship. Is it a bad idea to quit this internship, considering it's a good position and I'm almost a senior and should have done more internships? Will I have more chances to find another internship later? I feel like I'm leaning towards quitting and just continuing my older internship part time and enjoying the rest of the summer. What do you think? Thanks for reading and any advice given.

253,So my mom isn't very accepting of me. I like wearing dark clothes and chokers and other things like that. But she wants me to be the perfect girly girl. I've tried confronting her but she just got mad at me. I don't wanna continue wearing a style that's not me. So what should I do?,23May2017,3
254,"I was in a car accident. Police came and wrote up an information exchange report. Neither was at fault. There is no case number on my form, and officer didn't even take my side of the story.

The other person in the accident (husband that came minutes after) told me not to call my insurance and that their insurance would call me and then send a check out for the cost of repair. That way I avoid getting a higher premium or what not.. what should I do?",23May2017,3
255,"I am stuck with a crush on this guy. Originally, I mentioned that I thought he liked me too. I have come to a conclusion. He doesn't like me back, he is just a nice guy. This means things are more complicated between us than originally anticipated. Whenever he says my name I get butterflies and am in awe, and I hate to say this, but I literally found baby pictures of him on his little sister's Instagram and use them to make me happy when I'm sad. I am tired of this, and I cannot get over him. We have a class together, and his locker is next to mine, so we talk daily, mostly just awkward conversations consisting of ""hi."" I always ramble when talking to him and repeat myself. Our conversations are so awkward. One started where I told him that it was National Clean Your Desk Day and told him all of the other weird national holidays if that day. He thought it was cool. I then went on and rambled about how I needed to clean my own desk and how it was clean until I decided to shove all of the stuff on my floor into the drawers. He was weirded out and talked about his sister. Our relationship is really awkward, especially since I like him so very much and look at his pictures all of the time. I literally made a collage on my phone of him! It has hearts all over it! I really want to remain friends with this guy without it being so awkward. He is the nicest person I know, he has put up with my weirdness, and I need to get over my crush so that I can remain friends with him and not have to hold in the secret of my creepy collage.
