1,"When I was younger around the age of 13-16, I was bullied almost everyday in school. It got to the point that I started skipping classes or staying home and would get in trouble for it but nobody knew I was getting bullied and I've kept it to myself since. I am 22 years of age now and whenever I think about that time, I burst into tears and start crying. Always. Does that mean the bullying had some sort of emotional effect on me? I thought I would be over it by now but it always get me. ",24Jul2017,1
2,"So im looking at a fridge for college and I believe I have 2 options.

Option 1: $50, 1 year old, used. Would buy off of a co-worker. It would have a freezer section but it would be located in the fridge ( I don't want this because they have a tendency to also freeze anything on the top shelf of the fridge)

Option 2: $100-$180, brand new. Would buy from a store. The freezer and fridge would be separate sections (what I prefer)

3,"So I just received my schedule for this upcoming school year. However, one of the classes is Spanish II. This is because I was placed in Spanish I last year as an honors class. But I didn't really pay attention in that class, so obviously I'm going to fail Spanish II since I don't know Spanish I. I already requested to retake Spanish I but according to my schedule that got denied. I'm thinking I should just switch to French which I know they'll allow. What do you guys think?",24Jul2017,1
4,"Throughout that period I grew to see her as a mom figure. Uh They divorced about 7 months back, and she still wants to maintain a bond. She took me with her and her daughter to run errands, lunch, and her daughters boyfriend joined us for bowling, on 3 different occasions. 




Anyway I kinda wanted to know were I stood with her, and so I knew she was at work today, so I texted her if we could talk when she got home. She actually called me back, and I said aren't you at work? She said ""Yeah I am but I'm on break now  doing paper work "". I said "" do you want to just call back when you get home? "" She said "" No its fine hon, talk to me "". So I just said this "" Look, I just wanted to say, during the time when you were living with us, I've come to see you was a mom figure, you don't owe me anything, and I'm would not ask you to be a mom to me and I wouldn't ask you to see / love me as a son, because I know that wouldn't be fair to expect. I just wanted to put that out there.


She said "" Well I appropriate that, you always made me feel that way. ""   I asked "" Does that make you uncomfortable? ""

She said "" That doesn't make me uncomfortable at all "" 



She actually invited me to her daughters birthday 3 weeks from now and said she'd pick me up. We talked for a bit, asked what I had for lunch and told me about a home she was trying to buy, and told me that she's here for me. She was trying to talk to me while trying to get her elderly patients under control.





When she said "" I appreciate that "" I kinda took that as her saying "" I care for you but not in a motherly way "" Is that basically what she meant? I didn't want to press on it. I'm a bit sad, but that's up to her. I'm glad she still wants to maintain a bond, but yeah a little sad.

5,"My father (62 years old) works as an airplane technician fixing dented parts of airplanes. He's the only person in his department because he's been at the job for so long that no one else knows how to do his job. The primer that the company uses on the parts contains hexavalent chromium and by law has to be sealed off in its own area. His new CEO just put into action a rule that made it against company policy to sit down anytime that the employees are on break. The CEO had all tables and chairs taken away or put into the cafeteria. The cafeteria is half a mile away in another building but they have specialized areas assigned to each department. Guess where the specialized area my father was assigned to is? In the hexavalent chromium primer area. He said he can't go to his HR department because they approved the chair ban. Are the chemicals going to affect his health? Is there someone I can report this to? My dad can't be forced to eat his lunch next to these chemicals right? Isn't it a health concern?

10,"I could be going into my 2nd year of a degree (Ireland, so different system, can't change degree).
I don't particularly enjoy my degree, I find some parts interesting but the majority of it is tedious.

I've had the idea of learning silversmithing, designing and creating pieces of silver jewellery. I have been considering dropping out of college (or failing out considering I have 3 exams to repeat in the next month), studying jewellery design for the however many weeks the course is for.. keeping up my part time work while starting my own jewellery brand, not etsy, but a brand along the lines of Chrome Hearts.

My parents want me to get a degree regardless, I want to be self employed, I know that much I know I do not want to work for someone else for any time longer than necessary, I know I am intelligent and I know I have the capabilities to be successful both financially and in business, I love to learn, I spend my day online learning about everything from fashion, jewellery design, to stocks, coding, taxes, business related topics, taxes, everything of interest, I don't switch off very often, but my parents want me to have a degree because no matter the circumstances they want me to have some 4 year degree behind me, no particular reason other than 'you won't get a job'.

I have mentioned dropping out and my mother started with if I drop out I sure as hell won't be lying around the house all day. I have no intention of doing that, i do not want to become a recluse with no ambitions, I have hopes, I have dreams, i have ideas and plans.
I just don't know what is the right choice.
Sure a degree sounds like the obvious option, but this last year starting college has been one of the worst years of my life, mentally.. I just have been in the worst place, as I type this I have completely broken out into a full face rash/acne due to stress, and not stress because I am unable to achieve what I hoped to/what has been expected of me but stress because I have been trying to continue with something I have such little interest in, during the year it was ok because I neglected it but now that I have exams to repeat it's worse than ever.

I just don't know, I need advice.

17,"Hey guys, I'm really trying my best to get into shape and eat healthy as of a couple weeks ago. So today I decided that I was gonna walk up and down these really steep stairs on the way down to a beach near my house. I believe there are 235 steps to the top and a few upward slanted hills in between. I thought I could handle this. So I went down (obviously no problem) then went up... halfway I felt fine, I was doing ok (I was just walking, mind you) then halfway through I felt like I could not breathe and had to stop just before the top to sit on a bench. I started feeling extremely faint, light headed, couldn't breathe and I thought for a minute I might actually vomit. I was so shocked I felt THIS bad. It lasted around 10 mins. I thought to myself ""wow you're really in trouble here, you're far gone..."". There were old people doing this for Christ sake! The other thing I must mention is that I was born with a minor heart condition. My cardiologist warns me that I should avoid extremely strenuous exercise where I ""push myself"" too hard, but should still regularly exercise at a normal pace to stay healthy. This stair walk was just WALKING up hill and stairs.... I didn't think it would be too strenuous for me, I planned to do it and be just fine. I had never done them before so I guess maybe I overestimated myself? Either I have no stamina and am just way more out of shape than I thought or I'm in serious trouble here and must do something. I'm a male, only 21 years old, 6'3 and 250 lbs so yes I'm overweight but also quite tall so I don't particularly ""look overweight."" I've still been wanting to lose weight lately. I would like to ideally be around 190 lbs. I used to strength train with a personal trainer a few years ago and while she used to give me hard workouts I don't ever remember feeling this horrible and sick afterwards.

Quick background; I have been working as a waiter, promoted to captain then head waiter at an event space while earning my degree. Well I finished my degree last summer with a BA in PoliSci and minor in philosophy. I tried doing a normal 9-5 job but I couldn't stand it, it was a sales job that I did for 6 months while I was working at the event space. I've always wanted to be a professor, but after speaking to several under grad professors they told me it's not worth it, because they keep you as an adjunct forever and it allows you to have 0 financial security. I do have a good amount of money saved so I do have the ability to attend grad school. Now, I have asked to be promoted a year ago at the event space but my GM told me that he couldn't because of my age. Before anyone cries ageism, we do cater to an older clientele, and events can range from 30k-250k from our space alone.

I always thought I wanted to leave for college, but I am now realizing this is too drastic. I will miss my parents and siblings and I don't want to leave. I just don't feel I can fit in with my classmates.

I have never once felt disadvantaged until my acceptance. I do not believe that I got in through merit and that my acceptance was a combination of affirmative action and luck. My classmates are high achieving stars, I can't possibly hope to connect with them.

I didn't have the luxury of private tutors, dance classes, or family vacations. I lived a simple life, sheltered in my community. I realize that college is meant to be a great equalizer, but it is a cause of much anxiety for me.

I have dreams that revolve around my struggle to pay for my education. It's so hard when you think you did everything right, only to have your goal be raised higher. I am so nervous that the cost of my education will be too much for my family.

I always thought that an excellent education would be my saving grace, but now even I doubt that this is the right path for me.

24,"So I've been thinking about getting a tattoo. I have two ideas that I wouldn't mind mixing. 

The main one I really want to get, is some kind of reference to a passage in Theodore Roosevelt's speech ""A man in the Arena"". I would like to get it on my shoulder, maybe a half sleeve thing too. 

Here's the full passage, bolded is my favorite parts which might make for good banners to add into the tat. 

&gt;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, **if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly**, so that **his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.** 

Problem is, I have no idea how I want to put this into a tattoo. And I've struggled to find good inspiration for it from google cause it's such a random thing lol. The only thing that comes up is the fact that miley cyrus got part of it tattood on her forearm lol. The only idea I have for this tattoo, is to tie in into my second tattoo idea

For the second tattoo idea, it would be an Ouroboros. 

[Standard/classic ouroboros tattoo](http://imgur.com/a/34t3F): I don't like this style. To boring, and simple honestly.

[This is a decent half sleeve I've found that I like.](http://imgur.com/a/4SQK4) 

And this is my favorite style because of the head. I would love this on my forearm but then I can't integrate it.

Now that that was said and you have a basic idea, my idea for combining them would be like a half sleeve ouroboros with some kind of banner on it, with part of the quote on there. Maybe even in latin, or is that too cheesy? 

Another idea I had is a depiction of an arena, OUT of a an ouroboros, since they are both circular. I have no idea how the artist would do this though it sounds difficult as shit especially because I want it on my shoulder/ forearm. 

Any ideas, along these lines or even in a completely different direction would be greatly appreciated!",24Jul2017,1

Every weekend I like to go out to my local park and play pickup basketball. Almost every time I go, a mother is there with her two kids who also likes to play basketball with us guys as well. She usually lets her kids run off and play in the playground area of the park while she plays basketball. To be a bit more descriptive, she is an extremely attractive woman with amazing breasts who always wears tight and seductive activewear to play basketball.  

For this summer and last summer, I have seen her almost every weekend and we play basketball with others for hours. We have gotten fairly close to the point where we occasionally have many conversations about each others lives. From what she has told me, she is in her early 30s. My biggest problem is that I am not 100% certain that she is currently with someone or is married. For the past two summers that I have known her I have never seen a man spending time with her or her kids at the park, leading me to believe that if she does have a significant other, he may not have much interest in spending time with her or his family.

We have become quite close to the point were we exchange smiles quite frequently while we play. I occasionally catch her staring at me like how one stares at someone else who they are interested in.  Being a young, naive 18 year old virgin I have not been attracted to a woman as much as I am to this one. I would not be seeking advice if I did not believe that there may be a small, but possible mutual feeling towards each other. I am asking for help on what should I do next, especially her being a mother of two kids who is over 10 years older than me. My biggest concern is that I am unsure if she is currently with someone. I do not want to make a move and completely ruin a friendship that I have formed with her and make it permanently awkward simply because she was never interested in me. Another concern that I have is that if she actually is interested in me, how should I approach this with her being much older than me with kids. To be completely honest, I would absolutely love to engage with her sexually, despite me having no experience whatsoever, but I am very unsure about completely sparking up a relationship with a much older woman with kids who are almost half my age.

She has also given me a talk about talking to the people when I go to the skate park because they are a couple years older then me. I think the guys there are very nice and helpful. Could it be because I'm a girl? Or is she just genuinely worried about online predators.

They're incredible parents. But as far as hanging out with them for long periods of time or even sometimes short periods of time, I feel that they're too simple minded or something. 

Most of what they say is gossip or small talk. Most of what they do is work around the house or watch TV. Anytime I try to bring up something deeper, like questions about life as a whole or human nature, they usually don't follow or don't care to follow. Neither of them have a college degree and neither of them have travelled much (not saying only well travelled people with college degrees are intelligent), and neither of them care to.

48,"Cross posted to r/weddings, but thought I'd ask here too since's it's more active I think.

Just had a wedding last month and it went GREAT.
1 thing happened though. Wedding started at 1530. Around 1515, wedding planner said ""your musician isn't here, I think we should start and try and get the sound system up, but it's your call. He won't pick up his phone."" I told her let's go ahead with it so we did.

The officiant actually sang acapella for us during the ceremony! Really saved the ceremony or we would have done it in silence. So, it wasn't completely ruined, as all the guests had no idea that the musician was even supposed to be there during the ceremony.

Musician finally showed up around 1700, just in time for our first dance. He was really apologetic, guess he mixed up the times. He did great the time he was there, stayed a little over 3 hours which we paid for.

So, here's where we are stuck: during the wedding, the musician's agent (I think his wife) e-mailed us saying ""Musician told me what is going on, this is completely against what who we are and we are issuing a full refund."" We e-mailed back later saying we feel bad taking the full amount since he did show up, and that the officiant saved the ceremony and hope he doesn't feel too bad, but perhaps this full refund is best for both parties.
We get a reply a few weeks later (guess she didn't get our first reply?) saying ""thought this was taken care of, musician told me this was settled that day and that he stayed a little longer at the reception to make it up to us and that a refund was not necessary.""

Thoughts??? Yes, he did good while he was there and he did technically stay for the amount of time we paid for. But he missed the whole ceremony that we even made song requests for.

Tl;dr: Musician missed ceremony, showed up late, played for agreed amount of time. They said they'd issue full refund without us asking, we said OK, then few weeks later they said they thought it was all good since he played for longer.",24Jul2017,2

Unfortunately I find myself in China visiting the SO's family.

I've done about 3 public art shows, a few con booths selling fan art prints, been putting sketches on the bus to and from work, tagged the shit out of my posts on social media, (try to) sell clothing online, spread out from just drawing to tattooing/animating/writing/comics/design/music/games, reached out to i don't know how many businesses/local galleries, put an ad on the subway in Toronto, tried out boosting posts on instagram and facebook, submitted creations to the proper producers, and yet I feel like, with a couple of exceptions, there's a general disinterest towards the things i make.

There's a trend recently with people getting really into the messages I generally have hidden under a layer of most major things i make (not physically, although i've probably done that a few times), but they typically tend to lose steam after a couple weeks. this has happened with people saying they want to help promote me, and then after a few weeks they avoid talking about it. equally, people seem like they're uncomfortable working with me, although I feel like I'm being pretty normal and open when I collaborate. I think this may in part be because they aren't comfortable with collaborating in general yet?? maybe?

I think it could be that I'm just not as ready or good as I think I am (which isn't a whole lot, but I think I'm decent enough to get started in the field), or, most of all I'm worried it's something that's wrong with me personally, like people who don't know me well enough (however much ""enough"" is) are turned off and don't care to look any further than what's right in front of them and move on.

sorry if any of this sounds boastful or dumb or whatever. I dunno. I'm 25 and I feel stupid.",24Jul2017,2

I have applied to tons of other places to work at but they don't fit my schedule. The call center job is by far the most flexible but there is nothing I like about it except how super flexible they are and the pay is alright I'd say, for a student ($12 an hour).

59,"There's this girl in my high school who I was once sort of acquaintances with, but she thought I was tweeting about her when I wasn't, so she started to dislike me. In junior year, I ended up in the same math class as her and every day, she would make a comment about me when I walked into class. In senior year, she and I ended up in the same math class yet again, but this time she became obsessed with me. Instead of doing her work during the time we're supposed to be doing classwork, she would harass me and try to get my attention by saying things about me or calling my name. She would talk about me really loudly to her friends to try to make me respond/react to her. She also commented on other people's Instagram pictures mentioning me; for example, ""ew you look like you're trying to be (insert my name here)."" She found out that I work at this one retail store and at least once a week, she'd drop by the store just to find me and troll me. She talks about me to everybody, takes pictures of me, and records videos of herself trolling me to post online. She tries to troll my friends too, but always leaves me for last. It doesn't even seem like she actually hates me (at least not anymore); it seems like she really wants my attention and gets so much entertainment out of trying to get under my skin because she's always laughing when she talks about me or tries to do anything to me. She tweets about me, has access to my Instagram photos for some reason, mentions me to people who don't even know me, and stalks me at work. She also likes to ask me perverted questions (example: are you wet right now? did your boyfriend not fuck you good enough today is that why you're so cranky? when did you lose your virginity? i know you're not a virgin) and asks my boyfriend questions like that too (example: did you fuck (insert my name here) last night because she's extra salty today. which position y'all in most often?). In group photos, the first thing she does is try to spot where I am then zoom in to make comments about me such as, ""ew she thinks she's some type of queen. she looks extra as fuck. She even pays attention to when I cross my legs in a chair and makes comments about how I ""look like a pageant queen"" and shit. She @s me on Twitter even though I have her blocked and is really nosy about my life, asking a bunch of people stuff about me all the time.


What exactly is this? Is she just a hater or? Because I feel like she's a little obsessed, and she seems like she has the best time of her life doing all of this stuff. Some of her behavior reminds me of how some guys act when they like me (all the teasing, harassing, etc).

61,"In another Reddit thread, I discussed the issues I have between me and my grandparents. That got me to thinking: is it my problem? Did I dig my own grave?

I'm 18 years old, and both of my parents are disabled. I've never been outside of my home state, and I've had a ""hard"" life (although not as hard as some). I never grew up in a nice home, and I never got to play with nice toys. I attended school at a small rural school where I didn't have an opportunity to make friends, and those that I did make I couldn't hang out with. My first car was a ""gift"" to me (my mother sold land she bought with her inheritance to buy me that car), and even then it was nearly 30 years old. I tried to start my own business when I was about 13 as nobody would hire me, but that business was a failure. I got my first job at 17 years old at a fast food joint which I had for a year and one month before quitting due to poor management. I got another job at a Subway where I'm slow and the training was poor, so I'm constantly reprimanded and recently got my hours cut down to the bare minimum due to only knowing how to do one part of my job. Tomorrow I'm putting in my 2-weeks notice to move to college and to get a new job that I believe I'll be better at.

Enough exposition, now for the real problem:

My grandparents and I stopped seeing eye-to-eye beginning in my early teenage years. It started as more and more arguments started between me and my grandfather. My grandfather grew up during the Great Depression and had the same job for over four decades, and he didn't even graduate the 8th grade.

The first sign of trouble was when my six-year old cousin, grandfather, and I were all out on their patio. Out of the blue, my grandfather told me that my ""six-year old cousin has worked more than I [me] have in my entire life"", and then he started calling me ""worthless."" A heated argument pursued, and finally ended when he told me (my six year old cousin hearing everything) that ""unlike the other grandchildren, I've had everything handed to me."" I can still recall running through the crowded kitchen (it was a holiday, IIRC) and downstairs with tears running down my cheeks.

Before I quit my job, things were going better since I was working. They lended me some money to get my car fixed, and I steadily paid them. Then I was involved in a rollover accident. After about three or four months of scrounging and saving money when I could, I had $1100 saved up to purchase another car. They loaned me the rest of the money to buy my current car.

Then less than a month later, things at my job came to a boiling point. My boss threatened to fire me because I couldn't make it to work on a day I requested off weeks in advance, and it was for an important school project. I quit right then and there, not only because of the project, but also because of the poor management.

Ever since, my grandparents have called me ""lazy"" and ""irresponsible."" There have been several occasions since then where I've overheard them talking about me to my parents and others regarding my ""horrible work ethic"" and ""why couldn't he [I] be like the other grandkids."" When approached, they deny saying such things and said they never ""spoke behind my back"", despite only hearing it because I was in the right spot at the right time.

These things have continued despite having the job at Subway. When I've discussed not wanting to work in fast food, and saying that I will not work another fast food job due to my prior experiences, they tell me things like ""you have to work your way up"" and ""we all have to start somewhere."" It has been like World War III between me and my grandparents since I quit my last job, and I don't know how it'll be after I quit my current job to pursue my next job.

In my transition to college, I chose a 4-year University over a community college, despite a program in my home state that will pay 2 years at a C.C. and 2 years at a University if you choose to attend. I decided to go to a 4-year University because I wanted to get away from home and that is where the job I took is located at. However, my grandparents have not taken kindly to the fact that the University is where I want to go, and not the C.C. They also have told my parents and me that I'm ""likely to drop-out of college"" and I will have like $1 million in debt. They want me to stay at my current job and not move up.

As a result, I continiously feel that I have a poor work ethic. I constantly feel that I'm lazy, despite others telling me that I'm not. My anxiety has got worse, especially since I quit my last job.

However, I understand my time with my grandparents are limited. They're in their mid-80s, and I want to spend the rest of our time together as pleasant as possible. But it's hard to do when they feel the way they do.

Is this something I caused? Was it preventable? Are they correct - do I have a poor work ethic?

63,"The other night I (F) ended up going out drinking with a few friends, 1 married couple (the wife is a good work friend and someone who I consider one of my best friends) and another girl. We started off drinking at a bar and the couple decided we should take the party back to their apartment. We continued to drink there and the other girl friend went home soon after we got to the apartment. 

I wasn't planning on getting drunk, but shots later, I  realized exactly how drunk I was. I wasn't black out drunk, but definitely browned-out a few times.  We were all pretty drunk at this point though. My best friend set me all up on their couch (I've slept over many times the past few years) and I passed out. 

While sleeping, I felt the back of my shorts being pulled away from my body. I thought I was dreaming, but the feeling didn't go away and when I awoke to see what it was, my friend's husband was standing behind the couch.  I fumbled around with my phone for a while until he left the room and I was up pretty much most of the night. He came to check on me a few more times throughout the night. 

I'm unsure if I should tell my best friend about this. I don't want to ruin my friendship with her.  She's been married/dating him for over 10 years. They've had some struggles recently and I know telling her could cause an almost-relationship-ending fight.  Or it can go the other way, and she could cut me from her life.  But at the same time, I can't get past that this person, who I thought of as a friend, pulled my shorts to look at my ass.  I feel so violated even though (and thank god!) nothing else happened. 

I have some events and activities coming up that I will see him, one or two occasions that will be without his wife.  I don't think he will try anything- I think he only did because he thought I was completely passed out, but I still feel like I can't be around him or work with him without being withdrawn and awkward.  So unsure of what to do... Or what to even say...

70,"This is going to be a rambling mess probably, but I really don't have any clue where to turn to right now or what to do.  Also, this is my first post on this site, so be gentle.

***

I don't know.  I mean, about anything, really.  I don't know where I am in life, how I got here, or where I'm going.  Or where I need to go.  I just... don't know.

I dropped out of college a couple years ago.  A law enforcement program that just wasn't right for me.  I couldn't hack it.  Couldn't finish the work, couldn't do the practice, couldn't even handle talking to the people in the class or asking the questions at the mock crime scenes.  Couldn't even handle the pressure of going any more, so I didn't.

Had some trouble getting a job, probably mostly because I wasn't trying hard enough, maybe partially because I didn't have any real work experience or references at 21 besides a summer job with a family friend working for cash.  Just drifted for a while.  Thought about going back to school for something else, but I didn't know what it would be for, and still don't.

I played some video games.  Made a few dollars helping my grandma out.  Didn't do much else.  Eventually reconnected with a friend, and after a while he helped me get a job, the one I have now.  Started it two weeks ago, and it's not the worst thing in the world.  My coworkers aren't terrible, at least, and it's a whole $1.75 more than minimum wage.

But really, I still don't know any more about myself or the direction I should take in life than I did when I was just some dumb kid getting out of High School.  I can sure tell you what I don't like, and what I'm bad at, but when it comes to what I'm good at or passionate about, I have no clue.

Most of the problem, though probably not all of it, is that I just get so darn nervous.  Pressure in my chest from dealing with confrontation, my brain just shutting down for a few seconds to process when a stranger talks to me, having to stop the car after some guy almost clips my car going to fast to do some breathing exercises because I'm hyperventilating and shaking, stuff like that.  Never been diagnosed for anything other than ADHD (partially because I'm not sure the insurance would cover mental help type stuff, but mostly because I don't want to have to explain to my parents why I need it, especially with what happened when my sister did the same thing), so I'm not going to say I have anxiety or depression or anything, but that's just the way I am.

I have trouble focusing, too; I can't multitask too well or it all falls to crud, and I have trouble getting my thoughts into words.  Kind of like right now.

So where does that leave me?  I haven't the faintest idea.  Kind of why I came here; that and I don't really have anyone I would be cool with talking to about this stuff.

I've tried to be brief with my problems, but I know this is still a lot, so thanks for reading this far if you have.  I appreciate it.  I'll be happy to provide more info if necessary, and I'd really like any kind of advice I can get on any of this other than just telling me to man up or something.

Thanks,

71,"This job was a great career opportunity for me so I couldn't pass it up (I need some experience in my field before I finish school), even with the odd hours and schedule, but since I've been working at this position I've been feeling really cut off from all my friends/family. I'm not sure how to go about making new friends on this schedule, and other than go to the bar or sit at home I don't know what to do with myself on days off while I'm up all night. What are some good ways to stay busy and social while on a 3rd shift schedule?",24Jul2017,2
72,"I have been working as a delivery driver at a restaurant for nearly 2 years now, and have struggled with punctuality since day one. It's usually only 10 or 15 minutes late. However, my boss had never reprimanded me, nor any other employee for tardiness until just recently. While the company has clear policies regarding punctuality, my boss never bothered to uphold them. Because of this, the entire staff has become apathetic, knowing that there won't be any negative consequences for their actions. 


When my boss DOES reprimand anyone, it's rather infrequent, never consistent, and she has never followed through with the previously warned disciplinary actions. There have even been several occasions where I expected and definitely deserved a write-up, but she said that she ""didn't want to give me one"" for whatever reason.  

Here's the thing... She too, has an issue with punctuality. She frequently arrives to her shifts drastically late-- often times causing the other scheduled employees to be late for their shifts, as well as get behind on their required work. This exact scenario happened on almost every one of her shifts the past two weeks when she showed up at least 30 minutes late.


Today, I was nearly an hour late to work because I accidentally overslept. A call from the shift lead inquiring where I was woke me up. I explained to him what had happened, then got to work as quickly as I possibly could. 

At the end of my shift, my boss showed up to the restaurant &amp; confronted me with a written warning regarding my tardiness earlier. I signed it since I definitely HAD been very late. She then warned me that if this behavior continued, I would be fired. This is what irked me. 

I expressed to her that I felt her actions  hypocritical when she appears to uphold a double standard by not being consistent &amp; following through with punitive procedures for every employee-- herself included. 

*Side note: I realize that I can solve the problem by just showing up on time, but it's a flaw that I'm still working at to correct. In the meantime, I do my best to always make sure I work hard &amp; still complete all of my required tasks during my shift, even if I was late that day.*

TL;DR: My chronically tardy boss has never mentioned my perpetual lack of punctuality over the past two years, nor has she **ever** upheld standards or followed through with employee warnings nor company-wide punitive procedures. Although it is completely hypocritical of her, she now wants to fire me for repeated tardiness, despite her own major lack of punctuality.",24Jul2017,5

75,"So, it's late and I should sleep, but this has been keeping me awake for a while now. 

I work at a dealership. I'm a mechanic, or rather I'm an apprentice. 

So my dream is falling apart, what do I mean by that? Well...

I believe in doing things the long way, the right way and the hard way. I believe in quality over quantity, and I do mean that. I've spent many hours making sure something was done right as opposed to just packing it in and calling it. Take pride in your work and make sure it's done right. It's why I chose this particular dealership (and more specifically, auto maker) over the rest.

This has landed me in some hot water at work. On one hand, I'm being told that I shouldn't worry about being fast; I should be thorough and focus on doing a good job. On the other, I'm constantly being hounded for being too slow, and one other mechanic told me I'm being 'too indepth' with my work. 

I've gotten in trouble for calling leaks and poor work, because as it turns out the work that I was calling was performed previously by the dealership. I was asked to work overtime, and when I explained to them that I had family obligations, particularly to see my grandparents - The assistant manager responded with, 'Fuck your grandparents.'. I've been insulted in front of customers, when my manager said aloud in the lobby that changing a bulb might be above my paygrade. 

This, after being told that walking around with a cup of water is damaging to the company's image as it is unprofessional. I get pushed, rushed and stressed, and then I make mistakes at work. I apologize to them, but they have this 'look-at-you-down-their-nose' vibe that makes me really uncomfortable. The manager talks down to me and interrupts me when I'm speaking, the ethics in that place baffle me. At one point, I got into an argument with management because they refused to order a new crush sleeve and just opted to reuse the old one. They had me work on the boss's dad's truck and said not to worry about priming the oil filter; it's a diesel. Another argument later and the manager walked away and I angrily went about my work. 

I thought it would be better, different. There's so much shady shit going on that I can't stand anymore. But I need the hours to get into school so I can progress through the program. If I leave now, it'll look terrible on my resume, but everyday I wonder if my lift is going to kill me (it shakes and wobbles like a son of bitch. another tech's goes up crooked), or if this place is going to get litigated into the ground. I've wanted to be a mechanic since I was a kid, and my long term goal is to move to Japan and be a mechanic over there. But what I'm seeing here and learning here isn't right. 

What do I do? I'm thinking of leaving, but I'm tied down by residence and it's all starting to become too much. ",24Jul2017,1

79,"Ok so this is my first time posting. I just don't have anyone to really talk to about this. So first off a little disclaimer. Recently my job pulled some messed up stuff which has extended the time it takes me to get to and from work. I work 12hrs a day 20 days in a row as it is and now have an added 2.5 hours commute time to and from work everyday. So I literally am devoting almost 15 hours just to work which basically leaves me 2 hrs a day to get showered, eat then it's lights out to try to get 6 hours of sleep if I'm lucky. Needless to say I've been quite a bit more cranky than usual. 

So anyways I'm usually a pretty laid back guy, but lately I've been feeling really angry with a lot of stuff, I'm sure the things with work are part of that but it's going into aspects of my personal life that make me feel like a real prick. I became single just before the new year and it was a good thing because she was pretty much destroying me but I also thought, hoped, she was the one. So that played, still plays to some extent, havoc on me. I came back to this lifestyle because I knew I could get out of the problems I was having financially and I knew what to expect. I've done this job on and off for several years now. Working out of state for almost a month at a time. As a result friends seem to slip away. So that's pretty much left me with just a very few good friends that I make time to see when I have time off. So in a sense I'm pretty isolated.

 I don't have a lot of people to joke around with and have fun with anymore. A lot of the times I feel like a one note wonder since I can't really keep up with current events, I don't watch a lot of tv anymore, and there isn't much time to make inside jokes...especially with friends that are basically non existent. So knowing all this and the fact I'm only around so often I've tried using some dating sites. I actually PAID for match.com. That's right I paid to get rejected. It's a wonderful experience, I  highly recommend it. By far the most thirsty one on that site was the site itself, after cancelling. 

Anyway here's the start of where my question is, I keep seeing these profiles and they are saying things like ""I enjoy spending time with my family and friends"". Meanwhile obviously my friend situation is limited, and as for family, let's just say I don't have the stomach for my mother. My dad passed when I was 15 and she ended up marrying a guy 7 years older than I was when I was 18. The guy was a complete tool. I knew it, my friends knew it, her friends and family knew it, she wouldn't accept it. He has two sons which she legally adopted, which I do really love and enjoy them. Guess I'm getting old because I remember them being 2 and 3 and the oldest just graduated highschool. I really am fond of both of them and try to be the person for them that I needed at their age, since their dad just decided he was going to up and split and lead a new life around a year ago. 

My mom has seemed to be going crazy for several years now. She has let things, major things just slip and not seemed to care. Like one of two homes she purchased with my father being repossessed by the city for back property taxes and the other is in foreclosure now. Mind you I was renting an apartment in the former and she never told me it had went to auction but luckily had not sold. She didn't tell me any of this until a year later when it did sell, luckily I was out of the apartment this time. 

Anyway things like that and other behaviors of hers have driven a wedge between us and I just really can't stand her anymore. So seeing things like that on a profile kind of just wrench me in the stomach. Like how do yo tell  someone that gets along with and enjoys their family that you would just rather not have ties with your own? That's the first thing that has me wondering, am I really just a douchebag? 
      
Since the breakup I've been trying to focus on more things I want to do with my life. Try not to count the days but make the days count kind of thing. My ex had brought up that she wished I was pationate about something. Well I think she's just a different kind of person than I am and doesn't find the things that I want to do with my life passion worthy. I had taken her on a cruise to the Caribbean  in the beginning of our relationship and we went snorkeling off Grand Cayman. I knew right then that I needed to go further and deeper. 

SCUBA had definitely become a huge goal but due to my having really meaningless lowpaying jobs, because she didn't like the industry I was in when we got together (which I left of my own accord seeing as gown thought I wanted out of the lifestyle myself) while trying to make the relationship work I stayed out if it and just dealt with the struggle, I wasn't able to get started in the training. I currently am only one more course from taking my open water certification, which feels great. I have been trying to go skydiving for several months when I have been off but the weather hasn't cooperated. I have a feeling I may pursue certification in that as well if I like it. 

Why all the useless info? Well earlier I said that I often feel like a one note kind of guy anymore. I don't feel like I have much to talk or joke about with people which is very different for me, I've always been a very funny and outgoing person. But seeing as I have a lot of different things I'm trying to get involved in I know I'm not the one note kind of guy I feel I am. But it's also been a hindrance in the dating realm because I'm constantly torn between ""she seems cool I'd probably like to meet her"" and ""I don't even want to deal with the hassle of meeting someone new, I've got too much going on with myself right now."" So again is this being a dick and just not trying to be a human anymore? I really can't tell.

 I know there are a lot of other things that are being a hindrance. I'm not happy with my physique lately and I know that plays into a lot of my mental process. I'm not obese but I'm also not where I was prior to the last relationship. I suffered a back injury last September which has made exercising quite a bit harder than it was and that sucks. Cause it makes me not even try to really meet anyone. I know this mainly focuses on this one aspect of life, that being relationships. But I guess I'm looking for a real answer. 

Have I just become too bitter and cynical or am I making excuses for myself? If you read this whole essay I've written to the end I at least thank you for that time. If you give any insight I appreciate that even more. Also side note. I have no idea how to really use dating sites. I've never had luck with them I can't look in someone's eyes when I say something sarcastic or witty and know If I've pushed a boundary or not. I've always had better luck in person. Although not having a life really doesn't help in that aspect. Thanks for your time Reddit.",24Jul2017,2

81,"How do I deal with those people when I can't even properly handle myself?  
First off, this is also kind of a religious rant, sorry for that but I have to write this off my chest.   
Sorry for the long post.
~

**tl;dr: My Wife's way older sister and her husband are Jehovah's Witnesses and I have an incredibly hard time being around them after getting way to deep into that matter (which was my own fault). How am I supposed to behave around them?**



So how did it come to this stage?  
When I first learned about them I didn't mind too much. I was raised in a christian family, but never  really believed in anything god-related (you might call me an atheist), however I am really interested in religion overall, it's just fascinating to me, so I do know a lot about the Bible. I'm also a Software engineer so people in my surrounding often joke about religious things and the like, which probably made me grow even more distant to actual believers.  

Then comes the day when I first met them. They wouldn't stop talking about god. Ever!  
Whatever they did, whatever they said, it was all about the Bible. They would constantly try to talk me into joining their meetups (btw., I did that later on to get some more insight; more later) and hand me all those Watchtower magazines to read... so I did.  
I didn't know much about the Jovah's Witnesses before, so reading those texts hit me like a truck. It was pretty tame for the most part (besides all the ""interviews"" being so blatantly faked, it actually made me cringe, being unable to read on at some particular parts). But then it got a little carried away when the talk about Armageddon started, with illustrations of little red demons spread all over the pages, talking about destroying the world.  

At this point I startet doing hours and hours of research on the Internet, taking notes, asking questions (yeah, I got carried away a lot, I know I shouldn't have) and so on. I'm a very critical thinker and eventhough I already learned a lot about Christianity, that new way of seeing things blew my mind and I still can't fully comprehend how they can believe in those things.  

When we visited my wife's sister the next time, I came prepared with around 15 pages of questions and contradictions in the Watchtower teachings and sat together with them that evening to talk about that.  
We stopped around 3 pages in, realizing it was pointless to begin with. They couldn't answer any of it but they didn't care whatsoever. I just got told they believe in it, and if I can't just believe it too I should join their meetups until I think the same (yes, that's literally what they said).  
 
That evening was also the first time I actually got angry at how close-minded they are (and they probably thought the same about me), when I asked them WHY they do believe in all of that, if they can't anser any of my questions or talk about the contradictions.  
The answer: ""The bible is the word of god, that's what it says"".  
Of course I asked how they knew, how they can be sure that's true.  
""In [xx part of the bible] it says the author was inspired by god and just wrote down the words god told him"".  
Alright then, the bible is the word of god, because one of the bible's authors told us it is. I think I pretty much snapped at that point, I felt so lost because I just couldn't argue with them.  
We had some harsh fights after that evening about how I was sent by the demons to shake their faith on one hand, and about how not even a 5 year old could make sense about what they're saying on the other hand (I agree that was really childish myself, I was blinded by anger at that point).

Months later we kind of calmed down again and when they sarted talking about the bible again I agreed to join one of their meetups. After a while they started talking about raising children, starting with how you shouldn't religiously influence them while they are too young to understand, but of course they have to be brought up living critically by the bible (?). They went on to how they should make their kids start practicing how to preach with their classmates, trying to convert them to the true ways of god. Also how parents can assist god in raising their children by physically punishing them, if for example they get into a relationship with someone who they won't marry. That day I learned that I obvisouly am a really aggresive person deep down, because after that I just wanted to punch them. I don't know why but I was literally shaking.  

That happend some weeks ago and I didn't see them since. I wouldn't mind not seeing them  again, but my wife really loves her sister so I somehow have to get over this. I'm trying, but they just won't stop bringing it up every time, they just never stop and I always let myself get caught up in it.  
I'll be honest: I hate them. I never really felt that feeling before but I actually hate them. Part of this is me being afraid of them influencing my family.

And I agree it was childish getting so into it, I agree I shouldn't feel this way but I just can't get it out of my head.  
I probably sound like an intolerant and aggressive asshole, I know that, but I had to get this off.   Sorry.  

If someone dealt with something like this before (especially on the religious side), I'd appreciate the advice.",24Jul2017,1
82,"Hi guys, so basically I work as a remote contract RoR web developer and I'm 2 months into a new relationship. I'm 29, she's 24. I like what I'm doing, it's flexible, enjoyable, somewhat stress-free. I don't like playing office politics and commuting for work.
But unfortunately the work schedule is unstable. I get $30/hr at roughly ~20 hours a week. No benefits.
I use my free time to learn ASP .NET and also to work on a building a business. I have a business plan. I want to build a website used by my town's asian community, raise awareness, and produce documentary videos for local businesses. I've got the website up, but it's a little embarrassing. PM if you want to see.
On one hand, life is short and I want to be happy. I've hated my previous full time jobs M-F 9-5. On the other hand, I need to give my girl results, show I'm doing something with my life.
How should I proceed?

84,"Hi Reddit, I've realised that due to my not having started work yet, and because my rent costs more than it usually should at the moment, I have just about 30 bucks in the bank for like the next 2-3 weeks.

I'd like some advice on Dumpster diving. I've never done it before and am wondering about how to go about it. Things like asking permission from the shop/waste disposal company. How should I go about that?

 With all the food that goes to waste (seen it first hand, and I've worked in a hotel so I would often pack up food that would otherwise have gone to waste) I'd like to really try and not waste any more, especially while so tight on money. 

I did some reading and research on my own and it seems that with the amount of food I could potentially collect, I could also give back to the community in a little way because there's a pretty consistent homeless problem in the city I live in and whenever I go for an early morning or late night stroll without the crowds in the city, it becomes really prevalent. So, maybe I could also get some disposable food boxes from a local takeaway for packaging and cook what I don't end up using myself for those sleeping on the streets when I can.
(I know how to cook quite well, so I could be sure of the quality of food before giving it to anyone else, in case anyone's worried about that!)

95,"I met my girlfriend at work about a year ago. She was only 21 years old and I was 36 and immediately we felt a very strong chemistry but she had a boyfriend and I had a girlfriend. We could not take our eyes from each other. I soon realized that I was falling in love with someone that was 15 years younger than me and even though that was ridiculous and scary I wanted to believe that age is just a number. She was an amazing person and a great friend.



 At that time she was having problems with her boyfriend and I was for having problems with my girlfriend, so I went ahead and decided to terminate with my relationship.  



Now for the rest of the next six months I dedicated myself to be in this new girl's life and for that to happen she would have to break up with her boyfriend that she loved.  Eventually he cheated on her and she cheated on him with me. We started dating and I met her family, they accept me and everything is perfect in the beginning until I found out that she was still talking to him on my back. I lost all the trust that I had in her because of her lying to me.



Within a couple months into dating she got pregnant and told me that wanted to have the baby and that she loved me. I freaked out so I told her to get an abortion. Three days later I regreted it but he was already too late, and the abortion was done. She was mentally devastated . I got really affected by that as well, I couldn't believe I just lost a child, our child.



She decided to go ahead and break up with me and started to see a psychologist.  I felt guilty, embarrassed and lost amongst a lot of other feelings but I didn't give up on her.  I tried to get back with her and reset the relationship. After some persistency she told me that she would give me another chance but she didn't love me anymore and that was going to take time. I think deep inside I did not want to believe that and I kept trying and trying and trying for another couple of months. I just couldn't believe that she stopped loving me out of a sudden.



From this point on I could tell she was a different person, had zero tolerance with me and she would break up with me every other week. But I wasn't ready to let it get go because I felt like it was my fault and it was my duty and the right to make things right and keep trying. But I was wrong,  I was never able to change her mind or make her fall in love again with me. For me it was hard to trust her again especially when she would go out with her friends. I I didn't know what to believe anymore. 



She ended up quitting the job so that she can stay away from me and that and Immediately I felt that my life just ended. From that day on I was never the same at work, I could not focus, I could not be productive, I could not be on time for work and I look like crap everyday. Depression took over my life.


Then one day I was able to talk to her and we decided to open a small business as friends, so I quit my high paying job leaving behind a 3 years career and a sour taste in my bosses mouth. Basically I burned a bridge and I know that was wrong. 


Deep inside I just wanted us to stay close together and try to conquer her heart again.  I was willing to do everything and anything including losing my career to have her back. I wanted to open a business with her for the wrong reasons. That caught up to us really quick. During the process of opening the new business she decided to give me a new chance romantically and that was the happiest day of my life and at that point I felt that everything I lost careerwise was worth it. 


But the honeymoon only lasted a few weeks and then we started to fight almost every day and eventually in order for us to stay together I thought that would be better if I got back into my field and get a job and give her some space. 



Our relationship became toxic, she never forgot the fact that I asked her to abort our child and that was the every day topic of our fights. I have to be honest it was the worst mistake of my life but it was done and there was nothing I could do. She continuously wanted to break up and for some reason I feel like we could work things out and kept trying.



So eventually I got a job and she brought her family in to help her out with the business. I start going once in a while to help out but I could not get along with her dad. So that was another motive now for us to fight about.  One day I got into a verbal fight with her dad, I lost my cool and almost put my hands on him. When she saw that she got it in between and pushed me away and called the cops on me. She was pissed off. Her whole family was there and they hated me instantly. Honestly I can't blame her/them because I would protect my family with everything so I understand.  I was very irrational move on my part to disrespect her family, I should kept my mouth shut and walk away but I didn't. Unfortunately I have a habit of making decisions that I regret almost immediately and unfortunately I can't make the clock go backwards.



 At this point she wants to be totally done with me in which I have no other option but finally accept it. 



Depression takes over my life again, I can't focus at work, I can't be on time, I look like crap and basically I'm not producing. This time I get fired. 



So at this point in life I lost my job, I lost my girlfriend, I lost my business.



Now to make things worst I carry a lot of debt since I got divorced. She wiped me clean. I'm about 50K in hospital bills from my motorcycle accident two years ago, about 100K in loans and credit cards, I'm behind on my rent, I'm behind on my car payment, behind on my insurance, utilities and basically losing my mind. I have prolly 2 more weeks to survive out of 300 bucks. When I owe about 4K in bills right now. To be honest I even thought about ending my life. I know it's the coward way but I have almost no friends maybe 2 or 3no family in the country, no dog, NO ONE!! So it's something that crosses my mind quite often when depression takes over. 



In regards to the business because I had all this debt going I thought that would be better to make her the owner. My name was only on the lease and a personal loan with the previous owner. However I came up with the concept A to Z and spent countless hours working there without making a pennie which made fall further behind. She told me that she changed all paperwork to her name and I wasn't welcome at the business anymore.



I know that all this is my fault, my temper, my personality which  basically sucks and I'm not capable to hold anything that's important to me in my life.  I'm actually really worried not knowing how the hell I'm going to get out of this hole because of all this financial problems plus the emotional problems and they blocked me from moving forward. I guess I feel guilty for hurting the person that I love the most. 



I feel like I need to talk to her and try to apologize in order to move on but I think that is another trick that my mind is trying to play trick on me in order to keep fighting for her. Anyway I tried talking to her but she blocked me everywhere, email, phone number, instagram, Snapchat, Facebook,etc... I love her so much. I really do. This is killing me. 

I'm really lost...

108,"First off let me start by saying that the relationship between my half sister (same mother different father) and I has always been a tense one. There will be times we get along well but compared to the times when we are not speaking, it isn't very often. 

When our parents passed away within months of each other we had put our differences aside for a while and we were on pleasant terms. Mainly because even tho I had an updated will from my father leaving me everything, I decided to just split everything evenly with her if she'd handle the logistics.  For almost 5 and half years (a record actually) we got along great. 

Slowly however she started becoming domineering.  I am an atheist. She is Catholic.  I decided to branch out with my art and try carving something out of wood. I chose a Ouija board because why the hell not. Omg she went ballistic on FB trying to get my cousins and my friends to stage an intervention before Satan took my soul to Hell. I admit I fanned the flames a little bit and started posting a BUNCH of anti religious memes and such. Even calling out the Pagan origins of major Christian holidays.  One day she called me up and told me I was going to hell unless I embraced the lord.  I shrugged it aside. 

Later on when the elections were heating up she'd call and try to get me to vote for Trump by telling me about Hillary and Pizzagate and throwing gay people of buildings (I'm gay btw). And how Trump was so gay friendly. I told her I didn't like either candidate, but I certainly wasn't going to vote for Trump. That was about a month or so before Thanksgiving 2016.  Because of the two arguments prior I didn't bother inviting her to Thanksgiving, instead I spent it with my Husband's family(who are Trump supporters, but far more respectful when it comes to others political beliefs). I did not hear anything else until the 1st of January 2017. 

I get a call that morning and the first thing I hear is ""You don't love me! Why the fuck haven't you called me in 3 months!?  Not hello. I tell her I didn't want to get into another argument and she blew up at me telling me she was dying from Kidney Disease and I don't care about her. Words were exchanged and she ended with ""I want nothing more to do with you!"" And she hung up. 

3 months later around my Birthday she calls again all sugary sweet saying she wants to know what I want for my birthday. Bear in mind I have heard nothing from her since January. I respond by saying "" I thought you wanted nothing more to do with me?"" And she denies ever saying it in the first place.  And she goes off again how I never call her. I tell her again what she told me that day and follow up by saying I was just respecting your wishes. Is there anything else you want?  She says no and I hang up without saying goodbye. 

I know eventually she's going to try and insert herself in my life again at some point. Whether it's because she actually is dying or some other reason.  Also note that over the many years since we were kids there has always been some crisis where she might be dying. I take such news with a grain of salt now. She is very dramatic. My half sister( same father different mother) thinks the same as I do.  

Can I actually keep the crazy one out of my life?  Or will I be obligated to help her out if things are as bad as she says for once?",24Jul2017,6
109,"To make a very long story as short as possible:

I went drinking with a friend (who is 5 years younger than me) and she got absolutely plastered. Our friends and I told her for over an hour that it was time to go home. She flipped me off and told me a guy (who was really drunk) would drive her home. She disappeared with said guy on the beach. I searched for her for another hour and couldn't find her. 

Eventually I had to make the call to leave her. I had other friends who were sick and falling asleep, plus it was almost 3am. Words can't describe that it was the hardest decision I've made in my life.

Right before I got home, she called me and asked me to come back and get her. It was a 40 minute drive. I did it; took her home. She was a bit disoriented, but able to walk to my car and up her driveway.

Next day I chewed her out for being a drunk asshole and told her that she's lucky I came back and didn't make her find her own way home. She accused me of facilitating date rape, being an untrustworthy DD, and failing to take her to the hospital for alcohol poisoning/rape.

I DD 99% of the time my friends go out and have had to make somewhat similar calls, but have never been chewed out for it before. I assume a lot of responsibility as the DD, but always go off of the idea that ultimately the drunk person is responsible for their actions even if inebriated.

Do I break up with her and tell her the truth?

Do I tell her the truth and buy her a gym membership? She's a pretty lazy person but I think if it hits her that her weight is effecting her life she might put effort into losing some.

When they told my wife they also said not to worry because Insurance would cover it.  It rubbed my wife the wrong way and i just received the explanation of benefits from the insurance provider and they do cover it...however I'm now down $400 each kid in lifetime coverage for their braces (but surely the dentist has a nice boat down payment), so it basically comes right out of my pocket.  I'm upset about the whole thing and surely we aren't going back to this Dentist.  I feel like he took advantage of us and insurance.  People like him raise the cost of insurance for all of us and I don't want him taking advantage of others.

So here are my questions:
1) When I call the dentist to confront, what do I ask for?

At first I really did think it was just me that she hated (being the poor white guy that married her daughter, instead of the filthy rich, chinese man she envisioned). Or maybe it was because of the language barrier that she generally ignores me when i'm speaking right to her. But it's the same for everyone. And she seems to be getting progressively worse.

Can anyone please give advice on the best way to manage this? She's been going to the church and giving them hundreds, in hopes that god will cure her, but I don't think she's even considered speaking to a doctor - or how I would go about getting her to see one.

Anyhow, I'm at a point in my life where I would like close friends and, god forbid, a girlfriend but am disinterested in most everything. I don't care to talk to people, I don't care for viral sensations people enjoy like Harambe, gaming channels, fidget spinners and ""oddly-satisfying"" whatchamajimmy.

149,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. The title is fairly self explanatory, but I really don't know what to do.
My wife and I used to have sex regularly (about 4-5 times a week ish), then when she got to about 3 months pregnant, it just stopped. For the following 6 months of pregnancy, we probably had sex twice?

After our baby was born, we didn't have sex for 4 months. I know that it takes some women a really long time to recover and ""feel sexy"" again, and I was absolutely fine with that, I always just told her it wasn't a problem. 

Fast forward to now, our baby is one year old, and we're having sex every couple of months or so, and I am literally always the one to instigate it. She keeps telling me that she feels fat (she is a size 12) and is always tired/has a headache. I've tried to be as supportive as possible, and tell her every single day that I think she is as beautiful as the day I met her. I just don't know what to do about it, i'm always the one who tries to instigate something, and i'm starting to worry that she's just lost all interest in me whatsoever. I've asked her if this is the case a few times, but she always just says its because she doesn't feel attractive. 

When it actually comes down to trying it on with her, it is always ""not now, later I promise"" then later in the day its ""i'm tired"".

I really just don't know what to do, sex is an incredibly important part of a marriage, and it isn't literally the sex part that bothers me, it's worrying that she just isn't into me anymore. 

For the first time in my life, I am finding myself getting more and more depressed, and I just don't know what to do about it.

153,"So, I've been friends with this girl for about 3 years now, and for as long as I've known her, she's been single. I've always thought of her as a really good friend and caring person. She's the kind of person that would drop everything and come to your house with a tub of ice cream just because you've had a bad day. She's also the person responsible for introducing me to most of my university friends and helping me overcome my shyness, etc. 
The problem is, she got in a relationship about 4 months ago, and the way she treats her boyfriend (21m) really bothers me. 

He's a nice, but extremely shy/ quiet person, who seems like he might have kind of low self-esteem. We're all in university together, so I knew him before they started dating, but we were acquaintances more than friends. Despite this, I'm really upset by the way my friend treats him. She's controlling, manipulative, and thoughtless. She's joked to me about how she went through his friend list and made him delete any girls she didn't know, despite her having plenty of male friends, and even exes whom she messages regularly. Once after a night out (without him) she asked me to go and get the morning after pill with her because she had ended up going home with one of her exes and didn't remember what happened (I didn't notice, or else I would have tried to stop her). She felt horrible about it, but she never told her bf.

Once, a group of about 6 of us were hanging out in the Uni pub getting drunk and she leaned down to pick something up, and her head was near his crotch and he joked 'be careful down there' and she flipped out. She went home and refused to talk to him for 2 weeks, saying that she can't believe she trusted him, and accused him of sexually harassing her. She was raped when she was younger, which he knew, so she was basically guilting him and saying that he betrayed her trust and she 'needed space'. He was grovelling apologetic, and begged her to forgive him. I also tried to reason with her about it (because I thought she was blowing it way out of proportion) but she just got upset with me too, and told me to mind my own business. Eventually, she got over it, but she never admitted to being in the wrong. She also makes fun of him behind his back, telling everyone that he was a virgin when they started dating so he's not very good in bed, and casually saying that she's the 'attractive one' in the relationship. I just think that's such a fucked up way to think/ talk about your significant other. 

I'm not one to interfere with other people's relationships, and I guess it's probably up to my friend's bf to stand up for himself but I feel really bad for him. I've tried to talk to my friend about this stuff, but she's always extremely defensive about anything involving him, and doesn't take any kind of criticism well. This had made me think a lot less of her as a person, but I also know that almost all of my university friends are also friends with her, so avoiding hanging out with her isn't really option. I just feel like her boyfriend doesn't have the self-esteem to realise he doesn't need to put up with that. I'm always nice to him whenever I see him, but I'm still not sure we're close enough for me to talk to him about it, and I'm not even sure he'd want to hear it. I just really don't know what to do. Should I mind my own business or do something? What would you do in the same situation?",24Jul2017,12

159,"Hi there, /r/Advice. My name's Karli, and I just turned 17 on the 16th of this month. My mom was a bit of a sheltered child, so she was sort of ignorant when it came to dating and marriage. My dad has been an alcoholic since a pretty young age (he came from an abusive family, so it was always a way to cope), but he managed to convince my mom that he'd change. When they were married he would abandon my mom and my brother (a toddler at the time) for entire nights and binge drink, eventually passing out somewhere. My mom used to stay up all night crying, not even sure if he was alive or not. Though my dad came from a bad family initially, he had a lot of support; my mom's family immediately accepted him as their own, and his workplace would refuse to fire him and would actively try to help him, even though he would often times miss work due to drinking. He even went to a nice rehab facility and came back claiming that he would change his habits. This, of course, was a lie.

By the time my mom found out she was pregnant with me, she was already planning to leave him. I think I was about two when she finally did, and we moved in with my grandma. I rarely ever saw my dad; he started dating a woman who made meth for a living and abused her three children (two twin 4-year-olds and a boy my age), and my dad contributed, both to the drug making and the abuse. I would occasionally be allowed to visit, but only with my brother(5 years older than me) constantly watching me; many of the people that would come-and-go in the house would eventually be convicted of child molestation. My mom, of course, was unaware of both this and the meth-making. My dad never really did have any interest in me, since he never got to know me, but he always loved my brother.

Once I became a teenager I learned of the meth-making and abuse, and finally decided to distance myself from that side of my family; I stopped communicating with them, and even created an alias for my last name. My mom approves of my officially changing my last name on my 18th birthday. I'm now a pretty successful person; I became a published author at 14, and currently work as both a journalist/podcast host, as well as a dietary aid for a nursing home. I'm already enrolled in college, and am almost finished with my associates. I'm embarrassed of my dad's side of the family, and I actively try to distance myself from them. 

Like I said, my birthday was on the 16th of this month. Though I unfriended my dad on facebook about a year ago and changed my last name, I guess he still managed to find me. This was the first time he's made any attempt to contact me in at least 5 years. A few days ago, he sent me:

""Happy belated birthday...I love and miss you very much""

I couldn't help but feel as though I needed to say something back, but I eventually decided against it; even though I hate it, I can be an extremely empathetic person, and I know my dad would take advantage of me if I kept in contact with him. 

I thought it would be a one-time attempt, but last night he sent me: 

""Love and miss you more than word's can describe.....gonna figure out how and what I can do to become a part of your life again.....I do love you so much""

I hate him, I really do. My brother still has some mental issues from being abandoned by his role model, and he made my mom feel so alone. I'll especially never forgive him in his role as an abuser to three innocent children; I have no idea what would come of the twins, but the one my age is a drug addict and, according to rumor, a rapist. Despite all of this, there's a part of me that truly does want to help him, even though he's rejected help for so long. 

So, /r/Advice, what should I do? Should I keep ignoring him as I have been and live my own, separated life, or should I at least be the good person in the situation and message him back? If I do, should I simply say ""I love you, too"", or should I actually speak my mind? ",24Jul2017,1

I’m going to the gym about 5 days a week now, and occasionally work out 6 days a week. I want to start tanning again, however, I don’t want to lay in a bed and damage my skin anymore. I used to do so, but I’ve stopped. I miss that skin color so much, though.

Problem is, spray tans and bronzers have (from what I’ve read, anyway) to sit for 24 hours with no sweating in order to be effective.

Anyone have any ideas how to get darker? Not using a traditional bed, without the streakiness of spray on/bronzer, and not breaking the bank?

Thank you so much in advance!

BTW, I can’t go outside to tan – I have a full time job indoors. :(

172,"This isn't a typical homeless question. I guess my advice is where to go from the situation I'm in. So for a few months my current roommate and I had decided to find a new 2 bedroom, lowering our costs, and move in together. We both procrastinated, but that was fine because its a college area so a lot of places are available now, and easy to get into. 

Well with 4 days to go before move out, I have to be out by noon on Thursday, he told me he didnt have money for rent or a deposit. Basically 200 dollars to his name. No job. He can go home to his mom's because she isn't far away. 

I had already known I might need to pay more, I didnt have a job but a fair savings, and I went and got a job at a company so we would have proof of income. Also so I could have a job. 

I don't have any places I can go for a day or two, so basically Thursday at noon I'm homeless. The option I'm at right now, is I've applied for a 1 bedroom, and that application is said to take a few days. So I should know, hopefully by thursday. 

The question is where or what I can do now, because I have a car and 1200 dollars to my name, but I can't afford to live at a hotel. Especially the cheapest one I found was 300 a week, which though I could pay that, I wouldn't be able to pay insurance, and phone bills as well. 

I guess my question is, I have a 80 percent chance of being accepted into this apartment. I have a 750 + credit score, I never miss payments, and am pretty thorough. If I were rejected, it would be because I can't provide paystubs, only the job offer paperwork. Which the owner stated should work but didn't guarantee. 

Should I be applying to other places? Should I go to a motel if this doesn't work out. What's the next step, for preparing for the worst.

173,"Hello. I am a male and I like my best friend who is a female. We are both in our early twenties. I have never been lucky with girls. I have had only 1 few months relationship with a girl which ended because of religious differences. I am not religious, neither is the girl in question.

I met her on my side job at a supermarket but she got another lucky colleague as her boyfriend back then. This was about 5 years ago. A few years later we started really talking and became best friends. About 3 years ago, she broke up with the boyfriend (he went gay but that's irrelevant).

I have liked her from the moment I saw her on her first day of work. We both have the same interests and hobbies (we both play guitar and do this together sometimes).

I truly like her, but the thing is that I do not want to lose her as a friend if things go wrong. I do want do finally do this though, as it is driving me crazy. I have had a few moments I wanted to do it, but I chickened out. 

Later this week, though, we are going to have lunch and see a movie together. I will drive her home. Is this a good time to do it?

181,"I hurt my back at work a week ago and my boss has been bugging me ever since about going to see a doctor and getting back to work. I haven't gone yet for a variety of reasons, the biggest being that it's been getting better steadily so I haven't seen the need. Also, I don't want workers compensation or anything like that, it's just a side job that I don't really need and more than anything I just want to be left alone so I can let it heal without potentially re-aggravating it by returning to the job before I feel 100%. 

This morning my boss called me for the third straight day asking if I've gone to the doctors yet and I stupidly replied yes and said I'd likely be out for a couple weeks, just to try to get him to leave me alone for a bit. However, now he is asking for a note or some kind of proof and he wants it in the next few hours, so there would not be any time for me to actually go see a doctor between now and then. I'm worried that since I don't have a note he could just call my doctor himself and ask if I went (is that even legal?)

Any advice on how I can get out of the shitty situation I've gotten myself in?

186,"Hey, hope this fits here. I'm a university student, and despite being at a very good university, studying a subject I find interesting and having a loving girlfriend, I constantly feel like I'm never going to be really happy. 

I guess there are certain instances in my life that you'd need to hear about. About 6 months ago, I received a medical discharge from the Army Reserve Intelligence Unit I was in, after- I shit you not- a single day post-attestation. I will be blunt here- it destroyed me. It was not only the basis for my plans for my summer- providing me with a financial base for the immediate future as well as giving me something meaningful to spend my time on- but I had been seriously considering pursuing it full time post university simply because I was seized with an innate feeling of fitting in. The discharge was a permanent one, from all 3 branches. I was and am still devastated. This particular development was all the more depressing because it was the very first time I had received a paying specialised position purely as a result of my own research and work, rather than simply being offered it or suggested it by my father. I was my own man, accomplishing things for myself, and then I was told I was back to being a success free child again. 

That was the main thing that hit me this year. Now it's summer, I'm stuck working in my dad's business doing jobs any incompetent shitheel can do, learning nothing and going nowhere. Any attempt I make to stand on my own two feet seems to go nowhere. At home, I receive constant flack for not exactly being awash with enthusiasm for a dead end job. I'm told that everybody my age is in this situation, but my friends and my girlfriend are all moving forward and have real jobs that they themselves earned. I have no independence at all as a result- I might as well still be 16. I'm trying to buy a motorbike to gain some semblance of control, but I know in my heart that I'm never going to realise my dreams because the only route I saw in is forever closed off to me.

I feel like I'm whining, but nothing ever seems to change and I'm sick of standing still- even as I realise this is pretty much all I can do for the next 2-3 years.

188,"So I own a house in a city, with an separate attic apartment. It's a full apartment with its own kitchen and bathroom, and a separate entrance.

A longtime (25 year plus) friend of mine and his wife rent the apartment. They and I aren't that close anymore - more friendly housemates than friends. They've been living in this house for 15 years. During that time, they haven't usually been able to pay full rent, but they've always paid some rent.

They also have an 11 year old son, who has lived in this house his whole life. I love the son like he was my own nephew.

Almost two years ago, the dad lost his job (I think he was more or less fired), and hasn't worked since. The mom has a part-time job. Both of them seem to me to be suffering from depression. They take care of the basics - they buy groceries, feed their kid, do the laundry (although often the clean laundry sits out in piles rather than ever being put away), drive the kid to sleepovers - but nothing more. Their apartment is an astounding mess - leftovers sitting on counters and sofas, etc.. They both have depression, and acknowledge that (although I don't know if they've been formally diagnosed).

Apart from when she goes to work, they spend all their waking time browsing the internet or watching TV. He says he's looking for work, but I'm not sure he's looking more than fitfully - he never seems to be writing letter or going to interviews or looking at help wanted sections. 

It has been a year since the last time they paid rent. I feel bad for their situation, and won't evict them - that might force them to move to South Carolina to move in with his parents, in a tiny town, and I can't do that to their son.

But I really want them to pay rent. 

But I also know that depression is a real barrier. 

Anyway, I'd be interested in any advice people have. What should I say to them?",24Jul2017,2

I have a problem which might seem kinda harmless, but is currently really weighing heavily on me and my mental health. 
Basically, ever since I was a teen I keep getting negative thoughts, you know, like when you get cringy memories when you go to sleep? I have that all the time. I was able to live with that, more or less, but it has gotten worse... 
Ever since I broke up with my girlfriend I keep thinking about her, the good times, the bad times, I imagine situations that never happened and actually can get rage from that (like really angry, just because I think about a fight that never happened).
It doesn't even have to be my ex, just basically anything, like a not returned ""Good morning"" can get me on the edge because I start thinking about, analyzing it in my head: ""Why didn't he greet?"" - ""What did I do?"" - Then imagining some kind of situation where I fight those people. 
It always comes down to bad experiences and especially my past, I can't get a straight thought, I can't distract myself without going back into the past and some stupid event that lies heavily on my heart. 
Also my job is very monotonous, so I my mind is always wandering from one bad situation to another. Music helps sometimes, but that's not allowed at work and I'd like to have a real ""cure"".

So, I've been going to a school called Waccamaw, forever. Since I was in kindergarten. We've moved in and out of the state I'm in which is South Carolina a couple of times, none of which were over two years. 

In the fourth grade we moved back and I was excited. I knew everyone, and I would be fine. Fast forward to about 6th grade and we move out of the house we'd been living in since the 4th grade, to a house which is out of county. We, after that had always been using the old address, to use for the school information. 

But now, fast forward to about 8th grade, and the school and district are gaining more and more suspension about our address. They would send us to the office, maybe every two months and what not. 9th grade they kind of just let it happen, nothing exciting. Now we get to sophomore year. At the beginning, they told us my family would have to pay 6000 total for me and my sisters and brothers to go to this school and they know damn well we aren't paying that. For the rest of the year I was getting sent to the office pretty much bi-weekly, always interrogating me about what my actual address is. 

Now I'm about to be a junior and they want atleast a 3,000 dollar deposit on the bill, or we can't go. This is extremely disappointing, considering they know what situation my family is in. And I'm not gonna come through 10 grades to be stopped when I have two left.

202,"Hello fellow redditors,
forgive me for my badly structured sentences that I will write now.
8 years or so ago, my parents and me moved from one European country to another. My parents were arguing with each other before moving to another country. But it was about my fathers alcoholism. Since we moved to the other country, a lot of years have passed, and my mother started to talk to other guys, (probably because she got fed up by my fathers drinking problems) and well my father noticed it, they were arguing a lot these past years, some of that arguing escalated to me being mentally scarred. My father as I said, has a drinking problem, but all around he is a real down to earth guy, never screams at me etc. My mom does not drink, but she has a short fuse so to speak. My mother tends to argue with my father ALWAYS when he's drunk. And that leads to really bad confrontations.(My father never hits my mom, only pushes her away if self defense is needed, but it sometimes escalates by my father grabbing her, and my mom spitting on him, breaking laptops, phones, family portraits etc.). So my father, these past years caught my mom over 20 times in her act of cheating, but my mom is really manipulative, and she turns the conflict around so that my father is the one who is guilty, and she uses threats such as her wanting to commit suicide, or leaving us and she sometimes manipulates my dad with sex so he can forgive her, sadly that's working for her. Now to my problem.(Sorry for being so detailed) When my parents argue, I developed a sort of anxiety, where when my parents are not arguing and there's no hostile vibe in our house, I am afraid, really afraid that my parents are arguing in the other room, even if they are not. 
Do you have some advice that I could use the next time my parents will start to argue ? Because I don't want to be a part of their arguing, because my mother likes to pull me in in the arguing and blames me for being on my dad's side and not hers, even if I'm not (I'm on neither side).

205,"So, I didn't screw anyone's wife or cheat or anything like that. Here's what happened.

I attended grad school with ""Dave"" around 5 years ago. We were never the best of friends, merely acquaintances. We were Facebook friends, which of course, really doesn't mean anything at all, but we were cordial enough with each other that I had accepted his friend request. Dave and I were in the same social circle of about 8-9 people, but eventually he was the only one I didn't feel that connected to and secretly didn't like.

Why didn't I like him? Without getting too bogged down in details: Dominated group projects/discussion, very narcissistic, regularly dropped the fact that he has membership in MENSA, bragged about getting a 6-figure job, mocked the company I worked for; in general, he was a sarcastic dick who thought he knew everything. Also, his avid support for a public figure I disdain turned me off completely. After I graduated, I pulled away a bit from the friend group for happy hours and what not if Dave was there; I've rarely seen the guy for the last two years.

Fast forward to one month ago. He posts this gem on Facebook: ""Calling a black person an n-word isn't racist. Telling someone you can't date their daughter because of the color of their skin is racist. Can you dig?"" (note, he didn't say ""n-word"" in the post, he used the actual term)

Um, can all sane-thinking people agree that both things are really racist? My girlfriend is African-American, so suffice it to say, I wasn't particularly thrilled reading this. After stewing about this for a while, I finally unfriended the idiot, but it didn't seem good enough for me.

Then I remembered Dave posted a compilation video of his wedding about a year ago on YouTube. There were a bunch of sarcastic comments from people I assume were strangers about how the video was awkward and how Dave and his wife didn't really seem to love each other.

So I responded anonymously that they didn't know the half of it, that Dave was a racist (I repeated the FB post verbatim) and that his girlfriend had already fucked other dudes after they married (which I had no way of knowing for sure; I remember Dave saying that she would secretly text other men while they were a committed couple, but before they were married). Basically, I wanted to say something that was true (the racist stuff), but also say something untrue but entirely plausible that might rattle his cage and maybe cause him some problems with his wife. I really didn't think it would do anything other than give him doubts about his marriage; I'll be honest ... I just wanted to be a dick.

Fast forward to this morning: Text from mutual friend: ""Dude, Dave just moved out of his house and left his wife. She admitted she cheated on him"".

OK, is there really anything horrible with what I did? I really have no tolerance for racism. I think of it as karma coming to collect. I'm typically a ""leave well enough alone"" type of person, but after being around this racist asshole for 5 years, I think he had it coming.

213,"I've seen stories of ingenious acts of payback and revenge from this site and I created an account for this. Sorry but it's a long story and a bit complicated so please read carefully and try to follow along-

I have a now 11 year old daughter with my ex wife. We were divorced 8 years ago and she remarried a Navy EOD guy (we'll call him Nic), relocated to San Diego while I live in Florida, and they had 2 kids together. Well, 3 years ago while I had my daughter for the summer of 2014, she was having trouble sleeping at night and started wetting the bed again when she hadn't in a few years. Tried asking her what was wrong and remedying the problem. First it was seeing shadows through the window so we added blackout curtains. Next it was noises so we got her a noise machine. Next it was ""Nic is choking me"". My heart sank. We asked no more questions and filed a report with CPS the next day. They interviewed my daughter and she repeated it to them. They sent an interviewer in San Diego to interview my ex and Nic. Of course Nic denied it but so did my ex. Whether she lied to prevent more abuse for her or the kids or out of love, it doesn't matter. She's a piece of shit too. Anyways, the case went no where. All we had was the word of an 8yr old. About 1 1/2 years later my ex and Nic are splitting up. My ex and the kids all move back to Florida and he gets PCS'ed to Panama City in Florida as well. About another year of divorce proceedings and she tries using his anger and the fact that he choked my daughter against him in court. Of course because she told them before it didn't happen, it was no good. Just looks like she's lying again to try and get custody of their kids. So anyways, I have my daughter for the summer right now and I JUST NOW found out Monday that she admitted it happened and was trying to use it so I decided it was time to ask my daughter myself what happened and get more details about the situation. What I did next may not be the best course of action with my daughter, but I was obviously disturbed and shaken to finally know my ex admitted it happened and needed to move as quick as possible. I took my daughter to dinner just me and her. After dinner I asked if it was ok if I asked her some questions. She said sure. I said it was about Nic. Her face went from smiling to stone cold. I asked if it would be ok if I recorded it and she nodded yes. I had no idea how to start or what to ask and it was obviously very hard for a parent to ask their child these questions. I tried to start off slow asking if Nic was a nice guy. She struggled for words and eventually said ""not so much"". I asked if he ever yelled at her and she nodded her head adamantly yes with wide eyes. Then I decided to get deeper. I asked if he ever hurt her. Her uncomfortable shuffling and avoidance of eye contact looking any where and everywhere other than at me answered my question. I asked if he did anything she didn't like. She said ""yeah"" while looking down at the table. I asked what he did. She said ""sometimes he would choke me"". I asked if she could show me how he did it. She placed her hand around her throat with her thumb on her wind pipe. I asked if he used just 1 hand. She said ""sometimes he would use 2"". I asked why he would do it. She said ""when I got in trouble and couldn't stop crying"". I asked if she could count on one hand how many times he did it. She shook her head no. I asked if she could count on 2 hands how many times he did it and again she shook her head no. I quit asking questions at this point because it was too much. Next 2 days I took off and were spent tracking down and contacting the proper law enforcement agencies ( because it's either Sheriff's dept or a Police jurisdiction). I called DCF, the San Diego police department (since it happened in San Diego and there was already a case), found his base here in Panama City, FL and contacted the CDO and Fleet and Family Support Center. This is where this whole situation leaves me feeling helpless. The director of the Fleet and Family support center tells me there's nothing the military will do without getting charged in the civilian world since it's been so long ago. DCF says what my daughter told them is disturbing but there's nothing they can do because she's no longer in that situation and it was too long ago. The sergeant over the case for the San Diego Police Dept explained the statute of limitations in California to me. If there would have been bruises or broken blood vessels and would have been documented, it would have been a felony and would have been 3 years limitations. No evidence, it was a misdemeanor and would have been 1 year limitations. Since my ex lied to the first CPS interviewer and the case was stopped, the limitations have passed. There's nothing I can do to him legally now. I can't let this monster who choked an 8 year old girl, MY LITTLE GIRL! MULTIPLE TIMES!! get away with what he did all because he terrified my ex into lying for him. Not only that, but he has 50/50 custody of his kids with my ex now and he's here in Florida within driving distance. He can show up any time he wants. My daughter still has to see this man. He still terrifies her. She lives in constant fear of this man. The night after I asked her about him, not just her bedroom light but EVERY light in the house was on when I got up the next morning. I feel so helpless and like a piece of crap father for not doing more even though I know there's nothing I could have done more. He needs to pay. What can I do?

214,"I know when I'm working on projects at work, I get so caught up in trying to know every little detail on the project, that I can never piece it all together to create a big picture.

I notice when I TRY (I say try because it's harder than it sounds for me), to actually tell myself to ""step back"" and ""see the big picture"" it CAN help some, but how do I do this so seamlessly like everyone else seems to be able to do with everything?

216,"I recently got accepted to be a part-time telephone surveyor. The pay is $8 plus commission per survey completed. It seems like a nice part-time job for a pre-med college student like me and could help me get a foot in the door as a receptionist at a medical office in the future. The only catch is that it's 25 miles from my house (30-40 minute drive. Taking the tollway reduces it to 20-30 minute). I also went in for an interview at petsmart for a stocker position and was scheduled for another interview with the manager in a few days. Of course, this job has nothing to do with my career plans but it pays decently well and is about a 10 minutes drive (3 miles).

I've applied to countless other places (grocery stores, medical offices, manufacturing companies, ect.) but these two were the first to respond. I need to save up some money because I have payments to make for my fall classes and an upcoming trip in December. I'm 21 and still living with my parents, so it just doesn't feel right for me to constantly rely on them. I do have some money saved up but it's mainly for gas. grocery, and the occasional eating out with the family.

So my question is: Should I take the telephone surveyor job, wait and hope to be accepted for the petsmart job, or spend time searching for another healthcare-related job near me?

224,"Hey everyone. I'm a 17 year old incoming high school senior who is 5'4"". I was never a small kid, just pretty average, but I never hit a real growth spurt that all the guys around me seemed to do between 8th and 10th grade. In middle school, I recall most guys being around my height, but after 9th grade everyone just shot up past me why I remained stagnant. It felt horrible :(

My mom is 5'2"" and my dad is 5'7"", so my short parents probably explains it. However, my older 20 year old brother is 5'11"", which is above average, so my mom believes something is wrong with me. I went to the doctor with her during 10th grade to discuss my height, but the doctor tested all my hormone levels and everything came out normal. He then did a growth plate examination and said that my growth plates were not closed yet but that I was unlikely to grow more than an inch. At that time, it seemed to have ripped up my mom more than me since I didn't realize how demoralizing being this short as a male was.

I do my best to live a healthy, nutritious lifestyle, and I'm my school's best member on cross country. I keep my grades up with a 4.0 GPA, 35 ACT SAT, and I'm working my ass off to get into a good university. I've come to realize that being short automatically puts me at a disadvantage in nearly every facet of life, especially romantically, and I know I'm gonna have to work 100% harder than even the hardest workers out there, but fuck it - I can't control this shit. I love my brother to death, but I can't help but have relentless envy for his height. I can see the way my mother looks at him, the way she asks him about all the girls he's getting with his large build, the excitement she gets when he comes home from college for winter break. It makes me feel like shit. 

I've tried speaking with my mom about how she makes me feel, but she keeps telling me I can change this ""condition"" by eating better and doing exercises better suited for taller people (like basketball). I am not and never have been malnourished, and I've always gotten great exercise, especially since I run long distance all the time. I consume more than enough protein, calcium and vitamin D. My brother ate like shit during high school and never exercised until he began lifting senior year, but he had already reached 5'11"" in 10th grade. We all know there is nothing I can do at this point since genetics reign supreme. My dad even tells her to lay off the comments, and it seems like he is the only one who understands how I feel since he himself is a little short (though 5'7"" is miles better than 5'4"" since many adult women are under 5'7""). 

So how should I approach her with this? She is still under the belief that I am in control of my height in spite of our doctor's advice. I know deep down she loves me, that's why she gives so many fucks about my height in the first place, but the manner with which she speaks and treats me makes me feel unappreciated and worthless, as if all of my hard work in areas I *can* control means nothing.

229,"Alright, so, I'll give a summary of things.

Today I was invited out by a family friend and her kids. I'm twenty myself, and, while she was off doing her own thing me and the kids saw a movie. She requested that if her young son needed to go to the toilet, that I went with him just to make sure everything's alright. In a big public place with easily a few thousand people, it was only natural for her to worry about what sort of people might be lurking around. Understandable. I had no problem with that.

Half way through the movie, kid tells me he needs to pee - convenient timing as I was in the same boat. Either way, I show him the way and we obviously go inside. Keep in mind that up to this point, no one had exited or entered the toilet, and it's also quite a walk from the screen room we were in, and no one entered or exited then, either. 

We go inside, there's a guy standing there in this opening at the other end of the bathroom (that lead onto another part of the bathroom that had all the stalls (I think?), but there was no one there). I did recognize this guy as one of the staff in this place. 

Overall I found it kind of weird that he was just standing there the whole time.

I'm eventually done and on my way to wash my hands. Kid's not done but regardless, the moment I made off for the sink and stood there, where it was obvious I was with the boy and was waiting for him, the guy that was in there quickly made off and exited, and that was the last I saw of him.

Once again, there was no one else in the bathroom, and the time we were in there, no one else entered. There were no trash cans so there was no places for anything 'suspicious' to be hidden or whatever. In theory, whoever this guy was had no real reason to be in there. He wasn't using the toilet himself, just stood there with his arms crossed. Seeing as he was stood behind us as well, I have no real way of knowing if his eyes were all over myself or the kid I was with. I found it kind of odd how he hurried out of there, though.

The main things I've been able to depict from the situation:

1. Whoever this guy was, he'd been stood in there for a while. 
2. Given the fact that all screens were playing movies, it was unlikely that many people would be stopping by the bathrooms frequently.
3. The hallway leading to the bathrooms, and the bathrooms themselves, seemed to be empty. At least the men's room was.

Maybe I'm just being overly paranoid, yes, but the whole situation just rang alarm bells in my head. Since it occurred I've been convinced that what happened wasn't normal, and I also get the impression that the staff handbook didn't say 'every now and then, stand in the bathroom menacingly for as long as you see fit'. 

I understand routine checks, but literally standing there and not saying a word and just chilling out in an empty bathroom like that? It freaked me out.

It just makes me worry that if the kid I was with had gone to the bathroom on his own, could it have gone down a different way? I obviously did tell my friend about this when we rendezvoused with her, and she found it rather strange as well. She even double checked if I was sure it was a staff member and not some random guy, so, it clearly alarmed her a little as well.

I just came here to ask for some advice as I'm really not sure what to think. Please, don't slate me if I'm completely mistaken and this is normal behavior for a movie theater worker (I mean, as far as I'm aware it isn't, but y'know) - I don't mean for this to be in any way offensive to anyone (by that I mean anyone who works in a movie theater, works a job as security, whatever). I guess my main problem is I'm very protective. Any opinions on this would be appreciated.

stopped school for lack of money.He also candidly brings up how I have the least amount of stuff in my life compared to other family and that just makes me think he is being greedy with his success, like he does not comply to much to government things  which makes him take jobs that require multiple people while keeping on making mistakes how a class i had in business stated that in a family centered business that no family aspect should get involved. Theres other things like how if i'm having a bad time he takes it personal and berates me.

He shot me down for no reason, harshly and no longer offered that example and makes the point of quiting college cause i had aid removed, which is stupid of me.

237,"It'll be exciting.Thanks for listening my life's short story.

I am 23 years old male from Bursa/Turkey.I had undiagnosted ADHD.I was struggling to finish high school but i did it.But in university life,it have been disease for me.I changed three faculty; Art History,History,Computer Engineering.Never finished once.Simply i hadn't enough focus for that education process.I was using all my focus to another 'exciting' things like ; learning A.I,Statistics,TensorFlow,C++,Python,Java,Android Programming,Quantum Physics,Philosophy and Literature.

In Turkey,you got to enter 'OSYS' (university entrance exam).There are three types high school in Turkey; Numerical(Physics and Math),Balanced(Math and Literature),Social(Literature and History) if you would choose numerical class; simply you get four years full physics and math courses.No-literature.vice versa; if you would choose social type class; you would never see what physics is.

I went social type high school.I've won two times balanced-type university.(self-taughed Calculus 1 and 2.) After that,i entered exam again and won Computer Engineering (Gotta learn Physics from zero.Self-taughed and i am good at Mechanics/Dynamics now.)
It's nearly impossible that winning engineering faculty from social high school.Non of my classmates did it.

I owe that ""self-teaching"" skill to my ADHD.I mean Hyperfocus,it was another name for that miracle.But as the physics says; you must give equal thing for get one.It has negative effect; struggling to keep focus for university education.It needs daily focus that i have never got.So i changed so many universities never finished one.


I always self-taughed.I finished Python and Java withing two weeks after that i went full tensorflow and algorithms.Got bored and changed it with Quantum information,bored and changed it with statistics(standard and gaussian distributions) bored and changed with philosophy.

My brain has tons of unnecessary informations as you can't imagine.My social skills are weak because i get bored among people's social talks.But i went NLP course(six weeks) in my town just for curiousity.

Now it getting horrible...i am the only child of my family.My father was high school teacher and my mother is house-wife.My father passed away three years ago.I have must be man of home.I worked as laborer in buildings,my foot was broken but i didn't stop.worked in mcdonalds for short time.Sad thing is my mother is alive she is 63 years old.She needs me.I cry every night in the corner of my home.I am using Atomoxetine 100 mg,it works as keeping focus but it doesn't work for curing my broken insticts and paradigm.Everytime when i work,i feel ""i am hella in wrong place with wrong people"".

But i feel huge emptiness inside.I see only black no colors.Everyone except me,seems monsters of me.They always chasing me for kill.

I wrote so many applications and things...like recursive chatter-bot via tensorflow.Android regression application, newton's method for getting optimal equaliser settings etc.

didn't upload github.
I know it is useless.Because i can't show myself in real life.this world is like open-ceil for me.

What should i do for escape my coming end-game (suicide)?

Just tell me one thing,i will do it even i would die.Just say; ""Would you give me an autocad scratch that include self-improved jet-engine"" i will do it in few weeks.

I am terrified of backlash that usually originates from stupid stuff, now more than ever where people have become so reactioanary to everything, specially politics.

Several months ago, there was a political trial for corruption in my country and it was a Trending Topic. I posted a tweet saying that I was glad the guy was put on trial but that I also would like to see that other politicans of the opposing party that have also been accused of corruption got the same treatment.

I was not disrespectful, never defended the guy that was put on trial and it was just an opinion. About 5 minutes later, at least 8 guys started to attack me on Twitter saying that I was supporting him, that I was an idiot and using tons of insults.

I ended up changing my profile to private and after a couple of hours, thankfully people just moved on to something else.

It wasn´t just this, other times before this happened I just tweeted that I didn´t like this or that movie or that I didn´t think this cartoon or this book was that good and again people ended up storming me with insults. Again, I was never disrespectful, I never attacked anyone, I never insulted any of those guys but people just went crazy.

I know I´m not the only one who has dealt with this. I have friends who are artists or writers that had gotten a lot more criticism and I follow people on Twitter that had entire hashtags dedicated to them but they still tweet and use social media as usual.

Is this just how things work nowadays?

Throwaway for obvious reasons. So I'm in my last semester, and there is a final project for a non-core course. was in charge of putting everyone's parts together and formatting it, and I took a quick look at a previous terms project to ensure we had all the right parts. After that, I submitted it to the drop box folder, only after submitting did I realize I submitted the previous terms project as they were called the same name. I quickly submitted the actual project after realizing my mistake, making a note that I submitted the wrong file and that the previous submission should be ignored. I also emailed the correct file directly to the professor. 


Now my actual project and last terms project share zero similarities except for the title page. Everything else ( the idea, the way that everything is organized, etc.) is completely different from the old project, but I read that it's an academic offence to simply posses the old assignment. I'm debating going to the professor before she contacts me, but there's also a chance she doesn't notice since she wouldn't usually check previous submissions. I did not want to use the previous work at all., and this is just a ridiculously stupid mistake. What do you think I should do? ",24Jul2017,13

253,"I'm a 34y/o female. I have an 8y/o daughter. We live in my mother's basement suite (yes, I pay rent).
Recently went on a vacation with mom and stepdad. They were in one room and we were in a connected room, with a shared bathroom inbetween.
After putting my daughter to bed, I wanted to go out and stretch my legs and just generally not disturb anyone else who wanted to sleep/was sleeping. No problem, they say, they'll keep an ear out for my daughter.
I take a little walk up and down the hallway and then settle in a comfy chair overlooking the windows several doors down. I'm out about an hour and a half sitting there, playing on my iPad, then I go back, go to sleep. 
Wake up the next morning to my mother absolutely livid with me because (text message to follow):
""Both of us were awake off and on wondering where you went. I did see a fellow following you around though when you were doing hand stands &lt;in the pool, teaching my daughter&gt; and he was sitting in the sauna as well and then you got up to where &lt;daughter&gt; was swimming a few minutes later he did too? Interesting!! And I saw you texting someone while eating your apple and then you left the room?? And quite honestly I don't care what you do but you need to keep me in the loop where you go so I don't have to worry and get no sleep!!!""
First, she knew I was out for a walk.
Second, she knew I had my cell phone, could message me at any point if she was concerned. 
Third, am I completely off, or is this mostly because she thought I was out hooking up with some random guy?
What do I say? I don't want to encourage the notion that she can comment on my sex life (or lack thereof, as it happens in this case), but I live with her and she's my mother so I don't want to burn any bridges.

254,"My girlfriends dad a drywall company and have about 30+ employees and just asked me if there's a way he can track where his employees are..

So he asked if there's a way he can buy them phone and be able to track them that way?

256,"I moved out earlier this month, it was a less than desirable apartment situation so I knew they might try to do something like this. I spent my last day there cleaning every surface, I vacuumed, then I took pictures on my phone. When I went to hand in my key I asked if there was anything else that I needed to do and they said no, the maintenance people would look at the apartment and I would receive my security deposit back in the mail within a few weeks. I had done a walk-through before moving in looking at preexisting conditions in the apartment, and I still have that paper. They didn't offer that kind of walk-through when I left, and I was stupid enough to not insist on it before handing over my keys. In my defense I had literally just fallen down a flight of stairs with my vacuum on my last trip to the car. It hurt a lot. I was distracted and stupid. 
I got my security deposit check, they charged me $60 for carpet cleaning, $44 for apartment cleaning, $50 for painting, and $40 for apartment maintenance. My lease listed the terms for my security deposit being used for these charges as if extra cleaning was needed beyond their normal maintenance between renters. I left it in good order, with only a single spot on the carpet that was caused by water damage from the drain on the porch that I had put a work order in for. I called the apartment complex today to dispute the charges, explaining my situation, and the manager repeatedly told me that those were the charges that his maintenance crew had reported to him as appropriate and since I hadn't done a walk-through before handing in my key then he couldn't do anything for me. My pictures are time stamped in the file on my phone, but it doesn't show on the picture itself. He told me that they can't be taken into account since he wouldn't be able to know whether they were from when I moved in a year ago or when I moved out this month. The manager wouldn't let me speak to the maintenance supervisor to clarify whether or not he knew the mildew spot was not my fault, so I couldn't get a full list of everything they felt I needed to be charged for.

This past week though my cash drawer came up short twice with about $30 missing in total. After the first mess up though (which was most likely my fault) I made sure to count absolutely every dollar and cent and double check change as much as possible. Nonetheless, about ten came up missing yesterday. 

I am almost certain that I did not make a mistake the second time, but am not ruling that out. Three people in total used my drawer yesterday including me, the supervisor, and another cashier. If another amount comes up missing that will be three strikes and the consequences will go past warnings.

This is my first job and I absolutely do not want to be fired. These are also my first cash mistakes that have come up in my two months there.

265,"Hello everyone!

So this post is going to be related to work, obviously. I just recently had to be out of work for medical purposes and with a doctor's note. This was scheduled in advance and I've been keeping my boss in the loop for all of it. 
Had an allergic reaction that may slow down my healing? I told him. He seemed very understanding and wanted me to get better. Through all of it.

Great! But now I'm having only one of my co-workers text me. 

""When are you coming back? ___ wants me to ask because he needs to make the schedule for next month""

""I won't know until I meet with the doctor again for follow up.""

Okay.. my boss already knows this, he knows all of it, really. I'm thinking my coworkers are nosey since they asked an old employee to take my hours until I would be back, so possibly they're trying to let them know if/when to look for another job..? I don't know. But it seems off. I don't doubt my boss would call me if he had any questions or concerns.

I got another text from the same co-worker today asking the same thing. Then to make it even more of a point that ""They need to know and they told me to ask. They're lazy.""

Do I bring this to my boss's attention or would that be unnecessary? The last few texts I received were almost jerk-like and he even said our boss was lazy. And in my opinion, he isn't, and he's been very supportive.

Any suggestions?",24Jul2017,3
266," I don’t have a problem whatsoever if someone wishes to be referred to by a different gender pronoun (he/she/they etc.). I’m not always great at remembering but I do my best to accommodate. Something happened at work today, however, that makes me feel somewhat uncomfortable. I am a state employee, and my employer informed us today that as we introduce ourselves to new staff members we are to state our preferred gender pronouns (he, he’s, him etc.) , and go out of our way to ask what someone would like to be referred to by. If someone wishes to be referred to by something other than their birth gender, is it not on them to inform us? Is it normal for a state employer to have employees include their preferred gender pronouns in introductions to new staff? Is this political correctness the new norm in the workplace?

267,"Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, redirect a better place for this mess of a rant.


I don’t even know how to phrase this. To start, I just turned 18 years old in May, and am going to be attending one of the most prestigious universities for STEM in the US this fall. I have a job, and I finished high school with a 4.6 (weighted) GPA and lots of honors. I probably sound like I have the perfect life to most. However, I don’t even know what’s going on with me this summer. I have just had a negative trend in my life.


Every day, I feel as if I just sit on my ass all day at my PC, and play games for hours. I might go and hang out with someone occasionally, – maybe once a week, but that’s rare. I don’t even want to half the time. I also cannot get anything done. I have some side work that I do for extra money, and I cannot ever concentrate on it. I have tried all my previous strategies at doing hours and hours of homework, and I cannot simply work. I even went to the local café just to spend three hours on my phone, which is completely ridiculous. Just today, I’ve done absolutely nothing when I had about three different things to do.



Speaking of games, I am not very good. I regularly purchase boosting services just to stay within the average rank and not the ability to group with friends. I know this might sound petty, but it’s the truth. I can’t even do anything in a videogame. I have zero self-esteem, and cannot handle losing at all.


Everything has just been so irritating to me. People’s voices, even inanimate objects. I can’t stand it. It’s the worst possible feeling.


I probably sound like a spoiled brat, but what should I do? How do I get myself back into a contributing member of society and “my old self” in the next month? I'm not suicidal or anything of the like, and just need a nudge in the right direction.

269,"So, I'm a 25 year old male living in the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia. I have aspergers, anxiety, depression, and DPD. I'm stupid because I either take too many meds for my mental problems or because I never got an education. Both, I think. I was pulled out of school at age 9 and my mom failed to homeschool me. I have a GED and a decent job at a grocery store. I was a part-time courtesy clerk for Kroger for 2 years, then I was recently moved to produce clerk because my mom and therapist said it was a good idea, and I generally follow what people say without question, especially my mom. 


I hate working in produce. I don't want to quit after only 3 weeks, but I hate it more and more every time I go. I loved being a courtesy clerk, but no one should do that forever, so I thought I should move on. Now that I have, I only want to go back, but then I'd be as square one again making less per-hour working far fewer hours. I can't do this for the rest of my life. My parents can't take care of me forever. But I have DPD. Being away from my parents at all drives me insane. Any sense of responsibility is a nightmare. I depend on other people to tell me what I should do, literally, for everything. At work, at home, whatever. So here I am, asking strangers where to go with my life.


I don't have any aspirations. I never have. I don't want to be a great X one day, and even if I did I'm so stupid and incompetent that I can't achieve it. I don't need people to tell me ""you can do anything you want"", I just want a job that utilizes my greatest strength, the best thing about my job: interacting with customers. Nothing at my job has ever made me as happy as telling someone where something is or answering them or helping them. I adore helping people like this and I want to make a living off of it somehow, but I don't know how.


What are some good jobs that involve helping people one-on-one? I don't mind rude people at all, for some reason. I serve everyone with a smile and rarely even recognize rudeness in people. Helping people is incredible for me and I just want to do that. Not pushing carts around a parking lot, no sorting the good fruit from the bad...just helping people. I'd rather do something where I can interact with them in-person, rather than like a tech support over the phone or something of that manner. I'll be happy to answer more questions if anyone has them, but I wanted to keep the first post...somewhat short. Thank you. :)",24Jul2017,2
270,"She's in her mid-20s and currently lives with her mom and her mom's boyfriend. Her mom has been threatening to kick her out for a while now, and have set late August as the absolute final deadline before she has to leave. Trouble is, she doesn't have many places to go.

Right now her only source of income are disability checks. She has a host of problems with her mental and physical health, including severe anxiety, panic disorder, fibromyalgia, and kidney disorders. She needs a lot of medication to manage this, and her insurance isn't very good. She hasn't worked in almost two years, and her only source of income are her disability checks. After she had a nervous breakdown when she was bullied by her coworkers at a restaurant she worked at, she has been terrified of the prospect of returning to work anywhere. I've tried multiple times to convince her to look for a new job, but she is adamant that it would be too overwhelming, and during at least one of these arguments she has broke down crying because of the memories.

We've been dating for a little over a year now. She's a sweet girl, and I've had a lot of fun with her. I never intended for it to be a super long-term relationship, and she understood that. And in the past few months, I didn't really want to be in the relationship anymore. I didn't find myself attracted to her anymore, I stopped looking forward to seeing her on weekends, and her constant helplessness was starting to grate. 

So my plan was to break up with her when she moved out of her parent's place. Originally she was going to move in with a friend as a roommate. But her friend bailed just last week, leaving her with no plans. Now she is looking for other apartments to live in by herself. She hasn't even suggested moving in with me, bless her heart. But right now, her odds are terrible.

She only gets about $750 a month in disability checks. She's on a list for government housing, but she hasn't heard from them in months. Every other place she has been to requires her income be at least 3x the rent. On top of that, if she moves too far from where she lives now, she will have to find all new doctors, which will be a nightmare with all of her medical problems.

This girl has done me no wrong, and I want to help her. But if she moves in with me... she has few friends, few skills, she is terrified of the prospect of finding a job... I'd be stuck with her for a long time. And as much as I like her, I don't want that.

**TL;DR:** Girl I'm dating is barely capable of taking care of herself, is about to be kicked out of her home and has nowhere to go. I don't want to be in the relationship anymore, but I'm afraid if she moves in she will never leave. I don't know how I can help her without becoming her permanent caretaker.",24Jul2017,1
