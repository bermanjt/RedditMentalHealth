0,"Looking for advice on what one should do if they wish to pursue a completely different career than their major entitles them to.

I'm a Computer Science major, never liked it, but stuck with it because it is a safe career path.  I've had 2 summers of well-paid internships, and hated every minute of it.  I always wanted to do acting, or to be a musician (though that is more of a hobby of mine), but I always thought that risking financial ruin by studying art or music at college was an idiotic move.  Well, after several epiphanies, my attitude has taken a 180, and I realize that I'd rather be poor and do what I love rather than be wealthy and do something I hate.

At this point however, it would be difficult to go into the direction of being an actor.  You don't exactly get much acting experience from sitting at a desk typing Java code.  I know that I have to take some type of action, so I'm wondering what steps I should take to make this dream a reality?

Should I tough it out and finish my degree, even if it takes 1 or more years to finish?  Should I tough it out even further and work in the Computer industry afterwards to build up enough money to move to L.A.?  Those options are what people mostly recommend to me, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of a better way.

1,"Ok, i'm not sure if i'm actually asking for advice or just using this platform as a means to vent? Any and all advice is welcomed, though.

I'm a 34 y/o male living in a small town in NSW, Australia.

It's coming up to 12 months since i went through a messy break-up with my partner of 4 years. We have 1, 3 y/o Son together, and his Mother has court ordered custody of him.

I've never been a hateful sort of person, but the last few months all of my thoughts are taken up by, just, pure hatred for my ex. Its the first thing i think of when i wake up and the last thing i think of as i fall asleep. Sometimes i wish she would die just so i can have my boy back. My hatred for her has totally consumed me. I blame her for taking fatherhood away from me.

I fucked up a lot when i was younger, using drugs and never being able to hold a steady job for longer than a year or so, but for as long as i can remember all i ever wanted was to have a family and settle down. Since my Son was born i have been trying to better myself, not only for me, but for my family. I want to be a good roll model and provider.

I feel like i'm not even a father any more. It's like, i'm just a friend that he comes and visits once or twice a week.

While she's not exactly a bad parent (i use that term loosely), the fact that she spends most of her money on drugs and alcohol means my boy misses out on a lot.

We were both drug users when we first met and continued to use throughout most of our relationship despite my trying to get us both on the straight and narrow. I personally have not used any sort of drugs for 11 months, but i'm 99% certain that she is still using. Our relationship came to an end because she did not want to stop using drugs and drinking daily. She disappeared for 6 hours, spent $800 and would not explain where she and the money had gone to, which for me was the last straw. I wanted the child support payments to go into my bank account so i could take control over the situation and hopefully put an end to things like this constantly happening. Long story short, while we were in the social services office shit got outta control, she punched one of the workers who thought that it was me that hit him, so i was tackled to the ground and held until the police came.

The police interviewed her and she told them that i was the one with the drug problem, embellished and straight up lied, making herself out to be a saint and me to be some sort psychopathic control freak. Just for the record, I want to clarify that i have never physically assaulted her, though that day i was extremely pissed off and was berating her.

At court my solicitor basically gave no me choice but to sign over full custody to my ex and say that she's a good parent so our Son would not be taken by DOCS. (Aussie version of CPS)  She has already had 3 kids taken away from her in the past and placed into foster care, so apparently there was a really good chance that this was going to happen again if i stood up in court and told them what she is really like.

It eats at me every day that this is how things turned out and there is seemingly nothing i can do about it. 
I can't even be civil towards her when i pick up my Son. I hate her so much that her and her addiction has caused all of this.

3,"So I started talking to this girl from school that I really like, we both have a lot in common and she think so too. She just broke up with her boyfriend of 3 years before we started talking. We haven’t gone out yet but yesterday she texted me that she ran into her ex and they ended up sleeping together. I know we haven’t really even started dating but I feel betrayed, she let me know and said she wasn’t proud and that she was still into me and that they weren’t getting back together.

4,"We had made this plan like a week in advance. 

The plan was “do my two homework assignments and I’ll pay 20 each”

However, she didn’t supply me with the login info until 7 days later. 

I had to work that day[saturday afternoon] and when I got home I passed out.  

Woke up and went to work Sunday and then I attempted to do the homework. I got half of it done, and then I found out it was due at midnight.  

So she only got credit for half of one assignment.  

I did all of assignment 2, but she isn’t paying me for it nor is she answering at all. I honesty think I should get the full 40 because it’s her fault for telling me last minute the due date. But she says I shouldn’t be paid for that, even though I still did half so I should at least be getting 10 for assignment one and 20 for assignment 2.  

She’s ignoring me, so I’m considering just emailing her teacher and saying she paid me to do her homework and get her an F for the whole thing. 

Too harsh? It’s only 20 dollars but it still bugs me that she won’t even reply.  ",13Nov2017,2

Him and I have been a thing for 4 months, dated for 3 of those, and have sadly broken up recently.

13,"Warning, this is very long and it does mention sensitive subjects, so if you'd rather avoid it I'd say stay safe.


I use the term ""friend"" loosely, though I have known her for 6 years, albeit not very closely. We got drunk at some event and she opened up about everything- her self harm(she showed her thighs and arms later- I couldn't even believe it was real), opioid drug abuse, bulimia, abusive ex and suicide attempts. I related to some aspects on lesser levels, so we were just sharing our darkest secrets back and forth. 


Somewhere along the night we blacked out , went to my place and took some lsd. She took quite a lot, 3 tabs total I think, I only took like a fourth of a tab. So we have great fun, but suddenly she gets confused and starts repeating names and pacing around the room, I try to calm her down, but she's getting increasingly agitated. She takes off all her bottoms,  scars on her thighs all red and neatly parallel showing and starts throwing things around- bottles and mirror shatter on the ground. I try sweeping up so she doesn't cut herself but then she escapes outside in the corridor, flips over my bike and I attempt hugging her to calm her but she punches me in the face, pushes me and heads into other rooms . Which is horrible because I live in a shared flat and those rooms belong to my flat mates. At this point I am horrified, crying and I don't even know what to do so I have a period of time that's completely wiped out of my memory. I know I have to protect her and my flat mates from herself. Then I remember talking to my flat mates and one somehow helps getting her in my room, she's still throwing things and talking gibberish, not a spark of consciousness in her eyes, as she looks at my frightened face she repeats ""yes, I know what you're thinking.."", pure evil in her voice. I had flashbacks of all those exorcism movies.

As if it couldn't get any worse, I notice there's blood everywhere. Thankfully she had simply started her period an since she's completely naked waist down that's what happens. So she finally falls asleep at 6 am and remembers nothing the next day... I haven't told her what she had done,  Though she must have noticed my nice shiner, because that would have been too traumatic for anyone to hear.  That you turned into a demon ridden monster who wants to harm not only itself but others and the world around you. Those are the specifics of self harming behavior, I think. That you're only harming yourself is a myth. But if you can cut yourself, you are still able to harm others. I fear if she finds out what she's done she might go through with... something. And I well right am a fuckhead who's hugely responsible for this. LSD for depression treatment, sure. But in a fucking controlled environment. And not mixed with alcohol. 

 She is on meds and goes to a psychiatrist but apart from him I'm the only person she's told about the self harm and drugs and suicides. So I can't help but feel responsible for her. Which is stupid because this prevents people from voicing their struggles. No one receiving such information is prepared to react appropriately. I still am traumatized and can't return to that room, and I can't even begin to imagine what she feels like.

When playing a game I would talk about some qualities of something and don't get me wrong he listens, but most of the time he can ignore you. Other things too.

36,"I am a 26 y.o. recovering addict diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and Borderline Personality Disorder. I have been clean from heroin since August of 2016 and off of suboxone since July of this year. I voluntarily admitted myself to a detox and mental health facility in July because I was suicidal with a plan as well as addicted to suboxone which was unprescribed. This is where I received my PTSD and BPD diagnoses. I had health insurance during this time and for a month after I was medicated and attended therapy. I was unable to continue this treatment for a time span long enough to determine genuine effectiveness although the combination of Zoloft, Latuda, and Tegretol left me with extreme restlessness, nerve pain, and poor focus. I am no longer being treated due to no income or insurance which seems to cause extreme difficulty in being able to plan and take action in my life. 

I am a single mother with a great family support system and my child's father is still very active in his life. My son and I moved into my parents house September of this year. My son lives with me but sees his father daily and every other weekend. 

I am an unemployed RN that was unable to maintain my job for several reasons. The discomfort and severity of the side effects of my medication were only partially apart of why I was unable to maintain my work ethic/job after being released from my psych stay. After leaving my job, I also was unable to afford to renew my nursing license in October of this year. I have absolutely no income at this time and my parents are completely supporting me but they are not well off. They get by. So I am unable to work as a nurse until I renew my license. 

I have accumulated immense debt between medical bills (my inpatient stay, ER visits, therapy visits while uninsured, etc.), unpaid utility bills, car accident without insurance (court fees, DMV fees, the other car), and various other misc. that were neglected the past 2 years. 

I lost my driving license because of a car accident I was at fault for with no insurance in the spring of this year. The suspension lasted until September of this year but is an estimated $500 to reinstate. However, I have no vehicle (or money). I took over the contract of my car from my child's father after our separation after cohabitating and raising a child for 7 years. During this time I did not build any credit. Everything including our mortgage was in his name only. For this reason, I had a family member kind enough to help me and cosigned for my car. Through my addiction, struggles with my mental illness untreated, and irresponsibility I fell behind on my car payments and my car was repossessed. 

That is a general idea of my situation and the circumstances leading up to it. I am painfully aware of my accountability in WHY I have found myself in this place in my life. What I am desperately searching for is someone who is an outsider looking in (who is not debilitated by guilt, shame, the weight of depression, etc. that I find clouds my critical thinking) that can give me some advice on how to move on from here. I need to move forward with my life for myself and for my son so we can heal.

50,"I recently took a job and had to relocate to a larger city because there were no similar opportunities where I was living at the time. The thing is, I'm not a fan of urban living/city environments, but felt obligated to accept the job anyway, as I was approaching 4 months of unemployment after being laid off.

So I'm two weeks in and starting to regret this move due to the location. Rents are absurd, everyone seems clique-y/have friend groups established, dating seems impossible, and I just don't feel like I fit in, or that this is the right lifestyle for me. Yes, I know the whole ""you just got there, give it time"" speech, but just hear me out.

I've never been the ""career-oriented"" person; I've always wished to start a family young, and just be a stay-at-home mom. But of course as life would have it, we don't get what we want, and I don't have any boyfriend-material prospects in my near future. So, I decided to focus more effort on having the glamorous career.

I like the job overall (it's in public relations), but I'm starting to lack the passion to learn the work. This is odd for me, because I typically pride myself on having a strong work ethic. I'm wondering whether this is because I'm reaching a point in my life where having a prestigious career isn't as glamorous afterall. I mean, I have co-workers who are going to school for their Master's degree to improve their skill set; I could never see myself being that dedicated to a job, and if I go back to school to earn a higher degree, it'll be for a job that's a bit more secure and promising.

Overall, this new life change has just been hard because I feel like moving to a larger city only extends the length of time I remain single - too many options for men to choose from/too much competition. And to make it worse, I'm starting to see people from my home town getting engaged and now I'm doing the whole, ""if only I would have stayed put, worked a mediocre job, then I could also be in that position - Rather than moving to a large city where I'm merely prolonging my loneliness."" I mean, I'm 24 (to some, that's young but to me it's old), and all I want is to settle down, not chase after a career anymore.

I'm not sure whether I should stay put... I want to get a move on with my personal life for a change - tired of being lonely. I'm starting to really think about moving back home, switching career paths entirely, and maybe going back to school for something more fulfilling and ESPECIALLY something where location won't dictate whether I can get a job or not (I'm thinking teaching or health. That way, I can move wherever and have more opportunities, rather than being restricted to large cities.

It'll disappoint my parents if I quit this job, and go back to school for something else, but I don't see myself achieving what I really want out of life in this city... it just doesn't feel right and I can't tell whether I should trust my gut and move, or stick it out. Apologies if this post is a little all over the place - I'm a bit distressed as I'm debating whether or not to sign a lease here, or leave altogether.",13Nov2017,1
51,"Over the past year, I’ve become close friends with a coworker of mine. She is affectionate, friendly, and fun to be around! Things have been mostly good, but I haven’t been able to avoid her bad traits. At work, my friend has pretty much proven to be a liar, gossip, and manipulator. She has our boss’s ear, and often convinces him to do things that are good for her, but not good for me. When I tell her about my worries, she acts genuinely concerned, but it doesn’t seem to stop her from acting selfishly and hurting me professionally.

She is always looking for my attention, repeatedly tells me that I am her best/only friend, and has recently invited me to be her guest for Thanksgiving dinner later this month, which I would love to do.

I wish that I didn’t feel so unsure of our friendship, and I wonder if what we have could really be called that. Could it be that our relationship would be far healthier if we didn’t work together?

58,"Hey, I hope this won't disturb anyone and attract hostility. I am ashamed of what I am about to write and I don't act on those feelings in any other ways than secluding myself from society. I don't intend to shoot anyone, I would even say that I am less likely to harm anyone than an average person.

It's like I don't understand what's right and wrong anymore. I don't know what should I believe, what should I do and what should I think in many situations anymore. This is the advice I am asking you for... To help me understand, tell me what to think and believe in.

As in the title, I got interested in the story of Elliot Rodger. If someone doesn't know anything about him, you can easily find his story online. I've read about his feelings and thoughts about the world... and disturbingly, I found too many similarities between his thoughts and mine.

My life isn't going well now. I'm 21 and a hikikomori. In my past I've experienced friendship, love, happiness, as well as betrayal, being bullied physically and psychically, resentment, being struck hard by harsh reality. I won't describe all of them if it won't be necessary, to save your time.

I didn't share his entitlement from the very childhood, I wasn't throwing a tantrum if I wasn't the most cool and wealthy child in my environment. I was quite opposite of that. It started growing in me slowly from when I was around 14 years old, when I've noticed boys at my school being better at some sports or just being proficient at some hobby. I've started to grow some kind of hatred towards people that I could describe as shallow and growing in hostile, poor and abusive environment, those kind of kids to first start bringing cigarettes to school, trying to be disgustingly ""adult"", bullying other kids. But it was strongly tied to my past, during one year of transferring to a class with my friend, who left me and betrayed me by siding with one of those bullying types, and belittling me to build up his position with him. I've been ridiculed in front of a whole class, choked in front of all the girls in class, most of them laughing and none reacting at all.

I wasn't even aware yet about height differences, overall attractiveness, education, social status, wealth... It all struck me not long ago.

But at 14 years old it still wasn't much of a problem, it was ""fine"" enough. I had sociophobic and secluding tendencies, but somehow i had friends at school and outside of school with who I've been playing lots online. I had a girlfriend. This is the first part of what I may ask you about - I broke up with her, and I don't know if it was right. I grew up constantly experiencing arguments between my parents, sometimes physical. I said to myself that I will never argue with my wife. Of course now I know it may be impossible, but still I wished I could avoid any major arguing. This girl was my first ""serious"" girlfriend, there was this kind of ""link"" between us, but we were often arguing, and after seeing that my parents don't share any interests together and their beliefs rarely align, I've noticed that we don't share much about those with my girlfriend as well. I didn't want to push it further because I was afraid our relationship would look like my parents'. Was that a right thing to do?

Few years forward, in high school I started feeling alone, I felt like there was no one anymore who I could feel comfortable around, no one sharing my interests, no one fitting my personality. I've had no friends anymore, my good friends started being more ""outgoing"", most of the people were trying to be as adult and edgy as possible, going to clubs, smoking every break. Girls seemed repulsively shallow, none with which I could feel some kind of a deeper connection. I never could get into those, and for that I was often called autistic. High school was like a one big beauty contest, one after another. I wish I could write everything about what happened there, but It would take too long. It was a mix of every trauma I've experienced in the past. Long story short, I believe i have developed there inferiority complex. There words that I've only knew existence of, like independence, future and money, now gained a serious and frightening meaning.

I never knew what I want to do and I've spent most of my life playing games or hanging out with friends without giving a second thought about the future.
 
So after high school when I had no choice but to think about it, I felt completely ruined. All those world famous musicians whose music I've been listening to for many years now, all those actors, celebrities and doctors turned out to be ""real"". Real people living the same life as me, but after years long experience and passion into their craft since young age. And I felt like no one with nothing. Nothing was interesting to me. I live in Poland, here there's no major switching so I couldn't just bet on that when going to a university. I just didn't go anywhere.

I locked myself in my room, being unable to listen to all those songs I've always loved, because of my feeling of inferiority. Every movie I am watching now, I only see successful actors using their predispositions and skills to make a living for their families and leading a fulfilling life. I grew up quite hateful, entitled.

I've had contact online with many girls. After trying to seek someone to talk to after my suicidal episode, giving a chance for the last time of finding a ""soul mate"", someone I could share interests with, I've found one girl online, unfortunately we were quite far from each other, but still we became a ""couple"". Hundreds of thousands messages and nearly 2 years forward, she left me for somebody else, living close to her. Her soul mate, they ""listened to the same music, loved the same shows, had a birthday one day apart and even had moles in the same spots"".
My dream came true for her.

All that time I was supposed to go and find a job. But thinking of going back to society resulted in a sever anxiety, chest pain, loss of breath. With my education I could only barely find a job at some factory or storage, where people like my bullies work. And I would rather starve to death than be bullied or feeling presence of similar people again.

I've tried to reach to reach to one of my friends from the past. I've told him I have social anxiety, but I wish I could talk to him again. But he changed completely. He's been constantly talking about alcohol, problems with his girlfriend, obsessed with his car... pretty much like most of guys this age i suppose. I felt even lonelier after that.

I wrote to few girls around me who I saw have similar interests to me on facebook... but they all were so ""hostile"". Spiteful. It's hard to describe. I thought that similar interests connect people. I don't understand anything anymore.

Now I feel completely disconnected from society, unable to make money, unable to form any relationship, feeling entitled, envious, inferior, alone. I feel like everyone in the world is against me. I feel like world is too hostile for me.

Tell me, where am I wrong? Why was Elliot wrong? Was he wrong if all he saw around him was exactly that? If he just didn't know any different? I am not justifying his actions, but his feelings. How should I think about it all, if it's wrong? What kind of attitude should I have towards it all?",13Nov2017,1

*Boss likes to jump around on projects. (Maybe I can work on steering us the right direction.)

*There's literally not enough work to do. (Probably because I'm not helping create any.)

63,"Hi reddit
 
I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I need some advice and don't know where else to turn. My life is beginning to spiral out of control and I don't know how to stop it. 

I'll attempt to keep this as concise as possible. I'm a guy in my mid-twenties, for context.

Basically I find myself currently unemployed (as of last week), and unsure how I'm going to afford rent next week (I can ask my dad for help, and will as a last resort.) I am over-run with anxiety and the feeling of being completely lost. 

From the ages of 6 - 9 I was sexually abused by a cousin that babysat for my parent's on a regular basis. I've only ever told a very small group of people about this experience because for most of my life, I pretened it didn't happen. Shortly after my 9th birthday I moved to the otherside of the world and pretended it was all a dream. 

For the most part, I've tried to not let it effect me. However, in recent times I find myself dwelling on it and I don't know why. 

At the same time, I'm suffering from an identity crisis. I don't know who I am, or who I want to be. I feel as if I have no direction in my life whatsoever. I've lost interest in things I used to get such joy from, and I have no explanation as to why. 

I also find myself extremely optimistic for short periods of time, and then down soon afterwards. From one extreme to another and not much inbetween.

64,"I take care of a friend who is disabled and lives in an apartment that has security at the front desk. I dread going to the apartment on Sundays to see her because the black security lady -- let's call her Jocelyn -- who works the front desk is SUCH a bitch. *Note*: She comes and works the afternoon/evening shift. My friend thinks she's a bitch too and so does another friend of ours who hates her ( Jocelyn ). 

One time I came by to see my friend and Jocelyn asked me if I had keys. I responded without an attitude, ""no"" and she said in her big loud voice that she wasn't allowed to open the door to 'you people'. Then another time I was coming back from an errand again she said hi as i was walking by so i said 'hi' and rolled my eyes at her without looking and headed for the elevator. She yelled and asked if i was going to sign in again ( i had my keys this time) and when i got on the elevator she yelled something but I didn't hear it. I think she might have called me a ""bitch"" but I don't know. I wasn't listening. 

I haven't ever done anything to her since I met her. She is such a negative person who shouldn't working as a front desk security guard. When I see her working at the front desk I try to avoid her as much as possible but she is always starts shit with me. My friend &amp; I want to rep

ort her to apartment management. The OTHER friend who hates Jocelyn has also been treated the same ways as I have. I don't know if she does this to anyone else who comes to the apartment but she shouldn't be a security guard if that's going to be her attitude and that's how she's going to treat other people who don't live in the building.

So my question is: Should I report her? Jocelyn is not the only front desk security. She is the only one we have a problem with her attitude. ",13Nov2017,1
65,"I looked up what that's called and apparently it's called ""vehophobia - a fear of driving.""


When I was a kid I was in the front seat of my moms car while we were on our way to a football game when our car was T-boned by a truck on my side. I looked out the window just before it happened and all I can remember from that is my mom screaming, the horns blaring and then I woke up in the hospital. Fucked me up. Fucked me up real bad. 


I'm fine when I'm in the car with other people driving, I just can't drive myself. Although I used to have a friend that really didn't want to hit animals on the road, it didn't matter if it was a squirrel, bird, rabbit, anything. She'd prefer veering off the road and slamming into a tree then going over a mouse. I lived in a wooded area at the time and we drove around a lot together but whenever an animal would haul ass across the street she'd stop short and scream which would give me terrible flash backs and I'd lose my shit. 


At the end of the day, you can't not drive if you're going to lead a normal life. I've got no idea how to overcome this. If I'm driving myself it's like every second feels how it feels when my friend would slam on the breaks and scream when an animal would run across the road. I don't know what to do here. I've tried time and time again to adapt to driving and overcoming my fear of getting T-boned again but I can't do it. Even when I try to drive at 4 in the morning before many people are out. I also don't want my shaky-ass on the road either because I don't want to lose my shit and T-bone someone else, you know? 


If scientists could just invent teleportation already that'd be great. I can't afford the $40 per mile prices that Uber has anymore but lack of money, severe inconvenience and being berated by everyone around me for not driving isn't solving my problem. ",13Nov2017,1

80,"TL;DR: I finally found out who my biological father is and have his contact info. I don't know whether I should contact him or not. He doesn't know I exist. What do I do?

First off, some history for context. I'm 31, born to a single mother. From what i'm told, my mom was a bit of a wild child back in the day. When she found out she was pregnant with me, she could narrow it down to two guys she had been seeing around that time. She never bothered to let either one know she was pregnant since she didn't know who the father was. This being the 80's, she had already lost contact with them at this point, and with no internet or Facebook, that was pretty easy to do. When I was about 8 she met a guy, got married, and I gained two step-sisters and eventually, a half-brother.

I always wondered who my biological father was. My mom handled the inevitable ""Do I have a dad?"" question from me pretty well, and was honest. I never felt like something was missing from my life though. I was more concerned with video games and school and friends than a stranger I had never met. But I always wanted to know who the guy was, what he was like, and what he was doing.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Participation in 23andMe brought up an interesting list of DNA Relatives. The first one aside from my mother and brother was a name I had never seen, with three other past surnames. I called mom and after discussing some of the other interesting things about 23andMe, and I asked.

""So there's someone listed here as a possible second cousin, and it says her last name has also been [Name1], [Name2], and [Name3]. Do any of those sound familiar?""

""[Name2]...[Name2]...""

""That one?""

""[Name2]...yeah. Yeah. That's the name of one of the guys I thought could be your biological father.""

""Really?""

""I guess that mystery is solved.""

""Is he the one that was an airline pilot and drove a DeTomaso Pantera?!""

""No, that was the other candidate.""

[""Oh.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdEQmpVIE4A)

So I immediately got to work on social media and found...not much. His Facebook is bare (or private) but I did find his wife, who he seems to have married 12 years ago. It looks like she has a couple kids and grandkids from another marriage. I can't tell if he has any kids. No pictures of him (Damn!) but I also found his LinkedIn profile, which matches with what mom told me he did while they were dating.

So the question now is: **Do I contact him?**

My wife says yes, go for it. I've always been curious to know the guy. How much are we alike? What is he into? Do we have anything in common? Do I have any brothers or sisters? Would he want to know I exist? Be a grandfather, when my wife and I have kids?

My brother says no, don't bother. Sure, i've been curious. But I never really grew up feeling like something was missing. My dad has been my father since I was 8 years old. I have a career, and a wife. We're starting our own family pretty soon. It's clear that his absence has had little effect on me.

If anyone has any experience in some way, I would really love to hear your story. Whether you were adopted and contacted your biological parents later, or if you suddenly found out you have a child years later, how did you feel? What did you do? Did you stay in contact? Was it important to you?

84,"I'm 15 years old and recently started highschool. I grew up in Canada [moved here when I was 3] so I've had the opportunity to become fluent in English. My mom [48 F] on the other hand, has not.

My dad was quite abusive and controlling, so she took all 5 of her kids and moved out. With no financial support, she's pursuing an education and a career in immigration law. I couldn't be more proud of her.

But for her current job and school, she'll ask me to read over her assignments. She's on her last course, and I've been doing this all 3 years of her schooling. Naturally when I read it and find something that could be improved, I edit it. I've spent hours at a time editing her assignments. You see, the concepts and ideas are there, but the level of fluency and articulation for the field of law is not. 

We got into an argument today because I had told her she should sign up for an English and grammar class or watch a few TED talks. It would also be beneficial for her to surround herself with articulate and well spoken people, so attend a few of those events. 

She became defensive and said I didn't do anything. That they were only looking for the concepts, not the English. I didn't make these suggestions out of malicious intent. But after she's done school, I won't be able to articulate for her once she enters the work force. With where she's at currently, I don't know if she'll even get hired.

We didn't talk after that fight, and I'm still very conflicted. Am I in the wrong? Should I edit her assignments? Could I have done this with more tact? 

Thank you for reading, and any guidance is appreciated.

TLDR: My mom isn't fluent in English so I edit her assignments for her. I'm afraid she won't get hired after she's done school with her level of fluency, so should I continue to edit her work or leave her to fend for herself and risk her failing her classes? ",13Nov2017,1

89,"I'm 19 year old girl that is a college student. Back when you were able to use tinder when you were underage, I met a guy on there when I was about 17 and we ended up adding each other on snapchat. He then got a girlfriend. We didn't talk, but I guess I just was able to see his life through his stories on snapchat.

Flash forward to May of this year, I was on Tinder again, but now I'm legal. Came across him and swiped right. We matched once again, recognized each other, and began talking again. We realized we were both starting at the same college later that summer. He asked if we could hang out after a week or so of talking, and we did, even said ""it's a date."" We went to my college campus, got lunch, and then got ice cream after. I was so excited. He was incredible. I came across his instragram and found his claimed ex-girlfriend and she still had all their pictures up: one being only one week old. It hurt me knowing he lied to me. They were still together, yet he led me to believe that they were no longer together. They eventually did break up, but I just have no idea when. We kept talking everyday. I didn't mention that I knew that he lied. 

I didn't let myself develop feelings for him considering he was a liar. It was more so I was using him for attention. At this point, I was hooking up with different guys are parties and such, and felt like I didn't really need him.

We ended up staying up really late and talking one night and he admitted to wanting to hookup with me. I said we could make it happen, and well, we did. We got lunch and then hooked up, and I really enjoyed it.

It's been a complicated route. We never even settled to say we were friends with benefits, and I don't even know what to consider us. We constantly hookup. He kisses me goodbye in public. He's bought me shit. I developed feelings and ended up telling him one night while I was drunk. He said he was too busy with work and school for a relationship. I know it was just an easier way to say he wasn't into me like that. Things got awkward I suppose. I still had feelings. We got into a fight one night when we were both drunk and he told me he didn't want anything to do with me anymore. He said he didn't know why ""this"" is even a thing. I cried. He said he didn't care.

I ended up not talking to him for a week. He eventually apologized, and said he wants to still see me. We hooked up again, but while we were, I had a bit of a meltdown. I was disgusted by him and I do not know why. I was not enjoying myself. I was dissociating so hard while we were having sex that I pushed him away and just started crying. I didn't get it. I have experienced sexual assault before, but I didn't know why all these feelings hit me. He understood and stopped immediately. He didn't comfort me.

I want to end it but I don't know how to. I like him as a person, but I'm afraid having sex with him is going to result like last time, every time. I'm not sure how to cut things off, and if I do truly want to cut things off. I know this isn't healthy for me. He was constantly making me cry and I do not deserve that. I do not deserve to just be used. What do I do? What do I say? ",13Nov2017,1

Even my school work is suffering now. I just put everything off, knowing that doing so will screw me over, and then I get mad at myself for it. I am narrowly surviving my first year of college. (well.. for me a B is abysmal.. so I'm realistically fine..but I just don't want low grades) Why can I not do anything regularly? It's really frustating. Random side note, I consider myself a pretty intelligent guy. I have won an award for my french, I have placed statewide in a spelling bee.. I occasionally experiment philosophically.

91,"Me and my husband and two children have been temporarily living with my father. We did this in order to pay off my college loan and credit cards (i lived on my own early on and for a long time to get away from my family and unfortunately made some bad financial decisions). And also because my husband got a full paid college scholarship and so was doing college while we both worked. We did pay off the loans and even managed to save roughly $23,000 which we were going to continue to accumulate so we can buy our first home. We were hoping to reach $50,000. 

But here's the thing. My father is an unstable person who just kept getting worse and worse with us. Even though we paid him rent and bought him food that he otherwise would not be able to make ends meet on his own (my mom divorced him shortly after we moved in, so it was mutually beneficial for us to be there). He would call us moochers, *ssholes, POS. Would constantly let me know he hated me and only cared about my kids. Said he was going to take my kids from me. Would constantly threaten me with the police if i stood up for myself and told him to stop talking to me disrespectfully. Told me that the police would kick me and my family out if i crossed him. This went on for unfortunately way more than it should have. It wasn't every day that he'd try to hurt us verbally. Most days he'd pull this whole ""im a harmless old man and everyone loves my fiestyness"" shtick.  But when he decided to pick fights with us it was always bad. And he'd do it in front of my children which made it all the more worse. But my husband and i felt like we had no choice. We were broke and needed to save up or end up homeless. He and i developed anxiety but continued to work. Sorry for the rambling. He would also try to turn my family against me. By lying and saying i was being emotionally abusive towards him, telling the kids to ""hate their grandpa"" and ""not listen to him"". When they openly would tell him they were mad at him for ""being mean to mommy"". It was always ""poor little old man"" and he should be able to curse me out and threaten to throw me in jail on fake charges.  My half siblings no longer talk to me and he likes to swindle money out of them by telling them sob stories about how he wishes he could afford to live on his own, how he barely has anything to eat. How he we are mean to him.

Today was the final straw. It's roughly 7am and i am waking up and notice my oldest is awake (5 years old). I go to the kitchen and my son is angry about something or another. His little brother wakes up after and takes something from the oldest. To which the oldest responds by snatching back what the youngest took and screeching and shoving the youngest down. My husband watches it unfold and then proceeds to walk up to the oldest grab him and take him to his room for a time out while sternly letting him know what he did was not ok. My oldest is a bit of a drama queen so he was wailing and fighting back the whole time. My father then steps into the kitchen and goes ""youre going to let that man grab your son like that?"" And i look over and go ""like what?"" And he replies ""He's hurting James, im calling the cops!!""
Now keeping in mind, that hes done this to us before i immediately raise my voice and go ""FOR WHAT?!?"" My husband comes out and my dad starts shouting ""Im calling the cops on you, you mother f*cker! Today is the day you lose your kids and your job"" And my husband had it and went ballistic yelling back ""DO IT!!!JUST FUCKING DO IT! IM FUCKING DONE WITH YOU! YOURE FUCKING CRAZY! I DIDNT HURT MY SON"" Cops show up, realize he called for no reason and while they were there, i called my mom to come help us leave. We packed a little bit of clothes and we left...Luckily my mom let us stay for the night in her tiny studio apt which is where i currently am while typing this...while watching my kids sleep on the sofas.. Earlier i had to pass by my job and quit it since i wouldn't be able to anything other than watch my kids for a while since we are far from the center my youngest was staying while i worked. And since i cant go back to that old neighborhood i am back to being a stay at home mom for the time being and until we are settled again. It hurt me to quit my job but i really was between a  rock and a hard place. We don't really know where to go from here. 

Thing is, i live in one of the most expensive places in the country where a two bedroom is 2,000. You are lucky if you can get anything lower than that. My mom agreed to split the costs if we take her with and its ok with us, and even so, we will barely scrape by. But we also had planned on using that money on moving someday on our own...to get a house far far far...away from where we are. But me and my husband don't think its the right time since he hasn't finished college and has no jobs lined up anywhere. We are just really upset at now having to use our hard earned money to continue living in this city which we absolutely hate. Im just at my lowest point right now and need some advice...or just any friendly words would be great..",13Nov2017,3

So I’d like to know if there is any non-rude way for me to double the seasoning on my food at a typical suburban working class Chinese restaurant. Or would that be the rudest thing ever?

I like all of them as people and no one is a bad friend. Its just that I don't enjoy the same things they do. I don't really feel a connection to anyone like I used to have.

Let me explain: every time I wake up after getting stoned, I just feel guilty, like you do when you eat a bunch of snacks on a diet or something. And sometimes I feel like I lost some of my innocence when I started getting high about 8 months ago. It probably sounds stupid, but I just feel like I’ve lost something from this... 

I’m not trying to make this a depressing post, but I don’t have a lot of friends and my childhood was kind of... meh. No good friends, at least none who were coming over to my house. Kinda lonely.

108,"As a part of my self-improvement journey, I've been trying to say ""yes"" to every social situation possible. It has worked out, for the most part, but this one is a bit tricky as I'm guaranteed to feel awkward and out of place no matter how confident I feel with myself.

 There is a small social(not a house party) coming up at a girl's house who ghosted me. I've already seen her after she ghosted me and we had a regular(?) conversation so it's not like this will be an awkward surprise for her if I show up but I'm conflicted to whether I should go or not. I'm not trying to win her back at all, actually trying to just move on but it contradicts saying ""yes"" to social situations. 

Easy summary:

1. Social is hosted at a girl's house who ghosted me

2. The club associated with the social doesn't really have anything to do with me. Granted, I did meet some people, but the only ones I really got to talk to were her and one other person. I don't want to go into too much details, but I don't *really belong* in that club.

113,"Okay, its pretty late, so I'm just going to give the basic situation. I'll edit in more details tomorrow.

So, as the title says, I'm looking for some advice about asking out a girl. Sounds (relatively) simple enough, right? Here's the thing. There are a bunch of things that complicate it.

Here's the best break down I can do for now. Again, I'll improve it tomorrow..

1.) We're both sophomores in highschool.

2.) We have had a handful of classes together in the past. Like one or two. Currently, I have one class with her, in which we sit pretty damn far apart.

3.) I've never *really* asked anyone out before. To be explained more.

4.) I'm not from around here. She is. I moved from across the country to here about two years ago.

5.) I don't really have any friends here. The culture change was retty drastic and kinda makes it hard.

6.) I have no way to contac her through social media or texting. The only possible way to do so is to get her phone number/ social media information through my ex girlfriend who I am doing my best to never speak to again.

7.) No confirmation, but I'm pretty sure I'm ugly as fuck. Don't know for sure, as I've always wondered but never known. I posted to /r/ratemeteen the other day, but it was completely ignored. (I can add or PM the link if it helps)

8.) Thing is, she is far from conventionally attractive. I like girls who most people would call ugly, the ones who would be called fat or obese. If I had to guess, she's about 300-400 lbs, so unattractive to most people, but hot as fuck to me.

10.) I'm pretty shy.

11.) The one class I have with her is the last of the day

12.) I'm pretty much blind in one eye, and sometimes the vision in the other can be kind of weird, so if I lose sight of her, I probably won't spot her again. Well, except maybe because of number 8.

I'm probably missing some stuf, but I can't think of anything.

I've come up with a kind of plan to uss, but I don't know how goof it is.

Step 1) When school ends and everyone stattts going out to the doorways, which are a pretty decent way away from that class with her, I ""accidentally"" bump into her gently.

Step 2.) Apologize (which I'm imagining will kind of start the conversation)

Step 3) Ask her something about math, because that class I have with her is Algebra 2 and she's smart. Maybe also ask if she knows about this kind of weird thing that happened last eeek.

Step 4) Ask her if she's heard about a dance coming up. I honestly don't know if there is or isn't. Communication bettween administration and teachers and then teachers to students is honestly shit here.

Step 5) Depending on what she knows, either ask her to the dance or to a movie.

Step 6) Either smile in relief, give her my phone number, say ""Thank god"" or something similar (I live in a really religious area), etc or apologize and walk away in shame.

I'm just aware enough to know that this is long, rambling, and probably filled with typos, but not enough that I'm motivated to fix it. Sorry.

118,"A little bit of context:

Since the last year, I feel a bit desmotivated with everything. I do not recall any exact date or anything, but one day to another, I started to skip some of my responsibilities (college related: studying for exams, going to classes), but I did them anyway. I thought I was only getting lazy.

At the start, I joked about it with myself and I didn't feel it was serious. My brother, who studies Philosophy, told me about nihilism, and after some reading about that, it helped me to get by. I thought it was temporary and that I would solve it by my own, but instead, it keeped up getting stronger and stronger, and without realizing it at first, I found myself half year, doing nothing, not going to classes or even to friend's invitations.

It continued over time, and right now, I'm having troubles to sleep, sometimes not sleeping at night, some days sleeping the whole day, and always staying at home.

I'm already failing some subjects of my career only because of assistance, and I accepted it, but looking further to the next year, I don't want this to jeopardize my future. I'm worried about this non-sleep habit that i'm developing. I know it's not healthy at all, but I can not control it. And the worst is that I do not know why it started at all.

So here's my actual question: I do not know how to bring those worries to my mom (I live with her, since my parents are divorced) to get help, because this is quite a bit sensitive topic for me. My girlfriend and my best friend are the only ones who know. Any advice on how to start this conversation? I want to worry my mother the less possible, since her asking me questions and more questions that would get me more anxious than this already makes me.",13Nov2017,1
119,"I had a friend group I made through school, through which I started dating my boyfriend and made one of my best friends, who I don’t even talk to anymore. Her boyfriend, also in the friend group, was a real piece of shit. For the first little while of them dating, he wouldn’t hang out with her without being high. I told him to cut that shit out, and turns out his anger issues are even worse when he’s sober and when we all went to the fair together he grabbed me and tried to move me out of his way to be by his girlfriend, which I was not having. Between that, and a few other incidents of him getting extremely angry at me, I expressed my concern for her, but never explicitly told her to break up with him, just tried to bring these major red flags to her attention. She was blind to this, however, and when she told him, he took it as me trying to break them up and convinced her the same, and as a result she started treating me differently. 

She tried to “get back at me” by basically trying to talk shit about my boyfriend to me, and attacking me for anything I said in the group and letting her boyfriend say ridiculous things she would have previously been outraged at someone for saying. This, along with many other things, like her self destructiveness and refusal to take advice, took a toll on my mental health. (Edit: I let her stay at my place for a bit when she got kicked out of her house hit him being over while her parents were out of town as well, and was there for her and her boyfriend when she had a bit of a shroom-induced suicidal episode. I felt that I had been a good friend and put a lot into our friendship, but never expected anything in return except maybe not being treated like garbage)

Eventually, me and my boyfriend left the groupchat, with the support of the rest of the group, as her boyfriend said some extremely rude things towards both of us. The support of the group didn’t last long though, they kept talking to those 2 like nothing ever happened and barely used the new groupchat we made. My boyfriend, as well, continues to talk to them like it’s nothing, despite the fact that I’ve brought up how much this whole thing has affected me. Most recently, they all decided to go to a party with my former best friend and her boyfriend instead of going out with me and my boyfriend on my birthday. 

I feel like what I need is distance, but it’s impossible when my boyfriend is living with one of the friends who chose the party instead and talks to my former best friend like nothing happened but she won’t even look at me. I feel like I’m the only one not in the original group and it hurts because I feel like I was treated very badly, and there were no consequences for them.

123,"Hi, I’m currently a 20 year old full-time college student and I work part-time. I still live with my parents and financially rely on them. 

My parents both work a lot and I never really got the chance to travel growing up. However, last summer, after months of begging, my parents let me travel abroad with my boyfriend for two weeks. I hope I don’t sound too dramatic when I say that I had the time of my life. I am a pretty anxious person, but during those two weeks, for the first time in my life, I felt like I had no worries at all. It’s a feeling I had never felt before and haven’t felt since. 

Earlier this year, my boyfriend told me that he will have to spend half of the next year out of the country for his work. He works from his computer and can go basically anywhere in the world. He asked me many times to take next semester off and join him on his travels around the world: he even offered to pay for me. Sounds like I hit the jackpot, right? 

The thing is, my parents are dead-set on me finishing my studies as soon as I can: that means no interruption/semesters off, especially not for fun. I love them both and I am very thankful for them, but I wish they’d let me do this. 

My boyfriend has been gone for a little while now, and I feel like I’m stuck in this “study and work until you die” life, and I feel like I have no control, especially when I see him living his best life around the world. I feel like the world’s giving me the opportunity to briefly escape my life on a silver platter. However, my relationship with my parents is very important to me and I am very close with my mother especially. I know my parents don’t have degrees and had to work very hard to get to where they are now, and they simply don’t want me to suffer. I know how important me staying on track is to them, but I also feel like one semester won’t hurt. Education is very important to me, but I also feel as though I’m losing motivation, my grades aren’t as high as they used to be and I kinda just feel like I’m wasting my time/life.

I have tried talking to my parents about how I feel many times, but as soon as I mention taking time off school, they immediately shut down and get angry. I have a lot of respect for my parents, and I don’t want to go without their permission and lose their trust, but I really feel like I need this. I’m just confused and need advice!

tl;dr: I want to take a semester off school to travel with my boyfriend but my parents won’t let me, what should I do?",13Nov2017,1
124,"Hi guys, so mono has been giving me utter hell and the past 3 days I was on prednisone 1 and Tylenol 3. The pred 1 was administered over the day and before bed. This morning I went to the ER and they gave me prednisone 2 instead which helps but they said to only take it once a day. Well now it’s night time and it’s worn off and my ears are clogged and itch and are irritating and my throat is swollen to shit and ugggh I hate life rn.

126,"Ok so let me just dive right in because this is a fucking doozy, So 2 months ago I moved from NYC to LA with my 2 good friends from school, one of them being someone I've come to call my best friend even though I've only known him for a year (we just have that connection y'know?) So a little backstory: In New York I was going through a rough patch with drugs and binge drinking, and thankfully I nipped it in the bud before I straight up died. I now go to moderation management to learn how to control my drinking and I haven't blacked out in like 6 months! So fast forward to what happened. One of out friends from New York came to visit so we decided to go out to the bars for a night out! We pre-gamed a little in my apartment and I noticed my roommate was already drunk, not like so drunk I didn't think he could go out but just like tipsier than he should've been after 2 drinks. I didn't really think anything of it so cut to the bar I'm having fun doing my thing suddenly the bouncer comes up and tells me I have to close my tab and I've had to much to drink. I truly was so confused, but wasn't gonna argue with a man who could delete me from life in a matter of seconds so I closed my tab and got my friends and left. My (now super wasted) roommate is liek ""cmon I got us an uber it's here you have to go home youre an alcoholic!"" like in front of everyone....and he's like 6 foot at least 230 and I'm 5'4 140lb so the fact he started to physically try to carry me to the car was truly terrifying. He manages to get me into the car and I'm horrified, and completely embarrassed. He won't let go of me so I hit him in the face to get him off of me (I know violence is bad but this was needed) So I tell them everyone I'm gonna go to a different bar and my 3rd roommate decides to take my wasted one home. Also from now one Wasted roommate with now be known as Wasted and 3rd Roomate will be Jenny. So while I'm at bar numero dos I'm having fun I met some people and I get like bombarded with text messages saying all this nasty shit like im a bad friend and that Im gonna die because I can't handle myself. I think hes just being dramatic me and Wasted have fights all the time drunk but theyre always super petty. I text him I'm fine and I also text Jenny I'm fine so the one reasonable adult in this equation does not have to worry. So I get some more nasty messages from Wasted whose actually starting to piss me off and so I tell him like ""You need to learn your place You can't control me like that, thats what bad friends do"" so THEN I like do my own thing and don't really pay attention to my phone. so unbeknownst to moi back at our apartment Wasted is getting in Jenny's face (whom is like the same size as me also small) screaming at her for leaving me saying all these truly truly awful things. He has her cornered and is terrifying her, so in self defence she swings at him to get away from him. He grabs her and pushes her onto our couch. I guess their fighting was so bad that we got 11 noise complaints and security said if they have to call the cops we'll lose our lease. Fun! So Wasted freaks out and runs to our friends apartment. On the way to our friends place he records 10 snapchat videos of himself having an absolute mental breakdown in the grass and I mean I cannot explain the crazy in those. He's pretty much sobbing saying I'm gonna be dead soon and that Jenny is a fake bitch and all this mean shit and he also says that I have an AA meeting in the morning I'm going to miss and I have substance abuse problems. Ok so pretty personal shit right? HE SENDS IT TO MULTIPLE GROUPCHATS SO THAT EVERYONE IN OUR CLASSES AT SCHOOL SAW IT. Humiliating. So he goes to our friends place we'll call them Thing 1 and 2. He tells Things that he is going to MURDER us in our sleep and then tells Jenny that if she falls asleep tonight he'll murder her. Pretty much saying all this stuff like he doesn't care about prison as long as we're dead. Creepy right? So they get him back to our place and in walks me having a drunken blast unaware of the shit storm that occurred. Wasted flips on me saying all this horrible shit. I won't lie I'm not super innocent as I was pretty drunk so I kinda argued back. I went to go to bed and he screamed that I was a worthless alcoholic and he hopes I die. Now I'm not a violent person as I reiterated before but hearing something like that from this absolute psychopath in my own home made me lose it, I charge at him and punch him (totally should not have definitely take the L on that) Now obviously he rocks my shit back and throws my ass on the ground so hard I started bleeding from like a gash on my arm really cute stuff. After he throws me on the ground he runs to the kitchen and grabs a huge ass KNIFE and lunges over our counter at me and the knife was like this close to getting me but luckily we have that extra counter space! So then he puts the knife to his throat and threatened to murder himself, luckily Things and Jenny get the knife from him and manage to get him to his room. Ok so afterwards I go to bed and check my phone only to see text messages from his saying if I came home he'd kill me and Jenny and all this really scary stuff so heres my problem...what do I do? This isn't the first time he's snapped before and he's planning on us talking about this (I've effectively avoided him for 2 days so far) I'm pretty sure he expects us to get over this like all our other fights buts thats just not the case I can't be friends with someone like that especially when they threaten my life. I'm afraid that when I tell him there's no hope of us getting our friendship back he'll snap and may actually cause me some serious physical harm. Jenny is opposed to kicking him out saying that we can live with him still, and everyone in our friend group agrees (obviously because they weren't the ones with a knife an inch away from their face) but my parents and friends from home tell me I need to get him evicted. I'm not really sure what to do and how this would fuck up our lease and how we split rent. Also just how do I go about talking about this without him snapping? I'm really scared and I don't have another place to stay, and I have like 10 months left on my lease so please help me out what should I do?",13Nov2017,1

130,"So I’ve had this internet friend for about a year now, we met on Wattpad and had messaged on there for a few months before switching over to kik. Over the past year or so, we’ve texted just about every day, we may miss a day or two every once in a while, since this person is in college and I am a recent graduate trying to navigate the world, but we still make time to text a fairly decent amount. Most days we’ll text pretty constantly from 7 a.m. to about 9 p.m. (We’re in different time zones fyi.)

At first, I thought that the frequency of which we communicated was great, which may be due to the excitement of making a new friend and having a lot in common and such. But recently, I feel like I’ve started to get bored of them (or vice versa). Just to clarify, I don’t find them to be boring as a person, I just think that our conversations have gotten boring as time has gone on. I feel like because we communicate so much, we often run out of things to talk about and end up just sending random emojis or gifs back and forth just to keep what is an already empty conversation going. 

Don’t get me wrong, this person and I are good friends and I genuinely want to talk to them, but I feel like I need to somehow find a way to tell them to “ease off the pedal”, if you will, without sounding like I don’t like them or I don’t want to talk to them anymore. 

Any suggestions as to how I could go about this *gently* would be much appreciated. 

tl;dr: My friend and I text too much and the conversations have gotten boring. How can I tell them to text me less without being mean?",13Nov2017,4
131,"So I was in a deep depression for about four years, parents had a rough divorce, financial issues and what not. 

I finally got out that vicious cicle about 5 months ago, but during those years I really distanced myself from people, I was alone most of the time.
In addition to that, the last year was kind of a sabbatical year where I just  worked  and  that made me distance myself even more from the few friends I made in highschool and childhood friends.

I recently moved to a new city to study college, far from my family and friends, I'm making new friends having a good time, but I still spend most of the time alone, is not something that I want, I feel that now I unconsciously try to be alone, for example I return to home as soon as possible, eat alone, do projects alone.

132,"So, my dad's got me a new computer but i can only use it if i pass all my tests. 

Skip this paragraph if you already know how the Australian testing system works. Basically, in Australia we have CATs (Common Assessment Tasks) at the end of each term (of which we have 4). We have 1 CAT for each subject and we have 5 levels, from worst to best they are: Emerging, working towards standard, at the standard, above the standard and well above the standard. At the standard and above is considered passing. 

I would say in the past my test scores are pretty average, with some working towards and some above but most of them being at. 


So, Ive never really paid attention to my scores and have never tried to study harder to get better scores.

But now for the first time I have to. I need advice on how to go about ensuring I get at least an At the Standard for each of my CATs. 


Im going to be making a list of what im doing for each CAT and im going to be studying them and im also going to consider asking for extra help from the teachers of subjects im consistently bad at (namely English)

135,So i was having sex with my gf 2 days back and came inside her. I was wearing a condom which had a reservoir tip. I pinched the tip before putting it on so there was no air and I think plentiful of space was left for semen to collect.

136,"My parents aren’t the worst, but they certainly are not the best. Some examples of what has gone on, well it’s mostly my mother, but either way: My mom got me tested for autism behind my back because I’m socially awkward, but I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and she never let me leave the house or have friends over because it was too inconvenient for her, so I’ve never had experience really being around people as much. 

I was also hospitalized for being suicidal and she asked what she could do to make me happier. It was around when my mom was convinced my dad was cheating and had a conspiracy that he tried to get her fired, which neither ever happened. They fought a lot. I told her she could stop yelling. Didn’t say it in a rude way and she called me, and I quote, a “selfish, big-headed brat” who “won’t tell me how to run [her] house”.

All in all, this is a neglectful environment. The place is a mess, no one cares, everyone hates each other, it’s toxic, and I’m nothing like them.

However... 

I feel terrible about even considering cutting them off. I love my dad and sometimes my mom isn’t in a shit mood and those times make me think I’d be making a wrong decision.

The thing is, when I move out, I’m going to be doing a lot of weird shit that they are not going to like at all. We have entirely different beliefs. They’re ignorant conservatives, I’m somewhere on the far left political wise. They’re Christian and catholic and I’m not only atheist but a satanist (which honestly id rather not admit out loud to anyone), I’d date any gender and they think gay is wrong. They’re racist, I’m not. The list goes on.

When I move out, I want to decorate my house with the shit that they’d hate (not in spite of them, but because I love these things), I want to be free about who I am for once, and I feel as though I absolutely cannot do this while they know about it. They’d probably fucking hate me. 

So for the actual thing I need advice on: is cutting contact justified? Or should I just move very far away and try not to be bothered? I love them of course, because they are family. But I do not like them as people, and we are incompatible in that sense. They have neglected me and wronged me in ways that I cannot forget that I wouldn’t even have time to write down, so that’s a factor in feeling like I should leave. Everyone’s telling me I should, but it’s more complicated than that. 

Is it best to just keep contact? How do I know what is best for me? How do I come to terms with that? I don’t want to hurt them and I’d rather have a better relationship with them in the future, so maybe this means I shouldn’t do anything so final. But I’d like to hear other opinions, maybe even from people who have cut off their families before.

I want to call my family-doctor to get set up with therapist (it's in that order I have to do) but it's close to impossible for me to do. When it's something like fever, cold etc I have lesser hard time calling, but mental illness has a bad stigma in my country (I live abroad now, the only reason I'm even seeking out help to begin with) and that is yet another reason I find it so hard to call regarding that.

140,"So I began working with my friend a couple months ago. We immediately hit it off and have a blast working together. She's been with her husband for like, 20 years or so. Now at our job we close at 12am and are not located in the best part of town, so he's said to text him when I get home just so they know I made it ok. I'm 24 and kind of on the smaller side so I'm used to people worrying about me. But it quickly went from him checking on me to blowing up my phone at all hours.

Now not only am I not attracted to this man at all, im good friends with his wife and she often has her kids around. This is making me extremely uncomfortable and nervous, and it's getting harder and harder to excuse. Why would he ask to come over? Especially at this time? What should I do?

141,"I don't even know where to start describing it; and it probably doesn't matter. These threads never go anywhere.

I can't make connections with anyone.  When I find someone who actually interests me, they usually want nothing to do with me. Even when they do, I'll usually only see them once or twice before they fade away. Or it will be, like, a week before they move hundreds of miles away.

Of the two who have been in my life more than two weeks, both only really want to talk to me, or do anything with me, when they're desperate. I'm either strung along or a passing thought. 

I hear some people talk about how they are introverted, or don't have many friends, etc, but I don't think they know what the statement means. There's no sense in criticizing them, it's none of my business. But they don't realize how good they have it. They talk about going out every weekend. Seeing bars, restaurants, movies, amusement parks, shopping, talking.  Maybe it's not everything they want, but it's so much more than I've ever known. They have lives, and they're whole people. I'm increasingly convinced I'm just a puppet.

My goal for 2017 was to be more social, get out more, and maybe find a friend group. I spent all year trying, and completely failed.

I've done all the bullshit advice that people like to copy and paste onto whiney shit posts like this. Hobbies, have em. Clubs, tried em. Dating? Yeah. ""Life changing"" journey? Mhm. And Dale Carnegie is basically my BFF at this point. I'm sure there are more, but I don't feel like rattling them off. You already get the picture. No matter where I look, or which advice I follow, I can't find the answer.

Maybe my purpose in life is to be a background character? Someone that the important people get to use when convenient? Maybe the entire purpose of my existence is to provide a plot line for someone else, whose life is tangential to mine, when I finally blow my brains out? I have some cousins who could really rack up some Facebook likes with a status update about that.

Maybe I can't connect with anyone because I wasn't meant to be a part of anyone's story? What if I wasn't supposed to be here in the first place? Well, nothing is truly supposed to be, is it. 

I'm not always negative. I'm usually lightheartedly empty, sometimes throughly optimistic. I make people laugh regularly. But sometimes, I'm just realistic. I'm doing everything right, at least as well as I can understand, but the results are shit. Over and over again.

I've been driving myself crazy trying to figure out what my problem is. There HAS to be something about me that is triggering humanity's immune system. I don't think I'm ugly enough to explain this, but maybe I am. There's no sense in claiming that my personality and social behaviors are normal, since if they weren't, I'd probably not be able to recognize it. But I will say that I've never been called out on anything like that, and I've interacted with people whom I know would have.

I know this reads like the wacko manifesto of the Santa Barbara shooter or something. I guess that's unavoidable. But I don't think my mindset is like his at all. I blame myself for the hole I'm in, I just need to understand how I got here in the first place.",13Nov2017,2

146,"TL;DR Want my first time to be with a girl I'm comfortable with but not sure if it would ruin my friendship with this girl


Hey Reddit. So I got super close with this girl over the summer. We went on around 5 one on one dates and had a few pretty intimate moments. However, both of us are now at far away colleges so we decided to not do anything physical during the summer (non spoken but heavily implied) so that we could stay close friends.

So far, we kept in touch. I text her many times a day and we FaceTime every few days. I'm a virgin and before college I had never gone further than a light kiss. At my college, the hookup culture is very big and I have made out with 3/4 different girls (that I remember lol) just at parties or night clubs.

So all that is fine but there have been a few opportunities where I may have been able to have sex but I didn't want to have my first time be with someone who I didn't know and while we were both drunk. I really don't want to wait to find someone who is special at my college but I want to have more options.

Anyway, so I was thinking of asking my good friend if she would sleep with me sometime during Thanksgiving break (we are both home) Here is the message I was thinking about sending:

&gt;So this I know this is super weird. I'm super glad that we became good friends and I want us to stay that way- as just friends. But would you be open to sleeping with me for my first time? You were talking about how it's a good idea to do it with someone you feel comfortable with and have a connection with and honestly you're the only person that comes to mind. I was thinking about it and I think that it would be important for it to be with someone I know and respect rather than some girl from Tinder or random drunk girl from a night club lol. And I know that soon enough I'll probably find a girl who is that special but honestly I really don't want to wait that long. It's not even like just for pleasure but it's more of like a confidence thing that I just think about a lot. So yeah...I know this is a really awkward question so I will COMPLETELY understand if you don't think that it's a good idea. If you're at all interested we should definitely talk about it more because our friendship is very important to me and I don't want to fuck it up.

Also to be clear, I do kind of have romantic feelings for her but I really really don't want a long distance relationship in college.

Why are people so weird? No one understands me. I feel like I am talking logically and even when sometimes I am making a good point, the other party may look disinterested or looking somewhere else.

My friend finds it okay to spit anywhere to clear phlegm even though that is disgusting. My friend thinks it’s okay to look through his girlfriend’s phone when she’s not looking. Whenever I tell them it’s wrong, I get met with stares.
The question I want to ask is, do they REALLY feel it is okay or do they just not want to admit it? Admit that they are in the wrong?
Or am I the one in the wrong as this are okay issues? I really do not get it. I am willing to listen, but whoever I talk to in real life does not understand.

A bit about me:

- Personality

Have always struggled to make friends in my life. Used to be paranoid about accidentally offending people so I used to be a wallflower and avoid too much social interaction with people I barely know. Had very few female friends and even fewer friends of the opposite gender. Have often been labelled as autistic for my reclusive traits.

Now I am trying hard to make new friends. I've reached out to a lot of people but I only end up with a lot of acquaintances and no friends. I don't know if this is common in uni. I really want to change myself but I don't know where to start.

155,"In school: I see my friend sitting at the table of her clique. She thinks she is in the clique, but the other 4 of them do not think so.
The teacher announces a group project, a team of 4. The rest of the clique talk amongst themselves, ‘Hey do you want to be do together?’ ‘Sure!’
She looks at them silently, with a smile of her face.
But deep inside, emotions are churning. What should she do in this situation?
The rest of the clique ignore her, as though she is invisible.
She walks away, to find another group.
But what is she to do?
She doesn’t know anyone else in the class. They are talking amongst themselves, having formed groups.
Talking to the teacher is not an option. The teacher doesn’t understand. He will just ask her to find a group with one member less.
Furthermore, what is she to do later, during lunch break? Does she continue eating with her so called clique? It would be awkward, sure, but it is better than having to eat alone, with your classmates looking at you, unsure whether to invite you to eat as they did not talk to you before.
She gulps, and returns the smile back to her face. She continues.

What am I supposed to do? I witnessed this whole thing today and it makes me sick. I want to help her, yet I already have a group. I cannot bear to watch her suffer in silence.

160,"I have clinical depression. All through 7-10th standards i got bullied. And had terrible rumours about me. No friends. I changed schools in 11th standard but couldn't continue because i would get terrible anxiety and panic attacks. Depression caused me to not be able to get up for days. I dropped out. Tried going to anther school next year for 11th but the same happened. So i decided to home school. And i was actually excited about it. But then my parents decided mental illness does not exist and i must have some thing possessing me and they called an exorcist. I was getting some tuitions those days so my parents would make me skip chemistry to go to the exorcist. That guy once came into my room (parents invited him) and he grabbed my throat and pressed so hard i swear to god my vision went blank. I was in shock. This was last year. I was locked in my room because i almost jump off from the balcony. I would cut so much it would take two hours for the bleeding to stop. Even thinking about it now makes me cry. That messed up my mind, the shock. I locked myself in my room for 4 months. I survived on noodles and coffee and i would watch movies all the time to distract my mind from the hallucinations. I remember there was a point where i didn't know what day it was, or if it was day or night. My health slumped and mentally i almost went insane. And when the time came for the 12th class examination (indian education system is weird) i messed it up because i didn't study. But i passed, barely. And then i was put into a college to do my bachelor's in physics. College started in august, this year. I was doing better than everyone else, I'm really good in studies. And i love physics. But i stopped going again. I have missed so many classes and all the labs I'm sure i won't be allowed in if i go now. And it had been difficult for me because i haven't studied anything from the syllabus of 11th and 12th because of the thing that happened. I asked my parents for a break, so i could rest my mind. But that's been really bad too because since i stopped going to college i have been in my house. My parents wont let me go travel. Indian mentality, it sucks but i can't do anything. I feel trapped. Like I'm losing this game life is playing with me. I cannot even apply for anywhere outside India because who would take a 3 times drop out. I do have a hobby, i am in a music club. I play the drums.

I'm 20, I studied IT and I really like it, mobile development specifically.
So I found this job near home, it's a big project for a medium company (can't get more specific but in theory it should be a really big thing in the future).
The project started with me as the only programmer, so I should do everything, still my boss is a fucking moron that doesn't understand a thing about programming and pretend he does.
Also some of my colleagues really like me and some others, for some reason, really hate me and they make sure to let me know about it (nothing really bad, I'm shy, I don't talk much and I don't really care about people).
Back to the project, the main problem is that we don't have a clear method of doing things, we are just starting so it's normal but it's really frustrating, we really don't know how to approach it and still the boss want to constantly change everything for the few customers we have now.
Having to do everything by myself there are days where I can't even breath and others where I literally browse Reddit for 8 hours.
I have to say it's a well payed job but it's so stressing having noone to talk about the project that know something about programming (they say they are hiring but I know for a fact they have no intention to).

169,"Hey all, 

I think the title is fairly self-explanatory. 

Ever since I was a child, I've always found myself attracted to women with darker complexions -- my first celebrity crush was on Salma Hayek, and my first date was with a Pakistani-American. 

Now that I'm in my mid-twenties, I've had the good fortune to explore different parts of the world. I've lived in South Asia for several years, spent months tramping around Central America, and have had a fairly good run at young life.

However, sometimes I get bothered by the fact that most of my relationships have been with South Asian (read: Indian, Pakistan, Bangladeshi) women. I've casually dated girls from Central and South America, too, but have only a marginal interest in white, black, and East Asian ladies. 

What's wrong with me? Should I try to burst out of my bubble? I've gone on dates with girls of all races before. But, from a purely superficial standpoint, I'd always opt for an attractive Indian or Mexican girl than an attractive blonde or redhead. I'm just not that into white girls, and tend to gloss over them on Tinder. 

Not sure if I'm looking for some reassurance or a reality check. I'd never date a person solely on the basis of their skin color or ethnic background -- personality is my biggest turn-on -- but I do worried that, when I'm looking for something serious, a potential partner might say, ""Yo, this dude has a brown fetish or some shit."" 

I've asked some of my female friends about this, and they don't think it's a big deal or particularly abnormal -- but they agree that it might seem strange to people who don't know my background (living in India for several years, not really ever having any white friends, etc). ",13Nov2017,2
171,"I'm 22 years old and I finally figured out what my dream job is. (The 1991 in my name are the numbers of my favourite players on the Red Wings). It's to be a Western version of a manga artist so I guess comic artist? I originally wanted to do this right out of school but I wasn't good enough so I took time to get better. I dropped it after reading about what other people were saying. They also wanted to be a manga artist but every top comment was saying it was impossible for them no matter how hard they tried. I'm easily influenced so I gave up and just decided to look for work. I've worked two jobs since turning 18. One was for three months and the other was for 11 months. It wasn't jobs I wanted to do forever and both times I left before they promoted me too much which surprisingly they understood and agreed with me on it. 

There's always been three things that I always come back to and have the most fun with: drawing, creating my own stories and learning Korean. The Korean is just for fun, to understand K-pop lyrics and because I plan to travel there one day it's good to know the language. My highest marks back in school were 93 in writing and 91 in art and throughout my highschool life I only had a 62 total average. These were the only classes I really cared about and had fun in. I always see art online and get inspired to get better myself. I have all these character ideas and designs and stores in my head that are dying to get out but every time I go to practice I always remember those comments saying how it's impossible to make it as a manga or comic artist and put back my stuff in my drawers.

I've pretty much hit my limit at home. My parents are telling me go to school or join the army since I struggle looking for and holding down a job. I already know I wouldn't pass the tests for the army I'm fit but for some reason I run out of breath instantly if I start running. When they said school it was almost like a lightbulb turned on in my head and that I decided on becoming a manga/comic artist. I need to get better, a lot better first before going to art school but if it's what I really want to do my parents would let me practice as long as I do go to school once I'm ready. I'm just wondering if any of you guys have followed your dream job despite what people said and how you ignored them. My best friend was in a similar boat. He was this gifted artist that ended up going to school to be a psychiatrist even after people said he wouldn't make it and to just stick to art.",13Nov2017,0

So there, I have horrible grades and my family is losing faith in me and doubting my intelligence. They have told me that I'm not capable of getting into the course I want at a high ranking uni in a difficult course.

And yes, I know with grades like mine there's no way I could. But then there's the grades I used to get. I was consistently an A grade student and last year one of my subjects was advanced, meant for the year level above me. I was so proud of myself for doing great in subject difficult even for students a year above.

I didn't continue with it due to clashes with another subject I like so I picked subjects I hated this year which stuffed up my motivation.

When you consider that for the majority of my highschool years I aced everything, it's not a crazy, unrealistic dream, is it?

I know it's a hard course but the jobs it leads to are high paying and I really want that for my future.

  now I feel our relationship is beyond repair and I feel I want him now much much more than he wants me and I feel my effort towards him is all for not,


 being in recovery prior to this I know it takes time to heal the wounds you inflict while in addiction and the things he has been through I honestly cannot blame him for the way he acts sometimes but now I feel he is just angry and miserable all the time and I just cannot seem to please him and he doesn't want to end the relationship but I don't understand why.


 he says he isn't going to leave after he put so.much effort into staying during the rough times that he doesn't want to miss the good times we used to have that will return with my recovery as well but I can't help but feel the way he is now isn't going to change I have been putting in full efforts to mend this relationship what should I do. 


Do I take the heartache and just let him go in keeping both of our sanities, or do I stay in this relationship still hoping like I am that things will get better and suffer through this.

The kittens mum is a hobby breeder and took the fact I was asking these questions quite personally, and said that by asking these questions she felt I was accusing her love for her kittens and also her as a person 

I do understand why what I asked may have upset her as I met her family, I met both the mum and dad cats, and she welcomed me into her home. I also think the questions I asked, if true, would mean she's scamming people of paying £600 for a £50 kitten. 

She cleared everything up for me but she seemed very upset and kept telling me I was welcome to go elsewhere if I think they might not be good breeders

My problem, the same problem I think everyone else is also struggling with that's also graduating, is what to do afterwards. I know I want to work in the aerospace field, but I have next to no experience. My program at school has co-op which means we alternate between finding an internship/entry level job and a school term every 4 months. However I wasn't fortunate enough to obtain a co-op position in aerospace. Most of my co-op was centered around mechanical systems for buildings like HVAC and a bit of robotics. I've also tried joining the Mars rover and Hyperloop student teams but not much came from them, mainly due to the burden of school and extracurriculars. To make it worse I didn't really take school seriously so my marks are pretty abysmal. I have one more term to kinda redeem myself as the courses I chose in my last term directly relates to the aerospace field. But I'm kinda stuck in deciding what path to take. Should I just stick with my co-op experience for a few years and learn on my own so at least I have a job after grad and then switch career paths?

Skip tomorrow's morning 8am lecture in favour of getting 8 hours of sleep, doing laundry, drying laundry, finish reading book, make multimedia report of said theory of said book 11% late marks taken of and submitted, eat toast and soup, drink milk and tea, clean up bed, change sheets, throw away all the trash, make some calls, check emails, organise dirty and clean laundry, fold and put them in the closet, make it in time for 11.30am tutorial, catch up on missed lectures and assignments, organise notes... 

That should be it. 

Not bad. Right? I just have to sleep now. Wake up at 8am. Pick up the trash and dump them. Organise dirty and clean laundry, fold the clean ones, bit by bit wash and hang the dirty ones over the course of the week. Finish reading book (30 more pages or so) and finish making multimedia report before 11am. Head to class, go home after class to eat brunch which would be the toast and soup. Catch up on past lecture slides, readings, and assignments. Drink coffee to keep energy up. Attend 2pm class.  Go home, prep for a meeting with a friend this evening in the city (gift and return items), and then head home. Continue chores while listening to podcasts or some sort of audio book before checking laundry again, unbox some items, build the shelf, organise stuff into it.

194,"So for the last couple years, my fiancee and I have been living at her parents' house. We are in the in-law quarters which is essentially an apartment attached to the side of their garage. It is a decent place with its own kitchen and laundry room and they have a good sized yard for our dog to play and it is close to both our work places and they are nice people. When we got married a couple months ago, we were very seriously working with a realtor but ultimately decided to quit the house hunt and stay with her parents for another few years. We decided this to save up more money and we plan to move out of state in a few years anyway and we only pay $100/mo for rent so we save a ton. The catch is my sanity. My wife is very close with her parents. She is an only child and her mom has always been stay at home. Because of this tight bond, my mother-in-law is always visiting, often uninvited and unannounced. Granted, relatively short visits, but I would say that I go one day per week without her visiting. My wife sees no issue with it. I, on the other hand, am a man of few words so I don't like visitors that frequently, even if they were my own friends or family. My wife is the only person I can stand to see and talk to every day. After already staying with them for 2 years but having 3 more to go, according to our plan, I am annoyed with the frequency of my mother in law's visits and my wife doesn't understand my desire for more privacy and independence at the moment. I see my options being A) buy a short term house and be upset with such a massive, short term purchase B) rent an apartment elsewhere and be upset with the high rent and lesser accommodations C) talk to my mother in law to set rules but I would come across as rude D) just deal with the situation and slowly go insane.

But if I do something she deems as wrong even if it’s something as much as staying up until 2 to work on a group project (like I did last night), she’ll get really upset ( not mad but the type of disappointed that makes you feel like shit) and it just puts me in a really shitty mood for the rest of the day.

Well, in the last week, my mom has caught her 3x. Once in her bra and shorts, once in her bra and panties, and the third in just her panties. My mom pretended like she didn’t notice the first 2x but the 3rd she asked what my sister was doing. My sister just said she was playing some video game and my mom told her that she’s disgusting. 

My mom called me after the 3rd time and it was my 1st time hearing about it. I’m 10 years older than my little sister and basically raised her. I don’t want to just ignore it. I feel like I should say something or educate her or something?
But it’s embarrassing for both of us and I’m low key grossed out and am scared to even see her. I never imagined she would do anything like this. She always seemed so disinterested in sexual things and insecure.

200,"I could really use your advice on this one :)


I was supposed to graduate from university last year, but turned in my final thesis too late (medical reasons). Now the examination board gave me the choice between getting my old thesis graded or writing a complete new one. 


One one hand I really wasn't in a good place while I was writing my thesis for the first time. I didn't sleep for days and spent much of the time in a kind of delirium... I now know that I shouldn't have taken my medication while I was under so much stress as the medication caused a lot of my symptoms at the time. While rereading my thesis, everything sounds logical and ok. But I can't remember how good I cited everything and I discovered some spelling and grammar mistakes. There is no use in correcting that now, because my professor will grade the version I turned in months ago. If I fail because I didn't cited everything properly I will be expelled for sure. 


Writing a complete new thesis mean of course a lot of work and stress again. Although my thesis only needs to have around 30 to 40 pages and I can pretty much choose a topic of my liking. I don't have any other courses I need to pass, so I'm pretty much free until January. In the past it took me around three weeks max to write 30 pages (research and everything else included). I'm a pretty good writer and always got really good grades on papers in the past. 



But I'm really torn and lost a lot of confidence. I keep thinking, if something happens or I get sick that I won't be able to turn in my thesis in and that I should have picked getting my old thesis graded...


What would you recommend? Fresh start or take my chance with my old thesis?

203,"Bit of background. I moved country from a young age, and lived there for just under six years. When I was first there, a teacher introduced me to somebody who was really fun and liked me a lot. Though at that age, people were kind of friends with everybody I guess. A year after we'd met, she moved to Germany. Since we were fairly young, we didn't arrange a way of keeping in contact or anything, so we went our seperte ways, almost. Throughout the middle of the second year there until the end of the fourth one, I had no ""real"" friends. People to hang out with and partner with in class, sure, but I was just there. I wasn't really included. They never got to know me, or my interests. Aquaintences, I guess. Then, when some classes were swapped around at my fifth year of being there, and a super friendly girl was in most of my classes. She introduced me to one of her friends, and that person and I became almost inseparable. We got each other into multiple franchises and whatnot, so we always had things to talk about. Their generally outgoing/extroverted personality was what enabled me to be more... myself? I'm extremely reserved and shy, but like a lot of people, I'm almost an extrovert myself when I click well with somebody. Anyway, due to family stuff we eventually decided that it was better to move back home. I'd have to start a new school and all, but I was assured it wouldn't be hard to find friends. That was five months ago. Five months, and I haven't found a single person willing to hang out or at least talk to me. Actually, that's a bit of a lie. There's a girl in one of my classes who makes simple conversation with me, and she's really kind. But the thing is, our friendship won't - can't - actually... go anywhere. She's not like me at all. Her interests are things that I just don't happen to like, and she doesn't seem like the type of person I ""need"" in a friendship, someone who brings me out of my shell. I feel selfish for saying these things. She was never obligated to even speak to me, but she did, and she's been incredibly nice ever since. I'm... looking for a certain type of person. Like the friend I had before. But I worry I'm just looking to replace them, as they don't tend to text me or anything unless they have nobody else to. I don't blame them, because I'm very boring over text and have nothing to talk about. It still hurts though. I'm trying to stay patient, but it's really difficult at times. After five months, I'm getting tired of being lonely. It's not like I can just waltz up to a group of friends and join their conversation. People aren't that friendly.

TLDR: Moved country, had a friend who then moved, eventually made friends later. Moved back, and now have nobody, don't know how to make friends. Any advice or just a story of a similar problem is accepted.",13Nov2017,4
204,"It’s my birthday today. I’m 23 and woke up with a really broken heart. I feel sucked in this deep hole of haunting and depressing emotions. I don’t feel like doing anything human today. I don’t want to smile, laugh, cry, eat, or sleep. I’m too broken to function. 

I got an early text from a friend this morning and that just made me realize that I’ve been sad for so long. And I bawled my eyes out yesterday after I left my friend’s house because all I can do is think and ask myself if you remember. If you remember that on this day last year, you made me laugh until my rib cage hurt and people were staring at me like I was crazy. And your warmth was there on my left side as we sat down holding onto each other. When you loved me enough to be with me. When I was the person of your life. And I also ask myself if you even remember about me.

I don’t want a fancy dinner, or any materialistic gifts. The best birthday gift would be to see you. I wish I knew how you were doing. I miss the sound of your voice and how you sounded when you told me you loved me.

209,"So, a little back story - I used to work at a shop for a month in the beginning of the year, thanks to a family friend who told the bosses about me. I was a vacation substitute for her and another worker there (was working in their place for a month when they took their vacations). 

In general it was a good job and the bosses were so wonderful. They even talked how happy they were with me when my time working there was over. All in all I left a very good impression, which I was very pleased about. 

I've been looking for a job for a while now, but there literally isn't anything on the market and it's getting very depressing. I really want to work for that store again.

210,"Hi everyone, I never thought I would write a post asking for help here again on Reddit.

&amp;nbsp;

A short introduction about myself, I'm just an average 20-going-on-21 year old guy. I'll be entering university next year and I'm currently working in a 8-6 office job. I live with my family, but I don't want to reach out to them about my current problems as nothing will ever change. I've been having a lot of problems lately, feeling down about life.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment I feel extremely lonely. The saying is true -
 *silence is deafening*. I wouldn't consider myself as the most ""socially-outgoing"" person, nor a complete introvert. I like to go out with people that I trust. The main problem here is that I feel extremely distant from all my friends, although there are close ones - I feel like they're never always there. Even if they are, I feel ignored. And it's the same feeling with everyone out there. I'm so tired of reaching out to people everyday and people only talk to me when they need things. The only acquaintances I have are the ones at work. None of them are close to me, I just talk to them on a daily basis about work-related things, small talk, nothing too personal and they seem introverted like me. At the moment, they're there. I know we'll part one day.

&amp;nbsp;

On top of all this, I have relationship problems with people I've met (already been heartbroken many times due to how fast I get attached to people). I'm closeted and out to select friends here and there. While I was dating someone, I grew too close to him too quickly and he kept pushing me away and pulling me back because of depression and other insecurities. We have had many problems and it took a toll on my emotional state but I still choose to stay as friends now mainly because I want to care for someone as I have a lot to give and don't want to lose an important person in my life. We still talk to each other but I find that I'm the one who has to keep reaching out and it is extremely tiring. I find that we don't have many common interests too.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm also losing interest in my hobby that used to be video games, but I still go on the internet to browse social media for memes and some tech related things every day. Suicidal thoughts have entered my head randomly before but I won't ever follow through, because it's a frightening thought. I feel I have so much to accomplish... I just don't know how, where and when to start.

223,So since I apply to housing early I have this random roommate. She is not very social and we come from different social background. We are both freshman and over the weeks into October I noticed my HDMI cable was missing from my TV. This happen during the day while I was at work but I was using it earlier the night before. Anyway she said she doesnt know what happened to it so I kind of believed her on that. Later on we have a coaxial cord that is used for cable plugged into the wall behind the bunk bed. I heard that she pulled the coaxial cord off the wall while I was on the top bunk laying down. I look down and the coaxial cord is broken beyond repair. I remind you that cord is University equipment and they charge for this. Anyway I told her this and she just gave me a blank stare and said nothing. But this isnt even what aggravated me the most. Recently I noticed my ID for my school has disappeared off my desk. I literally looked everywhere for my ID and it would be impossible for it to not be in the room as I used it to get into the dorm halls. I asked her about that and she plainly said I dont know. So now I have to use this temporary ID because I dont have enough money for another one yet and they are 20 dollars. But just today which is why I am writing this another thing of mine has went missing. Since my computer is broken at the moment I used my TV to watch netflix from my xbox. But since the HDMI cord I had was missing I went to buy another which was 20 dollars to watch TV again. So I used it just yesterday to watch some TV before I get on to an allnighter of studying. I stop watching TV around 12am and begin to study up until my 8am class. This whole time I am in the room so it is impossible for someone to come in during the night and take the cord. As I leave for my 8am class I check the cord is there and I leave. I come back after eating breakfast at around 9:30 am and notice the cord isnt there. I ask her has she seen the cord and she says no. I also noticed that my xbox was moved a little out like someone just took it.      WHAT DO I DO? DO I REPORT HER TO MY RA FOR THESE ACTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS TOO REPETITIVE. WHAT DOES THE RA DO WHEN I REPORT HER? AND CAN THEY CHECK HER CLOSET AND BELONGINGS TO SEE IF SHE IS HIDING IT?? I do remind you as well that she was going to do a room change beginning of November but did not. I am beyond pissed because I am trying to enjoy my life here but I still have to pay for tuition and other things I dont have such as a new laptop. I simply do not have money for these type of things. I tried talking to her and she is not participating in any conversation.

234,"I'm your typical 17 yrs old guy.

I think it's been like this for about half a year (kinda since this April). I just lost pretty much all motivation for even things I enjoy.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Here are a few examples:

I go to school every day only because I have to, in order to go to college. I only do my homework when it is really not much, and if the homework is too long, I either find an excuse, or skip it alltogether. I do have good grades, though.

I started doing Basketball weekly 2 months ago and I've only showed up twice.

Some time ago I was also really into HTML and CSS and worked on my own websites (never published them because I only did them as training) but I slowly started to lose interest. Not from one day to the other, but slowly. But deep inside I still know I enjoy it and I miss it now and then.

I used to really have passion for creating mods for games like Skyrim and Morrowind, but now I lost all enjoyment from it and it feels like a chore and I just want to get done with it when I start. It was my hobby. I even worked so hard on a showcase mod as a resume to get into a big team of 50+ members working on a massive project for a game, I got accepted and now I lost all motivation to contribute to the project. I always wanted to be part of the project and I had great passion for it.

On some occasions, it even hurts my social life. Everyone in my school has Whatsapp and they always tell me to get a new phone number (since my current one is not working, I dunno) and I always say ""yeah, will do!"". It's been months and I still didnt bother to get a new number even though the store for this stuff is right across the street. I even walk past it when I come from school every day. I also have money to buy a number, that's not it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, sometimes I feel like I'm just lazy or maybe procrastinating. I actually really enjoy going to a pizzeria or the mall and I'm not really trying to stray away from the people around me. But whenever I *have* to do something, I immediatley lose all interest.
For example, before I joined the Basketball thingy, I was excited for doing a sport, but after I *had* to do it every Tuesday, I lost interest. I also had great passion for working on the showcase/resume for the game project, but once I got in the team, and *had* to work on the project, I lost all interest.

!!!IMPORTANT PART!!!

I think the reason for this mood (maybe depression, hope not tho lol) is school. It's all just so overwhelming. My whole life and future DEPENDS on the next 2 school years. If I dont get a final grade of A- (9 out of 10 here) (which is really overwhelming and also freaking me out all the time) I won't be able to go to college, EVER, and the stuff we learn keeps getting harder and harder every semester.

236,"So I made a post about this a while back and I have an update.  I'll describe the situation.  It's very weird so please excuse the long explanation. 

Months ago I began talking to this elderly man over the phone.  He called into my job, we talked and had a pleasant conversation, and it was such a good conversation that we exchange contact information.  Ever since we've been talking on the phone about various things.  Life, money, sex, man-conversations.  We are both straight.   

He offered to take me on as his mentee a while back, offering to take me into his home, teach me what he knows about various things.  Making money is one of them.  He is quite well of financially.  (Not a millionaire perse, but still well off).  He knows, and constantly reminds me how I am essentially letting my life pass me buy because my yearly income is so small.  

This man also has terminal cancer, the doctors gave him around 3 years tops.  He doesn't have a son in his life so he wants to take me on and pass his knowledge down to me.  This involves me uprooting my life and going to live with him.  We currently live in the same state but eventually he is going to be moving out of state.  He offered to show me his connection, get me a good job, maybe send me back to school, teach me some others things like how to invest.  He likes to talk about how much money he has made other people, talking about how much his time is worth and how I won't get another opportunity like that. 

The issue, however small, is that he has told me multiple times he is going to ""bring me down"" on certain dates.  That means bring me down to live with him and become his mentee and help with the caregiving since again, he has cancer.  HE is constantly in pain.  But the problem is that he constantly pushes back the date for us to meet.  For months we only talked on the phone, and when he made a meet up date he'd push it back 2 weeks.  And he has done this at least 7 times now.  So it's been a bit upsetting, especially when he claims to tell me just how much he values his word, and this his word is all he has.  Yet he seems to break it constantly.  

I've been trying to figure out a way to bring this up, about how upsetting it is for him to push back this date.  But the thing is I've been forecoming with him in the past about a similiar concern I had with him and he BLEW UP.  Essentially damn near broke our relationship over me questioning him, talked over me and didn't allow me to explain myself, didn't listen when I did explain myself, and told me to keep my opinion to myself.  He tells me that a zebra can't change his stripes and he has no intention of changing for anyone.  So essentially, he views himself as without flaws and won't keep anyone in his life that doesn't follow that narrative. 

So I know the type of person this old man is.  Despite everyone's advice to drop the relationship with him I kept the relationship going and closed my mouth, and kept my opinion to myself.  And he FINALLY brought me down for a weekend.  I met him.  We hung out, he took me to bars, restraunts, casinos, strip clubs.  Everything he said he'd do.  And then I went back home.   He was exactly the person he said he was.  

So now I'm back home, he tells me he is going to bring me back home in 2 weeks.  2 weeks comes and, guess what, he pushes the date back 2 weeks AGAIN!  This upsets me and I don't know how to talk to him.  He calls me and can tell I'm upset because I'm not laughing at his jokes very much anymore.  I finally decide to speak up about him constantly pushing back the dates and going back on his word and guess what, he blows up on me AGAIN!   

He's not a screamer really, but he does talk over me, he was completely closed off to the idea that him giving me a date and not keeping it was him going back on his word.  He went on a long rant giving me excuses as to why he had to push the dates back.  Reffering to his pain from cancer and other old man stuff, his doctors appointments, lawyers appointments ect.  But the thing is that he already knows he has these obligations before he tells me when he is going to bring me down, and he does it anyway.  Regardless, He told me to never question his integrity and I should be ashamed.  He told me to never do that again and that was the end of it.  I asked him 'well does this mean I shouldn't be honest about how I feel?""  He said no, yet he told me to never do ""something like that"" again.  Which is essentially to question him.  So now I'm in this situation again, how can I bring up my concerns to this type of person if he is going to see them as a grave insult and consider breaking off the relationship everytime I do?  He gets genually upset, and tries to make me feel guilty for daring to question him.  Reminding me just how valuable he is and how I'll never get another opportunity like this again, and ""you'll never meet someone like me, willing to show you the ropes and take care of you.""  So essentially, ""shut your mouth."" 

I've deciced to shut my mouth before because of what he has to offer.  Even if it's half true, it's better than the direction my life is going right now for the next 3 years.  I made next to nothing and don't have any major plans to do anything for the next 3 years besides save what little money I make.  I'm single, no kids, I'm 27 years old, so i have the time to spend the next 2-3 years of my life learning from someone. 
 I just would like to be able to share my feelings every once in a while.  But it's starting to look like I just need to shut me mouth, grin and bare it like you'd do in bootcamp or something. Thoughts?  

TL:DR: Whenever I bring up a concern of mine to my mentor he takes it as a grave insult and tells me not to question him and keep my opinion to myself. How can I bring up my concerns to this type of person or should I just grin and bear it when he says or does something that upsets me?",13Nov2017,1

238,"My 15 year old son is very immature. I can't blame his mild autism on it either. He just doesn't have a grasp of reality except extreme objectivity. A girl has a crush on him and he's oblivious of it. A girl wants him to chase her to get the girl, he doesn't see the opportunity. A girl sends him a flirty message or picture, he dismisses it. A girl tells him a joke, it goes over his head.... You get the point. I know for a fake my son is interested in girls because he makes perverted jokes once and a while, but I don't think he understands how to have feelings for a girl without treating them like objects.

My wife and I tried watching some chick flicks with him but he's too immature to understand the themes. I thought about music but he won't listen to anything but parody music on YouTube or video game soundtrack music. I thought about setting him up with a girl but that would never work. I'm honestly at a loss. Need some new perspectives on how to get him to develop romantic or at least hormonal feelings for a girl.

He's basically stuck in a mental age of 11 years old, the same age as his sister. He's not in groups, not in clubs, we don't go to church, and we don't have a large family so all the practice to socialize is done online. I will be having him do drivers training soon and maybe get a job but other than those two things I have no clue how to help him grow up.",13Nov2017,0
239,"So, I’ve not been around my family for about seven years now. It started when I began dating again after my last divorce. I’ve been married more than once and they ended for different reasons. I will add that the only divorce due to infidelity was my ex’s infidelity. My relationship with my guy now is great and I’m hopeful for years of continued love. My guess is that my brother didn’t approve of me trying to find a lasting relationship yet again. He’s never met this very sweet man of mine. Said brother seems to have convinced the rest of my family that I’m not worth having a relationship with.  I recently attended my sister’s wedding hoping it was the beginning of a family reconciliation. She seemed glad I came but I was obviously still treated like the outsider (only one not at the family table, brother still not speaking to me). I feel somewhat sad not having a family but I also don’t care to be bullied or judged. If anyone has a similar experience, I’d be interested in how you handled it.",13Nov2017,1
242,"So, I work for a very large company and I do internal first level phone tech support for the workers of said company. When I first started we had a tool that would allow us to IM a select group of people if we needed help with a call we were on. We will call it the Call Assist Line (CAL).

Well, CAL didn't work too well. I would constantly hear complaints about how no one would respond, it would take too long to get, things like that. I was one of the people on the list who gave answers, and I tried my best to answer as quickly as possible, but I'm only one person. So I submitted a request to have the process looked at.

The request was approved and I was a part of a small four person team to gather and analyze data. We found that there was no supervisor to oversee the groups (aka maintain and remove/replace people). That was the main problem... no one took responsibility for it.

We went through the data, found people to ""champion"" it, and also found a supervisor who would be willing to take responsibility for the tool. We also created a tool to track everything so the data would be easier to view and the helper tool easier to manage. We renamed CAL to AML or Assistance and Mentoring Line in order to start with a fresh slate.

It's been several months since the new tool went out, and although we have had some bumps in the road at the beginning, I really felt like we were having a positive turn. But last week I got an email for an update for the tool that I didn't particularly agree with.

They wanted to add all the people with a certain job designation. This doesn't necessarily mean that they're super knowledgeable, majority of the time it just means they've been with the company longer than I've been alive. They then removed people who are not of that designation. The people removed are people who actually help and are very knowledgeable, but just don't have that I've-been-here-forever designation.

They didn't ask the people they added if they wanted to be apart of the group. I've had people tell me they didn't want to be in it. This was not how the tool was supposed to be used and how people were supposed to be added, but it's what they're doing and I feel like it's creating the wrong environment.

I called all the orthodontist places near me and they said they wont remove it even if i paid them, Almost every single one said the only way they will remove it is if i get new braces or spend $500-$800 for a new one.

249,"Throwaway since my husband uses reddit. I feel like this is a crazy idea and i just need to quickly get some advice, i'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. 


My husband [34] and I [29] have been together 7 years, married for 3. We are currently trying for a baby. It is still pretty early days, i know that people say it can take up to a year naturally, we have been trying for about 9 months, so i don't think we are at the stage of seeking help from doctors. I track my periods and my ovulation but my periods are irregular and I don't know if I'm ovulating... regularly? I just had a thought and wanted to see if it was realistic. 


I used to be on the pill and was told that if i forgot to take the pill two days or so in a row that I wasn't covered at all, to start taking the pill as soon as you remember but to use other protection for 7 days after, I remember being told that... the pill stops your body from ovulating so when you miss more than one pill, it realises and starts to fix it? So, could I in theory, take the pill for a week or so and then stop it and would that... force me to be fertile? I don't know if that makes sense? I don't know if that's a stupid idea and baby fever is making me worry and overthink? Any advice would be great!",13Nov2017,1

252,"I️ already can see from the title of this that it’s gonna be a lot of no’s and negative responses but there’s a lot of backstory to this. So I’m 18 years old, and I️ got out of a 2 year long rehab type situation in March 2016. When I️ got back I️ turned over a new leaf. Got along with my parents much better, my dad was getting sober because he’s a drunk and it was all good. Ended up dropping out of school with my parents approval to start working in my dads family construction business. I️ work under my older brother and we stay pretty busy. I’ve always been a pretty big introvert that likes to be close with family and has very few friends. So I️ was on a good path of working and making a good careeer. I️ never stopped smoking weed or drinking when I️ got back because basically my whole family smokes weed n stuff so why not. So I️ got real close with my brother n stuff and we had plans to get a house and be roommates. Anyway about 6 months to a year ago I️ kinda started dabbling in my old ways with drugs n what not. I️ also had a little habit of getting hookers on backpage here and there when I️ was a little fucked up. Trans girls and regular. But my family except my mom would never accept trans or gay type situations. So about 6 months ago I️ started getting into much harder drugs like oxy, dilaudid, cocaine, and all that shit and it was eating away at my budget pretty bad. And 4 months ago, I️ has gotten off of work and was horny so I decided to get a trans girl on backpage. I️ got there and we did our thing but it was weird at first because we had hit it off like talking and what not for like an hour before we did anything, and even afterwards I️ was just chillin there with her. She was telling me how she had just gotten out of a really bad relationship with this guy who’d beat her like crazy and leave for weeks and cheat on her and all that bad shit. I️ offered to take her out that following Saturday and she said she was down even though she said I️ wasn’t gonna come through. But I️ really wanted to so she said she’d be down. And so on Saturday I️ hit her up and she was down, so I️ got ready and cleaned my car and all that good shit and when I️ went to go get her she blew me off. So whatever. But the next morning she texted me saying sorry that her friends stole her phone, and she asked if I️ still wanted to go, so I️ was like hell ya. And we went out. That’s the beginning of the relationship. Now it’s not like a sugar daddy kind of thing. I️ was hardly even helping her with paying shit and she’d buy me food and what not just as much as I️ did her. But over time we’ve gotten a lot closer to each other. She’s 27 and I’m 18 so it’s a difference but for the first 2 months I️ had to keep this relationship very secret. But We’ve been getting more and more serious so I️ ended up telling my mom that she’s trans and what not. I️ can’t say anything about escorting lmao. But my mom supports it and it’s just now I️ have to still hide it from the rest of my family even though I️ practically live with her. I️ haven’t even been home in 4 weeks. I️ can tell she really likes me back because of many things. She has a really high guard because of past relationships so it’s still sketchy now and then but for the first 2-3 months she’d blow me off a lot because she’s afraid to get attached to me because she doesn’t wanna get hurt anymore which I️ completely understand. One thing is that never, not once in any of her relationships had she brought a man back to her Mom.And I️ was the first guy she ever did that too. The reason she escorts is because it’s good money #1. But secondly, she comes from a really small, broken down town close to Mexico. Her dad was terrible and never there so it was just her mom and her brother. They eventually moved to where we are now but her mom has terrible knee pain and can’t work, and her brother is a worthless drunk druggie that doesn’t work either. This is her only family so she obviously doesn’t wanna lose them so she does this to pay her own bills, AND support her mom and brother. It’s a huge struggle. They don’t contribute or appreciate any of it and only ask for more and more. Recently she just bought a mobile home because her mom and brothers apartment lease ended so they needed a home and she got a trailer for the 3 of them even though she still pays for her other place because of escorting. That’s a lot of bills. So now I’m here pretty much living with her, her mom and her brother in this mobile home that needs a looott of work. I️ recently stopped doing meth so I’m able to budget much better and I’m able to help her out with her expenses even though it’s not enough because I only make $8.50 an hour and I work 7-10 hours, 5 days a week. It’s just so hard because I love this woman, she loves me back, and we recently just got sober together because on Halloween night we just both hit a low rock bottom which is another story. But after Halloween, we moved into the mobile home, got all situated and she’s barely been working at all, which I’m glad about obviously. I’ve been helping out a lot with her rent and stuff but lately she’s been declining my money saying she doesn’t wanna be taking advantage of me and she wants me for me, not my money. So she’s picking up her work a little bit to pay bills and for Home fix up. Idc what she says but im still gonna help with expenses lol. But the thing is, I️ need a lot more income than what I get, because between bills and food and what not, I’m about broke by my next paycheck. She tells me that if I️ were to move in and we get her mom and brother to start working or else kick them out, that she’ll stop escorting, which I️ believe, but she needs time to be able to trust that I’m legit and everything before she completely relies on me. Because it’s all on her right now so she doesn’t wanna be shit out of luck. So now I’m getting to the point where I’m sick of her doing this to herself because it’s an endless cycle of her ending up broke and needing to do it more, that I️ feel I️ should just do it myself outside of my work to make extra money to help so I️ can save up and have a good stash to keep adding too. It’ll break this vicious cycle I️ feel, and I️ hate to see put herself so low because I️ love her. I️ want to spend my life with her and she’s even at the age to start settling down which she explains to me. That’s another concern of hers is that I’m gonna change and get older and wanna party and stuff while she’s gonna wanna be relaxing and at home. But I️ tell her I’ve never been the type of person to go out and party. I’m a home body. I’d be the happiest guy ever to settle down with her and make a good life where she works at a normal job while I️ work my way up in construction. I️ know I’m not gonna change. It’s just a real rough path right now so I’m considering this. sorry for wall of txt but I️ need opinions. All my mom knows is that she’s older and she’s trans but she supports it and she’s gonna meet her this week. It’s a great relationship other than the escort thing. We help each other better ourselves in a lot of ways, and this is a big step I️ want to help her take. So if I️ do this temporarily I️ think it’ll help. Any feedback or advice? Maybe even similar experiences?",13Nov2017,1

256,"Hallo Leute!

So, i'm 19 and i work at a call center (Comcast). It's been only 2 months and a half, and i already hate my job. I already worked previously at one, but quit because it's just terrible. You have 9-10 hours shifts for 6 days a week. You can only rest either tuesdays or fridays, in there you can't have a book, your phone, not even any kind of paper, you can't speak with your workmates, you have a supervisor yelling at you all day for not selling TV service to 70-year old people that call in just to yell at you because their internet is slow, or sometimes because their computer doesn't even turn on. This month has been the worst, i really don't want to work there anymore. The only reason i, and pretty much 90% of the people there, keep this job, is because it's one of the highest paying jobs in the country. I earn twice the minimum wage, which is pretty good in this country where even professionals struggle to earn more than a minimum wage (Yep, third world sucks), but it's taking the life out of me. I had to postpone college and won't be back until next february. I'm not living alone anymore, i live with my family, but i don't hace any time and i barely see them. I see my friends once a week. I didn't go to work this weekend, i was really stressed out, of course i had to get a medical note, or i would be fired. I'm on my way to work now, but i don't want to. I can get another job, one i would enjoy, or at least a 9-5 where i can see my family, rest weekends, see my gf, my Friends and so. The thing is that if i do change my job, most probably i would earn the minimum wage. Don't know if it's worth giving my life up for a good salary or earn way less, but being happier and healthier. What would you do? What should i do?

My dream to become a poly-extreme athlete and adventurer seems so out of reach.. and there have been times where I’ve tried to forget about this dream and just give in to ‘the system’. But I’m at a point now, financially, mentally and spiritually where I️ am ready to drop everything and GO. I’ve planned for years to do this but only in bits and pieces..  any advice?

273,"I'll try and keep this as short as possible, but keeping any info I feel might be relevant.

I'm a medical student, and was offered a place by a combination of friends and acquaintance (all study medical and have worked with in the past). They need someone to fill the empty room so they don't have to pay for the unoccupied room. I place a single condition: I get the room with the biggest table to set up my rig as the rest of them have macbooks. They promise it will be so (evidence on facbook messenger). Then I get told by the girls that the 4th person that dropped out doesn't have the money to cover the agency's check-out fee, claiming I should be the one responsible, and that the girls will cover 2/5ths, that I'll get paid back by the guy, and that the agency won't release the keys to any of us until it's paid. Not much of a choice as it would start to affect our study without a place to live. So I cover it, with the promise it will be paid back before the end of the year. Get to the house only to find the girls have moved into the 3 largest rooms, leaving me with one less than half the size. I get pissed, show them their promise, followed by the discovery that they are 3 of the 7 deadly sins. The first, Greed, says she doesn't feel like/want to switch rooms. Pride tells me I should be grateful I even found a place (which isn't true - I have autism and get guaranteed places on campus if I want). Sloth buries her head in the sand in her room. The agency says they don't deal with social disputes, the guy who I lent the money hasn't responded about anything for weeks, the girls refuse to negotiate on rent as I'm currently paying the same as them.

And the rest of the agency's snake-oil tactics: even general requests such as to fix the radiators get the response 'the landlord hires his own guys, and it's his house, so we can't do anything unless he replies'. The catch? He has never replied. So the agency throws their hands up in the air saying they can't do anything, meanwhile the landlord doesn't respond as he just keeps raking in our money. And of course we can't stop paying to catch his attention because then we'd be breaking the law and the agreement now wouldn't we? Also in the pile of papers with the tenancy agreement, a part says issues should be fixed within 3-5 working days. Agency says that's just a cover thing that isn't actually part of the agreement.

So what should I do? Should I move out but have to pay another £300 to the agency and whatever other surprise fees they're obviously going to spring on me, also risking the noise first year students make on campus/complete strangers in a house in town? Should I send copies of the messages to their relatives/local Imam? Should I stay and keep paying the same rent for less room that I'm in more than double the time they're in the house, and literally need more?",13Nov2017,1

275,"Hello.

A small intro: I'm a 22 year old that graduated college with an Associate of Arts in Conputer Science. Recently, my mom passed away and my stepfather kicked me out of his house (my real father died when I was six) , so I'm now forced to reside with my stubbon and inconsiderate brother due to a hurricane driving me out of the state I lived in for 10 years. My hobbys lie mostly in digital illustration, coding, and video games. I'm seeking to finish my education and get a bachelors degree as well as find a good job so I can pay my bills and move out of my brother's house. I also have autism.


Right now, I feel a large amount of anguish, depression, and hopelessnes with my everyday life. I don't find my brother's house to be a safe place because I'm always put on the spot for every little thing I don't do correctly, as well as not being able to get a job immediately. (He's really impatient) I don't find outside of my house to be a safe place either, due to the reckless drivers and time limit that I have to relax in one area. 

Without a mom to give me even the smallest amount of comfort, and without my own living space to take life slowly in, my life just feels miserable and rushed. I spend a lot of my time crying and feeling like there's no chance for me to get to my goal. I haven't been able to smile because I was forcefully kicked out of my comfort zone, and I don't have any desire to eat, sleep, or enjoy myself anymore. No jobs have come back to me for interviews, and I sense that I'll be kicked out my brother's house for not having one anytime soon.

Is there a point of even trying to look for a safe place anymore? Or should I just accept that this is what my life will be for the rest of my years? My heart just feels empty thinking about how I don't have parents to rely on and family members who think very little of me.",13Nov2017,8

277,"I have been working in a new team for about 6 months now. My small department merged with a larger department. A short while after joining my department a colleague I don’t particularly like joined our team. I ended up being sat next to him much to my disgust.

I don’t like him because he has a sense entitlement, he has no social skills, he’s loud and crass. I thought this was well known so I was really shocked when he got the job to move to my team. 

He’s been living up to his name for sure. He keeps making generalisations about women and when I was trying to teach him the job he ignored everything I said. I mentioned him ignoring me to my supervisor who hasn’t really done anything ably it. I mentioned it again and my supervisor again and he asked me what I did to resolve the issue. I just said I didn’t know to approach the subject. I think it is down to my supervisor to resolve this anyway surely? 

He has irritated me the whole time he has been there but what I really don’t like is how he speaks to our clients. He speaks to them like dirt from the beginning of the phone call to the end. He’s also patronising and gets obviously frustrated at them. He sighs down the phone and one colleague told me he has transferred the phone call to her before and she had to deal with an angry client. All caused by his attitude. 

My question is this. Should I mention this to my supervisor? My fear is is that because I have already complained about him he will think I just telling tales.",13Nov2017,2

279,"Goal:Find passion/ aka permanent career solution. Permanent career defined as something that is satisfying but is also relatively enjoyable to do.
Few careers are particularly enjoyable long term so the goal is to find meaning and then a level of engagement in the career that is satisfying.

I am logical.
I can pull relevant meaning from a statistic easily.

Problems:
-I don't currently know what that is and I am in college. Means I will have 4 years of debt to pay off and that a less than ideal job will make it very difficult to pay it off. I'm already 3 years in so going back now isn't an option(will ""inherit"" 3 years of debt and then won't be able to get an ""ideal"" job defined as able to pay off the debt in a relatively short amount of time). Having 1-2 years left I am pressure prompted to figure out my passion.

The options I see for finding out what my passion are: analyzing myself, trying things. Trying things takes time, energy, money, and transportation. I have little time because I have to work and do college(working to pay for apartment rent). I have little energy because little motivation(not enjoying anything I do). I have no transportation other than uber right now...but I get a car soon. This all led me to go to the analyzing myself route

Analyzing myself is incredibly hard. I'm finding it extremely difficult to observe how I observe because if I'm observing myself then I'm reserving part of my observational skills. In other words, if I'm observing myself...I'm not really observing myself(as part of me is reserved for observing the self). So I could try to observe how I'm observing but that is getting into both an infinite regress and also lunacy. I also can't move past analyzing myself because I'm on a clock.

So I'm logical-&gt; goes to check logical careers.

I don't like the idea of being a mathematician. The reasoning for this(and it will be stereotyped, but the reason I include it is for the value that comes from why I don't like the idea of it rather than the discussion of the reality of it), is because I don't like proving things for the sake of proving them. An example would be an online website that has math problems that are challenging and unsolved but need solving. I would never do this...I see little/no value in solving something for the sake of solving it. This means either I don't like the process of solving things, or solving it alone is not enough(it needs to have meaning as well because solving in and of itself is not enjoyable enough).

I don't tend to learn things on my own unless there is a need to learn it(i.e. the information/understanding that results from the learning is necessary for getting something I want). I am not particularly curious about anything currently(perception of no value to come from being curious towards anything mabye? Depression sometimes has faulty thinking).

As I analyze myself I feel increasingly lost. I don't want to ask other people about it because it seems very needy(asking someone to analyze you or help you figure out what you like) and it's a downer topic(I have no passion). Other people would at least be able to verify what I think, but being isolated during this process combined with me questioning my own conclusions makes it so I barely know anything about myself and feel increasingly like I'll never be able to solve this problem in time/move on in life. I am also surrounded by people that only really know me well during this state, they have little access to who I was before self analysis to solve this problem began.

Have a hard time connecting with others now because I have no passion/interests therefore I have little to talk about. Nothing going on in my life and having nothing to say leads to social anxiety in one on one situations as well as devaluing myself because fear of friends abandoning our friendship(no longer exciting/fun because of how I am right now). Because of this I can't tell/remember if I've always been kind of socially awkward or if it's only a recent thing. Have I always had little to say?


The last thing I was interested in was determinism. Since then my only interest/thing that gets me excited is when I perceive that doing something will solve the passion problem. I once read an entire book by a philosopher on boredom in like 5 hours because I thought it would have the answer lol.

My dad says I never had any dream careers when I was young and I never got really excited about that much either, so looking to my childhood seems like a dead end.

I can't tell if I'm asking for too much. Mabye my ""dream"" part of my dream job is fantastic thinking. It's not realistic mabye.

I can answer more questions about myself as needed.",13Nov2017,2
280,"I need help to deal with my wife because I am trying to save the marriage for our 2 kids.

The problem has been going on for a few weeks after but reached it's peak today. I run a small-business from which I can come and go since I can manage much of the day-to-day operations from home. This means that when I am home I am often working but do get to spend more time with my kids than in earlier years. So I come in a home just a couple of hours ago and the first thing that my SO tells me is that she clogged the toilet and to unclog it before the kids get here. I love my wife and these things happen, but she has no sense of responsibility for her actions and consistently pushes the hard labor and dirty work on me. I am honestly tired of it Reddit :(

This whole problem started a few months ago after she met some friend's sister who she had an almost immediate connection with. Ever since then, she has been reading feminists articles and claiming that she wants ""more equality"" in our marriage. However, this has turned into me taking out the trash, washing the dishes, unclogging the toilet that SHE clogs up after using it, and moving around all the heavy furniture 2 weeks ago when SHE wanted to paint the living room and the kitchen. That was her  being ""equal"". SHE decided that she wanted to paint, she picked the color ""independently"". she did pay for the materials and pain by herself mind you, but I was the one broght in to move the furniture, fridge, and to remove and re-install the washing machine even though the paint seemed just fine to me to everyone else in the house but her. 

I cannot even really mention what this has done to our sex life, but it has become an absolute disaster. She used to be  very submissive and ""agreeable"" but has now turrned our sex life into a game where she wins by making me upset or by seeing me unhappy. Meaning that if I come in wanting to sex and am in a good mood, she makes it a point to tell me that she is not ""an object"" and that she is not in the mood. And if I am doing something else, she comes in, starts trying to get things going, but when I tell her that I need to finish this work or whatever I am doing she gets completely furious and offended! Not only that, but because of this, I started watching porn a few months back, and was brought into our room behind closed doors when she found out, where I was completely shamed, humiliated and insulted! She called me a ""pervert"", told me that I should be ashamed of myself, and that she was ashmed to have me for a husband. No lie Reddit, I almost cried when that happened but I tried to hold back the tears until she left. It hurt. It really hurt :(

What can I do in this situation? I love my wife and I feel that she is still somewhere underneath all this that has happened, but I can't seem to find her or reach her. My kids mean the world to me and divorce isn't an option because of it. I want to make things work but I feel so used and humiliated that I just can't. I just can't.",13Nov2017,3
281,"I've experienced nightmares intermittently for the past couple of years normally attribute them to anxiety or work stress and they're fairly intense but over basically as soon as I wake up, I'm very used to being able to snap myself back to reality pretty quickly.
It's 6am and all night I've been having these short dreams where everything feels normal like I've just woken up in my house and then out of nowhere I get this sense of dread, or being chased and my whole body just goes numb, like someone's thrown a lead blanket on me and I'll call out for my boyfriend but I can't get enough air in to make even a squeak, then it could honestly be thirty seconds or thirty years but if I struggle enough I'll wake up enough to realise I'm in bed.

I have no problem whatsoever being respectful to the religion and not showing up like an idiot in a pair of booty shorts but some of the things we have to adhere to are just plain sexist (all girls).

286,"I'll try not to write a million words on the backstory, but here is the situation I'm in. My older sister (25 to my 23) has always struggled with adjusting to certain norms and expectations. It's gone from being something that I was always kind of worried about to something that is directly effecting my family, my relationship with her, and her relationship with my parents. I've been staying with her for the past few weeks and here is where it's at:
1. She is incredibly addicted to marijuana. The first thing she does when she wakes up is smoke. The last thing she does before she goes to sleep is smoke. Sometimes she'll wake up in the middle of the night to get high before going back to sleep.
2. She has no work ethic. Her days are spent sleeping A LOT (yesterday was 14 hours). She works maybe 15 hours a week, all of the money she earns goest to pot/fast food. She has a goal of a specific, competitive career, but it's clear she won't get anywhere in her field with her current work ethic. She is not doing anything legitimate to advance her career.
3. She has no semblance of independence. My dad supports her 100%. Rent, food, anything you can think of. She calls him asking for money more than once a week. Much of this goes to buying marijuana. He is in complete denial about what he is paying for; she emotionally abuses him to get his money. 
There are a lot more specific things that I'm worried about but those are the big three, many smaller issues stem from these. I don't know what to do. She is a very emotional and volatile person. I know that her roommate and former best friend has tried to talk to her about this, and they now hate each other to the point of not speaking. She is moving out soon. I'm worried if I try to talk to her about this the same will happen to us. But I don't know how much longer I can sit by and watch this. I want to talk to my dad about it, but I know if I do it will get back to her and then I'll just seem petty in that I didn't talk to her directly.

307,"I'll try to make a short summary to avoid making a long thread.
I'm a young guy, 22 year old guy living in Denmark. I'm studying architecture design and construction at Uni. I enjoy Bouldering(climbing), Mountainbiking, running, swimming just in generel doing exercise  and tries to make most out of life.

Before any of this makes sense I have to tell you about my past and relationship with my parents.

I grew up as the nerdy kid who always got beat up and never had any friends before 10th grade. I spend most of my childhood playing videogames avoiding people and hoping I would get rescued from this terrible world. But yeah, there's a reason stories are called fairy tails. My younger brother was the complete opposite. He was popular, became a up-coming soccerplayer noticed by an agent or something, my dad was the proudest man in our hometown. He kept telling me to be more like my brother which meant I was growing up in my brothers shadow. My dad was ashamed of me and I knew it deep down, but at the time sports didn't interest me.

When I finally graduated high school, my parents forced me to attend a year in boarding school, hoping it would help me, but it only got worse. I was being metally ripped apart by my fellow students. They would destroy my things, piss in my bed, tell me how useless I was and should kill myself. I told my parents to pull me out, but they refused and ensured me it was nesesarry for me to grow and improve. I cried almost every night and hated everything. At the end of the year, I finally realized the effect of running and I had my first running kick. I started running more often and in the end every day. The burning feeling in my lungs and dopamin was the highlight of the day. I stopped paying attention in class and thought about running instead. I wanted to improve and show everyone that I was more then what the claimed me to be. I decided "" I've always tried to improve myself to get people and my parents recognition""

After boarding school, I decided to apply for upper secondary school so I could later apply for Uni. My dad was against it the second I mentioned it, because he wanted me to become a carpenter instead. But I refused and started studying. Doing those 3 years I made REAL friends for the first time in my life. I started playing music, hanging out and drink a few beers talking about philosophical things all night. I love it. I avoided coming home as much as possible and started living at friends. When I graduated, my grandparents and mom was telling me how proud they were, but deep down the words didn't mean anythying to me. On the graduationday my dad looked me in the eyes and told me I had wasted my time and expected me to start working in his company anyway. At first I was heartbroken, but I realized at the same time, it was already broken. After the celebration week, I was told to come work at his place or I would get kicked out. My mom was angry and refused, but I packed my shit and left. I've been living on my own since I was 19. I applied for Uni half a year later and I've studying for 2 years now.

Last christmas eve I got into a fight with my brother and I ended up kicking him out of my car leaving him on the road at night. 3 month later my parents get contacted by a drug dealer telling them my brother owned him 150k because he started doing cocaine and he would start clipping off his fingers for each 10k he owned him. Ever since that my parents have never trusted my brother and he's a mess. He's not my brother I use to know. He's a junky and whole different person and he's tearing my parents apart. The worst part is I was told be started doing the coke on christmas eve the night I left him on the road. So yeah.. I'm blaming myself for ""killing"" my brother everyday..

Now that you read a short summary of my life, I can finally start writing about the problem.

The past year have been a living nightmare for me. It's the worst I've ever felt in my entire life and I litteraly wake up every morning, I wishing someone would sliced my throat in my sleep, so I don't have to wake up. Every time my heart beats it feels like it pumps deadly venom through my body, but I can't die for some reason. I don't find pleasure in anything, everything is gray for me and I can't feel anything.

I got in a accident a few weeks ago and hurt my back. I have constant back pain when I walk and I can't do any exercise at the moment. My doctor keeps giving me medicin, telling me it'll pas but I'm affraid, I might have injured my spine tbh. I opened up my heart 2 month ago for the first time to a girl and now she's avoding me, My friends from upper high school is moving on in their life and so I don't have anyone to socialze with, My parents don't care about my injury (Literally no one does), and I still keep blaming myself for my brothers drug abuse. - I've always been alone and I'm fine with it, but now that I'm injured like this I feel vulnerable for the first time in my life and I can't focus on my studies because of all the things happening.

All my life, the univers has thrown shit in my face, but lately I started to give up. I don't believe in myself anymore, I stopped believeing in a brighter future. I've been considering suicide the last few month, I really can't see any reason to keep fighting when nothing good ever happens to me or Do the things that makes me happy anymore.

If you're still reading this, let me thank you. When I started thinking back and write about my past doing Boarding school I started crying. It's been necesarry to take break because of all the emotions running through my body.

I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm starting to give up.",13Nov2017,30
308,"I have two equally close friends. I value both immensely. But Friend A is jealous and doesn't like Friend B, and given that view. Friend B doesn't like Friend A. 

Over the summer, I was down a bit, and while I was on the phone with Friend A, my Dad suddenly offered a two week trip to Europe. Awesome. Except Friend B and I had spent weeks talking about going as well. Impossible situation, can't take both, and I handled it poorly by not even telling Friend B until I was in Amsterdam. The optics looked awful. He felt very hurt and betrayed that I had gone without him. I apologize profusely and say I'll make it up to Friend B. Why don't you come and help me move in now in the summer and the New Year's week later on. It gets me off of really thin ice.

Anyways, last Monday, friend A suddenly calls me out of the blue and says: ""Surprise! I didn't want you to be alone for New Year's so I saved up and bought a really expensive plane ticket to come and be with you."" By the time he tells me this, said plane ticket is non-refundable. Oh. Fudge. This. Is. Bad.

On Wednesday, Friend B calls to finalize dates so he can get his plane ticket booked. I tell him the news. He's understandably pissed, crushed, and thinks I'm choosing favorites. Right now, he wants nothing to do with me. I don't blame him.

I need to find some way to salvage the situation and save face with everyone. Problem is, that I can't see a way to fix things without having Friend A waste money in airfare or Friend B get emotionally crushed, and there's not another week long window for 6 months. This isn't Friend B's fault, but right now he's the one getting screwed over, which is disgusting.",13Nov2017,2

311,"Short back story - I bought my house on a rural street about three years ago. I've always noticed an abnormal amount of trash collecting in front of my house. Not in my yard, but right across the street (still technically my property). There are no houses there. It's basically just an overgrown field with a few trees. It's on the same side of the street as my mailbox so I can see the trash when I get my mail. I try to pick up what I can. 

We aren't talking boat loads of trash. I'm talking a few mcdonalds bags, beer and soda cans, one time I found an entire shopping bag full of empty cigarette packs. I never knew if someone was intentionally littering here or it was just an area where all the windblown trash from the street would naturally collect. 

So anyway, i'm doing my dishes the other morning looking out my window and I see a truck drive by and throw a mcdonalds bag out of his window right into that same area! I recognized the truck. Green, lifted diesel with a big exhaust stack in the bed. I knew I had seen it around. 

Sure enough I drive down my road the next day and see the exact same truck parked in one of my neighbors driveways. 

So what do I do now? The obvious response is to go confront the neighbor, but I have a couple reservations. 

My idea would be to very kindly confront him and basically say, ""look i'm not even mad, I don't want any problems, I would just appreciate it if you would stop throwing trash in front of my house"". My concern is that he wouldn't take it well and he'd have this vendetta against me. I'm still kind of the new guy on the street and I feel like all of my neighbors are either related or close. If I have an issue with one, I could have an issue with all of them. Secondly, his house is definitely the ""dirt bag"" house of the street. I mean if he's the kind of guy that just throws trash wherever he wants, I don't think he has the highest moral standards. I live alone and am gone most of everyday. If he wanted to vandalize my house or something it would be very easy to do. I just have no idea how he would react to being confronted and I don't want to constantly worry that someones going to mess with me. 

The other option would be to anonymously report him to the police. But would this really do anything? Would they even bother talking to him? Would he know it was me anyway because it happened right in front of my house?

Or I could just ignore it. But I really have a problem with littering and it just seems wrong to let it go.

314,"My friend and I have known each other for about 4 years now. We’re close and cool with each other and we’re always very supportive of each other. When I came out 2 years ago, he was there for me, and when his ex was making him extremely depressed, I was there for him. We always mess around and I always flirt with him jokingly, because I’m flirty and touchy feely with all my friends. So now he’s in a semi long distance relationship with this girl he’s known for a while. I’ve met her and we’ve all hung out, and she’s very sweet. She lives in our area but goes to school out of state. A lot of times we hang out, I end up giving him a massage, because he’s tense and I’m good at them. I give most of my friends massages, and they never turn sexual or anything. Play games, massage, watch a TV show, etc..

This time however, it was a little different. We were hanging out and after some games I told him get on the bed because I already know he’s stiff as a board. Something I noticed differently was that he wasn’t wearing a shirt under his sweater, but I didn’t think anything of it. I massaged his back first and then the back of his legs. I asked him to change into shorts cuz his sweats made it hard to massage his thighs, so he did because the knots in his inner thighs were ridiculous. He flipped over and I massaged his front and then massaged the front of his legs. As I was working on his inner thighs, he said he felt embarrassed, and I asked why. He said he was getting a boner, and I told him not to worry about it, it’s normal. Especially since it’s his inner thighs and I was slightly in his underwear, lightly brushing against his dick and balls. But I mean this wasn’t the first time, so I didn’t think much of it, and I’m not coy about that kind of stuff.

As I massaged him, he then asked me how I felt about his bicuriousness, because he’s told me that before. I told him that’s perfectly normal, and asked if he told his girlfriend. He said he did and I honestly forgot what he said, but essentially she was pretty dismissive about it. Then he asked how I felt if we messed around. I told him honestly that I rather him try gay stuff with me then some random person, because who knows if they have STDs or if they’re crazy. And I told him it wouldn’t be full blown sex, just a blowjob, but suggested that maybe he could talk it over with his girlfriend, and at most that night I would just give him a handy.

He said man fuck it and took his shorts off and I blew and swallowed him. Afterwords he felt nervous because he doesn’t want his girl to know. I told him you were just trying to figure stuff out, and honestly I didn’t think it was cheating. He’s not actively looking for things to fuck, things just kinda happened. He asked if this was my intention and I said no, I thought I was just gonna hang like always. I asked he same and he said no. So after talking, he felt better. He said he wouldn’t do it again unless he’s single and I agreed. We are still super cool, but I’m sure he still feels a little nervous and I’m starting to. He said he enjoyed it but he just couldn’t see himself with a man, and I mean that’s fine. It’s not like I’m in love with the guy, we just ended up doing this. Maybe it was building up to that point, idk.

So I guess I’m just asking for thoughts about my friend and this situation.

TL;DR: I blew my straight friend while we were hanging because he was bicurious. We’re both cool with each other but still feel nervous about the whole thing because he has a girl.",13Nov2017,1

I just don't feel anything. I don't feel happy, sad, frustrated, scared.

1. I hate making referrals, I suck at it and I feel forced to introduce products I don't feel are necessary. My performance rate is low and we get recognized based on the number of people we get.
2. A few people got fired from cash shortage and I have cash imbalances here and there but enough to get me in trouble. I do make so many mistakes all the time and I get so anxious dealing with a lot of cash. One of these days I might make a mistake and I might get blackballed from future employers
3. I get yelled at all the time and people are just mean. I know it happens in every job out there but it just feels demeaning most of the time.
4. My superiors tell me that I should get used to it because I'll be facing more difficult clients when I become a lawyer but I have been an administrative assistant and I feel much more confident dealing with clients when I know I can actually help.

I want to quit already but I feel like all my other options are risky. I already tried to look for other jobs that would given me leniency with schedule but I can't find anything else that's consistent work and would offer me only part time. 

I am thinking of either
1.  Becoming an online ESL teacher (VIPKID) making at least 1700 a month while doing Uber eats on the side ( flexibility in schedule but afraid of inconsistent pay)
2. Applying for behavioral technician 14/hr and require driving from house to house. ( also afraid of inconsistent pay) I have a bachelors in psychology and it's virtually impossible to find a job here in Las Vegas.

330,"I am so overwhelmed with this right now and would be so grateful for any advice I can get.

I've always had a sensitivity around office politics and feeling taken advantage of.  I have worked hard and received nothing but raving reviews in my career so far (~7 years after finishing masters).  I tend to feel like being competent as well as friendly/non-confrontational invites the kinds of interactions that I struggle with.

Probably the most extreme example is putting together a proposal to create a new department in my area of expertise- everyone was really excited about it (it's a booming field), and when my boss announced it at a company meeting they didn't mention my name at all and appointed someone else as lead who had no knowledge or experience (in fact, I was training him).  I had been hired to introduce the field and single-handedly got everything up and running, and I was so upset I quit.  My boss begged me not to, and I heard from ex-colleagues that the whole thing fell apart after I'd gone.

Lately at my current position, I feel like I'm in a team of people who aren't sure what they are doing and are super insecure.  It's a huge company that pays a lot, the work we do is kind of open-ended and fluffy, and we don't have the sponsorship from above to make it work very effectively.  I've gotten the sense that some of these people are freaking out and putting a lot of effort into giving the impression they know exactly what they are doing.  This includes being hyper critical of other people/teams, talking down to others, talking about how amazing they are, etc.  Recently I've had a senior colleague use my format for some work, acting like she was overseeing something I did on my own to take credit, and more, all the while being critical of things I am doing (e.g. ""I want to take a look at your format for XYZ and talk about reorganizing it"", ""I suggest you start doing XYZ"") both directly and in front of other people.  Very, very often these directives are combined with glaring mistakes or self-contradictions which drives me extra nuts.  

She and my boss are super tight, and I watched them both tear down a colleague who was excited to show them something he built (they didn't even spare a second to try and understand what it was he built, he's just on their bad side lately) and he was absolutely floored.  I've been able to dodge being on their ""bad side"" myself by doing good work and helping move their agendas forward, but I feel like after two years they're both comfortable and overstepping some boundaries and I'm not reacting well to it, and it's kind of spiraling.  I've tried to talk to them about certain things before with our work culture or team dynamics that I wanted to try a different approach for (e.g. gathering details before committing to projects), but colleague often outright says I'm just complaining and everything is just fine, and boss tries for a bit and then just ditches it and gets annoyed I still have thoughts or feelings around it.

It really came to a head for me today when I tried to talk to the director that is the counter-part of my boss (and I recently interviewed for a position on his team and will have an update when budgets are set for next year).  I was asking him a specific question about a project that came up that relates to a member of his team, and he went off on a tangent about something totally irrelevant to what I wanted to talk about for 45 minutes.  It really felt like he was latching onto something random and vaguely related, and explaining it as if he knew all the answers to this question I didn't even ask and actually already had answers to.

I am SO frustrated.  I probably sound like a super egotistical person, but I'm really letting it all out right now when usually I tend to question myself and think well of others until given major reason not to.  I just feel like I'm seeing a pattern that being competent and very friendly results in a lot of people wanting to take advantage of it and/or feeling threatened and trying to impose authority.

MY QUESTION

I wish this were as easy as telling me to get a new job, but the thing that scares me is that I have had several jobs and ran into similar issues with most of them.  This one might be especially bad, because in the past I've sometimes had an advocate on my side in leadership, but right now I don't feel like I have that at all.  I'm thinking that getting another job is necessary no matter what, but I am also wanting to know if other people have had this experience before, and I'm looking for advice on how to deal with these kinds of dynamics in general.  

Do you guys have any thoughts?

332,"So I had a lower back injury since April. With some rest in the summer it healed a little, but then when school started up in September, I had to stop resting because volleyball started. The thing is playing again didn't worsen my injury, moving around helped it a little to be honest, and now I can lift stuff (stated to deadlift again) and I can move around without pain. I just have to heat it at night , and even then it barely helps. My back has been in the same condition now for about two months, rest and exercise not really affecting it at all. It doesn't hurt or hinder me, but I definitely won't be limboing anytime soon and bending it in certain ways hurt. 

So my question is, should I just rest for a few months, maybe even longer with the hope and risk of fully healing it? Or should I keep playing sports and working out with keeping my condition the same? 
Because I'm not getting any worse right now, but I also don't wanna have a hurt back for the rest of my life and I'm worried that I will have chronic back pain forever and I don't want that... However resting for 3 months in the summer didn't really do anything either. (With physio for two months too... Didn't really help..) 

Sorry for the long read. 
TL:DR, hurt back, rest and exercise don't affect my condition, wondering if I should risk not exercising for a few months and hope it heals, or just accept it hurts right now and play my high school sports for my last year with the hope I can heal it after (and not have back pain forever) ",13Nov2017,2

I've known her for a few years now. We've always gotten along and been friendly with each other but nothing beyond that. She's definitely very attractive but I've never really been interested in her in that way at all. 

Fast forward to this year and I'm a senior in high school. She's in a handful of my classes this year so I've seen and talked to her more but again, I'm not really interested in being anything more than friends. 

So a few days ago I get a message from her on snapchat asking if I wanna hang out sometime and work on art (we share art together). I said that it sounds like fun and she seemed pretty excited. We didn't set a date or anything, we just left it at that. That's a little weird, I thought, but whatever, it's nice to get to know people better right?

But today when I got home from school I got another snapchat from her, a video this time. It was a short video of her looking seductive and licking her lips with the message ""I want you steveeeeeee"" (not my real name). Hooooly shit I thought. It doesn't get more obvious than that. 

So some context: I've never been with a girl in anyway before (never kissed a girl, had a gf, etc.). Also, this girl is a little... loose... to put it gently. She's been known to send dudes nudes, cheat on her boyfriend, etc. Even currently I'm pretty sure she has a boyfriend. 

So what do I do? I obviously wouldn't mind getting a bj or something... but I'm worried that she might have an STD from being with so many guys. Am I overthinking this? Should I just go for it?

342,"Hey, guys.

So, I currently work for a pretty well esteemed company that has given me a tonne of experience. It does not pay that well, but sounds fantastic on paper, as I work directly with some very famous clients. The work, however, has been getting too intense for me. I'm working 11 hour days with literally every minute accounted for, and every day ends at a different time which is messing with my sleep patterns. I recently got an interview for a job where they sound very impressed with my skills, however it is a little bit out of my skillset, though nothing I couldn't learn.

The issue is this. It pays much more and would give me incredible experience, but only goes for a year.

So, here's the situation: I've known this girl since Year 7 (since we were 11, for anyone who doesn't understand the British school system). We've been mostly friends for most of that time, interacting through lessons and getting involved with school performances. Unfortunately, we don't share any lessons any more, and only briefly see each other through some rehearsals for the latest performance, and during break times and lunchtimes. However, I've still developed feelings for her, and have tried to be subtle about it, though I sometimes can't help but look at her (from a distance). I'm almost too nervous to talk when I'm around her, let alone tell her how I feel. One of my worries is that I've liked her before, and both times she hasn't felt the same way. I have a suspicion that it will be the same this time, but I still feel I need to try, in the tiniest chance she may like me enough to say yes to a date...

I have created a gofundme page for a good friend of mine and his family. 

What i wanted advice on, was when would be the best time to share the page i have created with my network? I will be posting it on facebook as well as sending personal emails/messages within his and my own network. I really want this go fund me to have a big of an impact as possible so I am trying to launch it with some strategy in mind.

A short backstory:
As a mother of 6, His mother has been battling dementia for the last 10 years and more recently her health has become very unstable. As she was the sole financial provider the family they are struggling to provide the medication/care she requires immediately. This is care the hospital/government can no longer provide and it is very costly especially considering their financial troubles.

I thought a Sunday evening would work best as a time to launch it, as it is a very family oriented time of the week and people usually have the time. It would give them a chance to take a look at the page and not simply scan over or miss it..

I want to launch it ASAP as it is help they need immediately. What I wanted to know was what others thought about this. Is it worth to wait a whole week to post on a Sunday? or would another evening during the week be just as effective?

Would really appreciate any insight on this topic, based on experience/knowledge etc..
Thanks in advance!",13Nov2017,2
351,"Long story short(still somewhat Long actually), I've been moving around for most of my life, most recently from London(where I was for 2 years) to Osaka.

Now life have been okay, not smashing great but decent in Osaka and I've recently received offer to relocate back to London. 

Now this sounds great since while I have not done everything I wanted to do in Japan I was getting kind of bored here anyway and returning to something familiar(and having access to cheap-ish Europe travel again) is definitely a welcome change. 

That said I do wonder if I should just stop, reevaluate and give myself more time to find stability here since all the moving around I have done in the past decade have definitely taken its toll on me. I make friends easily enough but found it hard to commit to relationships or anything else since I'm always in the mindset of ""I might be moving again, I don't want to get too attached"". Staying a year or two longer might help me with these issues and find some sense of belonging idk.

But then again I've never been the type to hold myself back from opportunities(and this job offer is definitely a great one) but I have had these unsatisfying feelings since the last few big moves now and I wonder if I owe myself some time to just stay a bit longer at the cost of the opportunity to sort myself out before I pack my bags again.

356,"using a throwaway since he knows my account

My boyfriend [17] and I [19] have been dating for about 3 months. It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions. We’ve been friends for maybe a year or less and he never seemed like the guy he is now. 

The first month was great. We connected instantly when we met, at first I was hesitant to date him but when we started to go on dates I was hooked. I can honestly say I really do love him. We’ve both told each other some really personal stuff in a short period of time. I’m scared that we’re moving too fast but it feels natural. I could see myself staying with him for a long time. 

So within the first couple weeks of us being together he sent me his snapchat password, I can’t remember why but he just said he had nothing to hide so I can go on it anytime. I’ve never had a guy give me his password to anything before so this took me by surprise, and I just went on his snapchat to take pics and post on his story and leave him little messages and stuff like that. Later on he persuaded me to give him my password. Now we just go on each other’s social media accounts all the time. I thought this was normal, but people told me it’s really weird and not healthy for a relationship, but that’s another situation. 

Anytime a guy snaps me or texts me, he takes matters into his own hands and replies to them for me. If a guy hits on me after I post a selfie on snapchat he would just tell them to fuck off or delete them entirely. It kind of annoyed me but I just shrugged it off. 

So fast forward to today. I started texting a guy (we’ll call him N) that messaged me on snapchat. I added him a looong time ago and don’t remember where I met him. But I told him I had a boyfriend and he was respectful and said we could just be friends. He seemed really nice and I wanted to be friends but I knew T (my boyfriend) wouldn’t like that at all. But I just decided hey, I’ll text him every once in a while, there’s no harm in that. I have no plans to cheat or anything but I was going to delete the conversation because I knew T would freak out about it. I hate hiding stuff from him but I don’t know. Am I in the wrong for that?

So fast forward to today, he comes to my house and I forgot to delete the conversation. Basically our convo was N telling me that he’s deployed and I was curious to know when he was going to come back. I know this seems suspicious but I really have no interest in him, or just cheating in general. But I knew from the looks of the texts, T would think I was going to plan on meeting him or something. 

So I was showing T texts from another guy that was talking to me about someone who asked about me at school. (I graduated in May and T is a senior there). He was already mad because he wanted to know who asked about me. Then he exited out of that conversation and saw the unopened text from N. He threw the phone and asked me who it was. I said no one important and deleted the whole conversation. I know this was probably the wrong thing to do but I was scared. So then he got even more mad and snatched my phone away. He sent a text to N saying “don’t ever text my girl again, curse word curse word blah blah”. N sent a text back saying “you don’t want these problems” so you can imagine T’s outrage. He pulled out his phone and tried to take a picture of his number. 

I forgot to mention that before all of this, he was already in a mood. I was talking to him about how clean my room was and how happy I was that I got everything organized. He always makes these jokes about anything that I own, if I received it from another guy, he would throw it away. So I showed him this batman inflatable thing and he was saying “yeah that’s definitely from another guy” and threw it outside of my room. Then he tried to take all of my hats and throw them and I stood in front of the door. He kept pulling me by my shirt and throwing me on the bed and choking me, which he does a lot in a joking way.  I’ll get to that later. 

So anyways, I tried to take my phone away from him so he couldn’t take a picture. We went in circles for at least 2 minutes, with him grabbing my clothes, shoving me, and at one point he pinned me to the bed and choked me until I felt dizzy and tingly. He finally took the picture and left, storming out of my house. I have a lot of scratches and bruises now, and I just stood there in a daze for a few minutes and watched him leave. 

So I know what you’re thinking; any girl in their right mind would leave a guy like this right away. But I can’t help but feel it’s my fault he’s like this. 

This is kind of NSFW and embarrassing to talk about but I think it’s worth mentioning that I’m really kinky and he knows this. I enjoy being choked and dominated while we’re having sex, but I know it’s not okay to do it outside of our sexual lives. But I don’t know if he knows this. Maybe he thinks that I enjoy being shoved around and choked even when we’re not being sexual? I never really thought twice about him choking me playfully at random places, but today he did it out of anger, and it scared me. It was the first time I felt like I was going to pass out. I didn’t really like being pushed and shoved so much. Usually I wouldn’t mind it but he did it so much I was getting upset, along with the idea that he doesn’t trust me. 

He hasn’t texted me and it’s been an hour since the situation happened. I want to apologize for deleting the conversation and trying to stop him but I know he’ll jump straight to me cheating on him, and I feel guilty. I don’t want to lose him, I really do love him and I want this to work but I don’t know how we can fix this and our communication problems. Thanks for any help.

368,"Here's the story:

We were at mutual friend's birthday party, drank some, smoked some, nothing out of the ordinary. Then two of my friends (let's call them Ant and Bee) and I decided to hotbox in a car, so we did that and it started out pretty normal, with topics you could expect from semi-drunk and high people.

After a while Ant starts acting kind of frustrated and we ask what's going on. He says it's because he can't speak English as well as Bee and I, (which is true - none of us are native English speakers, but we are at different levels). We start giving him advice as to how to overcome that conversational frustration and tell him to not worry about it, but then the shit kind of hit the fan. 

He starts going on about how he feels inferior to us for that reason and ends up mentioning how he's afraid my wife will hate him. We're all close friends, nothing suspicious at all though - that I'm sure of, as much as I can be of course. On a side note, my wife is really one of the most patient people I know and I don't think she's ever gone beyond ""strong dislike"" - what would cause him to think she'd come to hate him is beyond me.

Continuing: Bee and I are trying to convince him that of course there's no reason to feel inferior in any way and that all of us were at that point once and it's a matter of practice and experience. And there's certainly no reason to fear my wife's hatred unless he really did something despicable. 

Ant doesn't seem to want to accept that and comes back to how he feels inferior, so we tell him that if he feels that way so strongly even just at that moment then maybe he'd benefit from some counseling. He agrees that perhaps that would be a good idea, but then mentions that he wouldn't go anyway because he doesn't deserve to be helped. 

ohboy.gif

We then decide to try a basic 5xWhy exercise with him and it didn't take long to find out that he feels that he doesn't deserve help because he's a terrible person and any counselor would also judge him as one. He's silently, but steadily crying at this point.

The reason? Earlier this year his alcoholic father died suddenly of a heart attack/stroke and the day before Ant got into a word-fight with him and though/said that he should just die. So now he's completely guilt-ridden and convinced that he's complete scum, almost taking the blame for his father's death. His family of course doesn't think Ant needs any help and he takes their word for it, because they're family.

Apart from that apparently he doesn't trust strangers to help him. Even when confronted with a hypothetical situation where it's his life on the line with a heart operation and it's a close friend/relative and an experienced prodigy heart surgeon, he decided he'd pick the friend/relative. 

At that point the conversation basically lost all rational traction and Bee and I just kind of gave up. No amount of rational arguments would convince him that he needs to ignore his family's judgement and his own opinion of himself and reach out for professional help, which won't judge him and will be able to help him, in contrast to two buddies that aren't really people-persons in the first place. After 2-3 hours we ended the night telling him that we can't make him do anything, but still strongly advise him to make that first step.

TL;DR:

Friend has inferiority issues and thinks he's garbage because he's at fault for his father's death the next day after he stated his father should die.
Doesn't want to seek help because he say's he doesn't deserve it.

387,"This was in a smaller town ~100,000. I have been driving it several years with no inspection. I don't have the money for inspection as i barely have money for gas and insurance. I am below the federal poverty level and live in my car. I can not pay this ticket.
What are my options? I go before a judge in a week. Can i ask for community service or a reduction in the fine? Otherwise I plan on leaving the city to move back to a big city where the cops let me silde understanding my situation. It is unlikely that the city will put out a warrant for me if I tell them straight up I don't have the money and have no way of paying? The warrant is only good for that city? (not like not paying a state speeding ticket, where the warrant is good for the whole state?) also low risk of being extradited for a 140 USD non-criminal ticket?
There is no debtors prison in the US but i'm interesting how this will be dealt with (can't get blood from a stone type of thing) thanks.",13Nov2017,3
388,"be me: a college student who commutes. I see him three times a week on the bus. He usually wears a navy blue suit (call him suit dude/SD from here on out), and he'll sit in the front of the bus, the seats that face sideways. I'll sit a little towards the back, but every now and then, we make eye contact. Today, I was disappointed, because I didn't realize I do see him on Mondays. So, I got on the bus and sat in the sideways seat, because I was tired and didn't want to walk further to find a seat. At our stop, I turned around and got up and lo and behold, it's SD. I think he smiled at me, but I was too tired for it to register until after I got off the bus. I would love to say hi or tell him I think he looks handsome in that suit of his, but idk how to go about it. :/ I'd like to be friends too if possible. ",13Nov2017,30
389,"Essentially title, there’s a girl who I really only see in class that I think is cute, we’ve texted and stuff but she’s very shy and so are her friends so it’s hard getting an actual rapport going. I’m outgoing so “just go talk to them” is well and good and I’ve tried that, but then I feel like I’m talking with a group/whoever she’s with rather than with her. Any tips? Hs senior btw.

390,"So this girl and me are getting along pretty well. I enjoy just talking to her and we slept together a few times. But in one of our first converations she mentioned how she wasn't looking for any kind of relationship. She even repeated it later on. Now I did not really mind in the beginning, I never had a relationship before and a FWB sounds good to me. Also, I never even developed any kind of feelings for a girl ever. 

Now I just think about this girl all day. Just the way she laughs and all that kinda rainbow-disneyland-stuff. But fuck, this is all new to me. I feel like a FWB would destroy me on the long run, but I like her too much to just leave her. Some friend of mine suggested hooking up with other girls to maybe play it cool? But I don't really feel like that and it's probably too ""chad"" for me to do.

Help me out you guys
