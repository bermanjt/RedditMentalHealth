0,"Hello all!

I would like some unbiased advice, hence why I'm here.

I've been at my place of work for almost 2 years. I have quickly become enamored with the industry I'm in, and was promoted from my entry-level position about a year ago into an analyst position. Currently, I am working with executive management on a few projects, because I recently obtained my SixSigma and have been asking for more work. My department can be a bit slow-going at times.

A few months ago, we began a new sector of the business that aligns very closely with my interests. I sought out the person that they brought in to run this sector, and he and I developed a rapport over our shared interests. He is someone that I would enjoy working with and well-respected in the industry.

A position recently opened up in this new department, actually, the ONLY position besides the colleague I am interested in working with in that department. I would be learning a lot more about the industry and helping to develop an area of work I am fond of.

My problems are 
1. I am very close with my boss, our department is small and I am his ""key"" player. I take on the bulk of the work and make sure things run smoothly when he is away. I would feel incredibly guilty leaving the department, and I don't want him to feel negatively toward me if I leave.
2. I am unsure as to whether this would be a lateral transfer. I plan on talking to HR about it tomorrow.
3. I just started my projects with executive management, and I don't want to be seen as abandoning them right as they start, or looking like I am running away from an opportunity.
4. There is a lower management position that is being rumored to be opening soon, and I am afraid that if I apply for and get this position, I will miss out on that opportunity.

However, I do feel that I may regret exploring my interests in this new department further.

Any advice is appreciated, because I am at a loss! Thank you all in advance.",07Apr2017,1
2,"I know it's wrong...reading it aloud makes it sound all the more terrible.  I'm in the 12th grade and I'm in love with my English teacher.  He's so smart, funny, kind, and I just love being around him!  He's in his 20s and though that doesn't change the fact that he's my damn teacher, I can't seem to eliminate the possibility of some miraculous chance.  As mentioned above, it's wrong and I see that.  How could I have fallen for someone who I have absolutely no chance with.  He's consuming my mind and quite frankly, I don't know what to do.

4,"I work as a high level tech guy for a waste water treatment plant. 90% of my job is done from home as I can remote into my office computer and monitor everything from there. The last 10% is basically meetings and a ""Weekly check in"" as the boss of the plant calls it.

Now today I was given an opportunity to move from my current position to a position on the board of the plant. 

I'd get paid almost double what I currently make which is already alot, the only difference is it's not an hourly salary and I would only get 5 hours of paid overtime compared to the 10 I get currently.

The perks are I'd get my own office although I'd be at the office and could no longer work from home. I'd be forced to attend meetings that happen off-site for the plant, and be forced into what they call ""State meeting"" they wouldn't go into detail on that so I have no idea what it would entail.

The problem, if I accept this promotion, a vacation that my family has had planned since January, and my boss knows about would have to be put on hold as for it was for the first 75 days in this position I cannot miss a day of work unless emergency or ill.

So the vacation would be pushed back until Julyish. Which would be ok, but it's Myrtle Beach and we'd rather go when it's cooler than when it's pushing 100.

So should I take this promotion and postpone a vacation or keep my current one? My wife says she'll support whatever I choose, but that's probably just ""wife talk"" and she won't tell me how she really feels.",07Apr2017,3
5,"Hello reddit, this is a throwaway account because I don't want this associated with my main. Anyways, my dad recently remarried and that's all fine and dandy, I mean he has been divorced from my mother for a few years, so I kind of expected it to happen sooner or later.

For some background: he has verbally/physically abused my siblings and my mother for years. I genuinely believe we make him unhappy, and when I was around 6 my mom had enough and took us out. We didn't see him again for two years, and after we did see him he was not around much and never called or sent anything for Christmas or birthdays.

Now that that is out of the way, he has only known this new woman since last May and they got married in January. She straight up told me to my face that the only reason we moved in is because her ex stopped paying child support and by my dad taking over the bills, she saved them. I won't talk too much about her because its her kids I am having more problems with.

One of her sons is a compulsive liar and kleptomaniac. He has stolen upwards of $40 from my brothers, WHILE THEY WERE SLEEPING, stole my razors, a nail kit, other shit from all of us, a watch, etc. He is unapologetic and is literally never reprimanded for his actions whatsoever. His brother is a manipulative bastard who cries on command, and since he's cute his mom and my dad say I'm the one causing trouble, even though I never speak to him and the one time I did yell at him is because he laughed at my mom getting another DUI. Once again, excuses were made and he never apologized. 

Today, one of the brothers got bitten in the face by the dog (supposedly) and even though I have fucking told everyone the dog was vicious and needed to be put to sleep because it has tried to attack me multiple times, I was ignored. So when I found out today, I muttered ""good"" under my breath because in all honesty, I am a nice person until you fuck with me first. 

My dad freaked out and started calling me a bitch and saying I was spiteful. Even though these insults usually get under my skin, today I was unapologetic and didn't feel slightly sorry. To make matters worse, when I get home there is no ""huge cut"" his face, as my dad had indicated previously. 

The kid lies about everything and anything, constantly throws fits and beats up the dog that tried to attack him. The dog is traumatized because their dad used to beat it and they started to as well. 

Am I in the wrong here? I genuinely cannot find it in myself to feel empathy for them. any advice is appreciated and ask questions if somethings were unclear.",07Apr2017,1

15,"So, a little backstory I guess, there was this guy last year that had a crush on me, and he asked for my number, so I was trying to be nice and I gave it to him. I remember he was very creepy and would constant call me cute/beautiful and I mean constantly. He was trying to make me do things I didn't really want to do- like ditching my friends at lunch and sitting with him instead, and he would get upset/depressed with me if I didn't. So, eventually I told him that I was feeling uneasy, and eventually stopped talking to him.

But now, this year, he's started to talk to me again, and he seemed really nice and silly, and he asked for my number again. So, trying to be nice once again, I gave it to him again today. Since we got out of school today, he's been texting me nonstop, complementing me nonstop, which was okay the first few times, but now he tells me how cute/amazing I am every chance he can, and gets upset when I don't agree. He's also trying to make me do things I don't want to, like skipping class, hugging him, holding hands, and even kissing him. I said no to most of these things, and he gets upset with me and says ""You were so rude to me last year, and you don't even want to make up for it?"" 

He makes me so uneasy and uncomfortable and I thought he had changed, but he hasn't, and I broke down crying a few minutes ago because I don't know what to do, and yes I know this is my fault for talking to him again, but I just want some advice on what to do. I just want some advice on how to let him down easy again? Without him blaming me for being rude? 

EDIT: I told him, and after some lengthy messages of ""oh great way to be fake and add to my depression"" He agreed with me since I ""hadn't changed since last year"" that we should just stop talking, which was perfectly fine with me. So, thank you all so much for your comments, you have all helped me realize what not to do next time, and I will definitely make sure I don't give my phone number out to any creeps like this anymore. Thank you all again.",07Apr2017,26
17,"All my life I've been told by my teachers, friends, family, etc that I'm an extremely intelligent individual, however I've had extremely difficult times reflecting that in my grades + overall school performance and I know why that is but I've had hard times explaining it to my Dad who loves to tell me every day at dinner that I'm going to be a failure in life and I'm going nowhere because I'm failing 5 classes a week into the new quarter because I've forgotten to turn a few things in. 

I've always had a rough time learning in a classroom environment, the amount of distractions coupled with my ADD the teacher teaching poorly in general have made it hard for me to succeed in school. I've been trying to explain to my Dad my difficulties with school but I suffer from anxiety and social awkwardness which makes it hard for me to talk to people, especially personal issues with family.

Any advice any of you guys have is really appreciated, my Dad says he is going to take my computer if I don't get my grades up and I really don't know what to do at this point, he doesn't understand what I'm going through and I really need help explaining to him. ",07Apr2017,30

21,"Hello, Reddit. A little background information before we go on. My friend, who I'll call Patrick is sixteen, and so am I. We have known each other for only six months; however, in those six months, we have bonded and become great friends. Because of this, I and the others in our friend group are deeply concerned for Patrick's well-being like any caring friend would be. Just a few weeks ago, I didn't know that Patrick had been suffering from severe depression. Once Patrick opened up to me, it has been a different story. He told me that in eighth grade, the period where his depression was untreated and most severe, he decided to jump off a school balcony out of ""sheer unhappiness"". Thankfully, Patrick only sprained his ankle and in turn, received mandatory medication and therapy sessions. To my knowledge, there were no suicide attempts from all over last year to the beginning of this year. Also, I am not aware of his self-harm habits from that period, as well. Now, to the current situation. Just a few months ago, while sitting at a restaurant, Patrick took out a knife and waved it around, muttering, ""I am gonna kill myself"", whilst my friend, who I'll call George, watched in upsetting awe. At the time, both George and I were dumbfounded at Patrick's actions; as he is jovial and outwardly happy (which is obviously far from the case). Since this was what we believed to be an isolated incident, we decided not to tell anyone mainly because Patrick told us only to tell his parents. We didn't tell them, though. Now, just a few weeks ago, Patrick told us that he tried to kill himself by cutting a major artery in his leg. Again, the knife was blunt and Patrick was also halted by his brother before he could harm himself anymore. In his own words, Patrick stated, ""I was a pussy for not going thru"". Both his actions and his words blew me and George away. Also, we are now scared to death that he could follow thru with it at any time. Out of fear, George told the school counselor about the incident and child services was called. Patrick's mom then received a call that his home wasn't safe and he was going to be taken away if another incident occurs. Patrick knew George told the counselors, but he wasn't mad. However, Patrick doesn't want any authorities to know his situation. His parents know that the incident occurred, but nothing much has been done to mollify it. The main issue is that George and I don't know what to do if this happens again in the future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",07Apr2017,1

28,"2 years ago inlaws decide to sell house because they are too far from me and sister in law.  

They ask us while in the process of showing the home if they could move in w/ me, my wife and 1 year old. 

1 year prior my wife and I sold my condo and decided to rent my deceased grand mothers old house owned my my mom and aunts. They gave us a good deal, there's enough space for in laws. We say yes.

 was happy to help.  It's stressful to sell a home and find a place to live, renting would have been tough for them with a dog.  Also my mother in law wasn't working at the time..

My wife and I are paying cheaper rent then non family, my in laws pay the remainder - they don't pay us rent or pay part of our mortgage. they pay my mom aka my grand mothers estate/ LLC. 

When they first moved in we didn't ask them to baby sit at all.  My father in law was having a hip replacement.

My MIL needed a hisdirectory or something a few months later.

It was supposed to be a 4-5 month stay.  We also really like the baby sitter we've had the past year and didn't want to lose her. She was working 15 hours / week she wanted more hours and was patient but not till I found full time work...was freelancing from home..

I kinda assumed that 2 adults who've owned and rented homes would just talk through chores, we split the utilities evenly.

From when they moved in in Aug 2015 till Nov 2015 I did all the chores and cooking and what not.  As they both had surgeries and were recovering. 

In December 2015 I started work full time about 12.5 hours / day w/ commute. 

We asked my in laws how much they felt comfortable wathcing my daughter.  
They told us a certain amount of hours.  It was like 20-25 hours / week.  We increased the baby sitters hours too. 

Baby sitter does 6 hours monday thru thrusday, in laws handle the rest. At that time pretty much every day my daugher slept most of the afternoon so it was kinda light work.  She was 1. 

In April 2016 I left that job and for a month and a half in laws were not needed, I started another job June last year. 

In all this time they never stepped in to do any of the house hold chores.

I figured they would step it up but let it slide for those 6 months I was working longer hours and he was cooking dinner for all of us. My mother in law was also back to work. 

Most people, like friends fam and co workers are surprised when I say we still pay a baby sitter the normal hours (6 hours a day 4 days a week when I say my in laws live with us.  ALso my mom retired and has watched watches my daugher most fridays since last summer..

So between my Mom and my wife working from home on fridays they we don't really need any of my in law. 

What irks the fuck out of me is that my father in law cooks like a fuckin slob. and is sloppy in the house in general

I vacuum and clean the floors more often than I usually would due ot him and his dog.  Their dog crapped on my carpet and like most things it was a 1/2 assed clean up job. 

Long story short I've never asked them to do back breaking work.  Just pitch in and do some little things and properly clean up after yourself. 

On the weekends we rarely ask them for baby sitting.

My father in law is like 63 no job, no volunteering, no church stuff.

Mother in laws contract work ended last fall, so there's 2 of them to watch my kid 15-20 hours / week..again they live w/ us and pay $1100 in rent,,,their expenses are far less then when they owned a house. 

I get pissed off because he's sloppy...right when I come home I take a little break and then prep dinner a little bit. 

Then I have to pick up my wife from train.

Come home and work out while wife watches kid.  IN between sets I'll cook..I do a lot of stuff in the oven...

Anyhow it's a bit of a hustle after work.  I dont need a diaper to change...most of the day it's handled my the baby sitter, just do 1 diaper change per day just before I get home - no reason for me to find her w/ dried crusty poop but.  

Make the coffee for all of us in the morning..get the damn mail. 


I've gotten annoyed w/ them because they act like lazy know it all teen agers when it comes to just doing little stuff that goes a long way..They do little to nothing in the common area, only maintain their in law suit up staris.


Yes they live w/ us but I feel like they treat me like a maid and handyman.

Drain is clogged they call me..and they've been home owners before.

Can they make some kind of an effort??

Tired of the drama w/ them...

It's been 2 years of sucking it up..I don't know how the arrangement could be any easier on them.

Theyre moving out soon. But today I got annoyed w/ my FIL, he doesn't do much to earn respect, he sort of feels entitled to it.

I try to talk nice, any time I ask him to care for things in my house the way I would, he gets defensive and acts insulted.

Walks away, says don't talk to me like this, he has ""know it all"" tendencies in general.

Things have been good but this week there were too many ""oh shits"" and he still gives me the same old ""i didn't see it, I didn't do it, I didn't know answers""

Today I come home he says my daugher now 2.5 took get into the bathroom sink and got her self wet.

OK I thought it was all shits and giggles...Well she soaked her clothes and he just left them piled in a ball.  

Also why was she un attended long enough to get wet head to toe.

It's a number of the same things..he takes her to the beach...a dirty shit stained diaper gets left in diaper bag, needed 30 minutes of cleaning.

Twice in their old house he backed into parked cars in their drive way.

big track record of doing stuff half assed not being thorough .  Usually my Mother in law picks up for him, but when she's not around, I come home to his gremlins 

Today we had a slight argument, it was more I bring things to his attention, and we he doesn't like what he hears gets defensive, makes me the bad guy. SO today he huffed up stairs, then then texts my wife and mother in law to taddle on me like a baby.  Last time this popped up, he goes and tells my mom...wouldnt talk to me stormed off.  



Today he said, if you don't like how I'm doing something then pay me...so obviously he feels entitled to pay, but he lives with us, and they volunteered these hours.  He and my MIL tend not to speak up if they feel over burndened...I dont know

It's 15-20 hours a week tops...again they both have no jobs..dont volunteer, dont really have hobbies...them, their dog and their shit takes up 1/2 the house...I think it's beena  pretty cushy deal.

They were set on buying a house, so it hasn't been bad enough for them to rent in the mean time...I think it's been pretty easy on them..

Am I wrong for getting annoyed, would you be able to suck it up...are they wrong.

Anyhow looking for advice on how to make sense of it. thanks

29,"[Please Help] I think I destroyed any relationship o had left with my Mom and it's destroying me. Bear with me this may get semi-long.

The background- over the last 3-4 years I've ran into a good deal of life problems like getting a couple speeding tickets, breaking down car, and losing my job at one point.  My mom loves/loved me enough to help me out multiple times. Co signing on a new car when the old one broke down, helping me pay the speeding tickets off cause I was broke, and helping pay my rent when I lost my job. I promised I'd pay all of it back. 

Now I'm in a slightly better position to slightly pay her back a little at a time. And I have no problem whatsoever doing so but The problem is that she treats me extremely poorly complaining about the fact that I put her in debt and calling me names at times. To the point where my wife feels like she wants nothing to do with my mom anymore. 

Last weekend my mom got extremely viscous calling me a great deal of unusually vulgar curse words. I snapped and  basically told her off. I told her that ""I have no problem paying her back and I'm sorry it's taking so long but I am working on it and it is unacceptable to call your very own SON such mean names, you don't talk to your friends like that right? No, you wouldn't dare. And I'm not going to speak to you again until you apologize and talk to me reasonably like an adult."" She only continued to insult me and got meaner so I blocked her.
Now it's 4 days later and I realize that if she did think about it and apologize to start discussions again with me that I may have missed it and look like I'm ignoring her.

I realize that I am the one who was selfish and could have avoided this mess. But I will not apologize for defending myself. How do I try to fix this without apologizing myself??
I could really use any advice on this. She really actually is a good person she is just stressed and probably super hurt now. I was the only person she really had close  in her life. And I love her and don't want to lose her.",07Apr2017,1
30,"I'm 22 and started drinking for the first time.

Got a cheap bottle called that Old Vlad. It was plastic. I read that plastic is bad?

Well, I drank some beer then started drinking vodka around 10:00 PM. I first poured orange juice into a glass than vodka. Just a little bit. Couldn't see much vodka I was pouring because it disappeared into the orange juice, so maybe that was my first mistake?

Didn't feel that drunk, drank all the orange juice. So I started pouring more and more orange juice and vodka.

I feel so stupid and childish. All of a sudden it just HIT me like a train. I don't remember much. I was at home on my computer. I just remember feeling so completely exhausted, took off my contacts and crashed.

I then woke up with the WORST hangover in my life. I never had such a horrible hangover before. I felt so stupid for letting this happen. It was horribly painful. I then thought it would be a good idea to drink a lot of water.

I then drank two bottles of water. Felt sick, and threw it all up. Took some low dose aspirin, that helped I think..

I woke up at 1 PM. Hangover lasted until 7:30 PM.

I just felt so stupid. I guess I had a small cup of vodka. Not even a cup. Like a little coffee mug filled halfway with Vodka..is that too much?

Should I next time just get shot glasses and measure it that way? How many shots is too many?

How much is too much? Is it bad to drink it with beer before or after?",07Apr2017,1

36,"To preface the question, I currently live in a house with four other adults in their mid-late 20's. Our landlord, we'll call him Matt, used to live in this house with his family, and one of my roommates, let's call her Hannah, works in a store managed by Matt, so Hannah gives our rent checks to him at work. Now Hannah doesn't pay any rent for whatever reason, not that it matters to me because I'm pretty certain she pays the wifi bill. Anyway, the lease we signed reads the landlord pays for $200 of the utilities every month and we have to pay the difference if we go over. It's a great deal, I thought at the beginning when I moved in, because the likelihood of us going over $200 in utilities is bit much and even if we did, it'd be divided by at least four people if not all five of us. So now things have escalated a little bit with Hannah and three of us, myself included, are moving out very soon. I don't feel the need to go much deeper into it, but basically Hannah feels like she's the landlord since she works for Matt. She seems to think she can tell us what to do as if we all don't have equal responsibility over the house and its contents. She is also very hypocritical and manipulative. It's a very negative environment for everyone here. 

I talked to the landlord yesterday to ask him if my security deposit was refundable and if I could use that to pay the last months rent, which worked out well for both of us. Today, I gave Matt our 30 day notice and told him we'd be out before the end of the month. Thankfully, he doesn't have an issue with us moving out on such short notice, but Hannah seems to disagree. I guess sometime yesterday at the store, Matt told Hannah in passing I was asking about refunding the deposit, so Hannah rightfully assumed we were moving. I feel like I can no longer trust her. She told me today I owe almost $100 in utilities for the last two months. We've gone over $200 ONCE and we all had to pay less than $20 to cover the difference. I find it very hard to believe that we used at least $400 of utilities EACH MONTH if four of us owe $50 for two months. This winter wasn't even cold enough to justify using that much gas to heat the house. I just can't see how that's possible when I know at least three of us are very anal about turning lights off, not leaving the water run unnecessarily, etc. I don't know what I should do in this situation.

My actual question now is, what can I do? I plan on calling Matt tomorrow to see if this is actually true and what the consequences are for Hannah if it's not, or what the consequences are for the three of us if we move out without paying. I wouldn't just leave without paying though. Hannah is always complaining about not having any money and I just get the feeling she's trying to take our money out of spite. I had to send her a picture of my signature last month because I forgot to sign a rent check so she could sign it for me. I didn't feel comfortable doing that and she nearly forced me to do it. I'm fearful for my security. I don't want any bad blood. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. :)

37,"So, this girl and I met on monday and we really hit it off, like she seemed super in to it, said yes to a date without hesitation and we shared some heart to heart type of stuff.  Tuesday night we just chilled and I wasn't trying to pull any funny business I just wanted to get to know her and shes said something that made me feel great, that I am the first guy at college to actually want to get to know her and take her out on a date rather than just have sex or take advantage.  She also said that she has a good feeling about this.  We held hands and played a little cute game after we got food, she wouldnt leave the care until she felt 10/10 because she was lightheaded, so i grabbed her hand and slowly then number went up to 10/10 which was when our fingers finally interlocked. We chilled for the rest of the night, texted after then the Wednesday she was just super stressed with school work and her tests that are coming up.  So im just giving her some space but texting just a little, enough to show i care but not enough to be annoying.

Here is where my issue is and where my anxiety comes in, ive been in shitty situations before and this does not feel like it at all dont get me wrong, but tonight she went out to a party after she was done studying and idk, part of me wants to talk to her but i know thatll just be annoying, we havent gone on an offical date yet and we wont until at least Wednesday next week because she is super busy which is fine.  I know its still super early and i need to take it slow but I'm just worried that in like the few days between now and our date shes going to hookup with another guy or just find someone else.  I guess what im trying to say is that she just seems not disinterested or anything and i know that its only been a couple of days so its not like we are going to hangout all the time, but i just feel like i wanted her to text me a little before going out as selfish as that sounds.  Idk why im having anxiety about this, its just irrational thoughts because shes obviously interested. Sorry for the confusing wall of text btw.",07Apr2017,1
39,"Ok so I (18YO M) live in a flat of 6 people (4M 2F), we were placed there randomly at the start of the university year. I get on really well with all of them but they hang out more together and I have my own groups of friends. There are 2 showers in the flat and we sort of roughly allocated 3 people to each at the start of the year, with both girls in one of the bathrooms. 

Recently I have been hitting the gym a little bit and sometimes like to look in the mirror for a bit when I get back (I know it's sad but seeing results has really motivated me to continue to lose weight). I started using the bathroom the girls use when I get back from the gym as there is much better lighting and I can track my progress better. I usually continue to get a shower in there afterwards ( like I said the bathroom allocation was pretty flexible anyway)

Another thing I have started doing recently is taking cold showers as I've heard of their benefits for fitness recovery. If you have taken a cold shower you will know how hard it is at first to control breathing and whatnot. I was breathing fairly heavily at first.

Basically the male flatmate that also shares the bathroom with the 2 girls approached me today and asked if i had been masturbating in their shower. As apparently they had heard noises coming from their bathroom (my heavy breathing from the cold showers) and knew it was me.He also said the girls felt too uncomfortable to mention it to me. I explained all of this to him but it just sounds so unbelievable.

I really feel like I'm trapped in some sort of sitcom situation where my explanation just sounds so far fetched. Who even gets a sexual thrill off a girl's bathroom anyway? There's nothing in there remotely sexual

42,"So I fell in love with this girl some months ago, then we had a fight.

I started obsessing with this girl, I wanted to know if she was seeing somebody else (she does). I know its terrible but I cannot help it. I started to wait outside of her house for a couple of hours some days, to see if she is going out with somebody. 

Today I received an anonymous call threatening me to stop doing it. I don't know who called me, very likely the neighbors got spooked and found out about me. They said they had pictures of me and my car, and to stop doing it.

I don't know what to do. I never had any bad intention, but I know i might have spooked people out. I never wanted to become a stalker but I cannot fall out of love. To be hones, I was really far from her house, usually 300 meters or more, so I don't upset or scare her family, but people found out anyway.

I don't know if she knows about this, she hasn't blocked me from any social network, probably she doesn't know, or maybe she does. I'm going crazy, I know her from work and if she freaks out and publish this, my life is basically over (even if I never committed any crime, but people will found out how crazy I'm, lol)

Every single relationship I've made in the past few years have been totally casual and I get jealous of how people get contacted by their old friends all the time to events or share stuff together. It's frustrating. 

My childhood friends are all moving around the place so there's a high possibility that I'll never ever meet any of them again, and I have no idea how to create new meaningful relationships, which is incredibly crucial to have a decent life from what I've heard. 

I just can't act casual and fun around people and when I do, usually I end up being awkward and appear to try too hard to fit in and sometimes even openly mocked. I have issues moving past having a casual relationship and honestly I bore myself, not to mention other people.

45,"Hey, Reddit.
I'm looking for career advice- I know, 'I'm only thirteen, I have a long time'- because I'm confused.

My goal is to ""get rid of"" global warming- in the end of my life, I want to make a VERY significant impact on the research to end climate change.

However, I am unsure *how* to do that. I have an interest in Aerospace engineering, but also an interest in Architecture. With aerospace engineering, I can do something with the air/space that helps to end CC. With architecture, I can find a way to end housing crises and a way to leave more space for trees. (This is all in crude language because I'm in sort of a hurry, and I don't have time to reword phrases and such).

Which one should I get a PhD in? I would *like* to get one in both, but this isn't a perfect world. However, there are some criteria my job must reach:

1) I need to be able to freely innovate.
2) I need to be able to gradually make a significant amount of money (I DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS).
3) I need for the work environment to be creative vs like a corporate office job.
4) The job must not be SUPER taxing (for example, my dad's job is very stressful [programming], he always is worried about his boss).

So should I pursue Aerospace Engineering or Architecture?

I don't feel happy and excited for anything anymore. Also, being around people is such a pain. I have to practice in the mirror my emotions just so that I look real enough when I fake my emotions. I hate it when my friends laugh and I have to force myself to realistically chuckle with them in order to be be normal. I don't even remember the last time I had a good laugh where it felt REAL and effortless. 

The bad thing is, I don't even care about my family. My mom is so sweet. She cares for me everyday. She wants the best for me. But if she died, I wouldn't shed a single tear because I don't know what's wrong with me, and something tells me I can never change that. Currently she is 50 years old and her death will come soon, AND I DON'T WANT THAT DAY TO COME. If someone walked up to me and said ""Your mom has passed away"", I would not feel ANYTHING.

Students would line up to be my partner for class projects, the teachers would let me show up late most of freshman year without marking me tardy. I was not a ""nerd"" persay, although I am very enthusiastic about all things technology. I always had this perception that although my brain was well developed I couldnt help but feel that I would mess up somewhere. That out there one day I would find a reason to give up. Fast forward to my senior year of highschool. I just turned 18. never really had friends to hang out with after school, although I did text a few people off and on but for the most part it was school, work, then come home and play videogames. I couldnt help but feel something was missing. It went like that from about age 16 to I would say somewhere around 18.5. It was at this age that I decided to venture out and try new things. Fast forward again. I Discover the healing and sedation effects of Marijauna. Thats right. Mary J. To make a long story short, I purchased my first car at 18 and from then on I had done nothing but look for new experiences to enjoy while smoking pot. Everyday I would wake up to a bowl pack or two to start the day. This led to a falling out in my schooling. I began to thought school was for squares, college was nothing but a trap to restrain our entire humanity to a government related conspiracy. But at the same time I am extremely unhappy, almost never can hold onto a single dollar, asking family to borrow money only to go spend it on more pot, food while i was high, gas to go everywhere while i was high. I was living with a friend, my best and really only friend since highschool. We would do everything together. Then one day, i recieve a call... My best friend had overdosed, on heroin. I never knew he even touched that stuff, and now hes gone. fast forward again. now, at age 20 i have a suspended license due to never paying registration. IM working a factory job overnight with 12 hr shifts at 11.20 an hr and back to living with my parents, sleeping on a pull out in the livingroom. All because i wasted my time on half wit ideas to score more pot.

So my fellow members of reddit. I have a few questions i hope someone out there could answer for me if you will... Is it too late for me? Am I going to be stuck working this factory job forever? struggling to always make ends meet. I currently have no highschool diploma/equivalency. I only have about 3 credits left but just completely abandoned the idea to even pursue it because i always thought all I ever needed was pot and a minimal job to live with someone and blow it all on partying and weed. Can I still go to college? How do I get started. Will i ever get to make it to a university? If I put all the effort I have into pursuing something greater, will the education system even recoignize that? Or is it as I imagine in my head?

63,"The title gives the general idea, but there is a bit of a story behind it.

For me, the major regret goes back over 10 years ago to senior year of high school.  I was coming towards the end of my wrestling career and it was the tournament leading up to the state championships.  I had gone from a freshman year with only 1 wins, to a senior year with over 30 wins and set a new school record for pins.  The transformation was a huge deal to me, and the chances that I would place high enough to reach the state tournament were very good.  I was incredibly proud of the work that I put in during the off seasons, attending elite camps and training hard to get my body and mind into the best possible shape.

When I arrived at my high school and stepped on the scale I was exactly at the limit for my weight class, (148.0).  For the entire bus ride I chewed gum and spit into a bottle and tried to sweat as much as possible to make sure and make weight.  Due to some circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to check my weight when we arrived.  Instead, my teammates and I were the last ones to arrive and weigh ins started immediately after we arrived.  

As you probably figured out by now I did not make the weight.  When my turn came up I stripped to my underwear and stepped on the scale and to my amazement the digital readout was 148.1.  At this point dozens of other wrestlers had used the same exact scale and none of them had an issue, so clearly the scale was working.  I stepped off and removed my underwear as any of the others would have done.  At this point everybody is paying attention as I step back on the scale since this was my last chance to make it.  

148.1 again... Only one tenth of a pound.

That was it.  My wrestling career ended right there, naked, in front of a hundred other people, completely due to a combination of a few small mistakes on my part.  I managed to suppress the emotions for a while, but reflecting on the situation a decade later, I can see how it has impacted my thinking.

I decided to place some reminders of that day around my house as a sort of motivation in the form of post-its with 148.1 written on them.  I figured if I can look at the number and remember how I felt since that day, then I would be prompted to keep pushing through and current challenges.  After a short time I've had good results, so I'm considering making this a permanent reminder, probably on my left forearm or wrist.

I want to stop relying on them, but I'm unsure of whether or not I truly need them.  
For starters, the withdrawals are horrible. When I don't get my Adderall, I feel starving hungry, I get horrible headaches, nausea, dizziness, and I can barely function.

But as of the past few months, I've had very strong on-and-off feelings for her.  At the very beginning of this year I had just gotten out of another relationship, so initially I was unsure if I actually liked her, or if I was just looking for a rebound.

But I've been feeling this way on and off for the past 3-4 solid months now.  I was completely and utterly over my ex as soon as we broke up, so I'm pretty sure I'm not just looking for a rebound or anything like that.

Thing is, it's been on and off.  But when it's on, it's *pretty* strong.  And it's been on pretty consistently lately.

She's finishing up undergrad in a month or so (I already have), so at the very least I would wait until then to break it to her, just so that she doesn't have another thing on her plate to worry about until she's done.

Should I even bother?

Also, she's friends with my ex, and while my ex would outwardly go along with it, I could definitely see her feeling awkward about it.

I hint towards a relationship, but she's recently told me her emotions are in the past and she was torn up by her ex and doesn't know if she wants a relationship. Also we've done some pretty serious stuff. Should I keep talking to her and trying to get a relationship and keep the connection? Or should I give her space and let her do her thing? Also does she even like me or is she leaning on me for emotional support?

Edit: the girl has also seemed to be getting less and less into me, she use to text back a lot and she use to say something before she went to bed like goodnight love or love you but she hasn't lately.

She said it wasn't that id done anything wrong but all of the problems she's struggling with  (she suffers with mental health issues, pretty bad depression), combined with going away on a gap year thing for ages has made her realise that she doesn't want to be with me. The problem is that she told me she would have said yes to a relationship if I'd asked a few months before, and I guess since then I've been king of hating myself a bit. I tried to clarify with her about what's going on between us but she rarely even replies and now I'm convinced she doesn't even want to talk as friends, which is really getting me down so much. The past week I've been trying to get laid as a way of getting over it but I've just ended up hating myself a lotmore and I don't know how to really get away from all this. ",07Apr2017,1

Here's a bit of background on where I am.
24m with 5 years of college education with no degree. I study applied math at a university and have about 1 year of classes left. As of now, I feel like I can no longer continue pursuing my degree due to my disabilities. 
I am looking to dropping out of college and joining a coding boot camp. After doing tons of research on working as a developer, it seems to fit my criteria and interests. 
In the future, I plan on working as a developer and most likely going to make a company. Doesn't necessarily have to be with software.

I'm a sophomore and still can't declare anything because I haven't passed enough classes. I just barely passed Calculus. I failed Intro to Computer Science once and had to retake it. I also failed physics. I'm just lost in college, and I don't have to the study habits to do well in my classes; I never had to develop the discipline to study since I always did well in high school. I barely maintain a C+/B-'s in my classes. I'm so lost at this point that I don't even know what to ask help on...how do I catch up in habits?

85,"Okay so to give you some background, I'm a fabricator/welder in a workshop for a large company, been in this field for around 8 years. Things have been good until this new guy started, and straight away he started causing a division between the guys. 

He questioned loudly why ""unskilled workers (fabricators who didn't go through an apprenticeship) are working with proper tradesmen like himself. 

At the moment we have 8 skilled fabricators, and 3 like myself, who just kind of picked up the trade (and also weld). Obviously it immediately pissed us off, as we are all competent workers despite not having the college qualification. These complaints reached the ears of management, who held a meeting to say that they didn't care about who was a real tradesman or not, as long as people do their jobs well. 

Now the asshole makes these really snarky loud comments about ""unskilled workers don't deserve their jobs"", and ""there's too many snakes in here talking to management"". Even though none of us said anything to management, he was loud enough that they heard. 

He also has this habit of staring at the others and I with this really creepy smile. Dude is a real asshole, but the 8 skilled fabricators laugh whenever he makes these comments (I assume out of fear of getting on his wrong side). I don't understand them, as he constantly belittles their abilities to work as well. 

So has anyone had a similar situation, and how was it resolved? I will go to HR if necessary, but I'm hoping there's another way. Thanks for your time! 

TL/DR - asshole at work making passive-aggressive comments, what can I do? ",07Apr2017,1
88,"So for my entire life I've gotten by just being approached by people and forging relationships and friendships from there.  Every girlfriend I've ever had (about 7 since 15, I'm 19 now) has come on to me, every friend I've ever had (not many) has been my friend because the situation made it convenient for us, and 99.9% of them disappeared shortly after whatever circumstances ended.  I've still got like two friends which is usually enough for me (although one is my roommate and I'm very much on the fence about if I actually like him or not), but I'd like to make more to start creating a better social life now that I'm finally on my own in an apartment in a decently sized suburban area.

Well, I kinda want to make new friends on this trip.  It seems like an opportunity, I mean, hey, it's an amusement park, people are usually more open at places like this and the college is transporting us via charter buses, so we've got like 4 hours riding on those in the day as well. 

Trouble is, I've got no goddamn clue how to approach people outside of specific situations.  Like the fuck do I do, just be like ""Hey, my name's &lt;name&gt;, nice to meet you"" and go from there?  Because I'm 99% sure that'd be weird and pretty awkward.  Unless there's something I can comment on or whatever like a shirt with a band on it or something to just casually throw out ""hey I like your shirt, what's your favorite song by &lt;x&gt;"" (for example),  which there may be but I'm not into any pop culture so there very well may not be, IDK how to really pull it off.

Additionally, I don't really socialize with other guys.  I just don't fit in with them because I'm very effeminate and don't like being around masculine guys at all.  So that's a small factor that plays a part.

I am attractive and well groomed and sharply dressed and all, (which is how I've managed to do pretty decently socially despite being passive) and pretty sure I don't come off as creepy, so it's not like I'd be some neckbeard dude talking to chicks way out of his league that'd probably be instantly dismissed as creepy/thirsty, but I just have legitimately no clue what to say to try and start conversation with a stranger.

Please bare with me as this is my first ever post on Reddit. 

I am a freshman in college that recently pledged a fraternity. During my various drunken stupors of rushing/pledging, I have acquired many cigarette burns on my arm. By that I mean ""dude, I bet you won't put that cigarette out on my forearm."" I'm talking lit cigarette fully extinguished on my flesh, just because my drunk self thought it would be funny. Does my sober self think it would be funny? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I am 110% ashamed of what I have done, and I don't dare ever do it again. My right arm is tatted up with cigarette burns, and I feel like I can't even wear a short sleeved shirt now. Again, I AM NOT PROUD OF THIS. Summer is approaching, and so are short sleeved shirts. Also, so are my summer job interviews. On top of that, my family has to see my scarred up arms when I come home. I understand that I could've just not been stupid and told someone to burn me. I can't do anything about that now. Are there any remedies  and/or treatments from doctors anyone can suggest? I would like to get rid of these as soon as possible. By the way - these scars are about 4 months old. ",07Apr2017,2
94,"I don't have parents I can ask this to.. they're both addicts and live across the country. 

My husband and I are in a predicament. He has been having severe back pain the past week, luckily it started while he was on vacation from work, so he hasn't had to miss any days, yet. He doesn't have any days to take off as of right now, and won't have any until the end of the month. 

We went to the hospital and they sent him home with ibuprofen and a muscle relaxer. They helped for a couple days but now are no longer taking the pain away. We are planning on setting up an appointment with a doctor to maybe get a referral to someone who can help us, but I'm really not sure how we're going to pay for those medical bills. He has insurance through work, but there's a 25% copay and while this could be worse (like no insurance), I'm still not sure how we would afford that.. 

He woke up around 2:30 crying because of the pain. I gave him a muscle relaxer and put the heating pad under him to hopefully give him relief and he was asleep about 30 minutes later. He has work tomorrow at 6:30, and he is just not sure how he's going to get through the day being in so much pain. My heart is breaking for him.. 

So apparently you can't draw unemployment if you're fired for attendance in my state.. which was disheartening to find out.. 

Basically we've just been having some really bad luck lately. If he lost his job I have no idea what we would do because we have no family to lean on in a time of need like this.. 

I have severe social anxiety due to trauma from a few years ago and am unable to get a job at the moment.. I want to get a job so that it would take some of the financial burden from him, but it's just not an option at this time. I am going to be seeing a therapist next week so that I can work on this. Luckily I am medically insured by the state from aging out of foster care so we don't have to worry about medical costs for me.. 

Anyway, I just am unsure of what to do or what path to take. 

We are getting our tax refund soon and plan to use it as a down payment on a car because our car is about to stop working. Something is going on with a head gasket (or something, we're not really sure.) so the days are obviously numbered.. 

It just feels like there is a rain cloud following us everywhere, to be honest.. 

We are $1000 in debt to our bank because we made the mistake of getting a credit card when we first moved out on our own, and used it to buy some furniture and house necessities, and then of course on fun stuff later on, not being responsible adults.. I'm not trying to blame anything on anyone, I do take responsibility for my actions but I really didn't have my parents to teach me how to adult properly and my husband's parents never taught him shit either, which didn't help.. 

God I just feel so clueless and stressed out and I just wish his back pain would just go the fuck away. We have no idea what's causing it and we won't until he sees a doctor for it, which we don't know when will happen.. hopefully as soon as next week.

His next day off is Sunday and I really don't even know if he will last that long. I'm so scared he won't be able to go to work tomorrow or the next day and will then lose his job because I don't know what will happen..

102,"Hey reddit peeps.
Im in my 2nd year of my university double degree and i've finally come to realise that i fkn hate uni and my life (not suicidal if anyone thinks). I finally realise that im a pathetic loser who lives in the shadow of his older brother. I've always looked upto him because he was always there for (7 year age gap and lives in another state) me and looked after me. He and my mum both pressured me to study law but i originally wanted to be a cop, but my mum said no and my bro persuaded me to try n become a lawyer instead of a cop cos i have a lot of respect for the law. However i got offered a double degree and am hating it. For the past few weeks i'v hated my uni life, im barely keepung up with readings, i dont understand most of the things my lecturer is saying and im too much of a coward to ask them or my friends for help. 
I finally hit my breaking point because of my  assignment. I found out today that i had one that i didnt even know about cos i thought i already did it, turns out i was thinking of another assignment. Turns out its also due today and i only had 4hrs to complete it. well the times up and its been 30min past the deadline and i hardly did any of it. I didnt understand the results given, the methods provided and i couldnt think of a thesis statement/introduction. I want to ask my friends for help but i dont want to live with the shame of telling them that i havnt submitted (i lose 10% for each day after the deadline). I know that they wouldnt really care much n probs just call me an idiot in a joking manner but still i cant. 
Since my second semester last year i had lost all my motivation to do law and wanted to get a job in the legal field to do anything. I told my bro and he said to go for it and take it easy with uni and to 2 subjects. But when i told my mum she told me off and wanted me to focus on my studies. She means well because all she wants is a good future for her kids. Im the youngest of my family and theyve all sacrificed so much for me (my dad walked out on us when i was 2). The main reason y i did law was so that she would be proud of me, i know she always will be but when my bro graduated with his first degree in medical science, it was the happiest iv ever seen her and i want her to look that way with me when i graduate.
 
Now all i want to do is quit uni and get a job anywhere doing anything. After the deadline i just reevaluated my life. I dont have anything. All my past assessments iv written are pathetic pieces of shit. Im not smart. Im nothing. Iv always been in my bros shadow. He was always the smart one who did everything for the family as well both immediate and extended. And iv always been compared to him. He always was the top of his class whereas as im near the bottom. What makes it worse is when i just get a pass and when i tell my family they tell people that i got credits (60-70%), they know i tried my best but they still expect so much from me. 
My brother has always helped me whenever i needed him but i dont want to ask him cos idk y i just dont. I dont want to worry my eldest sister cos shes pregnant just got married and i dont want to disturb them. And i cant tell my mum cos she'll just tell me to continue and that ill enjoy it and that iv already wasted money since ive done 1yr already. I can ask my friends but im too much of a coward to tell them cos in my mind ill come off as a pathetic little bitch but i know thats not how theyll react. I dont know what to do. Iv stopped going to the gym and have gained weight again and i hate how i look. I hate everything in my life now.
The girl who iv loved for 7 years broke up with her bf in the middle of last year. I ended up helping her get though it and not to get her for myself but so that she would be happy again cos i hated seeing her upset and hating her life. I even told her to get back together with him if she truly loved him cos he wanted to get back together n they did but it didnt last. We stopped talking at the start of this year but whenever i see her upload a pic i want to talk to her and ask her out but im too much of a coward.
People always come to me when something is wrong with their lives. And im always happy to help them cos i hate seeing people, especially the people i care about upset. A friend of mine used to talk about himself like i do now being pathetic and useless. I told him not to talk like that and helped him through it. I helped him get a job and introduced him to his current GF who now love each other so much. And i hate him cos im jealous, thats all iv wanted in life. Happy, with a job and someone who i can love unconditionally. I promised myself when i was a kid that i would treat women like they were queens and not end up like my dad. 

And so reddit it took me courage to write this so please any advice to help would be much appreciated. For the rest of the day and tomorrow im gonna finish off this assessment and then go out with some friends cos im at peace most when im with them This is a throwaway account cos me n my bro share 1 together n i dont want him seeing this. Ill tell him everything next week during the easter break.",07Apr2017,3
103,"Brief overview. I was studying computer science in the UK but I left because I thought I wasn't happy and had a love/hate relationship with my studies. Some days I really enjoyed it, but other days felt like a nightmare. I had problems with living as well. I was living alone and am a major introvert. Not good at making friends.

After leaving the UK, I thought maybe I could apply to a different university but I don't have enough qualifications at the moment and since I waited for a while my IELTS has also expired. Trying to gain those qualifications means losing another year. I am going to be 20 in August.

The situation in Cyprus and the things I see, problems I encounter drive me crazy. Therefore, I am having second thoughts about staying in Cyprus. I feel like I won't be able to educate myself and eventually lose all interest. I could become an unskilled loser with no purpose. Wouldn't be able to live the life I desire. Which again could 100% cause unhappiness.

Now I have the option to go back and repeat my studies or stay here and try to find all the good things that can keep me motivated to be the person I want to be. If I am going to stay in Cyprus I think of studying business administration and teach myself programming along the way since I still love or hate it occasionally. I wouldn't study CS in Cyprus because I think most schools' programs are outdated and not worth the money/time.
I look forward to hearing your opinions and advices.

What should I do?

I don't want to ask her if they're still dating, so I won't know she's single unless she tells me.

Girl 3 is a girl who I've been talking to a bit who also went to the same class but dropped out of it before I did. We've said to meet up if we're in the same area, but I'm worried I'm being too flirty with her. There's a chance she's into me, but I honestly have no idea. I think she's pretty, but I don't know. She's very slow when responding, but I'm always worried I've said something stupid and that she won't want to meet up.

I'm a bit anxious over this because I do like them all as friends, but I would love to date any one of them. I'm a virgin, so possibly I just want to have sex. I'm perfectly civil when we actually hang out and I don't do anything wrong when we do (I think), I'm just worried I'll lose them as friends if I keep flirting with all three of them.

I don't know what to do, because I almost feel like I must be obsessed or something because of how I'm talking to them.

It's not like I'm always flirting with them, it's more that I think about dating them. I don't want to lose them as friends though, so I don't know how to force myself to stop chatting to them in a flirtatious way...",07Apr2017,1

This is how it's laid out, I have a fan blowing air out, but it is only a small window up high. The air-in is a bigger window.

The air to the right of the room seems to be stagnant, and I smoke and whatnot in my room so I'd like it all to be moving so it gets out. I have a computer to the right of the room too so I'd like to make sure that it is getting the cold air and not recycling the hot air.

There are not other windows or openings, is there anyway to get the air moving?

122,"I have recently been diagnosed with a rare connective tissue disease, and there's a likelihood there will be a few more weird, discomforting diagnoses on top of that. (Most upsetting: maybe cancer.)

I have been keeping all of this to myself. Only my doctor and roommate knows about it. I thought I was okay with this, until my PhD advisor asked me why I seemed so stressed out, and what I was doing to handle it. The question really caught me off guard, and for some reason upset me.

Because I knew in that moment, the knowledge of the progressive nature of this disease, how it will affect my future career and life choices, really stressed me. But I have told no one about it, because I'm ashamed of myself and the limits I will have to live by. 

I have a feeling that if I were able to engage more about my illness, I would be able to normalize it. Or at least not almost cry every time someone asks me how I'm doing. 

I would like to start small: maybe start engaging online and gradually move to in person.

125,"I've recently moved back home after uni, and found out that my mum, who retired about a year ago, isn't washing regularly it seems. It's bad enough that you can smell her across the room sometimes. My family tells me this has been gradually getting worse over a year or two. However, things are not straight forward.


She has been a functioning (or semi-functioning) alcoholic for as long as i can remember. She is also incredibly argumentative and gets very verbally abusive if she's been drinking, and she'll hold a grudge so she can vent when she next has a drink. I'm over a decade young than my siblings, and she's been like this for all of their lives too. What this means, is that everyone in my immediate family will not argue with her, or disagree with her if she gets aggravated. Nobody will challenge her or dare mention her drinking problem (and by extension the hygiene issue), they've given up essentially. They've been telling me to ""not let it bother me"" and ""just don't argue with her, it's not with it"" for all of my life. I feel like not only would i be alone if i challenged or mentioned this, but the rest of my family would actively try to stop me. It goes without saying, if i brought this up with her she would deny she had any problems what so ever (despite the fact the smell is so bad sometimes i have to stop breathing through my nose or it'll knock me sick) and she'll become *very* angry


I want to help her, as I'm pretty she's getting depression. Lack of care of appearance is a classic symptom, and she's getting agoraphobia it seems. Not to mention the other health problems she had that she refuses to even acknowledge. But after a childhood of being told by everyone that you should never fight back against her, and dealing with the rubbish she used to accuse you of whilst drunk (and she make you sit and listen to her rant and shout for literally an hour or more in one go, every other night), i cant face dealing with her on my own, but I've not resigned myself to just not bothering with her anymore. I guess this is more rant than question, but is there anything i can do? Or should i just leave her be?




Tl:dr (kinda) functioning alcoholic mum has stopped washing or seeing friends, i want to get her help but she has a history of vehemently denying anything negative about her and accusing you of attacking her, then drinking and verbally abusing you for hours. Entire family have never stood up to her and told me to do the same, sometimes siding with her to achieve this. I don't feel like i can stand up to her on my own.

130,"Hey guys,

First things first I live in the UK so advice pertaining to my tiny corner of the world would be appreciated.

Basically, my job is in the events industry and has both a 9-5 office work part and the necessity to occasionally work longer hours and weekends for events. 

My contract (without getting into specifics) says that when working longer hours than usual I would not get paid overtime and each day I have to work on a weekend (or other days off) I would get half a day time off in lieu.

We have an event coming up which would require me to work on a bank holiday and I am wondering two things:

1. If I were to argue for a full day in lieu or for full compensation for every weekend I work do I have a leg to stand on?

2. If I said that I would only work the bank holiday for a full day in lieu do I have any type of leg to stand on?

135,"Okay, Here we go. 

I am 25 years old with a birthday quickly approaching. This terrifies me because I promised myself (when I was about 16) that by age 25 I would be well established in life and at least what I deemed successful. 

* Have a psychology degree (at least an AA). 

* Have one of my novels published.

* Some type of recognition for my Artwork (I'm also a painter). 

* And comfortably paying my bills without struggle. 

None of these things have happened.  

At the age of 17 I dropped out of College my freshmen year (why? why? why?!) So no credits earned. I pissed away the next three years living with my mother and doing absolutely nothing with my energy and youthfulness (not even a job). I knew the goals I wanted to accomplish. I've known since I was a kid what I wanted to do with my life. So why wasn't I doing them with my free time?

I got Married at 22 (didn't see that coming) and we had our beautiful son. My Husband specifically asked that I raise our baby until his speech developed (he was a very late talker and we didn't want to send him to daycare until he could communicate with us). I said fine and did the stay-at-home mom thing. This was another almost two years worth of me sitting around with a little time in between not doing anything contributing toward my goals. I don't blame my husband or my baby. I know I'm a procrastinator. I was a failure long before they came along. I watch my younger family members graduating college and I feel so left behind. I like to feel like I'm slightly intelligent and talented so why can't I accomplish these REACHABLE dreams? Or why WONT I? 

We are trying to buy a house now and he wants more kids but I'm afraid of doing all these 'new' things without having accomplished my old dreams. I keep trying to change my hair/clothes so I can feel like I'm keeping up with this fast moving life but my birthday (in August)  Will be a huge smack in the face that I haven't done ANYTHING. I keep looking up high paying jobs that only take a little bit of schooling so I don't feel so bad about college.  I'm pushing to help buy this house so I can feel like I'm doing something, anything that has a blue ribbon at the end. So I can say: Yay! I accomplished something!

Please help me. No (fishing for attention) here guys. I really do feel like a failure and procrastinator. I feel like I'm running out of time to be youthful and happy.

My aunt has actually tried to reach out to my mother multiple times over the past 10 years, just asking how we are doing and filling her in on how my cousins were doing. My mother immediately contacted her back saying ""do not contact me or my kids ever again"". Why? Beats me. 
So, with this discovery, I want so badly to contact my Aunt. I don't even know where to start. The best way to contact her is through FB messenger, and I think giving the disclaimer that she does not have to talk if she doesn't want to is a good idea, too.

This is due to budget cuts and my program no longer being offered at my school.  The degree is in Automation Technology.  And now the school is only offering renewable energies and electronics certificates.  The majority of the classes I need to graduate with my automation degree are being axed.  They are willing to substitute some classes but in doing so I'll have an ""Automation Tech"" degree with renewable energies credits.  

I asked if this would effect my ability to continue to a 4 year college to finish out my degree and get the bachelors in automation tech.  Their answer...  Possibly but depends on the school.  They are PUSHING for me to finish but I honestly do not think finishing with this school is going to help me down the line.

165,"Recently, several friends of mine suddenly started to ignore me with no explanation. Just totally out of the blue. One day, I was chatting with them like normal. The next, they just totally stopped responding to all attempts at communication, or at best, responded with one liners. I can tell they are reading my messages, but not responding (ever). I don't mean ""not responding immediately"" but they just do not respond...ever. Not the next day or the next week. 

E.G. I message a friend once, he doesnt respond but i can tell he read my message. Several hours later, i send a second message asking ""hey, are you free to talk now?"". Again, he reads it, but doesnt respond. A week later, he is still not responding to any of my messages.

I know they arent busy because they are still talking to mutual friends and hanging out with them. One of them only talks to me when he wants help with something, but otherwise just ignores my messages or pretends to have not received them. When he does message me, he acts super nice and pretends that he didnt get my messages, etc, but the moment I finish helping him with something, he goes back to ignoring me again.

One other guy will only respond with random gibberish like ""my pool is on fire"" or ""my fish are drowning"".

I cannot think of anything that I might have done to cause this, since the last time I spoke to them, all was fine. We did not have an argument or anything. Its honestly baffling. None of our mutual friends who still speak to me has any clue either, or if they do, they aren't talking.

I have had issues with a certain stalker before and my friends who stopped talking to me are friends with the stalker and/or his friends. I have a suspicion this is somehow related, but I dont have any proof and the people in the know aren't talking obviously. But its the only thing that I can think of.

Especially since the stalker's friends started cozying up to a group of my friends right before this happened...and now those friends are either ignoring me outright or talking to me a LOT less. The timing is very ""coincidental"" to say the least. The friends in that group who still speak to me are either being very evasive when I ask them if anything is wrong, or saying they dont know anything. But we definately dont talk like before ever since the stalker's friends started to cozy up to them.

Personally, Im pretty sure that the stalker's friends are badmouthing me to my friends and convincing them to stop associating with me somehow.

Im not sure what I can or should do. If i leave things alone, its obviously going to get worse...but communication is a two way street and if they don't respond, I can't do anything. And all our mutual friends are just saying they dont know anything, etc.

A told me that she was with this dude (I don't know where they were or what they were doing) and that he pulled her pants down and I guess he straight up raped her. And here's where things get hard. Appearently his mom knows he raped her, and is trying to blackmail A into pressing charges on him. But A is scared of what he will do and has EXTREMELY controlling parents, so she would end up getting in trouble (because I'm guessing she was high when this happened).

He's asked me for money more than once when things are really tight for me lately--and he knows that. He's also gotten into a habit of railroading other people's plans.

I've been avoiding him, but I'm noticing that I bitch about him to mutual friends quite a lot. Whenever he says pretty much anything in the group chat we've got, my brain twists it to make it seem like he's the worst person.

I've been through this before with another friend and spent over a year not speaking to her. I'm noticing the same tendencies to pull away and just get pissed off super easily.

I was polite, acknowledged that he may not have even noticed that he was doing this, and just asked him not to do it this one time. He flipped out and got extremely defensive.

How do I bring up these issues with him? And if I can't do that or if it doesn't go well, how can I learn to just ignore him and not get pissed off all the time?

173,"**title should say ""ten days of leave""**

Hey guys! 
I really hopes this get some answers (or even one good one). 

Anyways, five days ago was the first day of spring quarter. I immediately asked my professor if I could move her final from Friday to Monday or Tuesday because my finance is deployed and I haven't seen him in six months and the only time he's able to get leave is during finals well in June. She said she'd think about it. 

Well, today is Friday, the end of the first week of the quarter and I asked her about her thoughts. 

She said if she were to move it for me she would have to move it for the rest of the class and would also have to move her vacation. 

Okay, now for my question 

Prefaced with **she is a brand new professor** 

I want to email and ask her if I can find another professor, or even the department head, to proctor the exam if I could take it early. That way she wouldn't have to move her vacation. But I don't know how to get across that I have a legitimate reason to .I've the final and am willing to work on stuff early and give up opportunity for questions because she o
Wouldn't be there if I had any during the exam. 

I need a way to convey that I am willing to find someone to proctor and I have legitimate reasoning to move my final, unlike the rest of the class who just want to move it because they don't want a final on Friday. 

How do I convey that in an email without being an asshole? 

As you can tell I'm bad at wording things...

Edit** I also I want to email her after already asking because due to her being a new professor I'm not sure she thought about these options... ",07Apr2017,1
174,"The following paragraphs are very messy and jumbled, sorry in advance.

I'm 29M and live with my father in a single room in an isolated location. He is a Christian fundamentalist and I am unable to communicate much wi thhim or display interest in things he disagrees with due to fear of offending his belief system. My alternative is living with my mother who is a hoarder and whose home smells like cat piss and shit. I have no friends to ask for help while I try to find an alternative accommodation. I don't think my parents have yet accepted that I will never be normal. Youre a bit more than a late bloomer when you're nearly in your 30s ha. This the core problem I am looking for advice with.

I think I have some type of anxiety and am not able to communicate with strangers or relatives and have trouble in the workplace.. I lost my only ever job a year ago I think because of my non-existent social skills. Unfortunately both of my parents are poor (by Western standards - I do acknowledge that things could be much worse for us financially.) My mother is soon going to be homeless (since she is not the owner of the home she hoards in.) I had a lot of trouble with bullying and racism in school which I think was the main problem

I'm not sure about how to proceed. The first most obvious answer is to get a new job and rent somewhere interstate, but my ability to communicate is very poor and I don't think an employer is going to see benefit to having me for this reason (also due to very weak qualifications and history.) My English language skills and general intelligence have been getting worse and worse, it's driving me crazy, it's like my thinking is blacking out and I can't think things through properly, which I guess is because I'm not using my brain enough? Thankfully I have no access to drugs and alcohol, I would lose my mind with addiction lol

The second option is death, but I am not sure about how I could carry it out. I fear making a mistake with hanging and suffering for it and am unable to obtain a gun or carbon monoxide inhalation equipment. But I am thinking that the fear of pain should not be an issue if someone really wants to die? I am also concerned about leaving my parents. My mother is extremely protective of me and would not take my death well.

I'm posting here for some ideas for how I can proceed. I understand that nobody will recommend the second option and that is ok. But as for the first option, I guess I need  to find some sort of job without human contact or control my anxiety (posting this is making me shake a lot lol). How do you get help for these things when you are unable to even talk to people lol,, also note my father disagree with therapy/psych stuff so I can't let him know

What can you guys recommend to a. cure anxiety, b. find a low contact job, c. get into some alternative accommodation

Sorry for such a rambling post. I've seen people on here with awful miserable existences and know that having a roof over your head and people to supply you with food and drink is better than a lot have it. and I'm sorry I can't offer advice in return.. I'm a manchild and cant help myself a lot of the time.

175,"I'm 21, and like a lot of people in my generation, websites like Reddit and YouTube are a big part of my life. There's something addicting about endless feeds of easily digestible content, and I've found these websites easy to get sucked into. I've had focus issues for a lot of my life, and I want to start taking the steps to use these websites less while building my focus skills.

It's gotten so bad that if there is a phone in my room, I'll start the day with an hour of browsing /r/all or watching YouTube videos in bed. It's hard to quit when I start, because I don't have the willpower/discipline/self-control to use them in moderation. I've lost so much time doing this, and I want to fix it.

When I've tried to quit them cold turkey, I've felt this craving for them throughout the day. I'm so used to distractions filling my day that I don't have many healthy ways to relax. My leisure time is mostly spent on meaningless time sinks, so quitting them has created this void me. My attention span is so bad that I have trouble sitting through TV shows and movies, too.

I'm a 22/M. I go to a small university in my city and last year I follow this girl on Instagram because she was really pretty and seemed super cool. She also goes to my university but she doesn't know I exist. We both have mutual friends according to Instagram.


Is it weird to message her on Instagram to become friends? I'm honestly not looking for anything more than friends, she just seems chill and we share a few similar interests in music, and she's super into nutrition/fitness (I am too a little).


All I'm looking for is a friend, how do I write to her in a way where she doesn't think I'm just ""sliding in her DMs"" ? It really doesn't help that she's really pretty. lol


On her Instagram she does post a lot of stories about open invites for people to do things. (hiking, concert, etc.)

180,"So, i browsing the local Gigs section on craigslist and saw a post with the title ""Kill Me"". After reading the short post it was a person looking to hire somebody to have them killed. So i reached out to this person just offering any help I could, just a person to listen to them because i know things get tough sometimes. I talked to this person for maybe 2 days and the entire time i'm just trying to convince them that life is worth living. She has 3 kids but is severely depressed. She had tried to commit suicide in the past but failed she told me. Then last night she messages me saying ""it was nice knowing you i found somebody"" and then didint text me back for a while. So i reached out to the police department in her area and asked for an officer to be sent over for a welfare check. (I had gotten her address in an earlier convo)
So I get a call back from a police officer about an hour later asking to confirm the address because the officer said he went up to the apartment number i had said and the person who answered the door said that wasint her name and she had no idea what the officer was talking about. (as i'm on the phone with the officer my phone lights up and its the woman texting me cursing at me and saying terrible things because i called the police) So she lied to the officer saying she had no idea what was going on. 
She has been sending me threatening emails since the incident saying that now this is ""war"". I don't personally believe what i did was wrong, I was trying to look out for the life of another. I'm just kind of stuck here on what to do. I would like to remove myself from the situation all together, some people just cant be helped.

189,"Last summer i wanted to buy a car as my partner was selling his and it would leave us without a vehicle. We both work somewhere that there is no public transport to so it is important that there is a car for the household. As my partner and I are saving for a house, my mom very graciously purchased my chosen car in cash for 7.5k under the agreement we would pay her back when the house purchase was complete and we'd re-stocked our savings.

The particular house we are buying needs a new.. everything. The current occupant has carried out some questionable DIY and we need to essentially fix everything he has done. This includes some minor structural works and installing/removing and reinstalling correctly some vital facilities. This means we need a new kitchen, to complete a half-assed bathroom, install a second bathroom (not a priority, as long as we have one), build a supporting wall, and complete a closed porch that has not been damp-proofed or insulated. We also need to install a heating system because, though the property was built with one installed, it has been removed and not replaced. The majority of these need to be done really quite quickly.

We sat down with our current savings and worked out what money we have in cash, what money we can build by living frugally and doing overtime, and how long it would take us to do what we want to do (5 years, with 30k - roughly). The payback to the car was factored into this. 

I called my mom to ask for her bank details to arrange the repayment as the money from my partner's car sale came through, and she has declined to provide her details. She said she doesn't want the money, that we can use it more, she doesn't need it etc. But my partner doesn't want to accept it to the point it is seriously stressing him out, he can't even talk about it. He doesn't like being indebted to someone.

I can assure that this money from my mom comes without strings attached. But i respect my partner's wish to want to do this alone (although he had no problem accepting 1.5k from his family as a housewarming gift). I am so torn on what to do. If this were someone else telling me they had been offered this money to use on their new house requiring extensive renovation, i would tell them to take it and not look a gift horse in the mouth. But i feel immensely guilty about accepting (I don't feel like I deserve this money and I'm concerned about my partner's feelings) and just conflicted over the whole thing.

191,"I am going on 22 and I have an amazing career that I am building. It has become pretty much all I can think about and I revolve all of my decisions in life based off of it. I don't consider myself overly consumed by it, as I do make time for friends and enjoy spending time with them and mostly forget about it when I'm with them, but I have lost interest in all of my actual hobbies in favor of it and I consider my only hobby outside of socializing with my small circle of friends to be working. I don't feel as though I miss any of my old hobbies, and in fact, they make me miserable now and I don't get any joy out of them at all, only stress. I feel as if it is time to grow up and quit being a child and engaging in meaningless and unproductive hobbies, but I have not forced myself to quit them or lose interest, I just have. I don't see the incentive anymore. I usually only really focused on one thing at a time before and only had one real hobby at a time and maybe a couple of minor things on the side, but I feel that my focus should be on my career and I feel good about myself when I focus on it. I have forgone dating too because I view my career as being more important and I view dating as a distraction. I can't even force myself to take any interest in any of these things. I love my independence and the freedom to do what I want with my life, and I feel like dating and nonsensical hobbies tie me down. I am making great money for someone my age and love being free to do with it as I please and not spending it on things that I feel do not benefit me, such as hobbies. I view dating as more of glorified babysitting based off of past experiences, and I am a person who greatly values time to myself and the freedom of not having to take care of someone else. I have never felt a strong need for companionship and grew up an only child that was used to entertaining and taking care of myself. I also have completely changed who I am as a person and I was someone I am very ashamed of now, and I feel as though I should throw away all old remnants of my past, which include my former hobbies. I feel like having any associations with my past at all will not allow me to become the person I want to be, and I have realized that I do not relate to nor agree with, or even like a lot of the people I met from one of my old hobbies, so I want to disassociate myself from them.

193,"Hey guys! I don't usually post on Reddit (throwaway because I'm self-conscious about stuff), and have been confused on an issue since, maybe mid-January.

Basically, I want to find a new job, but feel hindered because of my choice of major and illness (pilonidal cyst, google at your own risk)

Bit of history: I **only** majored in East Asian Languages and Culture from a big ten school with a focus in Chinese (I was led to believe by only majoring in Chinese, I would not have to worry about a job, turns out this is not entirely true). I was part of a prestigious program for learning Chinese, but never completed it due to not maintaining a ~3.45 GPA. Coming out of college, I had a higher level of Chinese, but nowhere near native-speaker.

Once I graduated, I worked abroad in China as an English teacher for about a year. My time there really helped make my Chinese more colloquial, and the job was okay, just some management issues. I wouldn't mind doing it again, but it definitely would not be my first choice.

Now I'm back stateside and working at an insurance agency. I'm still using my Chinese, but one of my bosses is really making things difficult (blaming us for mistakes we didn't make, not giving us a consistent schedule, some verbal put-downs and has even physically touched me in an aggressive way (she poked me, I know it sounds lame, but it was a jabbing poke that she gave me because I messed something up, even though I immediately corrected it)). I can't talk to any higher-ups because the only other higher-up here is this other bosses boyfriend.

I'd like to find a job that uses my Chinese somehow, but I'm also losing confidence in my Chinese. I'm only using it to talk about insurance. So I've come to two options:

1. Go back to school to pursue another major. It's not entirely in my budget, but might be worth it in the end. Other thing is, I'm not sure what I'd major in. Absolutely have no interest in business. I like helping others a lot, so I was thinking maybe education?

2. Join the Air Force and try to nab a linguist job. The pay isn't the best but the benefits seem decent. This option would have me relearning Chinese, so that way I have a better foundation, but also requires a 4-6 year commitment.

To add on top of this, I don't really have anyone close to talk to this about or hangout with in general. I'm back in my high school hometown living with my parents, and all my old friends are far away, so I'm fairly lonely as of late.

Any advice on ANY aspect of this situation would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading through all of this in the first place!

194,"Im 19 years old and I'm in an apprenticeship program where we get paid to learn a trade and go to school. However, you can stop academics after a year of being here and just graduate with a certificate in the trade instead of continuing the academics. 

The academic part is very competitive, it takes 4 years, you have to be selected and meet certain criteria after a year of qualifying to continue, you only get an associates degree and there is no guarantee you will get it even after your hard work to meet the criteria. But the tuition is 100% paid for by the company so you're debt free. 

My dad is stressing the degree part so much and I know he has a valid point. It won't look good (especially for an African American man like myself) to be in my early 30s one day with no college education and I may need it to fall back on if I get laid off or fired one day. Im currently making 21 dollars an hour and by the time I complete the apprenticeship ill be making over 60 grand a year at 23 years old. Most college graduates are in debt with a useless degree at that age. Also we get guaranteed raises and apprentices can't get laid off. 

My aunt has a good job, has a house, drives a lexus, and she has no college degree.. So I'm starting to see a mix of opinions here.. is getting a degree THAT important? People obviously succeed without it.. What is the reality of it?

200,"So about 2 weeks ago I had a virgin media technician come to my house to install my broadband and telephone line. However after he had completed the job and left I went to close the window he left open only to realise he had broken the hinge by opening the window too far with too much force, ignoring the button that extended the window. Adding on to this he didn't even complete his job as he had used our neighbours line, cut theirs and installed ours. Due to this I called up virgin media and was told another technician would come back the next day. After waiting around 12 hours since the morning, I called them again and complained again about my broken window and was told to pay for a repair and I would get refunded. I called back again to make sure this was definitely the case to which I was told it was. So after being desperate to have my window fixed since it was extremely cold and rain kept pouring in, I looked through google to find a company who would fix my hinge. As I had no previous knowledge on any companies that do this sort of job I called up a few companies and was told they either didn't do it or wouldn't be able to come to my area. So I found 2 people who were willing to do the job and so after waiting I decided on the first one who would come the quickest to repair my window hinge. The next day 3 men from this company come and fix my hinge however they charged me ¬£440 which for 2 hinges on a window seemed extremely expensive but I thought since I had no knowledge on this that this was ok and that I would be getting a refund either way as long as I got a receipt. So I asked them for a receipt after they finished and was emailed an invoice and they left my house. I called back virgin media and was then told that I should have actually waited as someone would have come to check the damage and they would have had it fixed for me to which I told them that I was told differently by 2 others a day before. So the next day a technician comes to fix the problems with my broadband and takes my pictures of the damage and I gave him the emailed receipt I got. After waiting weeks and weeks I was told 2 days ago that the receipt I got was a fraudulent receipt and that the company on the receipt does not exist and so I was really confused. So I gave the contact numbers of the company to the investigations team and they called them up however the company denies that they ever did the job at my house and so because of this I am unable to receive my refund of ¬£440. I called up the company myself and they kept denying me of the truth and kept saying that they never did fix my hinges. So now I have lost ¬£440 from being over charged and am not able to receive my refund and it all just feels extremely horrible all because of 1 damaged window. So I am asking for anyone in the Reddit community for any advice on what I can do, I doubt my bank can help since it has been 2 weeks as I made the payment by debit card, and virgin media won't help at all.

203,"I just kinda fell off a cliff with Spanish. I hate it and I'm terrible at it so my grades slipped pretty bad. Told me dad and he's been calling me names and yelling at me about it these past three days. I can't even have a civil conversation with him because it devolves into him yelling and getting in my face, calling me an idiot and telling me I won't succeed. Then just randomly at the dinner table he brings it up again and starts yelling about it, putting me down and said he doesn't care about how I do in school and that he never really did, but then when I called him out on it, he said that I'm ""a motherfucking idiot and that I need to use my goddamn brain,"" because if he didn't care he wouldn't be getting mad. I mean, I kinda get that, but then why would he say he never really cared? I told him that if he doesn't care about me, then why should I care about doing better for him? He took that as me saying that if he doesn't care about my grade then neither should I. He's just sort of stuck with that and won't listen when I try to get him to see he's wrong. And he calls *me* stubborn. 

Also he said I'm depressed??? But I know I'm not. All my friends have depression and I don't see anything like that in myself. Also I probably should have added, I'm passing all my other classes with A's and B's this is my third and final Spanish class thank god. In every one, in every semester, I've had trouble, grades slipped bad, then brought them back up at the last minute. I think he's tired of it, but I can't see how his reaction and his way of ""telling me like it is"" would help me......

He's not being abusive, don't even go *there.* Any other time he's pretty nice and loving, but when it comes down to my Spanish grade he can be a bit scary and his constant putting me down has caused me to want to try to pick myself back up even less. I want to tell him I can do better and that I'm trying, but he'll only tell me he doesn't believe me, so I'm keeping my feelings about it to myself. My mom seems to agree with him about all of this, so I'm kind of alone.

My only option at this point is to just improve my grade and prove them wrong, not just because that's what I need to do, but because my dad is literally threatening to destroy my entire final summer in high school through whatever he has hidden up his sleeve if I fuck up one more time. I don't want that, and I want to fix my Spanish grade. But now I kinda feel like I can't do it even when I tell myself I can. I'm wanting to just say ""fuck it"" and spend all my time on other things. What I wanna know is how do I deal with my dad? How do I let him know how much he's hurting me? And how do I deal with myself and what I'm feeling?

TL;DR: I'm terrible at Spanish and failing it again, my dad has been pissed for 3 days. He's tired of me failing and picking it back up at the last minute, so he's been yelling at me and calling me an idiot, putting me down all the time, etc. Not understanding how his reaction is him caring about me even though that's what he says it is. Mom agrees with his reaction. I feel a bit alone in this situation. I know I have to fix my grade and I want to, but I feel like I can't.

209,"Hey everyone, I'm an 18 year old whose gap year is ending in May as I take an EMT-B class at my local community college. 

Right now, I'm working at Cold Stone and an irish pub, both in the same shopping center. I'm also volunteering 12-24 hours a week with my local ambulance service. When the EMT class starts, I need to drop a job. I'm not dropping volunteering because it's an essential part of my plan to get into med school/get a job as an EMT while in college. Both jobs have pros and cons. I'm leaning towards staying at cold stone but I want to get some perspective.

Cold Stone

Pros:
* I'm in charge when the boss isn't there (he's only in shop around 3-5 hours that I work per week, so I'm in charge a LOT and I like it)

* Coworkers my age

* $10 an hour

* Work schedule is very flexible and I never work at night since the high schoolers work then

* Since I'm often in charge of the shop I have plenty of work to do. Also fun when people come into the shop for weird stuff and I don't have to just ask for the manager to deal with it.

* Tips aren't bad. Average $10 a day

Cons:

* Unlikely I will be promoted to an official manager position

* Boss can be a GIANT prick at times, very nice at others

* The work sucks. It's sticky and cold and physically demanding.

* Customers at an ice cream shop are a different breed altogether. Incredibly demanding, demeaning, and entitled. Plus I'm really introverted so dealing with the customer from start to finish all day takes a huge toll on my energy.

* It's a franchise so I have to wear all the franchise gear and the music sucks :(

Irish Pub

Pros:

* I will be promoted to a server position at some point over the summer and be able to make tips

* Boss is Irish and hilarious

* Whole crew has a really nice vibe

* I don't deal with customers tooooooo much, and they're usually more civilized than at Cold Stone

* Small business, so it doesn't have the whole franchise vibe. 

Cons:

* Server wages. Unreliable income.

* Most of my coworkers are much older than me and it's very hard for me to be friendly with them because of it.

* I'm not ever in charge

* Work is INCREDIBLY boring when slow

What do you guys think? I'm leaning towards Cold Stone, but it also kind of sucks working there. Both are just food service at the end of the day",07Apr2017,1
212,"I've been giving head to this guy and we've been use durex latex flavored condoms (the first time we didn't use a flavored one). Consistently a couple of hours later I'm always getting a sore throats afterwards. I love giving head though, could the latex be the source of the problem with my sore throats or the fact that it's flavored? I have no idea. Is the latex to blame? We are thinking about using non latex condoms like Skyn so this won't happen anymore.",07Apr2017,1
213,"Hi all, I'm 13 and I sing RENT a lot in my room. I don't have a lock and so my brother filmed me singing and has it on his Snapchat. I just feel that he'll blackmail me or something. My life is now just paranoia of him coming and leaking it.",07Apr2017,3

218,"So I work at a restaurant and I attended a girl that sparkled my attention fuse. I've thinking about her way too much lately and been wondering what I could do to try and actually get to know her. 

I'm super shy at these situations and the best I could think of was to simply hand her a paper ticket with my name and phone number, while saying something funny (but not bold, y'know?) hoping that she'd actually send me a message. 
Something like ""Excuse me lady, if you have any suggestion to our customer service please send a message to this number"" with a humurous tone to it would do.

 This really sounds ridiculous to me but I don't know what else to do!",07Apr2017,1
220,"17 year old family member tried to overdose this week, and, although he was caught in time this time, still professes a desire to die. He admits to taking every drug he can get his hands on (except meth or crack). He's in a psych facility for now, but they say they will only keep him 7-10 days. What is our best course of action to help him? To complicate matters, there was someone who parked down the road last night and then prowled the yard of the family home, which is waaay out in the country. Dog alerted, and whoever it was left in a hurry, but family is scared it might be a drug dealer, since teen admits he was taking delivery at the house. Family is looking into purchase of a gun and wildlife camera, security lights for protection. Any further suggestions?",07Apr2017,1
221,"So the past week I haven't been hungry at all, I don't know why but I just haven't wanted to eat anything and If I do its a few small bites here and there but I've literally been forcing myself to eat, I'm actually genuinely becoming worried about this partially because I have fought with anorexia off and on for several years now ",07Apr2017,1
223,"I am currently an 18-year-old female that gets calls from a person with a masked caller ID rather frequently. Sometimes I'll get a day with no incidents, but I'll often get these calls once or even multiple times per day. Usually, I  ignore it, but one time my dad answered the phone to get to the bottom of this only to find...not even answer whoever's on the other side just hung up as soon as my dad spoke. But they just keep calling and it's getting annoying especially one incident a few days ago where they try to call immediately after I decline to answer where I finally snapped and Googled how to stop the calls without paying for some overpriced service to identify and block it. So I set it up to only allow calls from people listed in my contacts...and I got a call only a few short hours ago? I'm getting really worried now so I'm just here to ask if there's a way to finally end these spam calls from people who wants who knows what from me

Update: Thank you for the advice , but I didn't take any of it...because the calls stopped as soon as I wrote the post. Again, this is just the weirdest thing I've experienced only seconded by texts calling me ""possum"" from another unknown number (which I blocked since I was able to).",07Apr2017,4
224,"So, my car was parked in the back of my house. To get to the back, you have to come down an alley that leads to the parking behind my house, the house next to me, and this small apartment complex at the end. Its a dead end. Today I noticed someone put a bunch of pennies, nickles and a few dimes on the trunk of my car. The other day while I was driving, I took a turn and heard change hit the ground but figured I had just drove over some change. My roommate who's window is stuck down on his car, had a giant cup of change taken out of his car a week ago. Also, two of my old roommates who recently moved out, and I were not getting along almost to the point where I was afraid they might physically do something to me. 

Has anyone ever heard of this or any ideas as to why someone would put change on my trunk? It wasn't on any of the other cars and it kind of scratched my trunk a little bit.",07Apr2017,2
225,"Okay  
So I'm a teen in high school that got playing a game on the school computers and thus had my account blocked. I didn't realise it was blocked until the next day when i failed to log in.  
I went to the IT department who long story short told me i shouldn't play games. I let it slip i downloaded it by suggesting ""Should i delete the files?""  
They tried to score me by saying how i could have gotten viruses on all the servers and the school would be broke! (Not my fault they don't have an antivirus) they also told me how they'd be keeping a close eye on me the week back after we return from the vacation (2 weeks starting today)  
So i ALSO happen to have some OTHER files which are 100% not appropriate (not porn) labeled ""DONT OPEN THIS.mp4""  
An episode of sponge Bob as a joke  
Our school has also blocked access to the recycle bin however my friend told me there's a way to access it somehow but i don't know yet.  
So what do I do:  
A- delete all the files ASAP and hope they don't watch and/or keep track of my recycle bin (assuming they go there at all)  
Or B- Leave it as is and hope they never check my files for strange sponge Bob episodes.  
I am legitimately concerned because they threatened to block my access to all devices at school which would be a HUGE burden to my school life because of how much i rely upon PCs for my school work, not to mention all my files would be gone. Shit.  
What do i do???  
Tl;Dr: Should i delete my innapropriate files or hope they are never found??? ",07Apr2017,2
227,"I just turned 18 and would like some life and college advice.

*current situation* 
I just turned 18. Currently living with my Single Mom and 4 Younger Siblings Ageing 2-17. We just recently moved states and aren't in the best financial situation. We are currently living on paycheck to paycheck. As I'm just finishing my last year in highschool I can only work 20-30 hours a week. currently working in a grocery store at 9.50 an hour and subtract all the tax and union fees comes out to roughly 7 an hour. most of my paycheck goes to help the family.

I'm now looking into colleges and will be doing 2 years at a community college than afterwards finish my bachelor's or masters at a university. I know what field of work I want to go into but don't know the specific area. I have a massive passion for working in the financial field. I'm really good with numbers and mathematics (I memorized the first 400 digits of Pi cause I was bored one day).I handle most of my family's finances since the age of 16. I thought about getting my bachelor's in ""Accounting and Finance"" as I took an accounting class every year in highschool and seem to enjoy it. but I know the pay isn't as good as other available options. I looked into fianance related jobs and can't quite put my finger on what's my best fit. I was interested in the ""Actuary"" Field as well but it looks like it might be a difficult route if I do 2 years at a Community College.

I don't have any intent on moving out for another 2-3 years. I'm looking for a job in the finance feild that can put me on 60-80k salary after college and within years climb up the ladder quickly. I'm not in it for the money but with my mind and ""skill"" in this field I believe I can make a lot as I am dedicated to anything I put my mind to. 

anyone recommend a field in the finance area I should look into?
this might look like a wierd post and definitely not written out the best as I'm writing this on the bus home.",07Apr2017,1
229,I recently asked a girl to our school prom but she said she didn't want to go to prom at all because she didn't want to be around a bunch of stuck up people. She then began to be really apologetic. Should I try asking her if she would like to go somewhere else?,07Apr2017,1
230,"Hey all, sorry about this fairly specific problem, focused on academics and finance.

I'm entering a creative writing master's program, and I am choosing between 2.

Option a.) Tuition waiver (normally 28k cost first year) + stipend for the first year, likely to get a similar deal for the second and third year out of work study (tuition typically 24k cost for 2nd and 3rd year combined total). Faculty and program interests align slightly worse with my personal interests, but still pretty good.

Option b.) No tuition waiver (meaning ~20k cost the first year, 8k cost the second) but high likelihood of stipend. Faculty and program preferences align with my interests very well. My parents are very generous, however, and willing to pay for all.

Normally, Option A would be a no brainer for someone going to grad school for creative writing; however, my parents are very adamant about paying for my education, so I don't necessarily *need* to worry about cost. Option B is in most ways a small step above Option A, with professors I like a bit more and a slightly better selection of classes. However, it seems they won't comp tuition, though they've led me to believe that I'm a shoe-in for a Graduate Assistantship. All other things being equal (because they mostly are), is there a better choice here?

So, in other words, should I take the full-ride, or let my parents shell out for an education that's a step up?

I feel like dirt asking my parents to pay for something that I could get for free at a lower quality, but at the same time, this is something that would ideally shape my career path and my life, and I'm fortunate to have parents who aren't bothered by the cost. Anyway, I've been going around in circles on this, and I could use an outside perspective. I thought I'd ask a well-populated subreddit. Any thoughts?

tl;dr: Program A is a tuition waiver +stipend, but the program is slightly worse, Program B offers just a stipend and slightly better quality, but my parents will pay tuition. What do?",07Apr2017,0
232,"I'm prior military with PTSD diagnosis. In January 2015 I left a marriage from an extremely violent woman (put me through 2 surgeries), and moved back with my dad. In May of 2015 I got into college, and the same week I started classes my father passed (only parent, and only close connection left in my life). I got off to a good start in college, but then I noticed I was slipping and the weight of my past was catching up to me.

I started attending counseling by August 2015 ranging from grief groups to individual trauma recovery (which I still attend weekly to this day). Each semester from then on I slowly started dropping classes down from full time. I'm doing a software engineering degree, and my tuition and housing is paid for, but I'm currently only taking 1 class, and I can't motivate myself to do more because I'm depressed all the time and feel worthless. 

I felt lonely and started dating heavily and still do to this day. I've talked to hundreds of women in the last 2 years, and had 2 serious relationships. The last serious relationship left me emotionally crippled a month ago, and she still uses me for sex at her convenience. I was so motivated while I was with her and happy, she included me with her family and friends and we traveled and did everything together and then she completely changed once she realized how ""clingy"" I was.

I'm still so focused on finding someone mutually interested, but I'm so sick of being ghosted, lied to, used for attention then discarded, used for financial support then discarded, used for sex... I have no problem with confidence and picking up a woman, but honestly every single one I've put effort into when there was chemistry it ends up going to shit. After each girl I talk to I usually end up losing a bit more hope in myself and future. I'm not a big person, but I now take twice the normal dosage of ambien just to barely get 3-5 hours of sleep a night.

I have worked at various jobs, all of which I was not happy with the pay and really the quality and end up quitting. I recently applied at dozens of jobs, and got an interview. They ended up swapping the internship job on me once I got there, and I reluctantly accepted the job just to stay busy and try go get my mind off the girl I fell in love with. I'm now working a night shift supervisor position for UPS at 15.55$ an hour and honestly I don't see myself there for more than another month before I quit. Today I applied at dozens of more jobs.

I have only had 1 consistent and close friend over the last 2 years and she is married with 2 kids, and lives 2 hours away and honestly I feel guilty anytime I talk because I'm just talking about how fucked up the women are that I keep running into. I have the opportunity to go to college for free and get paid for housing. I have benefits that people would kill for. I'm in the best place I've ever been financially in my life, but I've never felt so low and worthless.

I wish I had my father in my life still and I could ask him for advice or just hear his voice again. I wish I had a family, friends, or a girlfriend that would be there for me 110% as I would be for them. I need someone to guide me and push me to get me excited about the future and make them proud. I'm running on fumes and each effort I make in a relationship just sinks me that much lower, but I'm addicted and I don't want to be alone. I am inflicted with so much emotional pain and my thoughts race making it hard to sleep or stay asleep even medicated. I could do so well, but I can't get out of this pit I've been stuck in for so many years, and I keep wishing I could go back and prevent things or change them for the better.",07Apr2017,1
