0,"Im taking JROTC in highschool which is classified as a leadership course and should mimic leadership in the army. My instructor never has any lesson plans and constantly spouts his political views going as far as to wear Obama shirts, socks, sweatshirts, etc while only referring to Trump as ""Pres 45"" claiming he doesnt want to say his name. We never know what we will do in class because its made up on the spot. Today out of nowhere we were told to march for the rest of class, and even when it began to storm and the wind nearly toppled us over, they forced us to stay outside. ",02Mar2017,5
2,"Basically posting this to rant because I try to be an optimist, but lately things have been tough. I'm a high school boy so already my brain is a mess. My mom is and always has been unhappy with her jobs, my stepdad is always fighting with her and is in the process of moving out. My sister is lazy and depressed and right now my moms taking her to the hospital because she's threatening to kill herself again. Some nights (like these) all I wanna do is cry and be held like a baby again. How can I stay positive when nobody in my life is happy?",02Mar2017,7
4,"Earlier this year, a new person attached themselves to my friendship circle. We're a close knit group of 4 people, and she has become a permanent ""member"" of the group so to speak. At first I liked her, but as I've gotten to know her more I have found her increasingly unpleasant to be around. Everybody else seems to get along with her, however.

Reasons why I dislike her: This girl is obnoxiously loud and doesn't like to let others speak. She always has to guide the conversation, and if the topic isn't about her she acts disinterested and quickly changes the subject. She has a serious attitude problem and is constantly bigging herself up, and she tells blatantly bullshit stories of how she ""beat up teachers in high school"" and ""has knocked out people twice her size"". She's also overly defensive and gets really confrontational if you disagree with her on something. She gets butthurt if you correct her on a subject she is uneducated on, and will basically defend her misinformation as fact just so she doesn't have to admit being wrong. She always has to be the center of attention also, and seems to get really bitter if someone else receives attention for longer than her.

It's gotten to the point where just being around her puts me in a bad mood. She is constantly grinding my gears. I daren't say anything against her, because the ""leader/alpha"" of our group has taken a shine to her. I feel like I might look like I'm trying to start drama if I say anything or act indifferent towards this girl. Unfortunately, she is always with us and shows no signs of disappearing any time soon. Her presence is toxic and the group dynamic has changed so much since she joined. But what can I do? I seem to be the only one who feels this way about her. ",02Mar2017,3
6,"Don't know if this is the right place to ask this but, basically my math capability is around the sixth grade, I'm now in the 11th grade. I've already been placed in an alternate school, the lowest level math class, even a private tutor, I still can't grasp the concept, and all of the rules. 

Now here's where it gets tragic, I have very high aspirations but I'm afraid if I can't pass my math class in high school, nonetheless college, I won't have a chance to succeed in my career. 

Just as a bonus question, if my major is Poli. Sci, is there any way I could go my whole college career without touching a math class? ",02Mar2017,1
9,"Last week I heard from a friend (let's call her Stacy) that she never wanted to speak to ever again.  We had been arguing recently, but this seemed way worse than what was going on.  This caught me off-guard, as it would with most people, so I asked what was going on.  She said that in the past I had said to a friend (that she had liked who we will call George) that she was not worth his time.  I immediately thought, ""this is nothing I would ever say.""  But in the heat of the moment, I couldn't put words together to attempt to rationalize any of it.  So my hope was that things will blow over and I can try and get her to understand that these things I am being accused of are not true.  
Since then, Stacy has gone to some of our mutual friends and tried to get them to side against me.   Some have understood and knew that this wasn't me, some not so much. Regardless, I did a little digging, trying to be objective just under the premise that I might have and not remembered, but then I found it: George had said all this crap and thrown it on me.  HE said that she wasn't worth his time.  He wanted to be with her, but when they had a problem, he turned to me and said this stuff (The problem was rather childish to begin with.  The two had been talking for a few months, nudes were exchanged, a rumor started that I had gotten some, wasn't true, told him it wasn't but it was too late.  The lack of trust was too much).

So after finding this conversation and screenshotting it, I decided to share with these friends that had stood with me and ones who didn't, and all agreed that I am telling the truth.  Some of these friends reached out to speak to her, but she won't look at this screenshot nor give me a chance.  Here is where I need the advice reddit: 

1) How do I handle this situation with Stacy?  She turned her back to me, isn't giving me a chance and tried turning our friends against me.  She has blocked me from most social media and what not (I will add that this usually happens if someone sit there and blows up that person's phone like the 4th of July, but I did no do that.  She just did it without me reaching out at all.) I really don't see being friends as an option, but I still really want to prove my innocence in this situation (maybe it's pride, I don't know).

2) How do I handle George?  Most see him now as the snake that he is and I don't/won't see him anytime soon, but I am so pissed about all of this that I am having a hard time staying calm.  I don't want to be irrational and stupid, but I am having a hard time putting it all together.

3) What should I do next in general? Despite being so angry I have found ways to take my mind off things (school work, video games, hanging out with old friends, etc.), but I was wondering if there is anything else I should or could be doing.

Any advice is good advice for me at this point so thank you in advance.  I know it's long but if you need a summary:
tl;dr One friend lied to me to another friend.  She has taken it to be the God-given truth and won't listen to me, despite having proof it's all a lie.  Need help for what's next.",02Mar2017,1
10,"Welp, get ready for a wall of text... Don't even know where to begin.

I'll just start with my back. Starting in high school, I've had a ton of spinal problems. It ended up with me getting a huge spinal surgery in senior year, and still limits what I can do today. I've been told it will limit me indefinitely. BUT, my doctor doesn't think it will be limiting enough to qualify for disability benefits, which I honestly don't want. I can handle a full time job, but working more than that or working a second job is out of the question for me, pain wise.

I started going to community college when I was 18, being told by my parents that they would e able to help me financially. When the semester started and the monthly payments began, I found out they couldn't afford to help anymore because we had to move across town. I tried to pay for the classes myself, only being able to handle a part time job on top of full time school because of the pain. Between transportation, food, books, school payments, etc., I ended up maxing out a $1500 credit card. I am a security guard right now, but I don't enjoy it at all. Kind of miserable, to be honest. I only took it because the pay wasn't terrible.

Early last year, my family and I got in a gigantic fight about my younger sister's learning and behavioral disabilities. They weren't the best at managing here, and I wasn't the best at coping with her. It seemed that the only way we could make it out without completely burning bridges with my family was for me to move out, so I did. I moved in with a couple of friends and everything works well there.

I started dating a guy when I was 17 and he was 21 (I'm a guy too). Things were amazing while we together, but we held out on sex until I was 18. Once we did, we found out how incompatible we were. Here's the problem: we decided to stay together and even got engaged. This past September, I found out he was cheating and just took it as a sign. We broke it off. Unfortunately, having a combined income with him was the only reason we were kind of stable in the way of finances. The other main aspect here is the car I'm driving right now. It's under his name. I make all the car payments, pay for the gas, pay for the maintenance. We have made some agreements, but legally, he could take it back whenever he wanted. If he does, I would be stuck finding a minimum wage job at the shopping center close to where I live as I wouldn't have the credit and/or be able to afford getting a car on my own. Right now, I can only save (or pay money to my credit card) $100 a month, and that's if I choose not to eat every meal.

I have a new boyfriend as of recently. We have been seeing each other for about 3 months now. I really like him, but found out he is moving 9 hours away in May.

There are 3 main wrenches in my life right now: 1) The car. 2) The contract with the stable, full-time location at work I have right now is ending mid-March, meaning after that, I wouldn't have a guarantee of full time. 3) Two of my roommates are planning on moving out in June. The rest of my roommates and I can't afford to stay at this place AND can't afford to end the lease (2 months rent to end it.) The roommates leaving said they would probably pay to end the lease if need be.

Here are my options right now, but I am not really a fan of any of them...:

1. My new boyfriend offered to let me move with him, but I think that is way too fast for me, coming out of a LTR that screwed me over rather recently.

2. I can try to find more roommates to stay with here, but from the way it seems, no matter who/where I live, my financial situation won't change. The big pro with this is the friends I have around here would leave me in a better emotional state.

3. I can move back in with my parents in July (they don't have any room for me atm). It would be better financially, but the stress of the living situation will be a lot higher.

I just don't know what to do. I feel like I am in a lose-lose situation. I feel like I have to choose between my sanity or comfortable finances.",02Mar2017,1
12,"Hello all! Last week I was flown for an interview for this amazing non profit that I really, really hope I can be a part of. It was a 4 hour thing where I did a short presentation, met with 4 key individuals of the organization and I sent a thank you email to each of them saying thank you for the opportunity, along with something unique for each one.

The interview, in my opinion, went amazingly well and I had a great conversation with all of them. I was the first individual they interviewed and they have 4 more to go (idk if they had other fly in). They told me that by March 9th they will have an answer.

What I want to know is if there is anything I can say or do to make sure they don't forget me, so to speak? I told the HR lady before my interview that I can provide a recommendation letter if it will heighten my candidacy. She said she relayed the info to them and will let me know if they want it, which obviously they didn't because a few days later she told me I was flying out to interview. Should I contact the head guy (who I had a great convo with) that, even though I spoke with the HR lady about it, that I can provide a recommendation letter or provide material highlighting some of my accomplishments in school?

What do you all think?",02Mar2017,1
14,"So I'll try to keep from rambling on here..

My wife is an addictions practitioner. She works in a detox. Her uncle was an alcoholic (case of beer and 26 oz of vodka a day) she had tried to get him help a few times but could never get him to go. Recently they had heard he was getting worse. 

She was planning on getting a court order along with his girlfriend to get him placed in a program to help him. (Important note he was not living with his gf but with another woman that was also an alcoholic but functioning) 

She was talking with his gf today planning on going to the court tomorrow to get him help. His gf told the woman that he was living with what the plan was and she said she was supportive of it. Well the other woman told her uncle what the plan was and he went out to his truck and shot himself.

I got a call at work from my wife and she was devastated, she's blaming herself and saying it's her fault because she waited too long and so on....

I've tried telling her and explaining to her that it's not her fault. Her dad called her specifically to tell her it's not her fault. I guess he was told that her uncle was driving around with a shotgun in his truck for the past week. And that he was going to die regardless (needed a liver transplant but wouldn't get it cuz of drinking) and he was thankful that it was just the uncle instead of a car accident or him getting pulled over by the police and doing something bad because of his state of mind.

24,"So I am trying to move out of my dad's place when the lease is up since I pay rent. It will be up in August meaning I need to find a place and roommates by June. 

My sister, who is having a rather strange relationship problem, wants to get a new place when her lease is up in June. She is a mother of a 2 yr old. She also is too busy to be dragging him everywhere BC her sorry lazy piece of shit of bf is getting worse as he grows older. So she wants to kick him out, use my good credit score to find a new place, and have me move in with her. 

I don't want to however. I love my sister but I can barely tolerate her BC every weekend she is complaining about her bf of 5yrs. Every weekend I go over to her place to babysit so they can go smoke. I use to hate this cause she was tricking me to come over. When she asked if I wanted to hang she meant babysit. Would've been fine but BC of her bf she has no wifi nor cable. And they would stay out till early morning (2/3am). Then he would like to her and take her car to go smoke and stay out late. My sister would take my car and ""spy"" on him and ""do a drive by"" and end up stay till early morning. She won't listen my advice so I'm slowly giving up. But the main reason I don't want to move in with her is because of my nephew. I'm not a baby fan. Even when my nephew was -1 I would hate to be around him. All that crying is annoying. And he still is annoying asf. Furthermore more, he wakes up early, too early for my liking. If i do move in with her i know i will be more responsible for him and probably taking most of the responsibility. 

The reason i want to move out his bc my dad is too demanding. Like I understand i have responsibilities as a resident, but i want it on my timing. Do what i want, when i want, how i want. Also my dad is too judgmental. If he doesnt like something he will lecture me. I want my own freedom. Now if i do move with my sister i do believe i will have more freedom but there is still the issues of responsibilities. Ik she will be like my father. I want to move out and not have anyone telling me what to do unless im getting paid for it. 

So the problem is, i cant tell her no. I already told her i plan on getting roommates who would be total strangers and i know she doesnt like that idea. I want to be able to make my own decisions without being judged or lectured. And i never told her no before and never had a fight with her. If she doesn't like something, she'll let me know, giving reasoning behind it and im just quite. 

TLDR: I really want my own place but i cant tell my sidter, a mother of 1 with no help, no and dont want her to be on her own. ",02Mar2017,1

33,"I'm just going to jump right in. I'm pursuing a bachelor's in software engineering at a local university, and am in my third year. I am currently attempting to obtain a summer internship or coop before finishing my degree (one semester left). I am very interested in embedded systems programming. I have three companies (companies 2-4) in mind in this field, as well as one company (company 1) that I would rather work at than any of those three but my chances are low (very high standards).

I have received an offer from company 4, however it happens to be my lowest preference. From what I learned recently, the work itself is very similar to company 4 but I'm likely to be translating code from one language to another more than doing development. This does not excite me. Additionally, company 1 does not offer a living stipend and I would have to drive 1.25 hours each way each day if I want to avoid paying double rent.

Company 2 is my second preference. The company seems to be a more prominent name, as well as the work would be strictly development. I would also receive a housing stipend or onsite housing, so no double rent and no lengthy transportation. I have communicated with the representative for this company and let them know that I received another offer, and was told that I was one of three candidates referred to the manager of the team I would be working with (I asked for any idea of how much of a risk it would be to reject my current offer and place my hopes in this company). I will be scheduled for a final interview with this company if I choose to reject the offer from company 4.

Company 3 is my third preference. This is a company local to my hometown, so living expenses and transportation would be easily managed. I have a friend as a referral to this company, as he has worked an internship here before as well as worked with me before. I'm not currently sure that they are still looking for interns for the summer, although I hope to receive confirmation from my friend by the time I must respond to the offer from company 4. This is a company where references from employees or employee's friends means a lot, and the manager is one of my dad's friends from high school as well.

Company 1 is my highest preference, but feels like a complete shot in the dark - they receive hundreds of applicants and reject most of them solely based on their resumes and GPA's. This semester, right after the local career fair, they asked another of my friends, a previous intern and now future employee, for a list of the smartest people he knew. I am one of five people on that list, along with a description of his experiences with me. Last semester I was screened out based on resume, but I have not received an email notifying me of so this semester, and my resume and GPA both look much more appealing after last semester.


Currently, my plan is to await my friend's feedback on Company 3, and if he confirms there will be availability in a few weeks, to reject my current offer. If I do not receive meaningful feedback by my deadline, I will accept my current offer. I'd like to know what Reddit thinks. I definitely don't want to commit to working for company 4, but I'd rather work there than another summer of a non-career position.",02Mar2017,1
34,"Hey there! I'm just a regular high school student that happens to have lots of free time. However, I can't quite enjoy my free time. There's so much I want to do, I end up not doing anything and feeling really bad with myself. Especially on holidays... I'm looking to change this!

Let's start with an example: Holidays. I wake up late, I have lunch... And then what? I'll go play games nonstop until I ragequit them, watching youtube videos in between. Then there other things I want to/can do. Go to the gym, read, draw, write an essay, etc. But I don't feel like moving from my chair or starting any of those other activities (the start is the hardest part for me). So I'll just lay around in my chair, watching boring stuff on youtube, not enjoying it, then I'll probably go back and play some more and on and on.

I can't organize and make good use of my free time at all, but I don't want to have to schedule the things that I like and make them feel like obligations as well.

I also have this mindset that I acquired through the years, that my night must end with me at the computer, because that's how it normally is during school time. But even when I want to read or draw, for example, I just can't, because that's not normal. I MUST be at the computer. So my main problem, I think, is that I have my life too standartized. I'm not sure I'm using the right word, but what I mean is that I see life too much from a specific point of view. I'm used to things being this way and I can't change it or do them any other way. I feel bad for not having a Facebook tab open when I'm on the computer, I mean... How bad is that?

40,"Throw away account here, and story to follow. TL;DR at end.
Buckle up. Its a long one. Like.. super long. I realized as I was typing this out that this is more theroupeutic and helpful than the advice I am asking for. 


A little over a year ago, my wife cheated on me, and then ran off with him. They ""fell in love"" over the course of a couple months writing music together (which I was all for because she's pretty talented and I wanted to see her musical dreams fulfilled, but I myself had no musical ability) we had only been married a couple years at this point but it still hit me like a truck.

After she had admitted to sleeping with him she was living with her parents (who completely and utterly enabled her during the entire duration of this event, which was awesome). She felt like we needed to separate for a little while so we both had time to ""think"". During this time I got to sit in in our home, surrounded by her things, and try to figure out where the hell I go from here. Of course, I text her every evening or every other evening asking if she has decided what she wants to do. (I forgot to mention, at this point I had brought up counseling and I was ready to work through this. She wasn't so sure.) She would respond with ""no"".

**insert spongebob time lapse**
2 weeks later.

I have been recommended a book, this book is for taking back control of your marriage. Walks you through the stages of infidelity and how 9 times out of 10 the spouse who has been cheated on starts to feel like its their fault, they start to get all clingy and push the cheating spouse further away blah blah blah. Basically, I read it and got my identity back and realized I was a doormat at this point. So then I come up with a plan. I borrow my father and brother and their truck. We pack up everything that is hers with the intention of moving it into her parent's house, as well as I was going to turn off her phone and everything else I was paying for because I was being taken advantage of at this point. 

**new information emerges upon deactivating her phone
Turns out I have the ability to check usage of each line, quantity of texts, phone calls, etc. Every day she has been calling this guy and they've been talking for hours. *temperature rises* texting 24/7. *bubbling rage* annnnd on the night she told me about what had happened between them, I went on a drive, she had called him and talked to him on the phone until I came back. *officially pissed*.
 with this new information I was a combination of broken and enraged. Each night she told me there wasn't anything to talk about, she was still thinking, etc. And she was on the phone with him during that whole time. So we ended up delivering all of her belongings onto their lawn. (we did knock on the door first to deliver her items, but nobody answered)

Of course that caused a string of petty things from her end. Multiple break ins to my (technically ""our"" but I bought it before she was in the picture) house. Taking furniture, stealing misc power cables to computers and things. Essentially every day I would come home from work to an emptier and emptier house. 

Time marches on and she ends up selling her car (which was my baby, which my brother in law bought from me when it broke down entirely, fixed it up, and then sold to her before all of this went down) getting a new car, moving out of her parents house, getting a new job, all that good stuff. Me, Im still in the same old same old. 

This is where things start looking up for me.
My brother ends up moving into the house with me to keep the in-laws from continuing to help her break into the house, as well as to have some bachelor life fun. 

I decide I need to start getting out of the house, all Im doing is working and coming home and moping around. I have some connections and I go out and rekindle some old friendships that I had cut off because of my wife (thats a whole nother drama filled story) they all immediately accepted me back with open arms, told me apologies weren't necessary and it was the first good night I had since everything happened. This trended upwards FAST. A female friend of mine had sent me a message basically saying ""i'll buy you a drink if you ever just need a night to vent"", I messaged her back a couple weeks or so later and asked if the offer still stood, we went out to this barcade (arcade bar, super cool) and sipped on bourbon and just talked. It was easy and just felt good. I got everything out there. The first time I really opened up about EVERYTHING that happened. We clicked really quickly because we both shared a genuine friendliness, so we just both talked about our lives. It was nice. 

**Flash foward**

A week or so goes by and Im aching to meet up with her again, not for anything remotely relathionship like or anything like that, but seriously because I just really needed a friend on the outside of it all because every day was a struggle. 

(My wife had hired a lawyer to go over our divorce even though at this point we had agreed to have an uncontested divorce, and I already paid for a lawyer for the two of us. Now she wanted my motorcycle. Which is just a petty jab at me because my motorcycle is worth maybe fifteen hundred bucks)

But anyway, I decide I have very little to lose at this point and just reach out and ask if it would be weird for me to request another get together. She's super nice and we end up hanging out again. She turns out to also be a musician, but actually successful. She has an album out, makes a living off gigs, basically what my wife was off trying to accomplish with this guy she was living with. So we hang out and then the next day she has a gig. And this is where I felt it would be seriously weird and stalkerish if I show up at this gig the day after hanging out.. And I also have no self-esteem at this point because of everything that had happened. Solution? I convince this guy from a band to come with me to check her out, along with her girlfriend and this other girl. So basically I invite a group to go to this to dilute the stalker vibe billowing off of myself. 

That night I heard her play and oh wow. This is when I felt a tugging in my heart. It was in this grungy house and wasn't really her typical scene as she played these whimsical fun songs, mixed with some soulful bluesy kinda stuff ( I later found out) but there she was, killing it. So she finishes playing and Im drinking with the group I brought, eventually everyone leaves but she's got more plans for her own night and I somehow managed to tag along. This night turned into a bit of a game changer. We ended up spending the entire night together, just talking. The sun came up and we realized it was now 6am. From that point on we spent a lot of time together. See, I am a big time reader, I got a kindle that year for christmas and I would power through a book a day some days. And she played music for a living. So I would go to her gigs, which were usually at little coffee shops or bars, and I would get comfortable and read while she played, and then she would get off and we would explore the city. We went everywhere. Every day, and every night was a new adventure. And we just loved to be around each other, we genuinely clicked. I was still in love with my wife, but I was beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel. 

Over the next few months we spent literally every day together. She was universally loved by everybody we came across and must've just had this aura about her that drew people to her as we were constantly meeting new people (guys and girls, so it wasn't a skanky vibe) and anytime I went anywhere and mentioned her name, chances were somebody knew her.  I became confident, and sure of myself again. She opened up my eyes to this world I never knew before. When I say every night was an adventure, that's not an exaggeration. We somehow managed to turn every night into something surreal. 

At this time I knew what I needed to do, I needed to finish off the divorce with my wife, and move on. So I wrote her a letter (she had refused to meet me face to face since the day I moved her stuff out) and I dropped it off at her new job. In this letter I told her I was at peace with what has happened, I wish her and her new guy the best, and I had plans to move to this city that was across the country. I also told her that I would sign off on whatever she was wanting with the divorce because I didn't need any of those things and I just wanted to be able to move forward. 

This sparked something in her. 

This is where my story gets complicated (as if it really needed to get more complicated..) she offers to meet with me in person a couple months after this letter. At this point me and this other lady have been spending every day together, for about 5 or 6 months? Not a super long time, but we were spending copious amounts of time together, and were enjoying every. single. moment. And at this point it had developed into quite a bit more then just a friendship. We were pretty much an item at this point. Which was a huge change for her as she wasn't the type to get tied down to anyone, but she was feeling the same way as me. And we were both finding ourselves more and more excited about the possibility of a future between us. 

And then I meet with my wife. 
We meet for the first time since the day I moved her stuff out, about 6 months later. We sit down and we talk, and we talk.. and we talk. And then we ended up closing the bar down and going onto the side walk and talking some more. I was up until, again, 6am. Talking. It all came back like a wave. Everything. I loved this woman. And we kissed, and sparks and fireworks.. Whole nine yards. Then she gave me this card for a free meal at this restaurant she was currently working at (she had about 3 jobs at this point to afford everything without me) and tells me she is working tomorrow so I should come by and we can talk some more. 

I go home. Confused, lost, unsure of anything.

Next day I go and see her at closing at the restaurant. I read while she finishes up closing. We then talk at her car and this talk was different. No rush of feelings. I felt nothing towards this woman. I was dead. I did not want to be there, it was weird, she was gross to me.. It was just.. Nothing. I couldn't pick out what changed. And then it hit me.. Later that week.

Later that week she invited me out to go out with her and her friends. At this point she had ended things with the man she left me for, and was trying to fix things between us. She left that guy a couple days after we sat down and talked. But I went out and realized that the weird, disgusting feeling I had gotten, was from her new friends. This group of people were bottom feeders. The way they talked, acted, holy shit I was gone so fast. I stayed for one drink and I chugged that thing just to get out of there. But after that we met up and talked and I told her straight up ""I think you are bad for me"" and used the group of people she was surrounded by as an example. And compared that to who I was surrounded with. I was going somewhere, and she was going nowhere. I felt like for the first time ever I finally saw who she truly was, and it wasn't good. This of course was hard for her to hear. And prompted a lot of conversation. 

We spent the next two months talking like we should have from the beginning (which I had requested dozens of times). And the lovely woman I had been talking to over that time stepped back, to give us space to figure things out. Because she was an angel, and everything about her was wonderfully simple and drama free. During this time we dug into each other HARD. Mostly me, digging into her, and making sure that it was clear that I was the one actually giving something up in order to fix this. That her garbage friends (I kid you not, half of them were ""witches"". and all of them were disgusting), and her shitty little duo was not what I would consider an actual sacrifice like she was making it out to be. Our talks weren't all bad though. It was all hard though. My heart was constantly being torn in two. 

I come to the conclusion I need to get away in order to clear my head and actually come to a conclusion because this was an actual life altering decision here. So I go on vacation with my family to this lake house we all go to in the summer, and I plan on spending the week there. While I am there me and my dad have some serious heart to hearts over some drinks and that in combination with a message I receive from the lovely woman that is now my best friend which says ""I think you should work things out with your wife, it gives me peace thinking about it"". So I decide thats what I shall do then. We're going to go to counseling, and we're going to do this thing right. And if it doesn't work out, then thats the end of that, and I know I can survive on my own. 

**Quick flashback
during the 2 month period we were digging into each other we did hook up a couple times. It was a combination of alcohol, and my birthday**

**flash back**

I come back from vacation and tell her what the plan is. We start taking steps towards fixing things. I stay a couple nights at her new apartment, she stays a couple nights at my house, and we slowly start putting the pieces back together.

When things are actually looking good, and Im feeling good about things, she tells me she's pregnant. Which at this point, because of our progress, and I have always wanted to be a father, is really exciting and happy news. So we share the news with some of our friends and family and things are going good. 

Then it hits me.

During our beginning stages of working things out, she broke up with the guy she left me for in order to start the process. Sometime early on when we weren't 100% sure we were going to work things out, she hooked up with another guy. One night stand. It was a couple weeks after we had hooked up (a couple weeks after my birthday essentially) turns out. And we go to the Dr. and they give us a due date that lines up with the day they hooked up.. Which is two weeks after we had hooked up. So now I have this weighing on me.

**flash forward several months**

We are mostly through counseling, we are working really well together and it feels good. It feels right. My family took her back no problem, they've been easy like that. But nobody knows this secret thats eating me up.

I wrestle with it every day. Am I strong enough to raise someone elses child? Is it my child? If its not my child would I leave? Do I even get a DNA test? If I stay for the sake of my wife, and the DNA test shows that its not mine, will I look at this child differently? If I don't get the DNA test will I survive not knowing.. 

**flash forward to present day**

I miss my friend. The baby is due in two weeks, and I don't know if Im excited anymore. I feel like I want it to not be mine so I can use that as an excuse to be with my friend. But we have put so much work into this marriage, I don't know if I could just walk away. But at the same time I want this child to be, without a doubt, mine. But what if he's not? I am a strong man. But I am tired. And I am tired of being strong. I want to be happy, but I don't know what that means anymore.. 




**TL;DR**
Wife cheated on me.
We separated.
While separated I met an incredible woman and we went from friends, to best friends, to something more.
Meet up with wife to discuss divorce, first time we have seen each other in 6 months, we decide to give it another try.
I needed time to think about it all so I go on a trip, while on the trip the girl I met messages me and tells me it gives her peace to think of me and my wife working things out.
So we work things out.
Find out she's pregnant, initially think its mine, later find out the due date lines up with a one night stand she had 2 weeks after we had hooked up.
Don't know if baby is actually mine. Have stood by her through her entire pregnancy and now we are 2 weeks from the due date and I am starting to question whether or not I have made a mistake. 

Part of me wants to take the paternity test to find out its not mine and use that as an excuse to leave.

Part of me wants to take the paternity test to be reassured its mine, and continue life with the woman I married.

Part of me is afraid that if I found out the child is in fact, not mine, I would still feel obligated to stay, but I might treat the child differently knowing that its not mine.. and so I don't know if a paternity test is a good idea at all. But then Im also afraid that not knowing will eat at me forever.


This is more so to get these thoughts out of my head, and I realize I kind of just wrote a horribly scatter brained novel/built the wall separating the US from Mexico for Trump. But yeah.. My body has just ached every day this week, and I realized Im starting to take it out on people around me. I want life with my wife to be the right thing to do, but I don't know if it is. But I know that I have to make a decision, and I have to stick with my decision.

Perhaps this is just my version of freaking out about the next big change in my life. Cold feet if you would. I have been solid and supportive up into this week. And now Im breaking down, and breaking down hard and fast. ",02Mar2017,1
42,"I'm going to list my problems as iterative bullet points in order of importance but they're very overwhelming to me and I'm not sure how I should proceed in solving them. 

-If all goes well, I should be graduating in the spring with a degree in computer science. Most people would be happy with this, but I'm actually very worried and scared. Basically I only hopped onto this major because I was still struggling to figure out what I should do after finishing my 2 years of general education credits and everyone always tells me I'm good with computers, so the final tipping point was seeing how good the pay was. While I can do the stuff, it doesn't thrill me and I can't see myself enjoying a career in this field. Not only that, but many of my professors have said repeatedly that unless you're dedicating lots of time on personal projects outside of what's taught, your skills aren't going to compare to others in the job market and you'll stagnate. Like I said, I've been skilled enough to do what's expected of me from coursework, but I don't think this field actually interests me enough to pursue a career in. I feel as though I had to complete the degree to justify my time and money spent on school and that my future career prospects are sunk. 

-I'm currently in a relationship of over 2 years. For the last 6 months though I've felt like it should end, but haven't had the strength to end it. There are many reasons I feel this way and I've tried to discuss them with my partner on many occasions to no success. Basically she would like to participate in an abroad program for an amount of time which would require me to either go with her and live in an area where I don't know the language and have like zero career prospects, or accept that for an amount of time our relationship would be prohibitively long distance. She is also controlling of certain aspects of my life which I'd rather not go into detail on, but they affect how I can enjoy myself at times which is obviously bothersome to me. I've tried to negotiate some of these points of contention before to no effect. However despite this I have a hard time feeling negatively towards her, I still love her and can't imagine life without her even if I can write down on paper the objective pros and cons and see that it's almost certainly a better idea to break up. I just can't do it for whatever reason and would rather mold around these constraints.

-I recently lost my dream (part-time) job working at a local gaming store because the owner is going through tough times and may have to close the store if it gets bad enough. It was a great source of income without really feeling like work because I always loved getting to interact with customers about shared hobbies. My savings that I was going to use to support myself after graduation are dwindling and I'm not sure if I'll be able to immediately do anything after graduation. I'm more fortunate than some as my parents have been very supportive and loving, allowing me to live with them for as long as I need to after college, but the job hunt has been rough and I'm not sure what resources I'll be able to throw together before ""real life"" starts. 

-I've been struggling with body image for most of my adult life. I'm obese and would love to lose a healthy amount of weight. I've tried exercise programs and counting calories before to some success, but I always manage to get derailed and lose all of my progress. I'm aware of r/loseit and have utilized it before but I just can't seem to find something that works for me. 

I can provide more details for any of these if anyone needs them but I already felt like I was getting lengthy. I would appreciate any input on any singular point.",02Mar2017,3

47,"In January of this year I lost my job of almost four years. This loss came immediately after moving into a new apartment in December of 2016. I have had zero luck even getting responses for job interviews and I won't start getting my unemployment for another two weeks. I owe $400 on this months rent and $300 remain on my security deposit (of which I was of the understanding that I'd pay an extra $100 on top of my $400 a month rent to get the deposit paid down).

Today I got a letter from my landlord telling me rent was late (today is the actual due date) and that I need to catch up the remainder of my $300 security deposit by March 31st or move out within 30 days from today's date. I'm at a loss as to what I can do. I don't have any family to turn to and I'm not getting any help from financial assistance programs. I live in the state of West Virginia so renters rights amount to jack squat. I feel like my life was completely stable and now I feel like every time I get a little bit of a foothold I lose my grip and fall back to where I started.

That part isn't so bad though. The hardest thing is living life pretending to believe in god. There are so many restrictions that my parents put on me because they believe certain actions are haram (forbidden in islam). I was recently diagnosed with depression and when i told my parents i was suicidal, they said it was because i don't fear god and brushed it off. I have not gotten any help for my depression because i am too young to seek it on my own. All this is really affecting my mental health and i no longer have the motivation to even live. I know my only way out is leaving and going to college but i can't even bring myself to care about it anymore. I don't plan on staying like this forever.

56,"Hey guys. I'm not usually the type to be ""PC"". But the behavior of my peers at my school has grown increasingly hostile towards political, ethnic, and religious minorities. I don't mean microaggressions or manspreading or other SJW stuff like that, but legitimate, n-word with a hard r level of racism. I live in a community of almost entirely straight, white, republican Christians. I've been harassed multiple times for my political ideologies (which are on the left side, leaning closer to libertarian), and just earlier today was belittled by classmates for choosing not to stand for the pledge. I heard a kid talking about how if black power is allowed to exist, then he shouldn't have been called a racist for ""supporting white power"".  
It's gotten so far out of hand, and the teachers are fine with it. This is fucking terrifying. I thought my generation was over this. I'm in the 12th grade. Have people learned nothing?  
I know you guys are going to think I'm making this up, but this is the complete truth. I don't know what to do. Everything in my heart says I should do something, but I'm scared.

I have a decent amount of free time and like to text or call my friends later in the afternoon when things like school, homework, and dinner are done, but I always feel incredibly guilty for doing so. I feel like I'm being a leech if I even attempt to contact anyone. I also feel like I'm intruding on or taking up time in their lives where they could be doing or socializing with someone better. Sometimes I feel like my friends only talk to me out of sympathy or guilt and that feeling tears me up to think about. It's almost like I feel I'm the third wheel in my own life.

59,"Wow, Reddit, I'm shocked right now...


I'm thirteen. I've always told myself that love is useless and a dangerous disadvantage, but I'd let myself have a crush for around three years. This year my emotions are running wild.
There are four problems in this one huge problem right now:


1. I have a crush, also 13. He knows I like him. But he told me, straight out, that I'm unattractive. A few days later, I went to a meeting for a club. I met an eighth grader from a different school on the bus ride to the conference. We talked about programming, and random stuff in general. He actually liked EVERYTHING I did, and I saw him as my role model. (In about thirty minutes, yeah. I seem like a player, I'll explain it in the fourth problem) We got each other's contacts. I told him I liked this guy and that he told me I'm unattractive, and he told me that I was ""cute ish"", and on a scale of 1-10, I was a five. He told me that I was really sweet, and that my crush was a dumbass for saying that. He was cute, too, but he was... sort of blunt/harsh... I was really happy that FINALLY someone thought I was cute... and then...

2. We talked for a while on google hangouts. Then suddenly he asked me why I was texting him so much and I told him that I would stop. I felt really sad and devastated. Then he texted me again, we talked. Then he said ""Now that I've served my initial purpose(helping me, the OP get rid of procrastination), I'll block you. Bye!"" That's it. Done. He hasn't texted me back at all.

3. Why hasn't anyone had a crush on me yet? Everyone I know is super pretty and someone has had a crush on them. I'M the one obsessing over people and things, like programming, piano, etc, and NO ONE ever gets obsessed with me. WHY? 

4. This always happens to me. I'm dynamic, changing with whoever I like or I am obsessed with. Sometimes an anime character, sometimes a real person. My opinion of people changes SO FAST. How can I stop feeling like this- getting obsessed with people? How can I be independent and not so submissive and weak? How can I stop my feelings from being so malleable by other people?

Thanks so much, I'm really bad at social relationships and I'm usually reading a book or being on Reddit. I mess up *** so badly, I embarrass myself all the time.

65,"I started dating a guy in college and ended up staying friends with his friends when he moved across the country and we broke up. A bunch of them moved to the major city near where I grew up after college and our friendship grew independently. We didn't have a ton in common, but I was living with my parents and working a boring job and I could party with them on the weekend. Our bond grew but we still didn't have a ton in common.

Fast forward 3 years: I'm in grad school for a low paying field and meeting a ton of people who share my values. It's awesome. I live with my roommate, 26F, who I consider a friend, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to hang out with if we didn't live together. I'm kind of attached to the friend group through her - she was a ""no new friends"" type for a long time, doesn't like change, and isn't very adventurous. They were all super close in college and remind me of Friends or HIMYM (probably partly because they're all tv and movie obsessed). I'm also dating a guy who was also part of the group in college, and while we have a lot more in common, it's still anchoring me to weekend plans with the same people.

So even though I'm meeting a lot of people I like better and have more in common with, I'm still very involved with this group that I feel myself pulling away from more and more. I feel like I won't be able to cut the cord unless I live by myself or move in with my boyfriend (who I've expressed these feelings to). 

That's not happening until late summer and I'm already starting to get snippy. Tonight I got snippy with my roommate because of these underlying feelings that I know so much about their lives but no one asks me about mine. I also have ADHD and feel like I'm seen as a ditz, but I have a 4.0 and I'm working my ass off. But my schedule is so hectic nobody wants to bother to understand what I'm up to.

I want to have a group of friends that rejuvenates and inspires me and leaves me feeling better than before we hung out. People I have more values I common with. But because I'm still on the hook with this group I don't have enough time to foster new friendships between school, field placement, my part time jobs and a long distance relationship.

66,"Hey, I think I need a bit of help.  Been having paranoid thoughts about my girlfriend and have a history of schizophrenia in my family.  I've always been afraid I might be susceptible to delusional paranoia. Anyway, been feeling weird since taking quite a bit of weed.  I was with my girlfriend and suddenly accusing my girlfriend of cheating on me and eventually going on to wonder if she even existed and calling her evil.  I remember her reaction not being convincing to me the whole time we were arguing even though there was hardly any evidence to suggest it was true.  And also yes was on a lot of weed and quite drunk. 

However, maybe it's shame since then but the paranoid thoughts about this and her cheating with me (with several people, it's fucking me up).  I've talked to her a bit about it and she's aware of that mental illness runs in my family so does the best to reassure me. Anyway, a few times since I've forgotten about it but it seems to keep coming back.  Also, just to make things a little weirder for me I've started to realize that she may be a Wiccan or something to that extent.  She has symbols all over her body that I've just discovered are of Wiccan origin.  

I'm usually a believer in science, not really of religion and before this considered myself a logical person, but this new Wiccan stuff has made me feel even weirder.  I haven't had the chance to talk to her about it yet, but I'm anxious because I don't want to antagonize or weird her out.  The thing is I think I really like this girl and it is possibly my first real chance at an adult relationship.  I'm wondering if the intensity of my feelings towards her is making my jealousy and suspicion worse.  

Anyway, again can't place a finger on a logical piece of evidence to think she means me harm but my mind is going to weird places very recently.  I mean I've been having sexual dreams that feel ominous and weird and honestly sometimes am so paranoid that she might be doing things to me while I sleep or leaving to cheat while I sleep.  Nuts right?  Or what? Like what should I do?  Am I maybe going a little crazy?  Who do I talk to without anyone thinking I'm losing it or strange?  How should I begin to help myself?",02Mar2017,1
67,"Good Evening All,

I have been a supervisor at my job for almost a 1.5 years. During this time I have excelled and even won a few awards. 

Over the last 6 months, the team i work with has gone down hill, the management has changed several times, and I have been constantly training new hires each week only to have them quit or be removed, which continues the cycle.

Over the past while, I feel that my bosses have been relying on me way too much, expecting me to handle everything, and not giving me the support I need.

I have taken a few complaints directly to HR since not having the issues resolved from my upper management. To put it shortly, I do not feel well taken care of at work.

I have been looking for another job for months, but have not received any interviews or call backs. I would like to take a Computer programming course, but I am still saving up and it will be a few more months until I can apply.

The daily stress is effecting my health very negatively. I have crohns disease on top of that, which just adds to the daily struggle. 

I am at a point now where I have written my 2 weeks notice, have absolutely no back up plan, and I think about quitting on the daily. I am afraid I will either deteriorate from bad health or end up quitting without any plan and loose my apartment and my life.

I do not have many friends or family to talk about this with, So I was hoping to get some advice on what to do...

I really appreciate any feedback. Thank you",02Mar2017,1

69,"Hi guys, I'm a little bit new to this subreddit, but I desperately need some opinions.

I'm having sort of a tough time finding anything that hits this issue on the head online, at least in a way that fits me. Here's what's going on.

I have lots of family. I have a boyfriend who I love deeply. I have some friends at work, I guess, though I really don't make a habit of hanging out with much of anyone. Even with all of these people around, I can't seem to get any kind of support from the people I really need. 

My mother is barely functional as an adult human being to begin with, and my step dad spends a lot of time just trying to tolerate her. My dad and my step mom are great people, and they're good to talk to sometimes, but I also have three step brothers who need them too (and the youngest in particular is a drug dealer and a drop out, so they kind of have their hands full dealing with that).

My boyfriend and I have lived together for over six years, and I do love being with him. He's funny and he's nice to me, and we get along almost always, but he's lazy. I don't think he is on purpose; he thinks he knows how to do chores, but almost always only half finishes them or gets very upset when I try to correct what little he has done. We've had plans to get healthy for years, especially after we found out that I was losing function in my knee because of weight gain, but he refuses to try a diet with me or even clean up after himself when he cooks. He won't do anything 100%, won't screw caps back on things, won't pick up small messes that end up contributing to the larger mess, and for a long time I would just do it all. He's also very stubborn, and takes it almost like a challenge any time I do ask him to do something. If I have to ask more than once, I know it's not happening unless I'm sick or injured, so I just give up the fight or I'll end up being incredibly angry. I have no plans to leave--we fit really well together in every other regard and I love him to pieces.

Now.. I'm constantly exhausted. I have no energy when I come home from work, or even on days that I don't work at all. I've retreated into reading things on Facebook, watching Netflix, and playing video games all the time. I've sort of had long-running depression, and it's not as bad as it used to be, but I still look around me and just feel trapped. Like even if I clear away the mess, it'll all be back tomorrow when I get home from work. I used to do perfectly well cleaning up the mess of two people, but now everything's piled up so much that it just feels like I've crawled down underneath a pile of garbage and made it my home. I don't know where to start or what to do.

The trouble I'm encountering when I look things like this up online, is that almost everything I've found includes joining a ""new community"" of some sort. Making new friends, joining a club, etc. I have neither the time nor the desire to try and get to know new people. I don't really like being around people, bad at small talk, horrible when it comes to really letting them in, and even worse when it comes to making (and keeping) plans. I used to be the most responsible person you could meet, and would show up 15 minutes early if we planned on meeting up somewhere just to be safe, but I've been ditched a lot and fucked over more times than I can count. I just want nothing to do with people or including them in my life.

What I really need is a way to lift myself up and make myself do things independently. I don't want a crutch. I want to get back to when I was self sufficient and had the energy to do the things I needed to do. No new group of random people is going to help me do that, because I honestly don't care about their opinions and don't want to share anything about myself with them. Is there anything I can do to get back to being a self sufficient adult short of going on some superficial friend-making crusade?

TL;DR: I've lost any motivation to look after myself or my household, and need help finding it again without the help of some new friend group or social club. I don't have anyone I can depend on to finish projects properly or help me with things. What can I do to lift myself up?",02Mar2017,1

76,"Hi, everyone -

So, my little sister died unexpectedly last Monday. (I'm 31, and she was 28.) Her funeral will be this upcoming Monday.

My family is not really religious, but my sister at least believed in *a* God, so a reverend will be leading the services (which will be non-denominational, but not secular).

I want to speak at the service. I have talked to the funeral home about this, but not the reverend (he's actually supposed to call me very early tomorrow).

I guess what I'm asking is for any advice from people who have been in this scenario, or a similar scenario. How long should it be? How somber should it be (which I ask because I have some very nice, funny, light-hearted anecdotes that could be included)? I also have a weirdly specific question; can I cuss?

84,"So my university lecturer presented an opportunity for extra credit for one of my courses. I wanted to get any advice/thoughts on these conditions, and whether there's a way/loophole that I'm guaranteed these extra points. 

Here it is:

""Each student has a chance to submit one multiple choice question. The only requirement for your submission is that the question covers an economic concept discussed in Intermediate Microeconomics. 
 
To earn the extra credit, your question must be submitted by April 6th. The number of credit marks you can earn depends on the total number of questions submitted by the class. 
If only one student submits a question prior to the deadline, that student will have 10 points added to the mid-term score.

If two students submit questions before the deadline, each of them will have 8 points added to the mid-term score. 
If three students submit questions prior to the deadline, each of them will have 6 points added to the mid-term score. 
If four students submit questions before the deadline, each of them will have 4 points added to the mid-term score.  
If five students submit questions before the deadline, each of them will have 2 points added to the mid-term score. 
If six or more students submit questions before the deadline, all students in the class will receive no extra credit whatever. 
Lastly, if no student submits a question before the deadline, every student in the class will have 2 points added to the score.

93,"Hey all,

I live in Canada, and current,y I'm going to a school that has a really good reputation for grades and students take education very seriously here.

I'm a track athlete and spend a lot of time after school waiting to take the bus to track (and training afterwards). I'd go home, but I live too far from my school to make it home and back on the bus. 

I am in grade 11, and will have spent 2 years here if I were to transfer to a newer school that's closer to my house.

I'm really having an internal conflict because I feel a sense of loyalty and pride towards the school I'm at, even though I originally hated it and was pretty depressed, I have come a long way and although it isn't amazing and I still wander the halls alone at lunch, I like this school quite a bit. The sports teams are really fun and a good chunk of th epeople here are fairly genuine - I'm just not great at making new friends... this is kinda good because it helps me focus on studying and such, but it doesn't seem to be as enjoyable as having a lot of friends. Also, since I have to focus on track and school + put so much time time into each, I often skip out on sleep and it's not great for my health.

I don't have many friends, which is what's really splitting me.

At the new school, I would be regrouping with a lot of friends from my junior high days that I still hang out with time to time and I really enjoy their presence. The only problem being that the academics are rumoured to not be as nice as the school I currently go to - my friends say it's quite good but I just can't bring myself to believe it, whether I've been brainwashed by the school I go to, or it's just instinct.

TL;DR: school with super good academics and teachers that are very nice + respectable, with the drawback of having no friends VS giving up school loyalty, and going to school with more friends but rumoured worse academics. 


What should I do?


Thanks in advance!


Edit: also, dating...

At the school I'm at, there isn't anyone I really see myself as compatible with because I'm in the minority + just generally not too social 

At the new school, I think the chances are pretty good because I'd be in the majority, have some more friends, and I think I'd be pretty comfortable there.. not too significant a factor, but I figure don't I'd throw it in. :)",02Mar2017,1
94,"I'm a 20 year old guy, and this is a decision I've been struggling with for a long time. I was raised in a fairly Christian household, and while I personally have no moral objection to losing my virginity, a part of me always wanted to wait until I was in love before I had sex for the first time. It seems like every day I wake up with a different desire, whether I should wait for someone I love or just get it over with.

96,"So, I'm 15, about to be sixteen this month, and I've never been in a relationship. I don't really care about them, because I don't want to waste my life away on a boy who only wants sex or something like that. Also, I can never allow myself to catch feelings for anyone. 

I think it's because ever since I was five when my parents divorced, my mom began dating this guy who was either drunk or on hydros, so he was very verbally abusive whenever he and my mom fought I would always be terrified he would hit my mother (he never has, that I know of) but she's my mom, and it scared me to see him be so angry looking. He would look like he was possessed. I guess seeing how being in a relationship affected my mother, I've always been terrified to be in one myself. 

But lately I've started talking to this guy and we've hung out once. He's cute, and I know he's started to like me, and I feel like I am starting to like him but I can't help but have this feeling of dread. Like I know this is just going to hurt me, or him, or both. 

He's a really sweet guy, and I don't want to hurt him, but I can feel myself started to want to just stop talking to him altogether. I can feel myself beginning to drift away from talking to him. 

I don't know what to do. Every time I've ever ""liked"" someone, it's only lasted for a few weeks and then I'd stop. I don't know if I should keep trying and see where it goes, or just stop altogether. Because I'd hate for him to get too attached for me to only break his heart. ",02Mar2017,2

Anyway, in doing this though I realize that I don't really fit in anywhere, and I know for certain I don't get a long with everybody. Maybe, on the acquaintance level but I have yet to find my tribe, if that makes sense? 

For sake of easy communication I'll use some labels:
I'm a grunger, alternative, emo, skater, stoner, punk rapper (yes, bringing some grunge and punk flavor to hip hop and talking about existential issues and social fallacies that people fall into) who reads way too much, writes poetry, stories, screenplays, songs, and plays guitar. 

I listen to everything from a Tribe Called Quest to Flatbush Zombies to Alice In Chains to Of Mice and Men to Trivium and Slipknot to Hopsin and Tech N9ne back to Metallica just in time to reload and ride the lightning as I swerve to Isaiah Rashad to make the Distance with Utada and unlock the kingdom to my heart. 

Anyway, I'm still getting accumulated and shit but the thing is I don't know where to start? I'm 24 and out of school (loong story) but I won't be able to get back to school for a little bit until i pay off some old school debt. So that's not necessarily an option just yet (Soon though!)

106,"So I'm 16 and a Junior in high school. I'm not really that talkative when it comes to meeting new people, but I'm really open when I'm with friends. During my Sophomore year my 4th period, which was the last period  of the day, was a welding class. So there was about 27 guys and 4 girls. One of the girls happened to be pretty attractive. So much so that almost a quarter of the class was always flirting with her at her table. The thing is she wasn't that talkative either, and it turned most of the guys down.

Fast forward to the beginning of this school year, and she is in my final class once again. Now during my sophomore year, I thought of her as just the pretty girl of the class. But about a week into the new school year, I started to like her. In my eyes we had a lot of things in common. We both didn't talk much but talked a lot to people we knew, we both had the same fashion style, and we both liked the same type of music. So the stars aligned for me and I start to get hints that she likes me to. So what would any normal guy do if he knew his crush liked him back? Well he's talk to her of course! But me, I never talked to her. Not even once. 

I could go on and on about all the hints she dropped and how she wanted me to make the first move which makes sense. But I'll discuss one in particular. That day I had seen her walking around during lunch with a guy from my welding class we had the year prior. So then and there I thought, ""Well that's it. You blew your chance."" (Which I still end up doing), but as they're walking around I look around and try to find them and when I do I see her looking at me and she turns around right when I make eye contact with her. So when I finally get to the class we're both in we're doing a Kahoot. So I go over to set next to my friend and my crush goes over to the table next to us. The whole time we're doing the test she's talking to her self. She's talking to her self in the sort of way someone talks when they want attention, and this is strange cause she never seemed to do this. So after we're done I hear her say to her self that she got them all right and a couple seconds later my friend tells me that he got them right as well. So I tell him ""She got them all right too."" And when I said that I saw her turn around and smile. This was the first time I indirectly spoke to her. I don't know how it happened but a couple minutes after I said that we locked eyes for a solid 7 seconds. The next couple of days were just us staring at each other during break and class.

After finals we went on our one winter break, and I was constantly thinking about what the chances of her still liking me after the break would be. When I get back to school I don't end up getting any classes with her, and we have separate lunches. I still see her looking at me as we pass each other during passing, but up until the last couple of weeks I feel that's she's given up, which I completely understand. 3 days ago I saw walking with a new guy and yesterday I saw him walking with her after school. I'm glad that she's finally found someone, but I'm hating myself. It makes me feel like a complete idiot knowing that I had 3 entire months to talk to her, and yet I didn't speak a word directly to her. It's not jealousy towards the guy either, as I'm happy for her. 

So I need advice. I can't stop thinking about how laughable and idiotic I am for never speaking to her, and how easily other guys can approach her not even knowing her name.

119,"It starts with my mother never being there for us as children. She was always passed out on pills because of one of her ""hundreds of health problems"". 

My step dad had a decent job, Yet somehow we were always poor. My mom would never get a job, always lie and ""borrow"" money from people, not buy us clothes, or give us food money for school, no Christmas, birthday, field trips, etc etc Yet she always had enough for her daily 2 packs of smokes, McDonald's and 2 liter of coke. She never showed up to any event, although she had no job. These things seem petty when your an adult, but you know the tremendous disappointment must linger in your psyche from childhood.

Since she got a divorce, she has been homeless off and on. I would ALWAYS answer her plea that she just needs a little help. Usually the only time she isn't homeless is after I drop $1.5k here, or $2k there, to get her into places until she gets evicted, as is always the case. She only ever calls to complain about her health problems, who ""fucked her over"" and to get money for help. Since, I was 16 until now, I have dropped at least $20k trying to keep shelter over my mom's head. 

Sometimes she is able to swing heart felt sob stories and straight up lies to the landlords and has gotten by with not paying rent for years. But it always ends the same way, eventually she is physically removed from the property.

She has ALWAYS been a CONSIDERABLE source of disappointment, emotional baggage, stress, and a drain on my psyche and resources. But who wants their mom to be homeless? I have accepted that she is, for whatever reason, a broken human being.

And now we have my sister: 27 years old, no skills, no job, no money... 4 kids! One of which has SEVERE cerebral palsy due to a car accident induced premature birth (not her fault). 

Last year, I gave her over $5k to help pay her rent, all of which is not easy for me, as I myself am in debt and have my own child. Almost EVERY SINGLE DAY, for almost 2 years now, I have stressed out, constantly thinking about how they're doing, if they are going to be okay, are the kids eating, are they happy, are they miserable, what's going to happen to them. Eventually she was evicted in December and She HAS NO MONEY AND IS IN A MOTEL with her 4 kids, her deadbeat baby daddy, and my mom! Her oldest son should be in kindergarten right now, yet he is not. I believe this to be a pretty serious disposition for the child to be deprived of education because they can't get it together.

I stressed out so damn much thinking about those kids. I have had long pep talks with my sister, on the steps that she needs to take and the things she needs to consider to avoid this type of life and to take care of her kids, over the past year and a half. However, considering her situation is only getting worse, it is becoming increasing clear to me, that she may also not be capable of getting her shit together, as the conversations remind me of talking to my mom. 

This is very tragic, who wants their mom, sister, and nephews to be homeless and poor?

The problem is, I have my own life, and responsibilities as a father and full time student. I am working to piece my own life back together and setting myself up for success. The problem is, I have constantly worried and stressed over them. I have obsessively thought about their well being and if they will be ok, when I should be focusing on building my skill set so I can be employable. I have constantly missed my own bills to bail them out. And now, I have manifested an autoimmune disorder and other conditions, which I believe is in large to the constant stress I feel for them. They are usually the first thing I think about as soon as I wake up, and the last thing I think about when I try to sleep. I am constantly afraid when I hear my phone go off, that it will be a desperate call or text about the next shitty thing that's happened and how they need help. I am afraid to hear anymore of their misery. I turn my phone on silent most of the day, and for awhile i was turning it completely off, just to feel a little sense of freedom from the stress I feel for their situation.

I feel like, I am at a point, where I am about to say a prayer, block their numbers, and don't look back. Not at all because I want to or think it will be convenient. I feel like It's a matter of self-preservation at this point. For my own emotional well-being and health.",02Mar2017,1
121,"So from the age of 15 until now (I'm 20) I was in a relationship with this guy (we can call him J) that I never met in person. I know it sounds crazy and cliche but for all this time this relationship consumed my life because I felt so in love with him. We met on omegle and instantly clicked and talked basically everyday for the next five years. In the beginning of the relationship we mostly sexted and talked every once and a while. It wasn't until around the time that I started my senior year in high school that we became really close. We talked on the phone almost every night and it grew to the point where we really loved eachother. We shared things about our families, told eachother all our secrets and my whole day revolved around talking to him. I'm naturally a loner and I was at a new school my junior and senior year. I didn't have any friends, went to prom by myself, and pretty much felt like a total outcast my entire senior year. J was there for me through it all. He made me feel beautiful and helped me overcome a lot of my insecurities and at the time, I needed that. I was so low and hated going to school everyday and he helped me deal with it and pushed me to finish and I'll always be grateful for that because to this day I don't know how I would have made through that without him. He had some of the same issues and we leaned on eachother for support. Even after we both graduated high school we continued to talk everyday and at  this point I really loved him and wanted nothing more than to see him. I thought about it everyday. I couldn't imagine my life without him in it and vice versa at this point. 
He lived in South Carolina and I live in Michigan and when we were in high school still it was easier for me to understand why it would be difficult to buy plane tickets and see eachother but as time went on and we moved on to becoming adults and getting our own jobs I started to ask myself why didn't he want to see me? I knew he was who he said he was, we'd facetime all the time. So I knew it wasn't that and as more time went on, even me just bringing up wanting to see eachother made him upset. I remember last summer taking a picture of myself at this park I like going to and sending it to him. I told him that I really wished that he could be there with me and he flipped. He accused me of always ""guilt tripping"" him and trying to make him feel bad about not being with me. At that point we'd been in this relationship for four years and I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. That was the first time i'd really gotten angry with him. We'd had disagreements about the same issue before and i'd always apologize and fix it for fear of losing him but he'd never blew up on me like that and so we didn't talk for about a month after. 
During that month that we we're talking I was really able to see that there was no reason for him to be upset with me. In fact, he should feel guilty about not seeing me after claiming to love me all this time. What kind of person gets mad about someone they supposedly love wanting to be with them? He eventually  apologized but at that point I'd seen the light and our relationship was never the same. We continued to talk but I had changed. 
This relationship with J made it nearly impossible for me to date other people around me (something I seriously regret now). I couldn't get close to anyone because I was emotionally attached to this other person (J) who lived in a whole other state. I actually ended a relationship with a guy who really liked me because I loved J so much and couldn't stand the idea of losing him. But after our fight I was finally able to let go and date more. J hated this and made me feel as if i was cheating on him. It was really confusing for me because I felt like well he didn't want to be here with me so why would he be trying to make me feel bad about seeking relationships with other people? I eventually came to the conclusion that maybe it was all about control. He was okay as long as he knew he had me obsessing over him. 
The relationship went on and it wasn't until I met the guy I'm with now that I realized it was time to let J go. My new guy is so good to me and I knew that I only wanted to focus on being with him. I didn't feel right keeping this relationship with J and trying to build a new relationship. It wasn't even all about my new relationship tbh, I knew that i just couldn't continue to wait on him (J) anymore. I just couldn't deal with the mental aspects of being in this relationship anymore. I was starting to feel used by J. Especially after I watched him get a new better paying job and buy a pair of $200 shoes like it was nothing.He also got into photography and when he'd be wanting me to get excited about him buying all this new equipment, all I could think was why couldn't he spend that money to come see me? It was then that I realized he never actually wanted to be with me. Any person who can afford to buy $200 shoes and expensive new camera gear could easily buy a plane ticket to see me. It wasn't like we were separated by ocean we were even in the same time zone! He just didn't want to and when I realized that, it crushed me.
I officially ended it about 2 weeks ago and he was really receptive and seemed to understand. We cried about it and talked and it seemed to end on a good note. He apologized for stringing me along all this time and admitted that he felt bad about it. 
I guess now I'm just trying to get over this feeling of being used. I feel extremely used and taken advantage of. I have this overwhelming feeling that I wasted too much time focused on being with him. I feel like he used me for emotional support only and never really loved me. I was only good enough to share secrets with and give him advice but not good enough for him to be with. I had a whole five year relationship that I have nothing to show for. I think it was all the time he told me he loved me or needed me that's confusing me. I'm starting to feel as if all of it wasn't real and I'm hating myself for letting this one-sided relationship go on for so long. Basically I feel really stupid.
I've only started to feel worse after texting him last night to see how he was doing ( we agreed to remain friends so I felt okay with doing it) . He was very generic with me. Gave me one word answers and ended our conversation with an emoji -_- . This has only made me feel even shittier because I guess I feel like he has no right, after all the shit he's put me through to be an asshole to me.
I guess I'm just trying to figure out what to do now. I have a new guy who likes me alot and I'm finally giving one guy all of my attention but I can't stop feeling used by J and I desperately want him to feel as bad as I do. 
Please help me make sense of it all. 
I know this is alot lol

125,"Just before I get into what happened I would like to state that I am a hardcore rationalist and atheist who does not believe in the paranormal, pseudoscience, psychics, god and any other irrational thing I didn't list. (Sorry religious people) 

Today at around 10pm (Australian Eastern Standard Time) I went outside to take my dog out to pee. I was on my phone when I saw a small white thing in my periferal vision. Me, thinking it was some moth or mosquito, looked up in an attempt to swat it away. But when I saw it, what ever it was, it looked like a floating light that was out of focus. I tried to focus on it but it just was not possible, and due to it being out so out of focus i had no depth perception on it whatsoever (i couldn't tell if it was a star or something on the surface of my eye). I closed one eye and only saw one blurred light, and the same happened when I closed my other eye. But with two eyes opened it just looked like two small blurry lights. To check if it was something wrong with my eyes I tilted my head upwards (i believed that if it stayed where it was when i moved my head, it couldn't be something wrong with my eyes) to my surprise the blur moved. 

At this point I was starting to worry my eyes were fucked up. I then I thought maybe light from the yard light on the wall behind me was being affected by my glasses and that the it had refracted in a way so that I could see the out of focus light. And as a result I proceeded to remove them. Even though my vision was blurry I could still clearly see the  strange light against the night sky. This time I started to worry even more, I begun to think there was something wrong with the lens in my eye or that my cornea was damaged.

Still thinking that my eyes were the problem I thought that if I blocked the yard light behind me, the out of focus light would go away. So I blocked out the light behind me by placing my hands over my forehead, replicating the brim of a baseball hat, yet the light was still there. Then i proceeded to block the light for each individual eye whilst I had my eye that wasn't getting blocked closed and I still could see the light. This made me assume this was not something to do with my eyes.

At this point (and I'm ashamed to say) I began to think there was some supernatural force at play. Was this a fairy? (Earlier on me and my friend were discussing Richard Dawkins' book ""The God Delusion"" and the beautiful quote within the book by Douglas Adams which mentions fairies) At this point I decided to just stare at it until it would away, but it didn't. So I attempted to reach out and swat it (had to see if it was some supernatural entity, just to test) and the light moved upwards so that when I tilted my head up I could see it once more. This time I jumped so that I could grab it (even though I had no sense of how far away this dot was from me because of how out of focus t was) and the light just moved in a away in a blurr, this time it was gone. I removed my glasses to see if it would come back, but it didn't. At this point I realised it won't be coming back and so I went back inside, googled to find out what happened (found nothing), then went on reddit and am now writing this post. 

At this current moment I am tying to rationally explain what just happened, was this a hallucination, is something wrong with my eyes, is this a schizophrenic hallucination? And at the same time the suppressed irrational side of me is thinking this is something supernatural.

Can anyone explain what happened, maybe an optometrist? Has anyone had something similar happen? (P.S. sorry for the bad grammar and spelling if there is any, was rushing to type this out. Also if i have not followed any unwritten rules of Reddit, i'm sorry as this is my first time posting on Reddit)

TLDR: I saw a strange light, i think it may be something wrong with my eyes or something paranormal.",02Mar2017,14
126,"There's this girl I've been interested in for quite sometime almost 2 years and I've messed up with being with her by not expressing my feelings when I should've.. She reads which I found attractive not necessarily the ones I read but she reads romance or fiction and I read literature and philosophy, but still attractive nonetheless, she reads. We even had a book club going for a bit between each other, I'd read one book of hers, then she'd read one of mine I tried to give her some page turning sci Fi and not high brow literature obviously. She loves anime as do I. She likes my jokes. I've texted her as texting other than seeing her at work is the only way to communicate. Sometimes I text her too much but we do communicate. We've talked outside of work few times. Every time a genuine conversation fun and engaging. I've annoyed her with giving her a gift this past Christmas even though I got her on the previous one. She was annoyed impart that she announced she was going lesbian over Facebook. This was 2 months before she starts dating this guy. But she's young niave.


You might be asking why am I attracted to a girl who's 7 years younger than me. We'll.

I've never kissed a girl or been in a relationship and am introverted and socially awkward.. I'm 25 and she's 18. There was initial attraction n' such we never really got to see each other cause her dad's controlling, plus she's quite shy, innocent, cute and introverted. I wanted to introduce her a new way of seeing the world from my reading and research into religion and existentialism while having fun. I noticed from her demeanor she was depressed and lonely. As she has expressed her loneliness and depression to me. From her last and first bf and first (who I think was much better than the current one but she begs to differ) I just wanted to help and potentially move into a relationship. I know it sounds manipulative but I tend to think I'm nice guy more on the agreeable side.


Along with my age as factor not too mention coupled we're co-workers at a retail store. I'm a Technician who repairs computers and she's a floor sales associate. 

Now the guy she's dating, and has visited his house a few times already. Personality wise  I see they really have nothing in common. He doesn't read he's barley passing School he skips most of it in fact. Not sure she knows that.. They pretty much only play video games and cuddle. I've sat down with him and conversated and friended him recently even before her to get to know him. He's nice in his demeanor and behavior, but his lifestyle at the age 17 is concerning: One, he smokes pot every day and he's done hash which at that age I'm like questioning his responsibility. She's aware of the pot smoking and doesn't partake or allow him to do it around her when she's there. But I'm not sure to the degree she's aware the extent he does, heck he's asked me almost every time I message him if want to blaze almost like it's a motus opperanda. Plus he Vapes.

Note about myself: I've only done weed 3 times EVER and I don't think it's anything spectacular. I do know it makes you satiated which is great if you want to escape harshness of reality or responsibility of a value structure. I'm for free use of weed but the effects warrant concern especially on a young developing mind.

That's not all he's told me outright. He's had consensual sex with a random teller at a license registration place. It was pretty much sex for convenience because it only lasted less a month or something. He did inkle that he had sex a second time with another girl, but I'm not sure. He also has a huge collection of porn in his computer..Confirmed from that conversation he told me: He's not sure how she'll respond to the fact about his precocious sexual behavior. I don't know why he told me all this but he did. He's also unaware of my attraction to her.


And here's how his friends are like. I was visiting one of his friends who’s also a pot smoker. One time, and they knew he was dating her and his friends were egging him with a pack of condoms whilst one was groping his girlfriend to have sex with her along with joking and poking fun at the fact he's not porked her since the started dating less than a month.. Like my god... Now in his defense he did respond by saying she's very sweet and treats him better than any girl he's been with for reasons for hold off the sex. But still, these are the people he surround himself with..


Now with her. I'm concerned with her involvement with a multi level marketing scheme. With all the typical over the top promises. She's been boasting about how she'll retire before age 20 and all this which I'm familiar with these schemes. I explained to her about the failure rates of these companies are 90-95% due to the structure and product of these organizations and that they are predicated on zealously selling easy passive income.. She doesn't think much what I told her. She's stubborn I've known that. But she's built this entire utopian personality that blinds her from seeing her potential downfall. She lives with a single dad so life has been tough, but to be showered with money doesn't solve your problems.. instant money tends to exploit to the heart's content and most people who win the lottery tend to default back to basic after about two years on average. Most relationships are ruined cause monies was of unraveling certain characteristic traits that people tend to ignore. I believe suffering is built into the nature of being. And to carried through life is to live an unfulfilled existence. There's no correlation between well-being and higher income from studies I've looked up. I know I'm making leaps and bounds but it's something I've lived with being in poverty most my life.


With her personality and her dating this guy who could take advantage of her. Especially when if the marketing thing doesn't work out for her that’ll ruin her map and leave her vulnerable because she hasn't scaffolded herself in case of such a scenario. And when people's fantasy or dreams get shattered to cope with the tenuous suffering people's proclivity is to go for local pleasure. Drugs, sex, alcohol, etc.

That said, I'm between rock and hard place. I'm wanting to tell her my truth cause with him if she'll most likely be sucked into his lifestyle considering her state and his lifestyle. Should I tell her to the best of my abilities the entirety?  Or should I just tell her I’ve never kissed a girl before cause that's what's been emotionally ebbing at me and creating so much tension. I just want to tell her that and my feelings towards her.. I know pathetic.. I know if I tell her everything there's a chance it could sour our friendship and my acquaintance with her boyfriend.

128,"So when I was 12 I touched another boy who was 6. It didn't go anywhere too horrible and I felt sick about immediately afterwards. The next day he tried to pull my pants down and was laughing. I didn't let him do that but I guess that meant he didn't feel as bad as I did. 

I never did anything like that with anyone again and he seems pretty well adjusted currently. I'm 19 and he's 13. 

I still feel awful about what I did and think about it a lot. I'm terrified that he's gonna show up to my house one day and tell me how I ruined his life. 

I don't know where to go from here.

So I realized I left out some details. I definitely knew what I was doing and I've kind of fucked up sexually. I was touched myself but my dad left porn open on his computer a lot.

129,"To keep a very long story short:

I live with my boyfriend of 2 years and his parents.They haven't exactly been the greatest in terms of wanting me here etc. And they forced me to go back to school to finish my optional Years so that I would be doing something ""productive"" in their eyes. They claimed at first they didn't care if I failed because they just wanted me to be doing something, so I rolled with it cuz I can stay here with the guy I love. 

Now we're here;

I have seven weeks left at 'college' (The UK kind.) and I started skipping two classes a day (Ones I knew I'd pass or fail for sure) for the last two weeks or so to try and pass my history class which I actually want to pass. I got caught doing so, and made up some web of lies saying that I'd been in and out of school because I had injured my foot (which is true, and is still Injured.) I am sure that my boyfriends parents are going to find out and despite them saying it doesn't matter if I fail or not, they got really mad the first time something like this happened and I don't doubt they'll be pissed this time. I've dug myself deep here and I don't know what to do to get out. Coming clean is only going to get me in more shit.

134,"I was just woken up at 4:06am by a phonecall from a number my Android listed as Troy. I was tired and answered, even though I didn't recognise the number or name, and they didn't bother saying hello - sorry for waking you - good morning.

He just asked me who I was, and I was groggy and sleep-stupid, so I told him my name. He clarified, and then asked me why I was texting his homegirl. I'm a woman and my voice is whiny and womanlike, I don't see why he was still on high-alert, and awake at 4am (same area code as me so must live in the same town).

Why I was texting his homegirl - my friend said she was deleting Facebook, and listed her number. I thought it'd be funny since historically no one has my number (especially not when she has a new phone) to be goofy. I texted her, ""Hello, new phone who dis"" and they simply replied, ""Lol who is this.""

I sent a pic of another friend making a weird face. She just did the laughing emoticon. I then sent a pic of my husband in a dress (you can only see the top half), because I still thought this was my friend, and they simply replied cha. A few hours later I checked FB and noticed my friend had posted the wrong number! She corrected herself in the next comment. I was so, so embarrassed but I didn't think it warranted explanation because the person would probably just right it off as weird. That all happened on Monday.

Back to present, now her homeboy(?) has me on the phone and is yelling at me, asking me why I'm lying about what happened (it really doesn't seem like a stretch) and asking who posted the number. Originally when I explained the mistake I was laughing, but it was clear this guy didn't give a fuck and was upset. I told him I wouldn't tell him who posted the number (because why?), and that it was an accident. He told me he'd make bad stuff happen or some shit, I don't even remember, and then said, ""Bye, bitch.""

I was okay with that, didn't bother me. Then he called back, so I hung up - which I shouldn't have, because I realize now, my voicemail has my full name listed. He called again after that, and apologized for calling again (weird, you just threatened me dude). He asked about my husband, asking who that was; I answered honestly, told him it was my husband, and he said that was fucking weird - yeah, to a stranger, but again I explained this was a wrong person text. 

He didn't care, he threatened me a couple more times, and ended the call with, ""Well I've got this cutie awake next to me, bye bitch."" 

At this point I thought this guy sounds a bit crazy. He's making threats to someone he doesn't know, and he sounds like a thug (there's a lot of weird shit that happens in our town, and we have issues with thug people). So I googled myself to see what personal information was online now that he has my name -

My stepmother ran for a government position and my family is very open, and been in the media plenty. I checked in to my parent's hottub back when checking in was a thing in 2011. And of course, I have a registered domain with GoDaddy (ugh) for an RPG site I had, and it lists my home address and everything!

I'm dealing with GoDaddy right now trying to get them to close my account. I changed all my personal info to some obviously fake nonsense. They were trying to extort me into privacy for like $14.99 or something. I'm actually a bit freaked out, because this guy sounded crazy and did not believe the honest truth - I should have just flipping texted wrong number when I realized my mistake.

I called the police (non-emergency) to report they were making threats. She told me it wasn't a police worthy issue, and that it was stupid of me to have my personal info online (I know that, lady!), and to call if anything else happened. I didn't feel safe at home, so I took my dog and I'm somewhere totally safe now.

140,"I am a 15 year old IB student that got the privilege of skipping grade 9 (IB MYP, not local school system). However, this privilege turned out to be an utter fucking nightmare. I coped with the IB system just fine, but there was this little problem that is now at the level of being a brain tumor. 

There is this weird thing with my country's (Azerbaijan) educational system. Despite the fact that I am in grade 10 as an IB student, I am in grade 9 in the local school system. There is a special exam in the local 9th grade, which involves all of middle school material, and in the end, students get a ""middle school diploma"" or something like that. Now, I've been in IB since 7th grade, so my mathematical curriculum is now drastically different. Plus, I have not done much studying of my local language anymore due to the switch as well. So, when I got into my new grade 10 class, my parents were forced to hire 2 extra tutors for the local subjects along with my existing French tutor. With just the French tutor it was just fine, but now 12-15 hours a week are spent on the exam preparation lessons and the homework for them. This came to bite my in the ass. Hard.

Due to this insane workload I've been hurt both mentally and academically. My attention span has lessened, absent mindedness increased, stress essentially quadrupled. I've been having minor cases of depression. So as I am writing this, there are teachers couple of kilometers away from me reviewing my exams that I performed on relatively poorly. I went from constant 7s (max grade) in October, to fluctuating between 5 and 6 in January. I got a 4 (minimum passing grade, around 50% score) in my last math exam that I got the score of just today and I am still shaken up. This needs to stop.

My parents tell me that the exam is only a necessity if I end up staying to study in Azerbaijan. But the thing is, the only thing that makes staying in Azerbaijan is the exam's workload itself. It's really draining and I am very frustrated with this bullshit. I do not think I am delusional because coincidentally I have another grade 9 skipper in my class and she is going through the same mental destruction. What do I do? Do you guys think I can get the weekly 12 hours back by trying to speak out and get rid of the obligation for the exam? If not, how can I at least fucking *survive* this bullshit?! I can't even drop the French tutor, because I need to finish B2 level before January. 

My brain is not functioning properly so If I left out some important details please ask me to elaborate.

For example last night a family member and I got dinner and saw a movie, after the movie she wanted to go get drinks but I just wanted to go home and take care of my dog and go to bed. I clearly stated this to her but she seemed insistent on continuing to hang out even though it was like 9:30 at night and I explained that I had to work at 8:30am the next morning. So I tried saying I needed to go let my dog out and stuff, which only made her want to come meet my dog (he's a puppy so everyone wants to meet him right now). So not wanting to be rude I said sure but told her she had to be out by 11 because that's when my parents (who I live with) go to bed. Well we get back to my house and it hits 11 and literally everyone is dropping hints at how tired they are and how they want to go to bed, legit even my dog was looking at me like ""come on I'm tired, I wanna go to bed"".

148,"(this is going to be a long read, so thanks for reading in advance.)

I don't have many good memories of my last relationship. I know it was terrible, but not completely terrible, and maybe those thoughts get suppressed easily but they never get to see the light of day.

I remember my ex as a manipulative, overly defensive sociopath who gave me hell, panic attacks and all. I also remember her as a rather troubled person who I tried to help out at first, before we got into a relationship. We were like friends, penpals and she was bipolar. She'd been through some shit before.

We were both in our late teens but acted like little kids playing a grownup version of house. She told me she's been in relationships before, but it didn't seem that way. I remember all of that like some sort of blur. She was immature, but I'm sure I was too, and some of the things I said, and the way I approached this whole thing still makes me cringe.

I also remember a very close friend... for six months. He was equally sociopathic (if not more), the kind of person on 4chan who would bully someone and then dig up stuff about them to justify his bullying. He used to meet me very frequently, having just gone through a breakup himself, for support. Sometimes he used to say some pretty disturbing things about meeting his ex, and I used to say nothing. He made sure he never had a chance of bumping into her, and was a recluse. I stopped contacting nearly all of my friends after I became friends with him (this was during my relationship with her).

Things crash-landed afterwards when I found out she was cheating on me. With him. It was one of those ""look, I was lonely back then, it was a fun run, this is it"" things. I cut off contact with them and never fully recovered, although I did start contacting more friends. I realized that perhaps it was a good thing they weren't in my life, it was like two birds with one stone. 

A year later they would contact me out of the blue, after doxxing me and holding me hostage over a video call because I spoke to a friend about them a few months ago. They somehow contacted some of my friends and to this day I don't know what they told them to make them stop contacting me. They threatened to press charges on some bullshit claims but I didn't call their bluff because I knew that they're crazy enough to make shit up and expertly play the victim here. I ended up filing a restraining order, and a lot of my friends believe that I'm the one making shit up here.

149,"A friend of mine paints, as a hobby.

She did a really cool one recently which I really liked. I said I'd like to buy it, since I'd indeed like to have it, but also because I knew that would make her feel pretty good and motivate her to keep painting. 

However when I said I'd like to buy it, I had in consideration that she never sold her work before (as far as I know), and the canvas is pretty small. So I assumed it would be around 30-50$. Maybe naively. 

But she asked for 160$. That took me a bit by surprise. Of course, she can ask any price she wants but I found it a bit expensive considering the context. I'd just like to have a outside opinion, considering I'm no art expert. She also said the painting took about 18h of work, which is a lot so I understand the need to get a significant value for it. 

For reference, the painting seems to be around 8x12 inches.",02Mar2017,1

151,"Context: I share a house with my sister and brother-in-law - I live in the basement, they live upstairs. They're recently married. My sister is out of town for a total of 9 weeks for a new position in her job. Last night I was woken up at 4am by the piano upstairs. It was so disorienting that at first I thought my phone had the wrong time. Anyways I called my brother-in-law, since I didn't want to walk all the way upstairs, and when he finally answered I could tell he was totally shit-faced. Managed to communicate that playing the piano at 4am is unacceptable, and got them to stop. However, the noise continued getting louder, as they were playing pool, talking loudly, stomping, and singing right above my bedroom. By 5:30 I'd accepted that I was not getting back to sleep, so I went upstairs to make breakfast (we share food/costs). The whole place reeked of booze and weed, and the guests had split into two groups - one on the porch smoking weed, and the others in the bathroom down the hall with the door open and the light off. I heard at least two women in the tub (big tub), and I heard two men (including my brother-in-law) in there as well. Now I didn't LOOK, but from what I heard I suspect they were all naked and probably fooling around to some extent. 

I've never been in a situation like this and I'm not sure what the most responsible response is. I thought about telling someone else in the family, I thought about cryptically texting my sister, ""Ask your husband how his bath was,"" I thought about confronting him about the noise, I thought about confronting him about the bath (I don't think that would end well for me or him)... They had a big fight about 9 months ago and she almost left him then. I don't have any proof, but if I roused her suspicions and she found out that he is cheating (which wouldn't surprise me, given the company he keeps) I'm sure their marriage would end. (which would be a huge nightmare, joined family, etc. etc.) (would also suck for me, I'd have to find somewhere else affordable to live, which is pretty hard in my city)

If it's relevant, they're both about 20 years older than me (I'm 23).

Not too long ago, he left for a week without even touching a huge mess he made in the kitchen, leaving me to clean it. Soon after his milk in the fridge expired (it was sitting in the fridge expired for a month already), and he decided to take it out of the fridge and sit the half full spoiled milk on the counter waiting for me to take it out, along with leaving moldy food in the fridge for weeks. Today, our trashcan is full. I have taken the trash out the last 5-10 times, because he never leaves his room anyways so I assume he doesn't use the trash. The past week or so I have seen him use the trashcan, and I have seen his trash in there on top of the already full can, which means he stuffed his trash in without taking the trash out like it should have been. I left a note before class saying it was his turn to take out the garbage. When I got back, the garbage was in front of my bedroom door with a note saying ""I don't use this you cuck""

He does use it. Like I said, I watched him. and I know what garbage I throw away and what I don't, and I know what trash of his I have seen in the can this week. We have had countless other problems and I can't seem to bring myself to be able to confront him or figure out a way to make him clean his own damn mess. We have been having a huge feud ever since he decided to call the police on me when he thought I was smoking in the appartment, but I wasn't.

161,"For the past 3 months regularly I wake up in the morning with a severe headache which develops into nausea and vomiting for approximately 4-10 hours. Symptoms typically resolve by night but I stay pretty much in bed all day due to severe nausea and headache as well as vomiting between 1-5 times during the day. I am fine the next day and the next episode happens between 7 to 10 days later like clockwork.

Before 3 months I also frequently had nausea and migraines (sometimes separate sometimes combined) for about 2 months intermittently but the migraines stopped after I changed environment, diet and stress level (left my job). I add this because I know migraines, and I currently do not have migraines, just very bad headaches with nausea.

I have cut out all meats other than chicken and non-fatty fish, no alcohol and quit smoking 2 months ago.

During our time together we have managed to adopt three cats, in addition to the one she owned before we started dating.

I'm looking for advice on how to best ensure that I can keep two of my cats. 

There's one cat that obviously belongs to her since she owned the cat before we started dating, and one cat which I specifically adopted to be my ESA, so those two are sorted out. 

The other two cats however, were adopted as a joint effort. I picked out and paid for one, which is the one I believe I should keep, and she did the same for the other. 

I've already called my county and made sure the two cats I want are registered in my name, and I have the adoption papers stating I'm the owner, but I'm worried she's going to try and pull some shit and keep three of the cats anyways.

169,"So i just graduated college and am starting a grad job in September. Sounds good so far but let me take you back. I never really wanted to go to Uni as i figured myself as a self-starter and capable of getting where i wanted in life without it. Cue parental and familial influence and i find myself in the most harrowing 6 years of my life, bringing about symptoms of depression and anxiety stemming from isolation, loneliness and a life not lived on your own terms.

In between this i did a fair bit of travelling to various countries and enjoyed the time i spent there, but almost feel that every time i returned home without any skills to speak of, it was just a fleeting experience. I return to ground zero.
So i came back from South America a couple months ago to finish some exams, done, now i have this gap of time of around 7 months to do as i please.

I should add that the feeling of failure (taking so long to graduate) and being so far away from my expectations of where i should be in life plagues me daily and almost paralyses me from making any future decision.

My choices seem to be to:

* 1) Go back to travelling, it was the happiest i remember being so far in my life and at least gets my out of a country where i have these familial roles i need to live up to (mostly by my own standards)

* 2) Enrol in some sort of course, a big part of why i don't find travelling fulfilling as such is because i don't feel i have added much to my skillset apart from soft skills. I should also mention that i don't feel like i have a hard skillset as such and hence am not much use anywhere (many recent college grads can relate i'm sure)

* 3) Start looking for a job straight away now, seems to be the worst option given that i already have a job lined up (which i am unsure if i would even enjoy) and it is hard to know at this stage which career i may end up in or find myself enjoying without any experience in anything.

* 4) Other options not yet considered

I picture myself going into work that is big picture thinking, where i could have creative input into how a product is marketed or operations concerning how a product is manufactured. Right now that looks like the ultimate career position of Product Manager or Operations Manager respectively. Right now the job i have lined up is in IT consulting, while not a bad first job out of college, it may be a big risk going into something i don't have an interest in seeing through to the end.

I suppose my biggest concern is that at age 25 i have done nothing with my life (save barely making it through college and travelling extensively) and am beginning to feel swallowed by failure of how far away from my expected success i am right now. I feel if i don't start making progress soon, this is it for me, i will live my life in regret for what could have been.

I guess what i am looking for advice in is how i should spend this next 6 months before my first job and reassurance i can still be who i wish to be, or who i know i am capable of being. But feel free to divert from that objective if anything else comes to you that you think is worth sharing, i'm all ears at this point.",02Mar2017,2

173,"I met my ex best friend when I was 17 (2008) or so. We met online in a student forum and we instantly clicked and soon became best friends. We've lived a lot together, have gone camping together, have helped each other through breakups, hardships etc. Generally it seemed like we were meant to be friends forever. She became a bit more distant since she had met her boyfriend, who was then her go-to person for things I'd have done in the past (like going out for a coffee or movie nights). I admit it kinda hurt, but I had a general feeling since we first met that I was more attached to her than vice versa so I didn't really react.

Anyways, here's a timeline of what happened.

-2013 I'm creating my thesis (video game), which my professor likes a lot and wants to submit it to a game competition. For it to be submitted, I need to add sound and we decide she's gonna record sounds, voice acting and music to reach a level where it can be submitted.


-2015 She's working on her thesis, and we decide to make some nice game art for it. I offer to make game art and we're frequently doing skype calls to show each other our work. I constantly change my mind and scrap my previous art, showing nothing really usable, and she eventually gets frustrated and answers that she doesn't care if I have a new idea, she just wants some basic stuff. I eventually lose my excitement in the project, she doesn't ask me again, but I left her without art.

-2016 Early in January, she told me she has an infection or so along her leg and she was gonna visit the hospital to see what's up. She was pretty calm about this and in my country you visit the hospital for almost everything, even for a bruise, so I assumed she was just gonna go check it out. I'm not particularly sure why I didn't offer to accompany her, maybe I was busy or something, but I didn't go anyways. 

A few days later she stopped talking to me. She would answer if I told her something in chat, but she would never start a conversation. We played a lot of video games together, but at that time she would always decline my invitations saying she was busy, but she would play with other people a few minutes later.

A few more days later I asked her how was her leg because I recalled something was wrong there. She said it was fine and it ended there.

About 1 week after that, I was pretty fed up with her dismissing me all the time and I straight-up asked what's the problem, because I feel like an idiot constantly trying to start conversation and she's always turning me down. 

She said she was hurt because she was very scared to go to the hospital, and thank god her boyfriend was there and that he had to skip university to stay with her. The rash on her leg was in fact very serious and she had to be hospitalized for some days because the house environment could cause a severe infection. She also mentioned that I'm a jerk for never caring about it and that just asking once is not something best friends do. Furthermore, she felt betrayed because she made sounds for my game but I completely ignored the art for her game, and that she had to make a formal application to her department's head to change her thesis subject because she couldn't make the art for her previous one.

That hit me out of the blue. I was trying to talk to her for weeks, wanted to play with her, go out with her, but I was met with dismissal and just few words. Then she said that I ignored her for weeks, didn't care about her health and her game (which at that point I had totally forgotten about) and only looked to get my ass covered.

I started calling her while she typed because, honestly, I was very stressed out and confused and wanted to set things right. She said ""if you're not accidentally calling, don't bother, I'm not gonna answer"". I realised I wouldn't get a word out of her on the phone so I dressed up and got on the train to her house.

After a couple of hours (it's a long commute), I ringed her doorbell. She asked who it was and when I said it was me she said ""NO WAY LEAVE"" and then I rang again and said ""I came all the way from home"". Then she opened the door. After some pretty dramatic stuff, tears, screams and so, we started talking again about what was going on in our lives. Her leg was actually pretty fucked up even though it was healing (she wasn't overreacting) and she told me she had changed her game enough so that she wouldn't need any art even though I offered. 

I left after some time of talking. For 1-2 weeks after we were talking almost daily, and played a lot, but oh the awkwardness. Then we stopped. We mutually and silently decided not to talk to each other. Honestly, I felt very guilty and a scumbag. Not about her leg, since I genuinely had no idea was serious, but about the help I offered but didn't give. I'm fairly certain that's her reason for not talking to me too.

She kept posting about movie nights, camping trips and so on her Facebook, but soon I couldn't see them because she put me on Restricted. I then deactivated my Facebook because I didn't want to feel like I was being barred from all the fun my ex-friends were having (I had also made friends with many of her friends).

She did sent me ""happy birthday best wishes"" on my birthday, and I responded then, but I didn't reciprocate on her birthday because it felt awkward after all these months of not talking.

I've always had her on my mind as my bestest friend. Even after we stopped talking, after the bitterness subsided, I realised (and seems to be true so far) that she would be the only one to actually understand all the shitty things that go on in my brain. She's the only one to have always laughed with my stupid puns and jokes. And I haven't had a friend as close as her since then. Honestly, I still miss her. Even if we never make things like they were, it's a thorn in my heart that it ended so badly. 

Recently I've been feeling like I want to talk to her, but I absolutely don't want her to dismiss me. If I see that my message has been ""Seen"", I'll probably start crying right there, then cringe forever. AFAIK she's moved to the USA for her Master's, but I am not sure because I can't see her updates on Facebook.

That felt like a huge blog post. Anyways, what's your advice?",02Mar2017,1

I am very interested in mathematics. I wish to pursue a PhD. However, I'm beginning to doubt my natural abilities and talent. Yesterday I wrote a math contest, which I was prepared for, and still managed to get many of the questions wrong. The contest was timed, and I realized my errors shortly after it ended. Several acquaintances on the other hand, seemed to get the answers straight away. They also prepared for the contest. The only difference, is that they were clearly forced by their parents to prepare. I initially reasoned that it was because they were just quick, and good with time. And that once we'd get to actual rigorous math, I would be superior in my abilities. I have no reason to even believe this, as they will likely beat me at that too. I study politics,physics ,math,read and posses other qualities of intelligent people. I am able to understand math many years ahead of my age.

206,"Hi, I'm a 26 y/o guy from Sweden and I'm looking for advice. 

So there's this girl... I haven't seen her in 7 years but we made a volunteer trip together and became good friends for about a year, I was madly in love with her at the time but it only led to a few nights together, after which our lives went in different directions. 

Fast forward 7 years and I contacted her again after a drunken, lonely night on Facebook. We hit it off and decided to meet up and hike together in Norway for a week in the summer. I had gone through a really tough break up and I needed this. 

So I went to Norway (about a 12 hour drive from where I lived), happy as any guy would be about to hike with an old flame after over a year of loneliness. But, she never showed. 

During the week I received a bunch of messages (I'll short it down for ya):

Saturday: ""My car broke and I'm going to be a day late""  
Monday: ""car still broken, will come Tuesday""
Tuesday: ""I'm so so so sorry but car need more fixing, Thursday I'll be there!""

At this point I'm really annoyed. I was hiking alone around my car, but the last days it had been raining and the whole Wednesday was spent in the car reading books. I was going home on Saturday and I wanted more than 2 days with her...

Thursday she dropped the bomb: ""I really sorry but I've been lying to you, the car isn't broken, it's for a reason I can't explain.""

Later she explained the reason she didn't show, lets just say it involved some kind of illness, alternate medicine (hallucinogens and a witch-doctor (I'm picturing a guy from Diablo III)). 

Fast forward again halv a year, I now have blocked her Facebook and Instagram. She contacted me by email and wants to hang out again, explain everything and make up. The sentimental side of me is telling me to keep contact with her, but the rational side is telling me that I have to put my food down or these kinds of things will keep happening to me. 

So my question for you is: Do I turn the other cheek and hear her out, or do I ignore her forever?

TLDR: Was supposed to meet an old love for a weeks vacation, she left me alone in another country for a week and lied about it the whole time.

210,"Really good girl friend(not girlfriend), pretty much the first I really got close to etc. I got humiliated today by some loser-oh wait they're actually considered ""cool"" nvm. I'm definitely physically stronger but decided not to respond. While getting humiliated I catch her laughing from the angle of my eye, especially when they said ""nerd"" mhmm... now you're not my friend and youd rather take side with the ""cool"" kids? Youre a nerd too you even said that to me once wtf. Even if it was just a 5 minute thing, it ruined my day completely. I went home but now I'm in a dilemma.

Should I brush it off and stay in touch or should I just cut it off because it's not real. One of the only legit connections that I didn't feel like they were a pain to be in, up until this point of course.

I get that maybe she was trying to defuse it by laughing but it definitely didn't work. I tried to be as objective as I can here so help me out

edit: just pointing out that she tried to be nice in text messages afterwards, not specifically about what happened so I dont know if she knows that hurt me but i guess she thought its too weird that i skipped the first 2 classes, got to recess then went home. im definitely beating those kids up as soon as i see them again tho thats for sure",02Mar2017,1
211,"Hello everyone. I have something that I could use some help with... so I worked at Kroger from 10/19 to 12/19 (ish). Just worked for a little extra money after school. I was 17, and never thought about taxes once. I had to be let go because I was moving to north Carolina, no big deal. But now, I was talking to my dad and he said I might be able to get some of the money they took from taxes. So of course I want to know how!

If you need any additional information I'll be happy to supply it. ",02Mar2017,1
214,"Over the last month I've been REALLY getting my shit together and I've been doing a lot of stuff. I went on my first date, I'm going with someone to my first prom, I'm getting a job, I've been busting my ass studying for the SAT's March 11th, I bought a bunch of new clothing to replace my rags that I used to wear, I'm talking to more people, I visited a college, researching colleges frequently, etc. 

So I felt like this would be a good opportunity to force myself to volunteer. I went to the environmental club teacher at my school and joined the club. He asked me a question that really got me thinking. He said ""are you doing this purely for self-interest"", and I guess I am actually. Despite being an environmentalist, I'm worried that I'll have no one to talk to while doing all this environmental mumbo jumbo and cleaning up parks. And I'm also purely doing this to get some experience to put on applications and for colleges because I want to get into Environmental Science or Environmental Engineering.

I'm not really all that excited about doing this. In fact, it's making me really anxious. I don't really like the whole ""community meeting environmental"" thing and I think they're bullshit from prior experience in these kinds of clubs. And according to the schedule I saw they only get out like 10 times a school year to actually do stuff. 

But the teacher also mentioned that since I'm interested in getting into the Environmental STEM field he'd work with me so this could be an extremely valuable contact. Though the guy does sound like really non-personal and my best friend hates him. 

Even after all this is considered I also have to consider the fact that I'm likely going probably have him for a class Senior year. So if I do just tell him ""lol no I was just kidding"" then he's probably going to hate me next year. 

The first timed event I'm supposed to be attending is March 11th at 9am through 12pm and that happens to be the exact time I'm taking the SAT's. So I can't attend. I have to email him back now and explain that. 

Maybe I'm just being a lazy fuck I don't damn know.",02Mar2017,1
215,"Well... As the title says, should I keep trying with these people I talk too and don't seem to put an effort in this ""Friendship""? I am a very social person, maybe a bit too much... But whenever people message me or whatever I can usually always reply, until they start giving me single replies, than that is where i feel screwed because I can only say so much to single word replies. In the end this causes me insecurity and makes me feel annoying. I understand plenty of people enjoy talking verbally instead or seeing each other but I don't have the transportation atm, and neither do these folks I talk too. Are these people worth trying for or should I leave them alone?",02Mar2017,2
217,"So to start this, I am going to explain myself, who I am, how my day goes, etc.
As of now, I am 13 years old and am Homeschooled by choice. The public schools in my area after a recent move are not very good, and are far behind what my old school was doing. I was basically repeating 6th Grade, and I didn't want to do that, so I asked my parents if I could be homeschooled.

Now, I take online classes that have adapted to me. I am working with my ""Teacher"" (more like a schooling guide, so to speak), about starting my highschool credits now, in 7th Grade. This is great, obviously, I can advance my education more and in turn live a more successful life.

Now, this is where things become an issue for me. As of the last few months, after my older sister had moved out, I was thrown a bunch of responsibilities. This, obviously, was very well accounted for and I understood this would happen.. but some of the responsibilities I have taken on shouldn't be my responsibility.

What happens is I wake up at around 7 in the morning. My Dad gets up a bit before that to wake up my siblings and get them ready for school, and then prepare himself for his job. I boot up my computer and get on the website to start my day to day routine of completing some lessons. Now, this is where it becomes an issue for me.

I want to succeed in life, and I have the will to do it. I don't want to be an egotistical asshole, but I have always gotten good grades and have been offered more challenging courses than my peers. I have sustained friendships for my entire lifetime as well, so I am what people would refer to as an outcast.

Every day, after my Dad leaves, my mother makes me take my baby brother. About 1 years old, constantly screaming and crying, causing me to stop what I am doing (my schoolwork), and take care of him. Day in and day out, she sleeps while I have him with me. It's extremely hard to focus like this, and getting anything done is near damn impossible. I also have a 3 year old brother, who sits in the living room and plays games. I have to constantly dismiss myself from my education to check and see if he needs a diaper, change my baby brother and toddler, feed them, et cetera. I don't know if this is right or not, but all of my friends' parents constantly tell me that it's just wrong that I have to do all of this, while my mother sleeps. She is pregnant with ANOTHER baby, which i know is going to become my responsibility as well. And, when my siblings get home, my little sister who is just 8 years old has to help too. My Mom will tell her to change my baby brothers diapers and shit, and I think it's fucking horrible. She's 8, let her be a little kid. My life as of now revolves around diapers and feeding little kids. I can't succeed in life like this. As I am writing this, I am in my room with a baby in my lap that is constantly fussing and crying and I don't even know what the fuck to do about it. Earlier, I tried to ask my Mom to please take him while I finish my tests that I need to do, and she yelled at me. She said ""You have all fucking day to do them, I don't want him attached to my hip all day long."" But if that's what she wants, why is she pregnant again? If she can't handle having a kid by her side, why is she having another.. It is extremely unfair and it makes me want to scream and cry because my future is slowly dismantling itself every day I have to skip my schoolwork because my baby brother is screaming in my ear constantly.

Any advice? I've been told by my older sister to just ride it out, not much I can do. Am I just wrong? Is this acceptable? I am only a 13 year old boy, after all. What do I know about parenting? Is sleeping your life away while your 13 year old throws his education down the drain because she doesn't feel like taking care of him?

Any advice will do, even if it's a lecture on why I'm wrong.",02Mar2017,1

So there's this girl in my P.E class at school. We talked once like 3 months ago near Christmas but after that I kinda just minded my own business and avoided everyone like I usually do. So last week I go really bored and talked to her and we talked along with her friend for the entire period. At the end we talked about prom and she mentioned that she was going and I was kinda like ""awww"" in a playful way and she mentioned that I should go with her. So I said I'd think it over. So now today I explained that I can't afford it atm (I really can't afford the entrance fee) for Junior prom so she suggested Senior prom 3 months or so from now and I agreed.

We don't really appear to have anything in common like at all. I actually don't really know why she wants to take me lol I'm such an uninteresting person I think. I don't know what to talk about with her. So how does this prom thing work exactly? It just feels weird. I got her number today and I don't even know what to talk about over text so I haven't texted. I do think she'd genuinely be a lot of fun to take to prom though for some reason since I've never even been to one in the first place.

223,"Hi everyone who will take time to read this.

I'm 27, what I would call a normal guy. A bit shy but had a normal life, girlfriends, lived six months in Finland, two in Spain, played in a lot of bands and currently working on a solo project. In university I studied philosophy, got a Master's degree with excellents grades and had a collaboration with a good professor which lead to a publication.

I applied for PhDs: I simply can't stand the idea of a 'normal' job. I want to contribute to mankind in a great fashion or die trying. I do not see myself making ice cream for 30 years - even though i envy those who can and enjoy it. Life would be so simple.

Anyways, after MANY rejections I finally got 2 offers, one in Austrlia and one in New Zealand. Since the latter was closer to my research interest, I accepted it and moved there. This was last year. Long story short, I had some sort of mental breakdown - I snapped and returned home immediately. There were some practical problems too with the scholarship there, since the professor had to move, but it was mainly psychological. All the conflicts I had with my family felt like jokes when I was 18,000 km away from home. I learned a lot about myself there and the relation with my father improved a lot. I do not regret my choice.

I started to apply for PhDs closer to home and this is where I am snapping. The applications are so long they drain your life away. You see a deadline, next month. Then, 15 days to wait for a reply. If you are interview, it's 15 days later and then another 15/30 for a response. This means that the shortest one will take approximately 2-3 months. Today I got rejected from what I perceived as my best interview ever.

I simply feel like I am letting my life slip away. I want to do stuff, I think about it all day and night. But seeing my friends, who have already been working for 5+ years makes me feel like a failure. I have no immediate need to work, since my family is not poor, but I want to. I want to leave a sign.

So I'm stuck here, doing stupid jobs just to get some money (part-time bartending, tutoring a high school girl etc). I'd like to find a serious job while I apply for a PhD but my country is in terrible conditions and I am not an engineer or an expert in IT. I know 4 languages yet crappy countryside hotels won't even reply to my curricula for night shifts because I do not have previous experience.

As of 3/10, I'm going to be homeless.  No friends here, no family for 3000 miles.  Thought about camping it out until June'ish but sort of worried about cats.

Started downhill slide when fiance lost his job of 15+ years in late ''15 &amp; couldn't find more work.  He ended up severely depressed, stopped functioning, on 5 psych meds.  Still unemployed.

I used my savings to move us into a home about half the cost of our other one.  I got diagnosed w/several things including kidney disease &amp; need lots more treatment.

Leaving this county, I lose this insurance and so does he and we are without healthcare at that point.  I wanted to try to make it here at least 30 days while I got biopsies sorted out.

No one to loan us the money.  No more access to credit bc we couldn't pay bills for months.  He couldn't/wouldn't function &amp; I stayed by him hoping it would change.  It didn't...

I thought I had a plan.  AirBnB until working and bk discharge and then, just pre-pay at an apt or pay quadruple deposit.  However, after talking to a few, that's a nope.

I have two cats I'm not willing to compromise on and he has night terrors so housemates would be unfair to the other party/couple.  Is it AirBnB or leave Los Angeles?

I have a graduate degree and when well, I can find work easily and quickly.  He doesn't have a degree but is advanced in his field.  I'm not well physically and he's not well mentally.

I'm just homeless now, right?  For 10 years until this falls off my credit report?  Or, until I win the lottery and can buy my own place?  This all seems so surreal right now.

My other problem is that I was the primary financial support for my father.  He is disabled.  He's been moved to assisted living.  I need to get 3000 miles to handle his things.

So, what next?  Biopsy? Home to fix family?  Trying to support fiance by staying in LA?  Abandoning it all and taking my last $1000 and trying to head in a new direction?

I've been in my job for 10 years and I'm now in my mid-twenties. 

I'm looking to retrain as I'm not really enjoying what I'm doing, I can't go much further and I want to be more hands on (same profession, different role). 

I've been studying at home in the evenings and weekends completing a course which should help me get into Uni. I sent off my applications in October and, to my shock, I actually got some interviews. One interview was yesterday and it's left me feeling really crap. I loved the Uni but the interviewers made me feel that I may just be there to fulfil a quota. The questions started out relevant and then turned to a very personal (age related and lifestyle) barbecuing. I felt like I was being spit-roasted and humiliated. My previous interview at another Uni was OK-ish but I talked too much and pretty sure I've blown both interviews. 

Basically, this experience has almost completely put me off going if I get an offer (cat in hells chance). The course I applied for is highly competitive and if I got a place I should be thrilled, but I'm not sure I want to go anymore.

I have really, really struggled to even get to those interviews and sit in the room. I've been working on recovering from anxiety/panic disorder for the last few years. This is one of the goals I'd set myself but I'm very tired, frustrated and frightened. I just don't have the energy anymore. I feel like I'm fighting a war with my mind, body, job, studying, home and applications. I should say I'm more healthy than I've been since I was 21, when things really kicked off. 

Is all this work really worth it? Should I just accept what I've got, be grateful and let this idea go (grow up)?

239,"so proposing to my (very) long time GF soon(few weeks) and need help in deciding which way to do it. 

here were my thoughts:

My initial plan: Date night out, dinner reservations at a nice restaurant, then go to a comedy show(we both enjoy these). so i was going to propose in a secluded little garden area (i dont want it to be public with a bunch of people around) about 10-15 min before our reservations. so we get there early, have a drink at the bar, then walk to the garden and bam! thought this restaurant would be a nice sentimental place, since we are HS sweet hearts and went there last for Prom(15+years ago).

2nd plan: we live in California, so was thinking maybe a sunset proposal? same thing, date night at restaurant at the beach. get there early, walk around to a more secluded lookout point and propose. eat dinner, maybe go to a bar, then head home for the night (30-45 min drive).

3rd plan: do plan 2, but make a whole day/night out of it by staying at a nice hotel at the beach. so tell her to pack a over night bag for a special night together (but not tell her where we are going). have lunch at the beach, check in, go do plan 2 then back to the hotel for the night. 

issues i am having with plan 3, to get a ""perfect romantic"" room, gotta get one of the nicer hotels, talking $300-500+ for the night. plus dinner, meaning the night will cost me maybe close to $800+. i can afford the hit, but not sure if all that is needed or it might just be a waste of money. also looking into hotels, god damn fucking yelp reviews have ruined like every nice hotel i find! &gt;&lt; so i am stressing out, that what if we have one of those shit experiences at the hotel that ruin the night.

also, i planned on having my brother secretly video tape the proposal. then during dinner, i was gonna upload it to FB and tell all her family and friends to blow her phone up and send her congrats. then when she is like, how does everyone know, i show her the video! thoughts on this, good/bad?

so which plan do you fellow redditors think is the best? please please do not give me more options, i just want 1 of the 3 i thought of. lol i do not need more options than these 3 running around in my head! thank you all for reading!

242,"So... My grandma died early last year and the only photos I had left of her were from Christmas 2015. And today I managed to, quite possibly, forever remove them from existence, just because I was in need of space on my phone:

I was using the popular program called ""File Manager"", by ""ZenUI, ASUS Computer Inc."" to copy my photos from my internal storage to my microSD. Once it was finished moving all the files I marked the whole folder in my internal storage, and pressed delete. But, like the bloody retard I am, I decided to tick the ""Permanently delete"" button. I did this expecting it to just delete the folder which was still in my internal storage -- but, alas, it turns out it deleted both the original and the ""backup"" I had just made a couple of minutes ago...

Now, according to my google drive I have a backup from January 10th. Which I'd assume would contain my lost photos, but I am unable to access it in any kind of way!

Is there anything that I can do about this? Is it possible for me to get these lost photos back or will my memory have to suffice?",02Mar2017,1

I'm waiting to hear back from another company that would pay me much more and told me I would hear from them by Friday.

251,"I live in a 3 story apartment building on the first floor. the people above me have a baby that has to be atleast 6 months old (based on how long I've been listening it cry-_-) long story short they're extremely noisy when their baby starts crying. they start stomping around and sometimes yelling at each other. to make matters worse, their floors creak when they walk and I can hear it very loudly. so I deal with crying, yelling, stomping, and a creaking ceiling all at the same time. and this happens multiple times in the day and in the middle of the night like clock work. I've complained to the rental office and the landlord looks at me crazy and claims she will ""come listen to it"" and never does. so I emailed the main office and they contacted me within 1 day and said the landlord will contact me to help me out.. guess what, she never called. 

so now I feel stuck. I understand having thin walls, creaking floors and a crying baby are all things out of my neighbors hands. but it is effecting my sleep severely. I'm woken up around 1230am, 3-4am, and 7am every single night. I'm a full time student so sleep is something I greatly need. any advice on what I can do to get this problem taken care of?

edit: moving isn't an option. it's not financially in my budget. earplugs would cause me to miss my alarm in the morning and it would also cause me to spend money I don't have. I literally live on top ramen and rice.",02Mar2017,1
252,"I haven't been to a doctor since I was about 15 or 16. That was the first time I'd gone and been asked the regular questions of ""have you had any suicidal thoughts?"" ""have you been feeling more down than usual in the past few months?"" Maybe if I hadn't of lied and just admitted to my feelings, I wouldn't be where I am right now. But that's just another symptom of depression, isn't it? Dwelling on the past and thinking of the ""what if's"". My mental state wasn't as bad back then, and I often put it off as I was probably just moody because I was a teenager. 

I remember being very nervous when I went to get my learners permit. I was even more nervous to have to take a drivers ed class so I waited until I was 15 and a half and got it on my own, planning to have my parents teach me how to drive. They aren't bad at driving but they're not teachers. I learned the basics of how to drive a car but when it came to being on the road and being in traffic, my nerves kicked into overdrive and my parents weren't very good at teaching me how to be on the road with other drivers. I know I'm an ok driver, I would do perfectly fine in a small town going 25 MPH. But I'm so anxious on the freeways and back roads. I just have this feeling that I'm going to get into a wreck or hit a dog and those feelings never leave my mind. So now, at 22 years old. I still don't have my drivers license. Again, dwelling on the past, but I really feel like if I would have sucked it up and taken the drivers ed class instead of having my parents try and teach me, I would have had my license for 6 years already. 

A drivers license might not be a big deal to some people, but in my situation it kind of is. I dropped out of school my senior year because I was behind way too many credits and I wasn't going to graduate with my class anyway. My school wasn't a very good one, and they wouldn't allow me summer classes or any online make up classes so I was stuck knowing I'd have to go a another whole year without any of my friends and I was quite frankly just too embarrassed. Leading up to the failed classes, I became way more shy and anxious. I would dread going to school in the morning and I'd often get up, get on the bus and then just walk back home so my parents would think I was at school and by the time I walked home they'd be gone to work. I can't really remember exactly what made me not want to go in the first place, but I'm guessing it was something mentally I was unaware of. Eventually I started to fall behind so I would just skip more to avoid having to explain to the teacher why I was gone for so long and I wouldn't have to do project presentations or take tests I was only going to fail. I ended up signing up for online education. Not through my school, but one of those k-12 things. It looked like it was going to be fine, and my dad allowed me to fully drop out of the school I was in because I was going to be switching to online but things got mixed up and I was one day too late for the semester. I probably should have taken action and just signed up for the next semester, but my parents suggested just getting my GED since I was already 18 anyway. I still haven't gotten it, because new places and situations terrify me. But I really believe I'm smart enough and if I needed to I could probably get it. There's also money involved in getting one, and the one subject I'm not so good at is math so I don't want to ask my parents for money to take it because if I do fail then I'm just waisting their money.

Now for a while I was jobless and had no car and wasn't in school but I was ok. I was actually doing so much better mentally because the burden of school wasn't there. I was truly happy for once. That summer especially was good because even though I had just flunked out of school, my brother was on summer vacation and so were my friends so I didn't feel weird that I wasn't in school. A few months after the new school year started, I started working with my dad. It wasn't always 5 days a week, but it paid $12 an hour which was great for a first job and all I had to do was file papers, print out orders, and organize things on the computer. It worked out great because I just carpooled with my dad. I actually enjoyed it, even though the other women in the office were a bit gossipy for my liking, I sort of kept to myself and just did what I had to do and it was lovely. I was able to buy my whole family relatively nice christmas presents that year and I even got myself a MacBook and an iPhone. I bought myself, my brother and our friends tickets to a concert the following summer and it was one of the best days of my life. Even though it wasn't my dream career in any sort of way, I was happy and I was doing ok. Eventually though, they started to have me do more things. Which I think most people would be happy about but they were having me do things like answer the phone and talk to people who came in and that made my anxiety shoot through the roof. Half the time I didn't even know what I was doing and would just hang up on the customer because I got too anxious. At this same time, they were hiring more people and because I only came in when my dad came in and couldn't have my own schedule, they let me go. 

Ever since then things have just gone downhill. I've been offered to work with my dad again but it would be as a receptionist and i obviously can't do that. There's an elderly couple that lives in my grandmas neighborhood who I house/dog sit for every couple months but I only make $50-maybe $100 each time I do that. So right now, and for the past couple years, that and birthday/christmas money from my grandma is my only source of income. 

I don't live in the middle of nowhere, but I live far enough from any city or town that I definitely need a car to get to work or even just get to a bus stop. It all comes back to needing a car. I feel like if I had a car, I'd have a job and I wouldn't be so stuck. What made me come on here a write this was just a little while ago my dad was showing me an ad for a job at a hardware store that's near where we live. He doesn't get depression or anxiety and I don't think either of my parents are quite aware of how bad my mental health is but I just can't work in a place that would require me talking to customers. So retail and fast food are sort of out of the question. I said I don't think I could work there because I know nothing about hardware and he told me I should just get a job anywhere that's hiring so I can have a job. He wasn't being mean or angry but it made me feel like complete shit because it just reminds me how lazy I must seem to everyone. 

When I start to think this way, I start to think how there's no way out. There's no way for me to get a job without a car, there's no way for me to get a car without a job. There's no way for me to get my license because I'm just too scared. This all leads me to start thinking the only way out is to just kill myself. I've never made plans to do so but I've strongly wished that I would have the guts and just do it. Sometimes I can see a future but I just don't know how I'm ever going to get there. I know I should probably see a therapist but that would require talking about all this to my parents, and I've tried that. They don't get it. It doesn't work. 

I also don't have any friends besides one that live across the country who I've never met in person. I spend days and hours on end just in my room by myself either crying or sleeping. 

I don't have a god relationship with my mom either, she's so ignorant with everything and every conversation with her is so negative and brings on the thoughts of suicide so I try to avoid her as best I can. I'm honestly happiest when I house sit for the elderly couple because I feel some sort of purpose. I'm away from the negativity in my house, I can sleep at whatever times I want to without being judged, and I'm making money/doing a job so I don't feel so worthless. 

I'm just stuck in such a rut. I'd love to hear similar stories so I know I'm not alone and I know there's a way out. 

(I spend a lot of time watching YouTube and I want to try and be a YouTuber but I really need to push myself to do it. I feel like I wouldn't even be successful but it might be my way out so hopefully I get the strength to try.)",02Mar2017,3
253,"Hy I need some advice.I had a really bad period the last few years and I kinda, ended up deactivating my brain since I had so many sources of problems and stress and had to focus on uni, it was the only way I could stay functioning .Now I can't really reactivate.And wanted to ask if there was anyone who managed to snap him/he out of it because I'm out of ideas.",02Mar2017,1
254,"So I was getting with this guy, I was really excited because I've never been in a relationship and he knew this. 

We never did anything to indicate a relationship so he was going to take the step and ask me out on valentines day, he went clubbing the Saturday before Valentines day and then told my friend that he wanted to go 'explore his options'... My initial reaction was that I didn't care and for all I knew was that he could explore my middle finger and catch some STD. 

Now it's different, how? Because I really miss him! I was angry when I thought about it but now little things keep leading back to him and now I realise I actually REALLY like him and that I miss him even though he was a jerk. Initially the response I get from people when I tell them what happened is that I shouldn't go to him and that he obviously wasn't a good guy. 

He was though, he was brilliant and was a gentleman! People don't see it like that but he is generally a sweet guy and even my friend (A guy i see as my brother who is also the guy i was getting with's best friend) will tell you that he is generally nice and it isn't like him to be the way he was. 

I'm not going to lie, i did go through the faze of wanting him to see what he was missing so I was posting cute pics up for him to see and I still got nothing back so In general this whole thing has got my hopes up for nothing but I really want to see him again and for him to like me like he did before. 

Please tell me how I can get him to notice me more, theres no point telling me to leave him since I have this major crush on him now and I just want things between me and him to go to the way it was before. ",02Mar2017,1

257,"My friend (only known him for a month and a half) just lost a very close friend in a car accident.

Without giving specifics, he is extremely shaken up. 

I have spoken with him a few times since then. Normal stuff, asking if he got home alright and letting him know I'm here to talk if he needs.

I am now in a dilemma. I feel like I should be texting him and asking how he is and asking if there's anything I can do.

However, I have not known him for more than a month and a half. Though I consider us pretty close for such a short amount of time, I still feel it inappropriate to force myself into the ""caregiver"" role.

Is it appropriate to text him every other day (or so) asking how he is and if there's anything I should do?

Should I just be normal and send him funny pictures I see on the internet?

Should I just leave him to be with his family and closer friends?

Not sure what the play is here, any advice is appreciated.",02Mar2017,1
258,"Hello everyone, I am a senior at the University of Georgia, and I am about to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science this May.

I was recently offered a job in Charleston, South Carolina with a decent salary, but I was also accepted into graduate school. Now I have to decide whether attending graduate school or taking the job is the most beneficial thing for me.

While the job sounds great (it's near the beach, it's an opportunity to meet new people, and it would be nice to finally make some money), the work itself is not challenging and I will bore of it rather quickly.

As for graduate school, according to my professors and financial advisor, I have a 90% chance of attending tuition free; however I will not find out until August. Attaining my master's degree in Computer Science will increase my salary, on average, according to the University of Georgia post-graduate student surveys, from a median of $62,000 to a median of $120,000. Also, getting a master's will provide more challenging work opportunities. However, all that said, this would add two more years of schooling, and I'd still be a poor college student.

My initial feelings tell me to stick in school. I am already in the school mindset, all of knowledge is fresh. I have no family (wife/kids) to keep me from attending now, and I have a good life in my current city.

However, I am a naive college student and would appreciate the advice of more experienced adults.

Thanks so much.",02Mar2017,1
