0,Hi reddit. I'm bored with my life and having an existential crisis. I'm a 21 yo girl I want to work for 2 months until my school starts to occupy myself. But the thing is I already tried working in my major area (computer science) and the classic waiting tables. I want something different and odd this time. So is there any weird/odd/unpopular entry level jobs that come into your minds? Payment doesn't matter. ,06Jul2017,1

Hello, I'm a 27 year old male and I've always been a geek who had your typical /r9k/ ""kissless, hugless virgin nerd"" teens and early 20s. Virtually no female contact in my life apart from my mother. I didn't mind it much, and the few times in my 22s-23s when my hormones were out of control I went to escorts (I got tested for everything after and I'm in the clear, I regret doing it tbh).

&amp;nbsp;

But 2 months ago one of the few girls I've ever had decent conversations with (she was also a geek) contacted me again after 4 years of not talking to each other. We went out and after a few dates we actually got into a relationship.


Fast forward 2 weeks, it crashed and burned because of many reasons, including my own inexperience as it was my first relationship ever. While it pains me seeing it end like that, I know that I must move on.

&amp;nbsp;

That relationship made me change many things about myself, I stopped biting my nails (which were horrendously short), and I've started going to the gym and all that. I've been working on my self-esteem and image. But it also left me craving for more of that ""having someone who loves you for who you are"" feeling.



I used to be very spontaneous and considered fun, but from around 21 to 26 years old I had a really ""shut in"" phase where I lost my social skills, motivations and failed a lot of classes in uni and felt bored all the time.

&amp;nbsp;

Then it hit me. I'm already 27 years old and the only relationship I've had with a woman has been a 2-week roller coaster of disaster. I've been going out this last month to language exchange meetings and clubs 3-4 times a week to meet new people and I'm failing at making meaningful connections, not only with women but in general. I feel like I have almost nothing in common with anyone, not even people who like things similar to mine. I have no ""game"". My life has been relatively boring, my conversations are too matter-of-fact-ish and I fail at coming up with witty remarks or comments to establish a rapport with anyone and open them up (that's one of the reasons my relationship didn't last, it dried up REALLY fast), and I have absolutely no idea how to improve on that side of myself.

&amp;nbsp;

English is not my first language so some things may sound odd.


TL;DR How do I improve my social skills, just going out isn't helping very much. And I feel like I've lost my passion for geeky stuff, I just keep doing it to not feel bored. Sorry I also needed to vent a bit.",06Jul2017,2
11,"As the title says, I crossdress. Its my sexual fetish I like being sissyfied and all that jazz. I'm still kinda new to it so I wanted to see what people thought and I thought it would be fun/risky to send them to people I knew. So I send a couple people from my contacts through google voice, a service that gives me an alternate phone number, and let them know I'm someone they know from highschool that wants to see what they think of my crossdressing, etc. 

So i send it to a couple people, they say sure- i send pics (without face) and get positive results. One person tells me its what they would wear and another says keep it up, stuff like that. I send it to another person and shes freaked out kinda. She asks who it is and when I tell them I dont want to tell her cause she can easily blackmail me, she gets somewhat aggresive saying she can post my number on facebook and that I'm harassing her. I can post screenshots of the convos if that would help.

 Anyways a bit after talking with her I got a message saying she tried to call this number. I dont *think* she can actually track me down to find out who I am and get me busted. I dont think anything I did was actually illegal but I'm afraid of her finding out because she can tell my family which obviously dont know about all of this and I will be ashamed. Please let me know what I can do about this. I unlinked my phone number from my google voice account but I'm actually really freaking out, shaking.

The backstory is this: A few months ago I bought a laptop without doing the proper research so I basically just walked into the store, went I have this much money, whats the most expensive laptop I can get and I got it. 


Obviously the laptop ended up be pretty shit. So what im planning on doing is to bring my laptop in today to see if I can get a refund or something then im gonna get a new desktop. 


I want to ask my dad what desktop I should get as it would be good to have a second opinion and most importantly since there are no good stores that sell desktops nearby I will have to have it delivered to my house. 


I guess the hardest thing here for me would be admitting that I was wrong and that I need help. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to get over the anxiety?

16,"I've been with my girlfriend for over two years now, we recently moved in together and things have been going smoothly except for things that involve food and exercise. 

We're both 23, and as of right now she weighs around 300 pounds, getting to that point through a combination of stress eating and PCOS (So i've been told) and probably from a lack of exercise.

I also have a weight problem, although very polar opposite to my girlfriend's where I'm underweight, and I have been for many many years. I have finally gotten motivation to change that and get to a normal weight, trying to go to the gym frequently and eat a little healthier than I have been (Although the gym part is really the only part I'm accomplishing so far :/ )

I have been going to get myself healthy and I want my girlfriend to start trying to get down to a healthy weight too, but whenever I bring up going to the gym or eating healthier options (Because on occasion, she eats very large portions for a meal) it upsets her, sometimes to the point of tears.

I've tried multiple methods to push her to work out more and be healthy, her therapist even told her ""...to get off her ass and stop making excuses..."" (Paraphrase but what the therapist said was along the same lines of emphasis), but whenever I try a method to push her, it only works for a month, maybe less. 

I just want to know if there is some way I can have her take her health more seriously, before it becomes an even bigger issue.

28,"Hi, I am a second-year student in Health Studies (Bachelor of Arts Honours) at a university in Ontario, Canada. 

Growing up I always had my sights set on becoming a veterinarian and I always had good grades. Around grade 10, I developed severe depression and a panic disorder that resulted in a lot of anxiety and I began to have serious doubts about my abilities in school. My grades fell (a little bit), and my hopes of going to school for sciences and eventually getting into a DVM program were seeming unattainable. 

Fast forward through the last two years of high school, I took biology and chemistry as well as advanced functions in grade 11, and just biology in grade 12 (Therefore missing many crucial prerequisite courses). At this point I wanted to go to school for psychology, but after first year I decided to major in health. 

Now I am about to go into second year and I am extremely unhappy with my choices and seriously reconsidering everything. I don't know what to do because veterinary medicine had always been my dream and I had done a lot of volunteering in clinics and even attended a vet camp at the AVC in PEI which was an amazing opportunity that just made me love vet medicine even more. Does anyone have any advice for me? Should I finish my undergrad and just get my degree and start over? Is it even possible to get into science programs without the high school prerequisites? Money is not an issue. Any help would be extremely appreciated. ",06Jul2017,1

33,"I'm married,  my wife and I both have a 5 year old daughter together. My wife has BPD, has cheated on me four or five times, and is an alcoholic, drinking a liter of vodka daily. Obviously, I don't want to be here. 

But we have a daughter. I cannot leave her alone with my wife anymore. I do literally everything for her, for both of them really. I get up with her every morning, prepare all her meals, take her out to do things, do all the cooking and cleaning, and luckily I work from home to make it easier. Whereas my wife does almost nothing. She has not left the house in over 4 weeks, spends all day every day on her laptop talking to people in chat rooms, hasn't say, done the dishes, since January. 

I'm just overwhelmed. I run to the store to get her alcohol, clean up after all of her messes, pick up all the slack as parent and provider. If I get on her to do anything, an argument ensues, which depending on the level of sobriety might just be her screaming at the top of her lungs, or getting violent with me. I'd rather just have a harmonious home for our daughter's sake.

But she's in a bad place, having tried to kill herself about two months ago, had to call an ambulance, all that. As cruel as it is to say, given all the infidelity, dishonesty, abuse and shitty behavior, I can't really care about what happens to her, beyond it affecting our daughter. So naturally I can't leave her with custody.

Nor could I get it. Technically, I'm a step-father. She and I got together when she was 3 months pregnant, and the biological father was almost entirely absent until our daughter was about six months old, then truly absent until she was two and bio dad sued for custody out of the blue. And got it, despite me having been here every step of the way, him never having had any official confirmation of paternity, etc. Whatever on that. 

So I have to stay here. I have to take care of her, and I know absolutely that she could not support even herself on her own in her current state. I just don't know what to do and I'm just so absolutely exhausted dealing with it all. ",06Jul2017,26

39,"I've been living in Japan for a little over three years now teaching English. I've enjoyed it for the most part but I'm wondering if it's time to go home to the US. My main hurdle is that I've been struggling to learn the language. I have ADHD and no access to medication (many Japanese doctors don't recognize ADHD as occurring in adults). This makes studying the language on my own extremely difficult. I've considered attending a language school full time for a year and getting to a decent level. I'm worried though that my job prospects after language school would still be pretty limited. I like teaching and want to make it my career but most jobs in education here that are available to foreigners are either low paying, entry level jobs or require extremely good credentials with having a masters degree being a minimum requirement.

On the other hand, living in the US presents problems as well. The main draw is being close to my family, my aging grandparents in particular. I also want to be more involved with my niece and nephews. I would probably attend graduate school and go into teaching after that. The problem is that there are reasons I left and avoided coming back to the US. While Japan isn't a perfect country, I generally prefer Japanese culture to American culture. People are generally friendlier and less self-involved. Things like health care and security are also significantly worse in the US. I also am wary of how the political climate has gotten so bad since I left. Yes, Washington is far from where I live but it is worth taking into consideration since I'm thinking about where I'd want to settle down long term.

Those are my thoughts so far. Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me. Sorry if a rambled a bit to much.",06Jul2017,3

The other artists work wasn't that good. Mine also isn't that good but my style isn't nearly as toony and lends itself better to poster design/advertisements (like skull shapes rather than circles and such)

Cue the other artist getting angry and claiming that the only reason my art was chosen was because that everyone in the group liked me more because I was smarter. There were 2 new people and one regular was gone so the ratio of people who knew me was actually skewed.

This went into an hour or so of them talking about how I've mistreated them throuout our, eh, friendship, with eachother including them lying about how I've yelled at them on public transit and shamed them for being mentally ill.

At the time it was decided that my art would be the poster but the other artist was going to design the next poster, which is this upcoming poster however at group today an open call for designs was put out to our group. This time a 3rd artist is going to be putting in their designs, I wouldve said something but I wasn't at group today because wisdom teeth.

42,"My ex and I (yearish together) broke up over a year ago, due to realizing we were growing apart after he moved for school and we tried long distance (which we weren't good at). Our relationship was amazing, but when we broke up I was pretty sad and I cut contact for many months, even though he wanted to be friends,  because whenever I talked to him I would feel sad. The breakup was mutual, but those feelings were still there. Evidently, he felt that way too, because I heard from a mutual friend that goes to his school that he was often crying and had my picture as his phone background for weeks.

After I got over those initial feelings, we reconnected and realized we both missed each other. We talked for a while and threw around the idea of getting back together but ultimately didn't. That pattern has happened a couple times - we don't talk much for a little while and then one of us reaches out again and we have a few weeks of good conversation, ultimately ending in nothing in particular. 

We both still like/love each other, we've told each other so. When we talk we feel like it did a year ago. The main reason we don't try again is because he's struggling with his sexuality (identifies as gay but his feelings for me make him feel conflicted).

Even now, a year later, he still comes to me for advice and he is one of my most trusted friends. I still care for him romantically and I don't know what to do about it.

I think a part of me feels like sex is the end-all be-all to life. Like it's the ultimate goal. Yet I feel completely empty no matter what. I don't really see a purpose in life and I can feel myself completely deteriorating. Has anyone been in this position?,06Jul2017,3

62,"Greetings all,
I would like to ask for advice from business owners or people with previous experience.

My mom took over a Fish&amp;Chips shop 1 year ago in a small shop center with only 4 shops in total. Our shop is next to a pasta-pizza-dessert restaurant with not-so-nice Italian owner.

I just want to ask what approaches you'd take when the restaurant starts advertising multiple things that have been on our Fish&amp;Chips' menu since the start. And unfortunately, they sell the food with cheaper price.

I don't have a good business mindset but I wonder if this happens normally in other shopping center or food court.

Thank you in advance.

Edit 1: Thanks guys :) I believe we make better food and have strong loyalty base. 
It is just the feeling there will always be someone ready to backstab us that my mom can't handle, she is always stressful. 
It is hard to focus on delivering good service and dealing with things like this at the same time.",06Jul2017,7

64,"I have difficulty with social interaction coming from thinking extremely analytically about everything. I would like to be able to ""turn my brain off"" during casual interactions with people because I think that complex cognition suppresses social intuitions which are necessary for social activities such as flirting, among other things. For this reason, I am contemplating drinking alcohol to be more social. I have only drunk alcohol 4 times before and never to the point of drunkenness (I am 21 right now, drank once at 18 and three times this year roughly once every two months), my ethnic background does not put me at extreme risk for alcoholism but I did have a single family member who had a problem with alcohol after a brain injury and one family member who had a heroin problem. I am quite averse to the idea of drinking alcohol and would strongly desire to not do so even without a risk of alcoholism but I feel that I am willing to make the sacrifice if it means that I am able to get a larger social circle and enter into a romantic relationship, in fact, I would probably take alcoholism if it meant losing my virginity. I previously identified myself as an Incel before realizing the label was toxic and this is in part an attempt to get away from that culture. Ideally, I would just drink a few times to get in touch with my social intuitions and then stop doing so but I am aware that state-dependent retrieval makes that unrealistic.

Is this a good idea. If I should not drink then what should I do to be better able to socialize, particularly flirting?",06Jul2017,4
65," I never think of a comeback or how to defend myself much later.

So I'm a very careful person about what I say and I always , ALWAYS make sure not to offend.

Yet, somehow they always try to throw me off balance. 

For instance, today I was telling one of my colleagues about how the Muslim shower had brown water coming out of it and I had just cleaned myself with it. If you're not familiar, a Muslim shower is a hose next to a toilet used in, well, Muslim prominent countries and many Asian countries as well.

Regardless of the potentially contaminated water, she cut me off mid-sentence and said ""Excuse me? Muslim shower? Those are used for when you eat spicy foods and have to clean yourself after using the bathroom. Watch what you're saying."" This girl, who is not even Muslim was acting SO offended at what I said. I was so thrown off center that I thought about it all afternoon. And then had to make this post. Lol.

I explained to her that my Muslim friend taught me what those were called. She continued to steamroll me, of course with her jaw dropped.
I didn't enter this conversation to get into the semantics of PC culture. I just wanted someone to vent to about the brown water, a friggin health hazard, mind you, coming out of the plumbing system and potentially getting the kids at our school sick!!

I LEARNED the word Muslim shower from my Muslim friend. I told my Muslim friend about this girl being offended and she was like ""whaaat? That's so weird. That's what we always called it. If you Google Muslim shower it shows up.""

The same girl also was talking about tattooing her eyebrows and then said to my black friend, ""you're lucky you're a black woman. It shows up better on your skin.""

73,"I am a third year male undergraduate whose always had a lot of social connectivity and developmental issues; and unlike a lot of my peers growing up, I turned to qualitative analysis (and a good decade of therapy) to work through them. My family, friends, and especially I am excited with my progress. College has made me confident and self-aware, ambiverted and career-driven. I perform highly at a pretty competitive university, and I don't have a lot of academic stress. Being single, however, causes me an insane amount of it.

This isn't a post on being single, per se. It's about feeling unfilled, I think. 

My intensity is one of my better qualities. I aspire to be non-stop like Hamilton. I'm ambitious and always focused on my work and the task at hand. I think this quality fuels my attention to detail and disciplines me to read voraciously. I take everything I do seriously and I'm very good at keeping myself busy. My mantra: anything worth doing is worth doing well. 

Chats with friends have revealed that this quality is not as helpful in social, non-academic settings. I'm a fast-paced walker who hates slow people on the sidewalk (even though I'd never vocalize my rage towards them). I can come across as too intense when I meet someone for the first time (and that's rather off-putting to girls I meet in bars, I have come to notice).

So this social intensity is the crux of what I want to analyze and rectify. I'm constantly thinking about the future, when I should be enjoying the moment, slowing down to smell the flowers, and participating in similar cliches. Here are a few other examples of how it's manifested: Whenever I produce a faux pas, I constantly overthink it and make my best efforts to apologize. I feel horrible until I do, even when it turns out that the person didn't feel harmed at all. I find it hard to engage in small talk when I meet people, and I want to get into the weeds on how people think, when those sorts of discussions seem awkward and pretentious outside of lounges with cigars and champagne. I convince myself to go out clubbing or to bars with friends because I might ""develop my interpersonal skills"" or ""meet the love of my life.""

Perhaps most importantly to me, I want to get married. I'm 21, and I recognize that I should probably finish college and probably grad school before I start seriously contemplating that, but I desperately want to meet someone who will feel similarly. It's incredibly problematic that whenever I meet a woman, one of the first things that runs through my head is ""could I marry this person?"" I am devastated when the first date doesn't turn into a second, or when there's a read receipt to my text without a response. I'm constantly thinking about the future, and I can't get myself to just stay in the present, and I imagine that reorienting myself to the latter would ensure more success in the present. The common advice I receive is ""someone will come around at some point in your life and they will love you"" or even ""someone will appear once you stop looking for them,"" but these seem like ineffective platitudes to me -- I'll obviously have more chances to find happiness if I search constantly.

This is all difficult because it causes me stress. It considerably depresses me to fail at this sort of stuff. I'm up at 2 am writing this instead of sleeping because it constantly bothers me and I'm finally able to articulate it a bit.

So to /r/Advice, how can I chill out and relax? How can I adopt a mindset that lets me take things an instance at a time rather than immediately think about the next twenty moves forward? I still want to be able to do that, because I think it's academically and professionally great, but more than that, I want to be happy.

And, again according to them,  I'm not mentally stable enough to provide for my child because I am under treated but over medicated.. now, with them getting emergency custody, I'm thinking that they have convinced the court that I am violent and unstable and it is possible that I could hurt her and them... It's the only thing that makes sense.

also, as soon as I announced my plans to move to the next town down from my home town, dcs was called. dcs dismissed the case immediately as no services needed. 

they took her based on""neglect"" but according to dcs, who they called on me last year, the child is not neglected in any way. according to her case worker, who I called in for an incident in January, she is brilliant and well rounded as far as any only child can be. I spend hours with her doing homework, I do everything I can to make sure that she is raised in a loving and nurturing environment.  

I live in TN, which is a mother's rights state. I Know I am a good person and a good mom. yeah, my childhood sucked. so I know generally what not to do.  I have court in the morning at 9. I'm nervous, they are trying to get my 8 year old to testify in court, which, btw, is illegal in this state.

78,"Ok so I've been a lurker for like 6 years, posted maybe just a few times on accounts I can't even remember. Just trying to see if anyone has experienced this. 

I can not smoke weed anymore. I used to smoke daily...quit for a long time when I joined the Navy. By daily I mean like 4-6 blunts. At 14 I started using heroin, crack, coke, acid...anything I could get my hands on. I got clean at 18 and then started doing coke again last year. I got pretty strung out on coke again for about 8 months (clean off that shit now for good) and every time I try to smoke weed now it makes me paranoid as fuck. It really sucks because I feel like if I could tolerate it my mood and overall mental health and anxiety would level out. I refuse to resort to pills because even though cocaine is my drug of choice I really have no preference. I like them all and have no self control once I start doing something. I do drink but that's never been my vice. I don't really feel the need to find a coping mechanism most of them time but I do think I would greatly benefit from some type of ""medication"" but I just don't trust prescription pills. 

I do struggle with depression. Long sorted fucked up story of my life I'm not getting into but I know enough about psychology to know that my brain is not quite up to par, not to mention my social skills, emotions, and coping mechanism. 

I'm a really avid believer that it's better to cope and pull strength from within rather than rely on a crutch, but I also know that sometimes a crutch is necessary to maintain a healthy mental state.

background: so my mother has been a hard drug user for as long as I can remember. We moved from apartment to apartment, and never had any food, sometimes we didn't even have hydro.

Further, I'm Californian, thin, a former cheerleader, and boy crazy. I'm not a ditz, I'm just very girly, and a lot of women have the same adverse reaction to my personality that I have to theirs. I'm smarter than about 98% of people (standardized test scores, IQ), but I'm also not a dykey nerd, so a lot of women hate me for that.

I bust my ass to emulate the qualities of other women that I'm jealous of, and I literally get wet watching girls who are jealous of me squirm. If I make friends with a fat girl, for instance, and if I'm not getting enough satisfaction, I'll literally do stuff like wear swimsuits around her and talk about my own weight loss goals (I started at an already healthy 130, am halfway to a more aesthetically pleasing in my opinion 110) to get a rise.

83,"Alright so this is my situation. For about a month I've been planning on moving to LA to a friend of mine and a few of his room mates. 
The place i was going to move into was a 3 bedroom 3 bath for 600 a month and id be sharing a room. I went out there for a few weeks prior to check things out and see how i liked it. Well a few things went down and i didn't really enjoy myself that much due to a couple of really scummy things they did to me while i was there.

     I get back and there was a a lot of pressure to come out and live there. I told them i was on the fence about it, but whenever i told them that they would just say things like""its time to take a shit or get off the pot"" so not really encouraging, but i understood the point. So i said alright i guess i'll do it. 

Well come the next month i already signed all the paper work signed the contract and was ready to move. But i was to afraid to move to another state and share a room for 600 a month. i wasn't worried about finding a job there. I just wasn't feeling the whole situation fully. I feel terrible because i really let them down. Thankfully the lease was month to month so i called him and told him i was sorry, but i wouldn't be moving and gave him two months rent to find someone to replace me. 

I just feel like utter shit and a utter scum bag . He called me and told me i was fucking him and the other two. Even though he has two months rent, and a few other people willing to move in with him and replace my spot. I understand what i did wasn't an adult thing to do, and i feel terrible for not going about it differently.

  He basically told me i was a piece of shit, a coward, and that i'd never do anything with my life. Basically that he wishes pretty much the worse to happen to me. I really wish i didn't  hurt my friendship with him. He even told me he wanted to beat me up. I feel terrible because i really do care for this person, and really don't want to see him in a position where he's in trouble living arrangement wise. 
I just feel like a big baby and a really bad person because i decided not to move there. I realize last minute wasn't a very adult thing of me to do, and i really could have gone about that differently and in a more adult fashion. however the things he said really hurt me, especially since we were friends in middle school. I know what i did was wrong, but maybe some advice on what i should do to help mend it would be nice. Or maybe  people can tell me how horrible of a person i am, and id understand that too. 

I learnt a big lesson on adult hood from this and feel really bad that i didn't handle the situation better.  I just wasn't ready to move to another state and i should have made that clear. I could just use some advice on life. or just some words of encouragement. ",06Jul2017,2

These girls are from the school I just left, I am starting University in September and will hopefully never see them again. For context, I left my old school to come to current school for many reasons. The two main reasons were that the old school is terrible and I suffered from a lot of bullying. When I got to current school, I was lucky to be invited into a large group of friends.

One of these girls was my friend, until they became a part of this situation.
The thing is, ex-friend seems to try and be cool in front of everyone else, while other girl is an extreme SJW. One of a few in the group who join in.

On top of endless, petty complaints is the fact that these girls do ANYTHING to make my friends feel uncomfortable. I have also been the target a couple of times, thankfully I don't care about it happening to me. I am only bothered by it because they target the first group of friends who make me feel like I truly belong. I won't go into detail unless someone asks me to in the comments, there is too many incidents to include in one post.

To summarise, I want to go in the group chat we have and call them out. This group chat is for the entire circle of friends.
Benefits would be justice, revealing the truth, explaining in front of everyone why I've been ignoring the girls so that they cannot lie about me like they do with my friends and the fact I don't have to deal with their shit in person. Hopefully.

Drawbacks would be group chat arguments, possibly losing some friends, awkward encounters, arguing with multiple SJW's and I'm not the most confident of people.
Being the target of the gossip won't be a new thing for me, either. I will also be consulting my friends about this.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I greatly appreciate any possible advice for my situation. Right now, I've been ordered to pay $463.00 for an unpaid traffic ticket. I need a miracle to come up with that sort of money. I know, it's not a lot but I have bills I need to pay and I'm unemployed, so I'm just scavenging for little, if any, possible source of money. Here's my situation, and then I'll go over what I think I should or can do. And for the most part, I'm hoping for some kind of input or comment on the 'what should I do' part. Anyways, I'm 23 years old, unemployed, with only a bike to myself and a few dollars in my pocket. So I usually spend my time searching for jobs, sending out my resume online, and going to places to apply for jobs. So, that's a start, but i've also been donating blood to give me at least $30 bucks a week. And then I'll usually spend the rest of the day at Barnes N Noble or the local public library, reading and trying to help myself to some self-improvement. So, that seems to be the best part about my life, here's the worst. I've been recently diagnosed with a disease, which I won't go into detail, since I think I have it under control, thank God. But my mother has lost her job, along with her benefits and health insurance that I was covered under. I think I'll be okay without the health insurance. But it's the reality of possibly losing the house that really scares me. Now, I think I know what you're thinking. ""What are you doing! Go get a JOB!"" Yes I know, I've been applying everywhere that can support me and both my retired parents. I think I am fed up with this job search, and I'm literally going to just stand by an intersection in the nicest part of the city with a sign that says:""Please hire me, 1%"" And then hopefully by then I've increased my chances for a desperately needed miracle. So, now with this debt collecting agency going after me. I'm worried, this letter sent to me says they'll seize and sell my real or personal property, garnish my wages or other sources of income, attach my bank account, file a lien to attach to all real property I own or may own in California, attach my california state income tax refund or lottery winnings. So here's my idea, I think I should stop ignoring these letters and contact them immediately. I was thinking maybe a heart-felt hand-written letter explaining my current situation. Any maybe ask for a sort of leniency, or extension, or maybe even an exemption. I need options.

I just turned 30, I have a 1 year old kid and my pregnancy took a major toll on my body. I'm also breastfeeding so my once perfect breasts look like total mom boobs. Seriously, I used to have beautiful breasts.  
I really need help coping with the process of aging. It terrifies me. For as long as I can remember, I have always been the prettiest girl in the room. Every day of my teenage and young adult life I was told I was beautiful, and over time, I began to equate my beauty and self value. I signed with a modeling agency when I was 21 and kept in great shape for many years.   
Now, when I look in the mirror, I see a stranger. I'm seeing these little fine lines, darkening under my eyes, silver strands in my hair, and the scar from my c-section combined with stretch marks looks like a gross sagging mess. I always wear a tank top during sex to hide my stomach and just the other day my husband and I were going at it and my shirt lifted a bit to reveal my scar and stretch marks. He actually pulled the shirt down to cover it. That crushed me. I knew I hated looking at my new mom stomach, but to realize my husband couldn't even fuck me without covering it up was fucking sad.  
 
My once tight and toned stomach is long gone and I am no longer that great beauty I always was. I'm having a hard time coming to terms with that. Men still notice me and stare, but they do not approach me anymore, and to be honest, I kind of miss the attention.  

My husband used to praise my looks constantly, almost obsessively. He would explain every detail of my face and body and describe why he admired each part. Now, he rarely compliments me, I have to fish for his affections. The best I can get is a once in a great while, ""oh wow you look pretty"". I can't help but feel disappointed at this, I was hoping to hear words like ""beautiful"" or ""gorgeous"" once again. It's not fair, he is only getting better with age and I am withering.  
I realize I sound incredibly vapid and there is much more to me than my looks, but under the veil of internet anonymity, I feel safe revealing these embarrassing feelings. but I really do need help dealing with this. Please don't judge me. :(

Okay, so that means I could simply be in a one-night stand, right?


Well, no, not necessarily. This is where the odd part comes in. It's true that I want one-night stands, but I don't want sex. Instead of sex, I'd like to cuddle and talk with a woman, even if it's for one night. Oh, and it has to be in their place, but a hotel would be fine with me. This gets even more odd because I don't want just any woman. I want to cuddle with women whose ages range from 28 to 30.


Before you ask, yes, this is legal. The age of consent is 16 in Australia, so the older women that I'd like to cuddle wouldn't get in trouble. I mean, it's not like we're going to have sex anyway because I don't want sex.


How would I go about finding these women? A 17 year old dude is gonna have a hard time flirting with women aged 28 to 30. Also, most of these women are married and I plan to cuddle with ringless women thanks. I refuse to cuddle a married woman.

Back in 2014/2015, my friend and I were almost always together. There were times that we totally got bored and wanted to have some fun. But as always I said, ""Let's pick up my cousin (which is also friends with this dude)"". His answers was always ""No, he takes too much time too come"" and even ""No, he doesn't want to do much"". He even said once ""No, I don't want to talk to his mother"". and then I always said that if he doesn't come I won't come either. After the discussion about whether to pick him up or not, we went to his house and start the day.

A year later it backfired to me. Whenever my friends (around 4 guys) went outside to do things, they never asked me. So I got a little mad and said to my friend (who didn't want to pick up my friend) ""Why didn't you ask me to come with you?"". His answer was ""I wanted to pick you up but someone said no"". After all this year I still don't know if he was telling the truth or not.

They was a period my cousin didn't talk to me for no reason. So in that period, I was only hanging out with my friend. even they didn't talked to each other anymore. 
After a month, everyone started to talk again.
And now it's starting all again.
Whenever they are eating junkfood or are having fun, they send it to me trough SnapChat. and again they didn't ask me to come with them, which now irritates me. I mean I live in the same neighborhood.

I always want everyone to be happy and have no problems but it's too hard. I don't know what to do now..

Now though? I've been keeping quiet at work, doing my job and not really speaking. Whenever she messages me on the PC I just close the convo with one line. It hurts so much but idk what to do.

Should I tell her how I feel about her even though I work with her?

117,"This is an xpost from r/momforaminute because I want to get a wide variety of opinions.

So here is some background:
36, living alone in a city about 2.5-3 hours from family, no friends. I work at home so I can move anywhere, I left my ex a year ago now, we were together for 13+ years and he really had control over my life but now I am truly on my own for the first time really and trying to figure out how to go forward.

So here's the deal. I'm currently living in Newport News (757 hype) and if you are from anywhere in the Hampton Roads area, you know it's better to buy than rent. Even with roommates people want like $700 for a room. Compared to like San Fran or NY that's not high but for me it is. I am trying to figure out if I should **A)** live with my mom in the podunk, 1 horse, 2 street, backwoods, nowhere town that I'm from where I can save all my money and pay off my car/little debt or **B)** stay here and live in the small apartment I found where I can save about $100 a month in a tiny hole of a place with barely any sunlight or anything.


Unlike other 36 year olds, I don't have a mate nor am I on the market (""the game"" and I don't get along) I don't have a degree to earn any money with, and I have no real reason to be here in this city. I don't even really know why I came to Newport News, I could have just stayed with my mother when she lived in Richmond but I was determined to come back down to Hampton Roads. I was going to go to ODU but due to the capped on student loans situation, school is out of the question unless I pay for it out of pocket. I can't do that with rent and my $380 car payment. I don't really have much of a reason to stay here, other than the fact that it never snows. I have no active social life, friends or anything, my job is here but since I work at home I can either come back here, move with my mom, go to California, anything. I have no ties.


I'm really bad at making decisions, especially good ones (I regret every single decision I have ever made in all of my life) so I'm trying to figure out what would be good going forward. I just feel like since I was with my ex for those 13+ years and now that I'm out, I'm behind everybody else and I don't have a clue what to do. I'm trying to make the best decision to deal with my stupid life as it is with what little I have going for it.
So, what should I do?

I stayed there doing nothing and browsing reddit until I felt better and decided I would go back home. I walked for a couple of minutes, turned around and saw a man 10 meters from where I was, he told me to wait and so I did. 
He approached me and asked me what had I saw. I didn't know what he meant and I told him that. He was pissed off. He repeated the question and asked for my ID (which luckily I left at home) and my phone. He took my phone and gave me his keys (?). After that he said something along the lines ""If I see any of my plants go missing I will fucking kill you and your family, now tell me your name and where do you live!"". I repeated that I hadn't  seen anything but he started shouting and I gave him my name and surname and the city where I live, not my street (it's not a big city in terms of area but it's very populated). He then told me to hold still and took a picture of me. Handed me my phone and ordered to unlock it so he could write my numbers down. As soon as I got my phone back I threw his keys to the ground and started running until I returned to the city. I headed home but avoided using the main streets in case he was following me. I live in a flat but I entered using the garage door (which is mutual to a couple of buildings around here) just in case.
I haven’t told anyone yet, not even my parents or the police, I thought about going to the police station but I don’t want to take the risk of them going for the weed (I’m guessing) and pissing the man and his friends off.

143,"I want to throw a 1920's theme murder mystery party. Instead of taking the easy way, and buying a kit, I decided to make up my own version.

I could use some help with a few details though, and I can’t ask my friends for help because I plan on inviting them. 

To keep the backstory short – there was a party at the hotel last night and all the hotel guest were too drunk to remember what happened. The owner of the hotel was found dead this morning. Now the guests must retrace their steps to figure out what happened last night.

Each person’s character will have two secrets. They want to keep everyone from finding out what their secrets are because the information makes them appear guilty. 

Each player will have the chance to solve a clue to learn another player’s secret. If they learn someone’s secret the player should keep in mind that they are pair with that player, and they can learn (or have already learned) a secret of theirs. 

Players can make deals, blackmail, or trade secrets. They should not announce them because 1.) they are too valuable &amp; 2.) The player who’s secret is revealed will be able to return the favor.

I will let the players know that the only way to find the killer is to start collecting secrets buy they will not be told how to figure it out from there.

What they won’t know is that the killer will actually have four secrets. I will do this by having to pairs of players share a secret. (So for example, one of the players (Player A) who discovers an extra secret of the killer – the other secret Player A discovers is say, they remembered seeing two of the other players in the room with the body late at night. So each of the players seen with the body will learn each of Player A’s secrets. This will not happen until the last few clues.

What I have not figured out yet:
1.) should I have the players remember all of their own secrets?
2.) should I let the killer know they are the killer?
3.) If not, should I clue them in on the extra secrets they have and just make a general announcement that if anything seems off with their character – not to question of draw attention to it – it’s not a mistake, it’s suspicious.
4.) How difficult should I make the clues that have to be solved to discover secrets? I was thinking simple things like “you remember you were in the kitchen and find the enclosed in your pocket” then have cookie crumbs in the envelope – the clue is in the cookie jar. Probably less corny than this but about that level as people will be drinking and I think the political aspect will be engaging enough.
5.) Lastly I want some kind of penalty for people who accuse someone during the game and are wrong, and the person accused for letting their secrets out, but having them just loose seems to harsh.

144,"So I've been talking to this girl for only like a couple weeks, we went on our second date yesterday and I got my first kiss I've ever gotten.

While this was nice things started escalating and we ended up doing pretty much everything but sex.

For me, not even kissing a girl before yesterday, I just feel weird, it felt right in the moment, it still feels right that we did it, we have a connection that I've never felt before. I just can't shake the feeling that it was too early, even though I don't think it was.

The thing that's messing with me is that my mom is my best friend and obviously there's some things you just tell your mom and his is one of those things, it the first thing I've ever kept from my mom before.

Any advice would be great, I'm 18 with pretty bad anxiety so that might be a huge chunk of it.

145,"I met this guy on POF and we both agreed from the beginning that neither of us wanted a relationship with the other. I'm 23, a recent college grad, and currently working a 60+ hr a week job that pays me VERY well. I plan on changing cities soon too, which is why a relationship is the last thing on my mind. 

The problem with this guy is that he was ALWAYS busy. He didn't want a relationship but in the three months I knew him we only had sex once, hung out three times and the one night I did sleep with him I found out he suffers night terrors that kept me up all night. 

I finally told him this just wasn't working for me. I don't want a relationship but I was stuck waiting on him all the time and it was apparently my own fault because I didn't understand that I couldn't get sex when I wanted. I naturally just don't have sex with multiple men at once because its disgusting to me. 

After two days of no contact, when I finally did hear from him we texted for a few minutes and then he went cold again, it was the final straw in whatever we were doing. 

I told him this just wasn't working for me anymore and explained that with him being busy, and me too now, mixed with the fact I'm about to move there was just no point in keeping this up. 

He told me I was mad because I caught feelings for him over having sex once and thought that everything was gonna change, I don't even know him. He really wasn't all that. He didn't listen to anything I said just said it was all me. Is that true?",06Jul2017,3

150,"Hello,

I'm friends with a family. One of their daughters is in danger of going down from her current school class into something for dumber kids (our school system is seperated in good, middle, weak so to speak). 

Therefore she has to pass two exams in English and I offered her father that I would tutor her over the summer holidays (six weeks) for a total of 80 Euros for about 24 hours of tutoring!!! (90 Dollars) and I would take payment only if she passes the exam. 

Now I thought about it (I talked with her father about that yesterday, today I already gave her three hours of tutoring) and it's clear to me that this is hilariously cheap.

I would reconsider my offer and offer 10 Euros per hour. I would get thrice of the orginal money. How should I proceed? What do you think?",06Jul2017,1
151,"I've been in a strong relationship with a girl for about a year now. In terms of how we are for each other there is nothing to complain about. However, this isn't the problem. My issue is that I'm having reoccurring thoughts about leaving her for a few self-centered but, reasonable reasons. One of which is that before i had met her I had a strong sense of my own ambitions (extremely strong) and I felt that my old mindset was really powerful for where i wanted to be led in life. After we'd started our relationship my mindset slowly turned away from this and flipped. Unfortunately, this has made me feel weak-minded and has caused my self drive to deteriorate (I hope that makes sense) and it honestly is hurting my confidence to power through life. 

The other problem is that I'm still fairly young and yes, my curiosities about sex, being single, travelling, and building relationships in a different way are still there. I need advice on what approach to take because I don't want these ideas to be left behind and i stay committed to this girl without experiencing these things while still young. Its hard because as my mind has changed to center around my own relationship I feel like I'm kinda tied down (which i understand isn't the case). However, I'm extremely concerned for her for if/when we break apart her mental state will be hurt. I guess an important note is that she is depressed and has a hard enough time dealing with it alongside me let alone by herself, especially when her support group isn't very large. I've heard advice to potentially warn her parents and friends about it in hopes that it would help make the support stronger but I am extremely worried for her still because I feel like she really does need me to function properly. I'm finding this extremely tough because yes I've gained a new part of me but i feel like mentally, I've lost a stronger part that I thrive for again. Please give me your thoughts. ",06Jul2017,2

I have been looking for a new job for about 4 months now, and had a few interviews (including one yesterday). I have been having increasingly distressing health problems lately, but have been avoiding seeing a doctor because of the job situation. My primary concern is that I will get a diagnosis of some kind, which will be on my medical records, and when I switch to the new job (and new health insurance), the rates will be higher - or they could even decline to cover me on the basis of the 'pre-existing condition'.

154,"Short backstory - my friend broke up with his now ex-girlfriend about 2 months ago, and has been sort of depressed after that, it hit him hard. The funny thing is, they still often see each other because of the common group of friends that hang out together, and I happen to be often invited to those hangouts. 

Now, to get to the important part. I have seen his ex only once in my life before that, because I was out of the country while they were together and I came back for the summer. I don't really know her as a person, and on the first time that I met her, I literally only had the chance to introduce myself to her and we didn't speak a word to each other until the end of the day. 
So, the second time I saw her was two days ago, on a BBQ party a friend of my organized. My friend, that girl and me were all invited, and we all came. Drinking started early, around noon, and continued all the way to the end of the party, which was at about 1 AM. In total I drank around 2L of wine and 2 cans of beer, so obviously I got very drunk. At one point of the BBQ, someone suggested we should play a game called ""synonyms"" (a game in which you write words on a paper and have to explain them to your partner) , which requires a partner, and the ex of my friend asked me if I want to play with her, so I was like, yeah why not? After the game ended, I started talking to her a bit more just to get to know her, you know, pretty normal stuff. We talked about pets, a bit about music, some movies, nothing special. What I didn't notice is that my friend was watching us all the time, and in his head imagining that I'm flirting with his ex and that I want to engage in to action with her or something, even though he is already aware that I am in a relationship already (I have a GF). So after a while, I noticed what she was trying to do. She was trying to flirt with me just to make my friend jealous, which she succeeded in. For example, around midnight, we moved inside the house, because it was getting colder outside. I sat down on a small bench which didn't have a lot of space ( I wanted to sit alone ), and when that girl came in the room, she pushed me on the right and sat next to me. I didn't know how to reject her, and I was sort of confused because I was also pretty drunk. So I didn't do anything. I just went with the flow, but didn't really try talking to her or anything, I was just sitting and listening to the others. When it was time to go home, I was trying to get a taxi for myself, and then she ( and one more guy, some friend of her) asked me if they can come with me because they were heading in the same direction as me, and me being the kind and drunk person I am, agreed for them to come with me. We sat in the taxi, arrived at our destination, and I immediately went home to sleep. The next morning I wake up, I take a look at my phone, and see a message from him saying ""Are you crazy?"". I tried calling him, but he declined my call, and after that tried to contact him in other ways but he had me blocked on almost all social medias ( Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram etc.) It's been two days and I don't know what to do about it.

155,"I am currently (almost) 21 years old currently taking a gap year from university. 

I absolutely hated my university back home so I decided study aboard for a year to see if it would make me happier. I realized how miserable I was back home and how much I cannot go back to my home university. I hated it so much and being away for a year made me truly realize how upset I was. I cried almost every single day, I couldn't sleep without taking sleeping pills and basically the first thing I thought of when I woke up was how much I wanted everything to be over.

I made a deal with my parents that instead of going back to my original university I would transfer to a university in my home town and finish my final year there. 

I thought that it everything is good, but my mother keeps pressuring me to go back to my original university. My original university is a well known private school that has connections and is highly ranked. While the school in my home town is horrible, it's just a normal public university. 

My mom thinks it's way better for me to go back to my original university, but I feel like I just simply can't. I don't think I could make it one more year with everything I had to deal with. After leaving for a year, I have nothing to go back to. I have maybe 2 friends and that is about it. I don't think I could go back to crying every single day and just being miserable in every way shape and form. 

Taking more time off is completely out of the question as my parents are super strict immigrant parents that both have postgraduate degrees. 

I understand what my mom is saying because my original school does have a level of prestige tied to it (the whole ""YOU WENT THERE!"" kinda thing) and it does look way more impressive to people. However, I am starting to care way more about my mental health and my wellbeing than what other people care about. 

Should I just tough it out for another year at my original university or transfer and have to do and extra semester but start completely new? 

I really have no idea what to do

And I remembered a person who was really nice to me, like the big brother I always wanted, but I wasn't nice to him.  

I'm not sure he would see it that way since I didn't do bad stuff on purpose; but I had a shitty attitude (young and dumb) and I'm not who I was then and I realize how nice he was by still helping me out.   
It's not like I ever forgot that he was; but I'm looking back at it differently now.

160," currently work FT remotely for a large company. My hours are very flexible, I typically work 6am-230pm M-F.

I have been unhappy, unfulfilled for the past 3 years working for this company. I am a people person and like to stay active. After work I wander for an hour or two before yoga then I come home and repeat this during the week. I want to experience a sense of fulfillment and purpose in life. I have been battling depression and adhd ever since working for this company about five years ago (3 years working from home, prior to that we were expected to go into the office)

I need structure, and I also think I need someone to tell me what to do. I do not function well when I have any free time or open availability- during this time I think too much or binge eat while I wander around.

I do enjoy helping people. I find greatest fulfillment when I help someone. If I could do it over again I would definitely work in the healthcare field.

I want to know if you guys can think of anything that I might be missing to help me with my day to day life. My ideas are as follows,

-Begin a yoga teacher training in Fall2017 so after work each day I will be heading over to training or focusing on my practice. I go to yoga each day but I still need to force myself If it were up to me I would stay in bed all day but I know I need to keep on moving so I work and go to yoga and spend time with my family. Im just worried this still wont give m fulfillment.

-Begin an esthetician training after work each day since I am very interested in skincare. The issue with this is the starting salary for estheticianis a lot less than what I am making now and I dont think I can take that pay cut.

-Continue to apply for positions within the department that have a higher ranking/salary grade and hope one day I will find my calling.

-Work in sales (which ive done in the past and have had success) so I can get a chance to talk to people since I do like to talk and Working from home does not seem to work for me

-Join another club other than yoga such as barre or personal training to go to everyday after work

-Continue to pray and workout and focus on myself until something magical appears at my doorstep.

-Begin Physical therapy assisting training which takes about 2 years- I would need to quit my current job.

167,"My roommate and I moved into this apartment that is two bedrooms, and you rent by the bed. My rent was $669 and hers was $659 because I had the bigger bed space. 

My roommate got evicted in March, because she had not paid the rent in two months. She just packed up her stuff and left and I never saw her again.

So now, fast forward to me. I have one more rent payment to make before my lease is up. Bear in mind that I said my rent was $669. We decided when we moved in that we would get electricity through the apartment complex instead of Demco or Entergy. My electricity bill has been unusually expensive given that only one person lives in my apartment now. This month it was $172! I work 40 hours a week, so I know I can't be using up this much electricity.

I worked out a payment plan with my landlord. We agreed that whenever I get my next paycheck on the 14th of this month, I would pay rent with the additional late fees. 669 + 172 + 80 (late fees) = $921 for rent this month. My check this week should be able to cover that easily.

However, checking my bill online I am already at a balance of $962 dollars. Not counting the late fees that are to come until the 14th. 

I checked into it to see where all of this money is coming from, and I noticed that my electricity bills were not that high but rather there was some sort of $75 fee every time attached with the amount for electricity. It should be noted that the only utilities that I have to pay for are electricity/gas. For instance, one month my electricity bill was $31, but then added that random $75, I had to pay over 100 dollars.

I checked my lease to see if I could make sense of this weird $75, and the only thing I could find was an ANNUAL fee of $55 for using electricity through the apartment complex. If I pay this bill late, it's an additional $15 added, but I always pay electricity along with my rent. Basically, none of this is adding up to me.

I do not have the money to pay for this. It's absolutely ridiculous and I'm fearing that I might be evicted come the 14th. I'm going to talk to them today to see what exactly my options are, but I'm afraid that it's either I give them ALL of my money and not be able to live off of anything for two weeks, or get evicted.

I could easily move into another, cheaper place before any notice of eviction gets attached to my name, but I wanted to come to this sub to see if I could get any sort of advice from people who know what they're talking about. I feel as if I am a little bit in over my head.

I realize with eviction that it could severely effect your credit score, and there's a possibility for a lawsuit against me so the  complex can get all of their money from me. I just don't know entirely what to do.

So just some quick background, I'm a 21 year old dude from Springfield IL. I currently do IT support for a major public school system making about 35k/year. I dropped out of college to work full time so I can pay my rent. I have 4 years experience in the IT field, as well as 2 years working in the pharmacy of a hospital, and then a few assorted odd jobs throughout high school. I play in a band, and have for a couple years now. I don't mean to come across as cocky, but we've hit our stride and things are going really well in that area of my life.

Straight to the point, my delima is that I am miserable with my current line of work and I don't feel like any career path particularly calls to me. I dig through heaps of ads every week, but don't see anything where I can make what I make with the experience I have, let alone feel engaged and fufilled. I'm just not sure what to do.

I don't know if I'm just lazy or didn't learn proper self-discipline, but I feel absolutely 0 motivation to do much of anything. I'm miserable at work and it just drains me. I'm perpetually grumpier and feel just hopeless about it.  My real passion lies with music and playing with my band, that completely changes. I feel motivated, engaged, and enjoy it deeply. But obviously, that isnt a career choice that is going to pay my rent and support a family.

Most days I just want to pack a bag and just go. Travel around and explore the world. There's hardly anything else Id want to do more. My girlfriend once ""If you could do anything without consquences, what would you do?"" Pack a bag and spend time traveling and seeing as much as I can was my answer. Of course, that was shot down rather quickly as ""never going to happen."" (She's a bit older than me and has kids and mareiage on her mind) . Which I get. It's unrealistic.

Since I've only taken one semester off from UCF I can still sign up for classes without having to reapply this fall. My reasons for wanting to go back are because I like that UCF is a bigger school, I'm super close with 5 friends I met during fall, It'll be free because of my dads military service, and lastly I really don't like Clemson nor the brothers in my fraternity. Should I go back to UCF?",06Jul2017,1

They asked me to come to a class, so I did and we talked design stuff. At first, the woman sent me a bunch of things to design and I sent back my creations, but no designs were ever settled on. It's now been over a month later. I have not received any payment (because no designs have been finalized). She doesn't even send me designs anymore, she just wants me to come to the fitness classes.

Today she left a metal box in our parking spot. Not against the wall, but roughly two feet from the wall right below where the right front wheel passes. We have limited visibility since there are cars and pillars on both sides of our spot.  I drove over the box, since I didnt see it. My mistake, should probably have driven slower. 

She thinks it's all my fault, that I should have gotten out and moved it even though I didn't see it. She says it was the correct place to leave the box. 

It's gotten to the point where I didn't even expect an apology or an admission of guilt. I really don't want it to be this way but I have no clue how to help her. No matter what happens it's not her fault. 

How can I help her admit to her mistake?

This was the girl I fell in love with for so many years so I decided to just go for it and see what she had to say. She told me she started dating someone else and that it was "" a miracle from God she found him"" and started giving me advice that some day I'll find the miracle too.

I graduated college in May 2016 [23/f] and got a job working for a consulting company. The company can place me anywhere in the US (our client locations) to do a job. I have the ability to reject a few though.


My first location was Cleveland, Ohio. I hated it. After 8 months there, they agreed to give me a work from home job (and then I moved back to my native NY). 


The work from home position ended abruptly. 
And I was put back on ""the bench"", as we say in the consulting world. I have a limited number of weeks on the bench, where my company pays me, but I don't work/i search for other projects. I get 7 weeks and I am already 4 weeks in and have not been picked up. It is possible that they may give me an extension if I go over the 7 weeks but it is not guaranteed.


I only had 1 official offer so far and it was in Pasadena, California. I rejected it because it was to far away from New York. That was 2 weeks ago, and I haven't gotten any other offers since then. Now, I was told about another opening in Pasadena, and im considering applying to it. I have qualms about it- It's so far away from family/I don't know anyone. It wouldn't be easy to visit home. But my job is on the line here. And Pasadena is supposedly a much more fun area than Cleveland. I'm very conflicted and weighing the pros and cons. Obviously I'm not giving full details on my life situation and everything, but what would you do?

I suffer from intense anxiety and because of that I've spent my entire college career bouncing back and forth on the idea of grad school but I've finally decided I'm set on it. I just have no idea how to apply to grad school or what the requirements are. I'm also nervous (terrified) about the GRE exam.

209,"This is a pretty condensed run down, but I'll try to cover what bases that I can.

I'm 18 presently and pending-graduation. I've been accepted to a wonderful school-- my dream school-- with a great scholarship offer, but I'm stuck at the...pretty huge enrollment fee, which has a deadline of August 1st. My step dad just lost his job and the VA payments/etc don't leave room for the chunk of money I need.

I am more than willing to pay for it if I had means-- I'd get a job, two if I could, and take art commissions back to back/organize crowdfunding. Trouble is, I'm not allowed to leave my parents' apartment in a really inconvenient side of town &amp; anything done online requires a bank. Banks require some form of state-issued identification for application-- an ID, license, etc-- and I'm completely dry.

While I have my birth certificate and SSN (parents have ""lost"" my actual card and are currently trying to find it..), I have no proof of residency. I have not been allowed to hold a job and I've attended an online school that is out of state for the past three years. When I went to the DMV, they told me that they could only accept transcripts-- which work for residency-- from within state/from the current year. Among other options, they listed stuff like deeds, insurance policies, medical cards, voter registration, pay stubs, financial mail, and even concealed handgun licenses, but nothing that I have access to because either my parents don't have it or it requires me to have pre-existing information.

I believe the only way I can get the residency papers is by having my step-father switch to an ID from this state and bring something like our lease and utility statement, though he adamantly refuses this.

Quite frankly, I'm at a loss. I went around town all day asking just about any possible place for their opinion, and I didn't get much. The SS office required essentially the same things I needed for my ID, and even if I *can* find my physical card, I have nothing for residency if my step dad continues to refuse (and for the sake of saying, I have no doubt in my mind he will). 

I'm contacting my adviser to see if my scholarships would remain in-tact if I deferred enrollment to the winter or spring quarters, so I think it's worth stating that if push comes to shove, I can miss the fall, save up money/reapply for the next, and then work through next few summers so I can graduate with my class. 

If anyone has any advice, please let me know!

212,"My wife and I are both full time college students. We are transfering to a new school in August and the new school is q fee hours away. In May our apartment lease ended and we couldn't get a month to month, so my mom told us to stay at her house for the summer until we move. 

Because of not being able to get a month to month, we had to quit our jobs and move a ways away to stay at my mom and step dads. We've had money saved up and we've sold a few things we didn't need just to give us extra cash for the move. The goal was $3000. We saved up a little over $3100. 

I didn't want to keep it in a savings account so I gave it to my stepdad in cash periodically to put in his safe. Today I needed to out it in my account for a bank statement to show the complex that I have enough money to live there. Well, when he gave it all back to me, there was only $2980.

My mom said she had to take out $200 but she put it back. My stepdad got defensive and into a pissy mood when I told him I was short and he went to the bank and pulled out $200 and basically threw it in my face. 

Someone took my money and I'm not sure what to do here. They don't have much money as it is because my stepdad is a lazy cunt that doesn't work, but that's no excuse for thievery.

Literally the weekend she was moving out he started dating my friend. I had always cared fondly for my friend but she is one of those people who always had to criticize people and be really nasty . Not someone I want in my family . She is good at acting sweet and nice for her convenience but I can tell when it's real and when it's an act . Anyway , my brother and her dove full steam ahead into this relationship and attempted to tell me to not speak to the ex . It's hard for me because I grew up with her . The ex has told me that within the last 4 months her and my brother met up and messed around , I have since not spoken at all to my friend because I feel if I speak to her I am going to tell her the truth because if it was any other friend I would want them to know as well if they got cheated on ... plus I know how cruel she can be and how fake and obsessive to ... it's just a mess .. please don't judge me for how I've handled this ... it's a mess . I just dove into my dream career that I've worked hard for and I feel because they are all in a small town mentality of nothing better to do then drama, addressing this can get messy ( as have prior incidents ) ..... I have tried to tell my brother and he knows he is the reason we don't speak ... I feel he can't be alone and I don't know what to do ",06Jul2017,1

253,"Hi /r/Advice. 

I could really use whatever advice anyone is willing to offer to me. 

So I'm now a 4th year Computer Science student and I've come to hate it. I only went into the field because of my parents (I was only allowed to pursue something in STEM, or something with good ""future prospects). 
I started as a Biology major (Pre-med) absolutely sucked at that, and transferred to Computer Science since I liked computers I guess and my parents thought that would be best for me. Fast forward a few years, lots of struggling to get through classes and honestly more mental breakdowns than I'm proud of, I'm only a few classes away from graduating. 

Here's the problem: I was set to graduate last semester, I've been failing quite a few courses because I actually feel like I just can't grasp the concepts anymore along with having absolutely no interest/passion in the subject anymore makes it almost impossible for me. I get yelled at for basically being lazy and prioritizing social life over school life etc etc. 

So I'm a few classes behind from last semester, but my parents still threw me a graduation party because the invitations were already sent out at the point I figured out I wasn't graduating on time, and my parents basically said the party wasn't even for me it's for the family to all get together... lol. I was mortified by this, I got a lot of money I'm really not comfortable having because I'm not even graduated. I basically wanted to cry the whole party when everyone asked me how it felt to be done and I had to lie so nobody knew I wasn't actually done. 

So I'm taking 3 classes this summer, I'm really fighting through these and I dunno if I'll pass Calculus 2 because I honestly don't understand it and I just don't care anymore. I just don't want to do this anymore and I fight the urge to just drop out every day. I know I'm so close to being done (I have 4 more after this summer), but I'm just so mentally and physically exhausted. I'm still recovering from a big mental breakdown over all of this at the beginning of the summer and I'm getting ready to gear up for another one. (I'm dealing with mental health stuff as well which I'm not even sure if was a thing before college and just was brought out because of this, or if college is literally distressing me so much I can't mentally handle it). 

My situation right now is trying to figure out whether to go back to school for another semester (its 3 hours away from home and I have a lot of trouble being away from home/relying on myself with some current mental problems). I want to go somewhere local, but I looked into it all to no avail.

I guess I'm just asking what someone would do in this situation. I'm just so tired and done and I don't want to do it anymore. I wish I never went into this soul-sucking major and just was able to have some passion in life. I love learning new languages, I love being outside, and I used to have so much passion for so many things but now I'm just too tired and I think college has brought on too much depression for me to enjoy many things. Idk. This almost was a big dumb rant and I'm sorry, I hope someone can help me or relate or something. ",06Jul2017,1

257,"Well I didn't get the job yet. I went in to apply for a tree climber position that said required no experience for very good pay. So on the application I put down the advertised pay / hour but said it was negotiable. (15.50 per hour)

When I turned in my application the desk lady set me up to talk to a manager with in a few minutes. The first thing he told me was that he messed up on the job post online and that the position I applied for actually required experience. That people he hires always start out as a different position (ground team) at a different pay. He didn't say what that pay was. 

I foolishly looking for work and kinda bummed out because I was actually interested in the job I applied for said I would be willing to work the other position. He said that was great and after he runs a background check to hit him back up in a few days.

Only when I got home did I realize that I didn't actually get to hear what the pay rate was for the different position. Only that I could possibly get the position I was applying for in a month or 2 after evaluation.

Do you think I'm gonna get screwed accepting a job offer without even hearing the pay amount? It is super hot where I live and only going to get hotter this summer. I've been payed 9.50 to sit at a register in AC building before. The thought of possibly getting paid less to work outside hard labor has had me really down the whole day. . .",06Jul2017,1

I'm 22 and in a (what I believe to be serious) relationship, with my 23 year old boyfriend. Prior to us being together, we had known each other for years, technically since kindergarten. Anyways, around 4.5 years ago he was in a relationship, which ended with his now 4 year old daughter. I came into the picture almost immediately following their relationship. We didn't begin dating until 3 years later, which was this march. Now everything is great with us, except his ex. She's controlling and basically hates me. Randomly out of the blue she will spark up and argument with him about me, and it really stresses him out and I'm scared she has the power to take away my happiness just because she is scorn. He's afraid of her trying to take his daughter so he basically lets her get away with it. I just don't know what to do or who to talk to, I don't know the legal boundaries of fathers and their children. If anyone has been in a situation similar, please give me any advice you might have.

265,"It's a bit of an odd situation. My new coworker appears to be making advances towards me, but nothing blunt or outright asking me on a date. And he knows I have a boyfriend.

For example, he awkwardly asked me if I liked Wonder Woman. When I said was indifferent and he asked if I wanted to watch it with him. I'm a very abrasive person (honesty here) and I have no issue with shooting guys down. So I said 'nah I'm good' and walked away.

He's asked me to the movies twice, to a party once, and once texted me outside of work hours about a netflix movie was watching (totally inappropriate to text me like that, I didnt respond). He's always trying to chat with me which is painful because he speaks extremely slowly and awkwardly.

A few things to consider though: He knows I have boyfriend so I don't just want to assume he's interested in me romantically. He seems extremely slow (maybe cognitive delays? idk). His desk is about a foot away from mine and I see him all day every day.

I've been extremely nice to him up until this point, I chat with him every time he comes by, I've never been rude when he's asked me to do things (nah, I'm good or nah I'm not into that). He seems like a very nice guy. But I'm not about to cheat on my boyfriend and I'm also not interested at all.

So there was this new guy in my class (I'll call him Leo) so me and 2 (I'll call them Max and Pete) other friends became pretty good friends with him.

We hanged out a few times with Leo too, and I hung out with Leo alone for one time (just like Pete).

Now one of Max hanged out with Leo all night, which gave me a bad feeling. And now tonight Max and Leo are going out into the city (they know I wanted to come with them, and Pete wanted it too). But they are going with just the too of them.

I have no idea why but it just makes me really sad. I think what I'm feeling is jealousy but I'm not sure. Is it the fact that they are becoming better friends with each other and I'm not?

270,"Okay, I'm gonna try to keep this as short as possible. So I met this gorgeous girl online around March, we hit it off right away and pretty much spend every second we could with each other on videochat or text chat. 

The problem is that she lives in another continent over 5000 miles away. Even though we lived so far away, we fell for each other really fast and she's the most incredible person I've ever met and probably will ever meet.

After a while we both told our parents that we wanted to see each other (Mine weren't as open to it at first) (I'm 20, she's 18). I already had a trip planned with my family to a big city near her at the end of this month (July) and she would be able to come and after that we would be able to see each other semi-regularly.

So everything was planned, until she decided to break up with me 3 weeks ago, it was because she couldn't handle the distance supposedly (now I know there were some other things and she took it out on me). I understood why and we broke up as friends. I tried to move on, went on 2 dates with a girl I see potential with, but I don't nearly have the connection with her like I have with my LDR girlfriend.

Now after 3 weeks, she regrets it and she said she fucked up. There's still the possibility of her coming to that city, but I don't know how my parents will react now that she wants to see me again after I told them it's not going to happen anymore (They were already not okay with it at first, but they gave in) + the girl I'm seeing will probably feel betrayed. 

I have no idea what to do in my current situation, on one hand I want to see her so bad and I want everything to be like it used to be with her, but on the other hand I don't know if it's a good idea to still do it after the 2 dates + parents permission might change",06Jul2017,2
271,"My first Reddit post!

After completing my first year at a private university in California working towards a bachelors of science in nursing, I am thinking about dropping out. 

I failed microbiology and was unable to take it at a community college near me due to ridiculous waitlists of 50+ students and/or pre-reqs required by the community college that I have not completed. 

In order to continue in my nursing education, I would have to take microbiology somehow. The only way to complete it at my school without having to pay for an extra semester would be if I enrolled in a local immersion program, something I really don't want to do. (I'm leaving out some details about how the program works because it's complicated). 

On top of that, tuition has gone up and my financial aid package has gone down meaning that by the end of next school year, I'd owe $19,000 and be only halfway through the program. 

Another thing that scares me is that if I fail one more class, I'm out of the nursing program. No refunds. I could be a senior with $40,000 in debt and fail one class and I'm out. 

I've thought about taking a semester to a year off to really think about my options and maybe take some classes at community. I've also thought about transferring to a state school and switching majors (nursing is too competitive in California).

I tried going to /r/legaladvice but they were no help. :-(

So I've been working for a small company in northern Va for almost a year now. Earlier this week my boss got an email from someone claiming to be a business owner and requested a reference from my boss, claiming that I was seeking employment from them. Their business address and phone number didn't exist, so my boss was immediately suspicious. He asked me about it, and I told him I knew absolutely nothing.
My boss said that he's going to try to trace the IP address and has a hunch that it's a former employee of his trying to get revenge (I never met that employee.) He emailed the person back with a cease and desist and said he's going to report him to the authorities. I'm a little concerned for my safety.
