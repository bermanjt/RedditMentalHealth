0,"Okay, so I just got put in this extremely awkward situation with a person that I have been really good friends with for a very, very long time, who I actually have developed feelings for but she is currently dating someone else.

Now, everything is fine. Really. I'm kind of okay with being just friends (even if I'd like more) and I don't have any problems with the guy she's dating. He seems cool. But, something happened recently that was just soo unbelievably awkward. 

I get a text from her out of nowhere.. 

Her: (my name) date me? 

I'm sort of confused here. So I respond with a..

Me: Um, wut?

Her: I need a new boyfriend.

My brain explodes with feelings of excitement and concern. I'm thinking something must have happened with their relationship, so I'm concerned. But of course, I'm somewhat excited because I honestly never thought I would hear those words from her. But mostly concerned, mostly because of how impulsive that sounds. 

Me: (her name), what happened?

Her: (Boyfriend's name) is mean. 

I'm thinking, oh shit. Did something happen? But I'm still kind of processing everything..

Me: I.. I really don't know if you're kidding or not.

Her: It's fine, I was. I was just kidding! (:

Turns out, she was just goofing around. 

What's embarrassing is that I fell for it, so that's weird. But I also started to think, she actually knows I like her. Or at least, she should. I told her myself a year or so ago. So, it's very very awkward that she would joke about that, and also knowing that I probably still like her, not thinking about how that would effect me. 

I told her she went a little overboard, and she feels bad but she also says she doesn't quite understand why that would bother me so much. 

I can't be in the wrong here, there's just some things you don't say. I don't want things to be awkward between me and her, or worse me and her boyfriend. But I feel like I'm being set up to be dragged into a potential argument. 

And sure, maybe she does like me and she's being a little flirty, but she has a boyfriend man. That just makes me uncomfortable, even to be all jokey about it. For some reason she doesn't see that.

Idk man, what does the world of Reddit think?

5,"Hear me out first.


I was at a work event where our organization hosted delegates from 10 different nations. One person in each delegation was to receive an award, which was the entire purpose of the event. I was assigned to escort around one of these delegations, with mine consisting of 7 people (two couples and three individuals).


I don't know, maybe I was doing a good job. I entertained them, sat with them, spoke with them, ate with them, laughed with them, etc. etc. (unlike the other liaison officers) that it seemed like they were having a good enough time with me. I felt like, out of all the delegations, we were having the most fun and I was the employee who had been able to build rapport with my delegation best.


In any case, they started giving me gifts. First, it was a silk scarf from one of the couples (a mayor in her country). I assumed she had brought it as a host gift and decided to give it to me instead. Of course, at first I politely, laughingly declined, saying I did not deserve it, but when they insisted, it would have been impolite to turn it down, so I accepted it and proudly wore it for the rest of the event.


Later on, another of my delegates gave me a t-shirt and a handsome clock that bore symbols of his country. I was floored because I *knew* it could not have been intended for me. I mean, who was I? I was just their liaison for the event; they had never even met me before this. I had to clarify several times because I honestly did not feel like I deserved it, but eventually, I accepted because it would have been impolite to reject their kindness and generosity.


Finally, on the last day, the other couple--the awardee and his wife--also gave me a gift. It was in an envelope, and as soon as it was held out, I knew what it was. They insisted it was a gift and kept repeating it. I had already accepted gifts from the two others, to reject this one might have offended them. In my mind, I thought maybe they hadn't brought anything from their homeland, but still wanted to give me something like the other two had done and so they thought the next best thing was cash (they were rich business owners in their country). So I accepted it, and put it into my bag without checking how much it was (it would have seemed rude to do so). I thanked them profusely and saw them off.


Later on, when I checked, they had given me a hundred fucking dollars DDDD:


Should I have accepted it at all (as with the first two gifts)? Do you think there would be repercussions for my having done so? (I'm pretty sure a few of my colleagues saw me accepting the envelope, even if they did not hear what we were discussing or know what was inside.) And if I shouldn't have accepted it at all, what should I do now that I *have* accepted it? (TBH, I need the money *badly.*)


If it affects the discussion at all, they are from a small, rural country in SE Asia and I am a newbie at my work.",09Aug2017,1
8,"To start off, I am a lesbian girl. I have a MASSIVE crush on a girl two years older than me, who barely knows me, but I have her number and we talk occasionally. She is bisexual. By some miracle, I asked her to hang out and we can go on a walk and play Pokemon Go (she recently downloaded it again for the meme and wanted someone to play it with) and she said yes. However, I broke my phone yesterday to the point where I can't use the touchscreen. We're hanging out tomorrow. I get very anxious when talking with her and I don't know what to tell her. Should I tell her the truth about breaking my phone? If so, what should I tell her? I was thinking that I could walk along with her while she plays, but that would be too awkward.

10,"I need some help. 
So here is my background, I am going to leave some names and places out to stay somewhat anonymous, however your going to learn a lot about me in the following post. I am a senior in high school who loves football, choir, and where I live. I live in a great small town, and I love it. I have settled in and don't want to leave, mostly because I have been moving around my whole life for my dad's job. This high school has a great football and choir program, and i have made many friends there. This is important to me because I am very introverted and don't make friends easily. This off season, I have been working my ass off to start for my football team, and to beat one team in particular that has prevented us from going to a state championship since I have gone to the school. I also am in a fantastic choir program and I made the top choir this year, I made last year but I declined the offer to take another course. I also have a good job here, and two Universities within close reach, (KU and K State) that have great programs with what I want to get into. I am really excited about everything next year as a senior, and I have been doing everything to work towards that. However, that's when my dads job took him to Texas. 

I didn't want to go. He had hinted that it might be a possibility for a while, but I was hoping that it would not happen. I wrote up a list of reasons why I didn't want to go, and he agreed that it made sense. I also arranged to stay with someone for my senior year, and old couple in my church. However, now I am in Texas, and now I don't know what to do. Here is what each place has to offer. 

Kansas
-My job (Could get a new one, not a problem)
-friends
-A good support system (no family, great friends)
-A football program I have been excited about playing for every day for the past 7 months. I love the sport, but I don't plan to play in college, which is why I want to play here. I would most likely start. 
-a choir program I missed out on last year that I regret missing
-2 great colleges to go to
-a great schedule, featuring many interests while leaving time for me to work on my ACT score (i got a 29 last time i tried it, going for 30s)
-independence, something I really am striving for
-a good school

Texas
-A great football program, however not one that I personally like as much as the one in Kansas. I would have a small chance of starting. I do have a knee injury, and It would make treatment easier if I were here. 
-A good choir program
-a university with a program that I like, UNT
-My family
-a great place to live
-a great school

The reason I am hesitant with leaving Kansas is because I love my family and they all want me to stay, however they have said they will support any decision I come to. I will miss them terribly. I could not do long camp outs or summer camps because I would break down in tears because of homesickness, and I have almost done that recently. (a giant football player, I know) My mood has been swinging the past few days, with great euphoria to hours of sadness and wanting to cry, cycling every few hours. I don't know what to do. I need help.

13,"Hey /r/advice.

So my girlfriend has been through a lot recently, the past year or two has been rocky as all hell. She started medication a while ago to deal with a mental disorder, which is fantastic. But the medication has some pretty nasty side effects, particularly extreme dizziness and weight gain. While I have no issues with her gaining weight, she has problems with her self image having suffered from bulimia for many years and an abusive ex who particularly liked to insult her weight.

So today we're out and about, when a shopkeep asks her ""when she's due"". Fuck. She plays it off cool, but her red flags are flying and I admittedly overstep my bounds and push her to talk about it. She says she's fine, but after probably too much prying from me, the conversation devolves into me feeling insecure because her ex's words still affect her so much. Fuck again. I quickly apologize, but the damage is done.

So now she's fallen into a pretty dark place, and she's concerned she won't be able to work herself out of it before her birthday later this week. I really want to try to fix this before it ruins what was looking to be a good week after so many bad days. What can I do to help?",09Aug2017,4

24,"Hello people of Reddit, so I'm going to refer to myself as Kaleb (not my real name) and my best friend as Logan (not his real name either.) We're both fairly young, 16. There are various incidents that have occurred over the past year that have sparked interest in my thought processes. I have become gay for my friend, and it is really bothering me.

This all started in the 4th grade when we became friends. I just moved into a new district in the city and I was having trouble leaving my other friends behind. I got on the bus on the first day of school and I saw him sitting by himself. I sat by him and he told me I could come over and hang out. That's where 7 years of friendship started. 

The events that lead to my attraction to him started about a year or so ago. I had always been ""attracted"" to him, but I thought it was just a pubescent stage and I never had problems with girls. 

It was Christmas break and I left for México to see family, and that's when we stopped hanging out for a while. It was maybe April when suddenly I got a text from him asking if I wanted to hang out. So I naturally agreed and I went to his house. He was different when I came back though. I would often look over at him while we were watching a movie only to find him looking at me. When we watched a movie I would always sit on the far left side of the 3 person couch and he would lay down, always resting his feet right on my crotch. I would get an erection because his foot was literally rubbing my dick but when I looked at him he was just watching the movie. I liked it, so I let it continue. 

We often played cards to pass time and I counted that every single time we played, we would lock eyes for at least 5 seconds, which is longer than it seems, very often. He would then take a deep breath and look away quickly and sort of shy away from the game. That's not the only thing he did though. He also liked playing footsie with me. He would place his feet on top of mine and rub my feet. I found it arousing so I let it continue. 
 
A few weeks ago we had like a weird friendship spree. He asked me if I wanted to make a tent, so I said ""sure, why not?"" Come time for bed I asked him where my sleeping bag was and he said we were sharing one because he ""forgot to bring me one."" So we snuggled up real close and fell asleep. I woke up that night to drink some water out of my bottle and I felt his boner touching me. I immediately was like ""Shit, what do I do"" because he was sound asleep, so I just stayed there. When I woke up he had his leg over me and his face was really close to mine. He woke up and went about his day. We stayed in a tent for a week.

Once his parents said we had to put the tent up, we slept in his basement, and this is where a lot of the stuff happened.

It was like 10:00 p.m. and we were playing video games when all of the sudden he told me he wanted to watch t.v. so I said sure. We laid down on his bed and he called me a ""lil bitch"" jokingly. One thing led to another and soon I found we were playing""Nipple Pinch tag."" I had him in a hold forcing him to surrender and he got one hand loose and pinched my dick and he said ""Now you're it"" I got a boner and we just kept playing that for about an hour. Then we went skinny dipping in his pool. He got out and flashed a light at me while I was i the water and it was kinda weird but kinda sexy. 

I guess here is the whole point of my spiel. He says he is straight, but he hasn't had a girlfriend since 7th grade, we're Juniors in High School now. I know its not that he isn't attractive because he is REALLY handsome! I was there when a girl asked him out and he rejected her cold bloodedly in front of me. 

I have though about it some, and I have come to terms with the fact that I am bisexual but that isn't the issue. My issue is that I think maybe I'm just over reacting and he isn't gay/ bi at all. I really need some input from you guys so if you could help that would be great!",09Aug2017,1

28,"I do a fair bit of urban exploration with a friend of mine in the area around us. Mostly abandoned factories and some other interesting sites

Today we visited a factory we had never been to before. Upon looking for a way in we discovered a nice looking vehicle hidden in bushes and trees adjacent to the factory. The car was driven into the foliage and intentionally hidden behind a large board of wood and an old couch chair. The car looked like it had been there for at least a month. The door was open but would not open all the way due to a large piece of cement next the car. From what I could see of the inside, it was very clean and did not have any personal belongings, the car had been cleaned out.

My friend and I have pictures of the vin number and license plate. I've looked up the vin number and found out that it's a 2014 Audi A4. I couldn't find any other information but I also checked a database for stolen vehicles and it said that this vin number was not registered as stolen.

I am not quite sure what to do at this point. I believe that contacting the police would be the most appropriate action despite the car not being registered as stolen.

I think the most likely situation is that this car is stolen and the thief is hiding it here until some time has passed. What do you think? Should I call the police?",09Aug2017,0

You see, I don't have the best home life. My mother left with her boyfriend 2 years ago and barely speaks to me. She lives a tossed town and doesn't help out with me or either of my siblings. I'll be 15 next month at this time. I have four siblings but only 2 live in the same household as me. I'm currently living with my father, who is a charming guy but emotionally abusive. My 18 year old brother is also extremely emotionally abusive. They are both extreme slobs and leave giant messes that I am expected to clean up. I don't mind doing a few dishes or loads of laundry, but when the dishes have piles of food on them or have been soaking in swamp colored water. 
I spent the passed year living with a relative but had to move out because they were moving. I've been back for about two and half months and I can't imagine living the next three years here. Most places won't hire me because of my age. I don't have any other relatives to move in with. I really just wish I could get emancipated, but I'd obviously have to be able to financially provide for myself. Luckily, however, I live in a small town where rent isn't terribly high, and I'll be doing online school and have more time to work once I find a job. I really don't want to live off of anyone else, but I can't stand living here. My mother isn't an option to live with either because she isn't in a great place herself. She recently overdosed on heroin and has been an alcoholic for most of her adult life.
If I can wait it out for two years, I'll probably join the navy once I turn 17.

38,"So I just received basically a dream offer, and the exact type of job I went through all my schooling for. The only problem is I'm a dumbass, and lied on my resume 6 years ago and then just never fixed it because no one else checked and I forgot about the lie even being on there.

The lie is that I had an internship at a company for 4 months, but for some reason I put it as 8 months (I honestly don't know why I did this, think it was just back then I had no other experience on my resume and I wanted to look like I had more experience than I did? Also I used to have a horrible lying problem that took me a while to get over). I've since worked at other places and all the other info on my resume is accurate, but I do have that lie about the dates for that internship on my resume.

The company uses a third-party background checking service called [BackCheck](http://www.backcheck.net/completebackcheck.htm) that seems really rigorous. I'm tempted to email HR and say ""woops I have a typo!"", but the only problem is ""Sept - Dec 2011"" looks very different from ""Sept 2011 - April 2012"" so I think that would make me look very suspicious. Part of me thinks they won't even check for info about that job since it was just an internship and I have better experience now, but I don't know how thorough BackCheck is.

Does anyone have experience with BackCheck? Should I just hope they don't check or just come clean? Or did I just screw myself out of a great job because I'm a total dumbass who lied for no particular good reason.

I've always had a rule with her that she can tell me anything, and I won't be mad at her, so she decided to confide in me. Last year, she was texting back and forth with this coach, and she was flirting with him. (I think an adult male teacher should know when a student is flirting and shut the conversation down right there, but I'll try to give him the benefit of the doubt. The fact that he was married and flirting with a student is pretty despicable, but flirting isn't a crime.) 

Last year, after a holiday party where she had been drinking heavily (I have a rule about drinking, I'm okay if they learn how to drink and what their limits are around me), she sent him a completely inappropriate text, something along the lines of, ""I want your dick"". 

He replied, ""If I was there right now, I'd give it to you.""

Nothing more was done. The next morning, both woke up, the texts were deleted, and that was that. 

Coach X has moved schools, and will now be working at another school. 
  
The State I live in (Texas) is very strict on rules about sexual relationships between teachers and students. A teacher caught in an inappropriate relationship is fired, arrested,  their license is revoked, and their name is listed on the sex offender registry. 

Fortunately, their relationship never got to that point. 

However, while she sent the first inappropriate message, I do think as the older adult teacher in the situation, he should have been more responsible about setting barriers. He obviously crossed the line, especially given that he is married, to say nothing of the teacher-student relationship.

What punishment,if any, should this teacher receive? 

I'll be honest, if she had told me about it right when it happened, I probably would have gone up to the school and cut off the source of his problem. I'd probably trying to get Reddit in prison.

I like to think I'm a little more rational and calm now, but it does bother me that he crossed the line. What say you, Reddit?

41,"Would you allow your daughter to attend a co educational swim class in school? at my daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting
My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this
this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism?
can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls?
the school thankfully tries to protect girls in one way by requiring girls wear one piece bathing suits but boys are allowed to swim just in trunks and be bare chested. I think this is wrong especially in school. School should not be a place to show off your body and it adds to the boisterous and show off behavior of boys.
whose idea were these classes? These classes only seem to benefit males and it gives them an opportunity in school to leer at their female classmates in bathing suits. Why create a class just for boys to look at girls basically? I just don't get it This is not a public pool for everyone, this is school. School should not be making students be in revealing costumes in front of each other. And give boys an opportunity to leer at girls in this situation
I am thinking of going to the school and asking that boys and girls be separated or at least if boys be required to wear shirts while swimming.

So there are a bunch of year 9 kids who play downball near the art rooms and every lunchtime since the start of the week they've been calling out my name in a mocking matter. At first I didn't know they were calling at me I thought someone in their group mustve just had a similar name, but then yesterday I looked over and the guy waved at me acting like a smartass. So today I just ignored them but this time they started shouting it louder and saying ""we love you"" 

I'm guessing I'm being tormented because last week at sports carnival I was sitting alone just listening to my own music with my headphones in and I guess they must've seen me as an easy target to pick on because of that and they also probably thought the name on the back of my jumper was stupid I guess?

52,"Hi! 
I am a 26 year old who together with my boyfriend decided it was a good idea to move out of out shared apartment. Rent in my area is not inexpensive and as a floral designer, I don't make a ton of money. I posted a listing on the Next Door app asking if there were any housing opportunities in my neighborhood, and an older man told me his niece was moving out of his carriage-house apartment. Later she decided to stay, and he proceeded to offer me a large room in his house for a super affordable price. Now, this room in the upstairs space, which is just a large room and private bathroom, separate from where his room is in the house. There are no other rooms upstairs aside from mine. The kitchen is shared between us both, but aside from that the upstairs space is large enough for me to have my own living area. He is not requiring a lease, so it's basically month to month. 

This man is 73 years old, professional, and seemingly harmless. He has spoken honestly to me about how this may appear strange to strangers or family, and can acknowledge the unconventional situation. My boyfriends mom actually met him as well and really likes him and has gone out with him several times since. 

I must add that the neighborhood the house is located in is amazing- walking distance to movie theatre, coffee shops, Whole Foods, etc. Also great for my work commute.

Then we went in the pool and we played some pool games but then he kept hugging her. Then we lay down inside for a bit and I sat down and gestured for him to sit by me but he sat by her so I was left alone. At this point I felt like I was going to cry my eyes out so I went to the bathroom and calm down a bit. Then we sat on his trampoline and he lay down and hugged her. It was pretty late so the stars were out so we looked at them and the girl said ""they're so pretty"" and my boyfriend replied with ""almost as pretty as you"" and I nearly lost it.

60,"I went to the ER a couple of months ago for an injury to my hand. The x-rays should that I had broken 2 different metacarpals and needed surgery. Surgery is done and I'm sent home the next day.

When I went back for my follow up appointment, it looked like they had completely ignored my 2nd metacarpal... they had let it just heal in the fucked up position it was in after the initial injury. I brought this up to the doctors and hospital staff but everyone brushed it off and treated me like another complaining asshole patient. They would rush and put a cast/splint on and send me on my way. This pretty much repeated every 2 weeks... I would go in for a follow up and bring up the SAME issue and they would simply ignore me! My hand looked fucked up and I could just tell that something wasn't right... I'm no doctor, but I'm not an idiot and can tell when something is off with my own body.

Finally, today when I went in for what was to be my final follow up, I brought the issue up again while in the xray room and what do you know, I was right all along! The doctor somewhat panicked and tried to tell me that it had shifted on it's own... he was claiming that it was fine when the first treated it. He offered me to fix it by re-breaking it and pinning it in the correct position. Of course I want my hand fixed, but I have no insurance and this additional surgery is going to kill me financially. 

Is there anything I can do to hold the hospital accountable for their negligence and failure to properly treat me when i came in over 2 months ago? I have a huge medical bill from the initial ""treatment"" and will now have another one from this second procedure and I don't think it's right. On top of all this, I'll have to endure another 2 months of being in a cast because they ignored what I was telling them since the beginning.



TL;DR - I don't have insurance. Went to ER for broken hand, they only fixed one bone and ignored another break that healed improperly. My cries for help were initially ignored. Improperly healed bone now needs surgery to fix. I'm going to drown in medical debt because of this negligence. Is there anything I can do?

66,"Hey - I wondered if I could use your collective brain to help my with my PhD. I'm trying to do a systematic search of google for certain terms using boolean operators. Thinking I was really clever I made a search string that was about 500 words long before realising google only allows 32 words.

I'm wondering if there's some code/script that I can plug words into and it then creates searches on all combintaions of those words.

For example if I have 'public' and 'patient' and 'citizen' and I want to search those three words in combo with 'involvement' 'engagement' and 'partnership' that's already 3 X 3 searches. For example the partial search string is:

 'public involvement' OR 'public engagement' OR 'public partnership'...

Surely someone somewhere has something I can plug words into that at least auto-generates search strings? 

My search is currently (9 X 3) X all verb forms and noun forms - so about 300! 

I know this sounds like I'm after a 'bot' - and google bans those - but even if it's an offline application that auto generates search strings that would be something very helpful.

Two weeks later, I confirmed with him that I did want the painting to be done. We agreed on a price, that I would pay when the painting was done. He agreed to send me updates.

82,"I don't want to name any names or give away too much detail for fear that it could be used against me but here we go. I am a 25 year old woman who started a job right after I graduated. I quit the job to do a year long fellowship at a company I really admired across the country because I felt it would be a great experience. I knew going in that they would not help me with relocation fees and they would not pay me very much each month – I would be living off of my savings. It was my choice to go and do this and I knew that. After moving, for months I worked as hard as I could, I stayed late almost every day – until they locked up the office each night. But I was doing work that I really liked despite the amount of errands I had to run for the office each day so I didn't mind at all. I moved here to do this and I was enjoying it. 

Something I noticed very quickly was that the owner of the company never really looked at me or acknowledged me, but everyone told me he was weird and not to let it affect me. He is a semi-famous guy with a lot of wealth and I just figured that he just didn't have time for me since he was working every time I went to his house, even though I had to bring prints and mail up to his house each day. For months, I took things up there and was ignored. During my second month a new fellow started, she was also a woman. She made the same amount as me and had more experience in the field than me but everyone in this fellowship makes the same amount. Her experience with the owner was the same and I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward to six months in, and a man starts in the same role. He has absolutely no experience in the field, has never had a job in it. I come to find out he is making $500 more a month than me and the other woman doing the same job. That is an amount that actually makes the fellowship enough to barely live on, in my opinion. I was so upset by it but when I took him to the owner's house for the first time I became even sadder. The owner got up and shook his hand and talked with him. He now requests him to do everything for him and doesn't want me, invites him for lunches, makes dinner reservations for him. He even told someone else at the job to give me less work because I look ""too depressing"", ""never smile"", and I am ""too quiet"".

I have talked to several other people in the office who disagree with his assessment but it is not possible for me to not take it personally. It feels like the quality of my work doesn't even matter. I go home crying each night because I compare myself all day long. There is no HR in the company and I'm not sure they would even do anything if there was. The owner keeps everyone in a constant state of fear. I'm not really sure if I should do anything, or if there even is anything I can do. I've never been in a situation like this before.

She did move on with a different guy while he was in jail but they broke up and she went back to her ex immediately. He's full of bad news and I suspected this would happen but really prayed it wouldn't, but it did...

Things started going extremely downhill for my sister as expected while they are going out together. I forgot to mention that this boyfriend is a thug. So for the past 2 years, they would fight like crazy almost everyday. The thing about them fighting is that I always get caught in the middle of it. How? My sister calls me and I have to intervene. Then they make up and break up. Rinse and repeat. It happened literally once or twice every week. Sounds normal? Nope. This literally happened over 100 times and I was always in the middle of it. Am I stressing from it? VERY. It's affecting my life like crazy. Also, when they fight, it's not a regular verbal argument. It's literally a crazy fight. They live in an apartment so it gets so loud the neighbor hears it all the time. It's so bad to the point where they break shit and cops sometimes arrives. Yes, it literally been like this for a very long time and yes, I was in the middle of every fucking fight. Then one night, it got to the point where my sister was really drunk and they got into a huge fight again. But this night was different. She literally got so crazy to the point where she said she's going to kill herself and she was on the roof. At this night, I ran up to the roof and she was literally on the edge. I then had to grab her and force her down, which I did, until the cops arrived. Cops came and took her to the hospital. Then she came out and things started to calm down a bit. I broke down and teared the fuck up while seriously talking to her in hopes that she would listen to me, but she didn't. She's just says sorry and think it's all okay after that. Then it happens all over again. She's with the guy and it's dejavu all over again. They're fighting like crazy, it's extremely loud, and she gets crazy. 

I'm not going to lie. My sister is not mentally stable. Knowing her all my life, I know she's has a very serious problem. She's very selfish, inconsiderate, and extremely stubborn. She's the type of person that you absolutely cannot reason with nor be logical with. She's also extremely aggressive and provocative. So a lot of times I'm in the middle of the fight, I just want either him or her out of the house but it doesn't happen. She doesn't listen. She doesn't hear me. She becomes very aggressive and starts provoking the guy. But at the same time, this guy is also very fucking dumb. He doesn't know when to stop. He knows damn well my sister won't stop and gets extremely provocative but he's still around to talk back and argue which obviously adds oil to the fire. Then the argument becomes a fucking circle. It just goes back and forth, repeating everything they say with just the voice getting louder. It's gets so crazy a lot of times and I have absolutely nothing I can do about it. When I intervene, I tell him to get the fuck out cause obviously in heated moments, staying away from each other and giving each other a minute would do some work but he doesn't fucking leave and he just stays there and argues back. Yes, it's fucking stressful. It's been like this for a very long time and I was always there. My sister.... when she gets crazy, she gets very fucking crazy. There's no stopping her unless you knock her out. It's fucking insane and I have absolutely no idea what to do. I've been trying to have them split for a very long time. I've talked to her numerous time and begged her on my knees to please move on because this shit will NEVER work out between them. They literally fight about the STUPIDEST shit ever and causes the biggest fucking scene to the point where law enforcement has to arrive. That's how fucking bad it is and I have no idea what to do.

So this was the story that happened and was my daily life the last 2 years. One day, her boyfriend got caught for something and was in jail for 1-2 months. Being forced to be away, this helped my sister a bit to get back on her feet. They broke up ""officially"" and she tried to move on. Then he got released and you can guess what happened. Yes, they got back together. This boyfriend is pretty fucking stubborn too and won't leave her alone as in he keeps staying in contact with her. Then it happens all over again. They get back together then they fight, they get loud, and all the same fucking shit they did every night. Then it got really bad to the point where my sister really tries to move on so she files a restraining order on him. This keeps him away. This pretty much keeps them apart for sometime. I didn't believe it until I saw that she wasn't with him for over 2 months and that's when I finally thought it was finally over... until yesterday.....

Yesterday, my sister called me and told me that she had a ""friend"" over. She wouldn't tell me who the fuck it was even though I argued with her for a while about it because I had an idea who it was but I just didn't understand why the hell she was being so secretive about it. When she finally said it, that's when it all fell apart. I just knew things were gonna go downhill again and it fucking did, but even worse now.

So I found out that they were keeping in touch for a bit and he was sleeping at her place for about 1 week. However, yesterday was something different. She was tripping balls yesterday saying that her boyfriend was trying to rob her or something and he was acting ""funny"". I took her word for it until I went to her house and realized there was something wrong with HER. The moment I saw her, I can tell she was fucking high on something. Her eyes were WIDE OPEN and her movement was a little abnormal. I first thought she looked like that because she was just very pissed off cause she was talking to her bf on the phone and still arguing while I was there. Then I came to realize that was not the case today. Today I went to work and I got a call from her early in the morning. The thing about this is that she's never awake early in the morning so I found this weird. Then comes afternoon and she calls again. She's in another fucking argument with her boyfriend and it gets crazy AGAIN. I honestly just did my work and tried to forget about it because I so fucking sick and tired of this shit happening again. Then I'm off work and on my way home. Just out of curiosity, I call my sister on my drive back and someone else picked up the phone. This was her boyfriend's mother that picked up the phone. She told me that they were both in jail because the neighbor called the cops on them saying they were extremely loud and so the cops took them both in after seeing marks on their body. I honestly didn't really care too much when I heard this. TBH, I actually felt a little relieved knowing that they both won't be able to hurt themselves or anyone being behind bars. Then the boyfriend came out and she's still in there for domestic violence. She took all the blame as she stated that she put those marks on his body. Now, she's in the process of getting bailed out. But what's crazy is, I spoke to her boyfriend on the phone while going through her bail process. He told me what happened the 1 week he was with her at her house. He told me a lot of the weird and crazy shit she said to him and he also told me that she didn't sleep for about 3 days. When I confronted him about her using drugs, he told me she was doing a lot of drugs but wouldn't tell me exactly what. I'm guessing it's meth, K, and Coke. I also believe she's on drug because when she told me that her boyfriend was trying to rob her, she texted me that same night saying she's sorry cause she was tripping out like crazy. So now that's another problem at hand. I don't know how long she's been taking drugs but I do know she's been at it for some time now and this shit really scares the fuck out of me because I don't know what the fuck to do to help her get back on her feet. Where are my parent in all of this? My dad left us when we were young. My mom raised us both. She's remarried and living with my stepdad but they are struggling at the moment. This type of shit is something that'll probably make my mother faint and worried like crazy if she heard about what's going on but it's so bad to the point where I may have to tell her and see what type of solution I can work on. But I don't know. I seriously want to try fixing this without my mother being involved because my mom already went through so much shit but I'm at lost. That's why I am here. I want to ask for your opinion. What the fuck should I do? I feel like my sister is a timebomb at this very moment and it really fucking scares me. 

Thank you all.",09Aug2017,2

105,"It might be better if I just tell the story.

My mom hates my dad, and my dad has referred to my mom on many occasions as some variation of ""the devil incarnate.""

Both have tried to make the relationship work for over a decade now, which results in the same thing: one person gets mad over something tiny, which leads Mom to start trying to isolate herself as much as possible from Dad, which leads to Dad calling the kids together for a ""discussion"" that turns into a rant about how disagreeable Mom is and how it's the result of her ""backwards"" family, so on and so forth.

Mom stops going to work at the family-owned business, Dad threatens (and occasionally makes motions toward) closing the business (which is the only source of income in the family) and remain unemployed, and the entire thing becomes a passive-aggressive war until someone (imo usually Mom) gives in and starts returning to work.

In the most recent iteration of this story, a cell phone containing backlogs of memories was smashed with a hammer, Mom stopped going to work for three months, and Dad again took actions toward closing the pharmacy, this time taking the added step of all but removing Mom's access to the joint bank account, transferring it all to a personal account that he maintains to this day.

Now, it's started up again, not more than 2 weeks after the last one ended. Mom wants to return to school to pursue a renewal of a nursing degree (that career ended due to an iteration of this same conflict that occurred a few years back), and Dad doesn't want her to. To this end, he's intercepted and hidden away documents addressed and mailed to her that would have let her make a good deal of headway in her goal of reintroducing herself to nursing. (Also, she paid good money for those documents back when she had access to at least a little bit of it). His argument is that her returning to school will not only be detrimental to the earnings of the pharmacy (again, primary source of income), but are simply a side effect of her ""low self esteem.""

Mom wants to divorce, but has no means to do so because, well, no access to money. Dad wants Mom to return to work, forgo her paycheck, and accept that her name will not be put into the joint business account.

Personally, I want to see a divorce happen. I hate the way things are, as neither one of them is happy nor has been happy with each other. Plus, having lived through more than a decade of this with my siblings, I'm tired, as selfish as it might sound.

One more caveat - my family is pretty financially comfortable. My siblings and I go to a good private school, and we live in a country club. The worry with divorce is that should it happen, any possibility of re-establishing that comfortableness goes out the window. (Same worry arises from Dad with Mom getting her own job independent of the family business.)

So here's my question: is there any path forward for Mom to get that divorce? I have no illusions that Dad will try to heavily hinder Mom from doing so, by either financially bullying her or by trying to use us (the kids) or the family business in some way, shape or form. Lawyers cost money, which she doesn't have.

Additionally, is there any hope of us maintaining at least part of our lives as they are should, by some miracle, a divorce go through? Can Dad stop working out of spite for Mom?

Thanks.",09Aug2017,1

My sister in law lives with her parents because her and my brother recently lost their apartment. My brother lives with us in my parents home..so its a full house here. the problem is that my brother is an alcoholic, and has been ever since i was about 8 years old...i a now 23. He has always had problems with the law in regards to DUI, domestic violence, and unpaid tickets.my sister in law and him argue at least once a week. what i hate is that sometimes theyre not fit to being parents because hes either passed out drunk, or shes shes out at the bars with her friends. sometimes they dont even bathe these poor kids. my mom is the one with all the stress.. my mom is 61 years old and should not be going through all this stress with my brothers alcoholism. weve tried to get him help but he refuses to go to rehab or reach out to any other resources. today he once again started arguing outside with his wife and i went outside to look and she yelled for me to help her...i was how stressed out my whole was especially my mom so i thought ""enough is enough"" so i called 911 and said my brother was arguing really bad with his wife. officers came and had a talk with my brother. they told him to stop drinking because he can go back to jail since he is on probation.  the officer told him that he needs to look into getting help and my brother was just agreeing with him just so that they could leave. as soon as the cops left my brother was so angry at me and my family for calling the cops on hin saying were such snitches and other mean stuff. we told him it was for his own good...but he honestly doesnt understand...in this case im just feeling a little bad becuase i know i scared him but i felt like something had to be done so he could realize this issue should not be ignored and that it is affecting is alot. what do you guys suggest my family should do? does this make me a bad person for calling the cops on my own brother?

114,"PS: I have posted this in another subreddit, I'm reposting it here hoping you guys can give me another insight too.

Hello there, I wanna try to keep this as short as possible but in all honesty I feel like I can't. To sum the first part up: My family and I have gone through a very shitty streak of things for the last 4 or so years and, our situation doesn't seem to be improving if anything, things have gone so downhill this year I truly wanna give up by now.

I'll start by saying that, there was a point where we really have wealth sadly, we made the mistake of not investing it into anything and well, my dad lost that job about 6 years or so, he still had some money saved but of course with things and more things happening we ran out of it quickly. 

Shortly after, my sister contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized for a month or so (honestly, I don't remember and I don't care to, this was one of the worst moments for me and my family a like), she was only 4 or so years at that time, it happened 3 years ago. This is where I believe shit started to fall apart.

Then, I had to drop out of high school, we couldn't afford to paid it and despite me having one of the best grades in the entire campus, the school refused to give me a scholarship or help (even though, they should've, if I asked... But, it doesn't matter, I finished it this year and that's a burden I don't carry anymore).

We've been literally acting like nomads for the past years, going from home to home, each time smaller, the thing is our situation doesn't improve and no matter where we go, we cannot even afford to pay a rent because, my father is relunctant to get a full time job or anything like that, and yes I have applied to jobs if hopeful, McDonald's should re-call me this week to schedule a final meeting so, I can start with it (I know, it's not a super luxurious or well paid job, but at least for my situation it helps.) And let's say that, we owe a lot of money to different parties, mostly because my father keeps asking for credits knowing he can't afford to pay them, so at least twice a day people come knocking our door to cash in, and if it's not them then, our landlord does it, I know my father needs to pay rent but, he has threatened me and my siblings if we don't open the door (take in mind, my sister is 7 and my brother is 15, technically still minors by law.) I've been told I can testify in-front of a court to, give him a restrinction order for when, at least me and my siblings are home alone (he has gone as far as to almost break the window or cut the power off, once when my siblings were home alone, with nothing or no one else.) Then again, my father has always been so overprotective so, he advices me not to make a legal move (even if of course, being a legal adult I can) saying he'll do it... It's been a year and honestly? I've grown with fear that someday or night, we might not make it out alive.

I lost my opportunity to access college this year, but I'll try the next one once they re-open convocations and sign-ups alike. 

The thing here is... I feel we've gone through a lot we're clouded and whenever one of us comes up with an idea to get better, other blows it out of the water for whatever reason. My French teacher (I am studying languages too, but I haven't assisted to classes in like half a year, thankfully my teachers are understanding of my situation and, I don't owe them any money.) has a free room in her house which, is in the same unit as mine at the moment, but, I am afraid to leave my family alone in this situation, even if it's murdering me inside, I've lost a lot of chances to improve just because of minor things my father and mother over-exaggerate, last week they argued so bad my mom cried and my father threatened her with divorce (he's had a rough time like us all, and let's say his life hasn't been the best one either, but this was too much to witness for me. And, the argue started just because my mother went to pick a gift my aunt sent us.) 

What should we do? Or... in defect, what should I do to progress and not leave them just hanging? I can't keep it up this way, if my own insecurities do not drag me down, then it's my depression or, external factors like economy and health. Should I just leave them and go with my french teacher forever until I'm done with college? Should I help them pay the bills with my soon to have job? (even if, my father is persistent I shouldn't and that everything will be alright...) or, is moving out until things are solved a better idea?",09Aug2017,1
115,"TLDR: I made a joke that may have made a good friend upset and I'm finding out months later. I don't know how to approach the situation or how to apologize. Any advice?

First some context
I'm a guy
It's a platonic relationship
I've been having this issue for the past few months
Other friends in our group have confirmed
I don't know what to do

I met this girl in high school right about the time I met everyone else who soon became my best group of friends. We got along really well but a few of them have diagnosed psychological issues which I do not. She had mentioned before that there were some thing that people said even in jest that would offend her but I always told her to let me know if I had crossed a line. She told me once of twice and I tried to stay away from the touchy subjects. 

Then we all graduated and went out separate ways to college. But I would still text everyone in a group chat every once and a while to try and keep in touch. This post is being written 2 years after high school graduation. About 4 months ago she stopped responding to my messages and would hardly say anything in the group chats. I remember sending something that I know was an issue but I thought she would understand I was joking (I had made jokes like this before and she never said anything). 

Two days ago I went back home and decided to text another friend in our group asking if the girl mentioned had started to dislike me and he tried to tell me in a subtle way that she didn't but I caught on and asked him to tell me straight up and he confirmed as did another friend.

My life really turned around when these people came in to it and I'd really like to try and save my friendship with this girl. Any advice on what to do or how to apologize?

I feel the greatest issue I have from improving my grades in chemistry to the ideal point is that I absolutely suck at memorizing small details! By this, I mean that I have no issues with learning and explaining processes with my own words, accurately too, but giving examples to a given process, or naming the properties of either a compound or the circumstances of a particular reaction I find myself stumped. 

Same thing applies to Native Language literarture - I can analyze things with the correct methods and argue for my views, but I've no hope memorizing the biographies of artists or reciting poems.

At the moment, my studying relies heavily on the following process:  
1. Read the chapter before class.  
2. Pay 100% attention to teacher  
3. Read the chapter again  
4. Write a short essay of own volition on the chapter  
5. Review essay's technical correctness.

123,"First, keep in mind when I say kid I don't mean some baby crying or fussy toddler. We're talking about a 10-12 year old playing video games and laughing and screaming at the screen at 2-3am.

I've gone up there and rang the doorbell several nights; sometimes multiple times a night since he'll start up again about ten minutes after I go back downstairs.

Nobody ever answers the door, but I can hear the parents shushing the kid halfheartedly, so they're plenty aware of the problem.

I wonder what I should do from this point, since face to face communication seems out of the question. Should I bring it up with the landlord? And, if that fails, will the police bother with a noise complaint cause of a kid?",09Aug2017,7
125,"It was the last day of school, so all the schools in the district were released early (I'm a incoming freshman). Me and my friends went to Wendy's and there was a couple of faggots instigating us. They came to the booth behind us. They called us bitches out of the blue. I wasn't going to let the piece of shit pick on my friend, so I told him to stop being a faggot. He didn't respond. He then slapped my friend, but not very hard. Just a simple tap pretty much. My friend then starts to tell one of them to chill. The other guy stands up to go get his food. My friend starts to piss him off some more, saying ""punch me and I'll sue you""... This was an inside joke me and my friends had, it wasn't literal. The guy smacks him a little harder. Then he starts screeching ""REEEEEEET"" being the retard he is. That's when the guy getting his food comes out of nowhere and pushes my friend's head onto the table. They got up and left, but right before they leave, one of them gives my friend the smack if his lifetime. As they were walking out they said ""be ready for next year"". That's where you come into play Reddit. What in the actual hell do we do if they want to fight us? They're much stronger than we are. And we really don't want to get into trouble. We wouldn't know what to do if they provoked us again. What should we do? 


TLDR; We pissed if some people that are bigger than we are. They want to fight. ",09Aug2017,0
126,"It seems that even if you make it clear that you respect and love women the fact that you also see them as individuals to have sex with is enough for people of both sexes to judge you as being needy....

So the question is, is it better to pretend you don't love women while making sure not to be an ass  in order for your statement of you love women to be accepted? Or are straight men just not supposed to be open about their desires to also want to have sex with them?",09Aug2017,1
128,"So a brief rundown: my man and I were co-workers/good friends for a few months before starting to heat things up, then a couple months later before it was official. Not long before wed decided to commit, we were having some realllllll kinky great sex. I woke up the next mornijng to, you know, admire the pictures. Much to my surprise did I also find hundredssss of pictures of other women, all sneakily taken, in gas stations, restaurants, other public plscds. Most of women in skirts, some tryiing to see more than they should. There was also a pic of him sleeping with a girl at a party one night when we were starting to get really serious but hasn't had the talk. I had a feelijng something happened at the party - he shaved everywhere- but he said it didn't, I let it go.

So I take a little time, went thru angry, hurt, but it was our firsdt big bump and I think everyone deserves one chance. Plus, as wrong as it is, it's a kink and I could get it, I guess, so I forgive him. I suggest taking sneaky pics in public instead and seeing what we could get  away with. Trying to 1) let him know I'm not a sexual prude and 2) try to open up communica tion on these things for better life in general. I don't want him feeling like he has to hide things from me, esp if they are things than can be turned into fun fantasies to share 😏

So fast forward 2 months to now. His two year old son was playing with my boyfriends phone, and when things got too quiet, I went to see why the Abcs were off. I take the phone and what do I see but..... ass. Multiple pictures of co-workers, customers, random women. This time he had the bright idea I guess go Facebook message them to himself and delete from the camera roll. Part of me wanted to laugh, because I never check his phone. Both times were accidents. 


So here I am, reddit. Sitting in the driveway of my boyfriend's house. Everyone is inside asleep; he still doesn't know I saw. I'm at the point where I love him, I love his son, and I am tired of starting over. He and I click very well together, mentally and definitely physically, so part of me wants to justify it. The other part of me thinks about him leering at women everywhere, fantasizing about fucking them, surely flirting with them. 

He constantly tells his friends what an awesome girlfriend I am. Is it cheating if it's just pictures? Or does the sneakiness make it worse? What do I do? ",09Aug2017,1
129,"There's a pen-pal I had been talking to, for around 6 months and had been talking about my depressions and problems I'd been having. I hadn't messaged him in over two months (I do that sometimes, depression, withdraw from everyone). I messaged him almost a month ago and I think I said too much tmi. 

Messaged him two weeks ago (I'm bad with time, might be more) asking him what he thought about an image I sent him since I had been working on it and redrew it a lot and wanted to ask him what he thought about it. He is usually quick to reply, even though I'm not, and this was a short message asking him what he thought about it. I won't give too much away (and some details might be changed), but it's on a site where people post stuff (like stories, comics, blogs) and i am subscribed to many people including him. Receive alerts when someone posts a story or drawing or anything. I'm addicted to the internet since I'm stuck at home, nothing I can do except go on my phone and go on the internet and computer. I don't interect with my family much, they....sometimes don't seem like they want to, and that's all I'm going to say. They aren't interested in anything I say or show them (they have told me so), and didn't appreciate when I made them something that took me a couple hours to make.  and this guy didn't seem to mind me sending videos of music and things I'd like to share with someone. I don't trust easily, but for some reason, I feel like I trust him. Was working on an animation for him for his characters he made but don't know if I should show it to him because I don't know the reason why he hasn't messaged back and don't want to seem too pushy if he turns out he doesn't want to see it. 

I become depressed and withdraw easily, not talking to anyone for around a month of time. I don't think he would be the type of person to do that to be petty, he always seemed nice and down to earth type of person, helpful advice. I think I may have said too much tmi in the last message where he hasn't replied since (not the asking what he thinks message). 

It's been two weeks, and he has posted a short story, but not replied to my message. I'm confused on what to do next. I already finished another piece of art that goes along with the previous one, like a comic, and (sadly enough, he is the only person I trust to share the things I made, since it is a fan made thing of a certain thing). So I'd like to share it with someone that I think would genuinly be happy for me (so far no one else has commented, I know I'm not good at art nor at writing). No one else I know is in the same fandom, since it might be niche. 

 I'm not sure what to do at this point. I don't want to seem needy, or obsessive, (I worry too much about everything). I'm planning on making animations for other artists, too, but his would be the longest (been working on it for a long time). I like to make things in advance. Should I show it to him? Should I not show it to him? Should I message him? What should I do?

I don't have any social skills because I didn't talk much when I was younger, and can't leave my house except for community college and am afraid of talking to people. People think I'm (r-word). I have trouble breathing sometimes, I have to breath through my mouth sometimes which makes me look weird. I have a slightly deformed finger which makes people uncomfortable when they notice it (I think. I was bullied and thought of as re-word for it).

As sad as it is, i don't have any friends. I already said the reasons why. I feel comfortable messaging him, and that is very rare for me (happened with another person online, through an online suicide help forum. He ended up killing himself...told me goodbye and everything. Saw his previous posts (remember that i said that I drop of the end of the earth?), and he had talked about reaching peace through death, and had said that death wasn't so bad. And similar things.

I can't leave my house cause I have a phobia due to bad things happening when I was outside. I don't trust easily. I don't know what to do, nor the reasons why he hasn't replied a yes or no. I can't show anyone else my writings or drawings (like on reddit) because they will link back to my account which I do not want for anyone I talk to to see. 

I'm not feeling well atm, might be some grammar mistakes. ",09Aug2017,0

133,"I just got a job at a company that does 0 hour contracts. We have a bank holiday coming up in a couple of weeks and I'm very worried my first shifts will be during this, however I booked a really expensive festival months and months ago before I had even thought about applying to this job!

If I'm honest they haven't even asked me yet, my training is a week before and they do schedules of a week at a time so I'm praying my first shift won't be bank holiday Monday.

How can I combat this without looking bad? I feel like it's a lose lose situation. I really don't want to give up this festival it means a lot to me and I only got this job for a little extra money. But I'm sort of panicking about them asking me now. Should I mention this at orientation and specifically say I can't work the bank holiday but after that I am literally 24/7 free and will work any shift ever??

I'm so worried about this, I know you shouldn't worry about these things before they happen but this is the type of company where if I make a bad impression they'll give me way less hours. What do you guys think I should do?

TL;DR my new job may ask me to work the bank holiday as one of my first shifts. I want to make a good impression but I booked a festival months ago which was really damn expensive and I'm seeing artists I've always dreamed of seeing and worked so hard at my last job to pay for it!!!!!",09Aug2017,1
134,"The long and short are as follows:
I work in retail and have three sickness related absences in the past 26 weeks.
The policy at work is anymore than three absences will lead to an investigation hearing.
I now have one.
The other policy is that upon returning to work, my management team are required to conduct a back to work interview with me.
This was only done on 2/3 occasions.
I believe the meeting will be a clear cut ""just be careful"" and we'll wrap it up there. However, if things do take a turn, could an argument be made that because work failed to follow their policy and conduct a back to work interview, they would void (lack for a better word) their policy on three absences?

136,"This is bugging me. But the way people treat me because of my race has made me frustrating and uncomfortable for the longest time. 

Here is the thing. I have brown skin and curly hair. I get read as AA often and grew up this way. However, from a young age, i don't really feel as if I have any connection to any other person because of how I look, including and perhaps especially african americans. In fact, all things being the same, I have been treated the worst by them than by any other identified ethnicity. 

Normally who I am isn't an issue. But it massively bugs me when people look at me and just start assuming things. They assume I have had a difficult life. They assume I am aggressive and very masculine (I am a cishet male but I am pretty gender neutral / effeminate). They assume my religion (I am agnostic). And all of these assumptions have caused me a lot of frustration over the years .

I want to be rid of it. The issue is that a lot of POCs can be very passionate about this subject. Esp. towards me because, as someone who is becoming increasingly successful, I am starting to become a role model for them. And this feels sort of nerve racking, as I don't feel much of a connection or identity as one of them anymore. 

I mean. My take on this is that I don't know if race is an identity. To me it is. But people are going to see me as what they see me. yet race is also hard to define. And my experience is that race has definitely effected more about how people perceive me than anything intrinsic to my condition as a human being. So can I change that perception., and be overt about doing it?",09Aug2017,2

142,"Im 26/f, and I've been in a semi long distance relationship for about 5 or so years. It's come to the point in my life where I'm looking to move in with my SO, and we purchased a reasonable house together. I've been trying to find a job before making the move, which has been quite difficult because I think being out of state may be a turn off to employers(and I have to drive 3 hours for interviews). 

After 3 rounds of interviews for a company, I have been offered a job..but at a $16k decrease of what I'm currently making. Even with cost of living differences it's a huge gap(and a huge kick in the gut). I'm not excited about the job itself, either..and the benefits won't be better than what I have now. I countered and was shut down by HR. Supposedly they would ""be estatic to have me because they're pretty sure I won't take the job due to the offered compensation."" 

My SO has great job prospects and we can afford the house and expenses, so that's not an issue. And I'm not in any real rush to move, other than to get my life started there. I have housing/a good job here with no set expiration date.

So what do I do. Do I take the job and just..push through it just to be out there..and then 6mo down the line start applying again? Do I hold out with my current job? I like my current position and employees..which makes it hard to leave just to..get out there (even though getting out there may make finding an actual job I like easier).

148,"[TL;DR version - Girl accepts texts from son, has dry convos, never initiates a convo herself, passive rejects all attempts to meet in person, won't share feelings/thoughts after 7 months of chatting, and overall seems self absorbed. Want to know if son should leave this narcissist alone or is she just playing hard to get]

7 months ago my son added a girl from his school on Facebook and they started chatting privately. During that chat the girl's cousin added him as well. Since then the original girl no longer likes him and even has him blocked where as her cousin still talks to him even to this day, kind of. She gave him her phone number to text instead of messaging through social media, but I'm not sure their friendship's authentic since she doesn't message him at all but she will talk to him if he messages her. She doesn't appear shy, just very self absorbed. Which is kind of funny because my son is self absorbed too. Most teens are from what I can tell. Me, me, me, me generation all thanks to this ""getting likes"" system we have now....

Anyways, when they talk to each other the conversation is very dry, she shows no interest in him at all and expects him to ask questions to stimulate conversation but she seems to have no interest in gettinc to know him or his thoughts or feelings. I thought it might be because she doesn't value her own thoughts or feelings but he refuses to talk seep with her to find out (they're both 15).

She seems to only want to be internet friends of convenience  because any suggestion he makes to meet her in person is met with a passive no through telling him that she has plans all the time and she's busy, but what she really does with her time is watch YouTube videos, draw, watch anime, and sit in her room all day. The only time that she ever does anything outside of her house is with her parents doing community events or with her cousins (including the one that hates my son) on the weekends. All attempts to meet her in public is met with lame excuses and all attempts to invite her over is turned down with a ""I have to ask my parents"". Her Dad seems chill as I've met him but I am getting the impression that her Mom is a strict control freak that micro manages her. Very unlike me and my wife, she's very chill and I'm a passionate Dad trying to help my mildly Asperger son.

He has gone long stretches of not messaging her, but she doesn't message him out of the blue at all. She went 2.5 weeks without messaging him but only messaged him to say ""sorry, I hope you aren't mad"" but not really to have a conversation with him. When they text it's like having a face to face conversation, they don't passive text like I've seen many teens do. This is probably part of the problem. The friendship isn't casual at all. Sometimes I think he's pestering her and she would rather he leave her alone but she isn't assertive enough to tell him that because she also likes the attention. She only has 35 friends on Facebook and it's all extended family except him and 2 others. And her posts appear to be inside jokes or memes within her family or cousins, nothing my son can participate in.

So I guess what I'm saying is, no matter what, the friendship appears to be one hundred percent the result of my son's efforts and absolutely 0% her interest in my son (despite giving him her personal cell number). Now, they met in person once at a popular arcade and hung out for about an hour together while I was there with my wife celebrating my birthday. But other than that there's been no effort in trying to meet up again. And it didn't even feel like a real teen meetup, it felt like her Dad toted his daughter to a playdate and the kids played while the adults mingled. Im not even sure this girl has ever had any real friendships other than cousins. Which is jist like my son, he hasn't had a friend since 2010.

So with my son having no other friends to talk to, he continues to talk to her because there are no other options really. But I'm afraid that the only reason why she talks to him is pity or her own lack of social skills, not a genuine interest in having a friendship since she refuses to send him messages or reciprocate interest in hanging out. I mean, at least she dry responds to his texts, but when he confessed he kind of liked her she just said ""why"", which just implies to me that she either has really low self esteem and was fishing for a compliment OR she was trying to reject him and tell him he's wasting his time. I read all there messages because my son wants help talking to her and I couldn't figure out what ""why"" meant either in context.

Anyways, what do you think? Should I tell my son to stop messaging her and to stop giving her narcissistic Supply? She's not an ugly girl, but she does not seem interested in my son, let alone society, at all. My son is a lot of the same way though so I thought that these two would make a cute couple since they would hate the world together, but I'm starting to think that this girl hates everyone so much that it includes my son.

I'm thinking of having him send an ultimatum to force her to reciprocate or to get him off her hook but I need more perspectives to find our what else it could be first.",09Aug2017,0

163,"Hi Everyone! I am really tearing myself up over this dilemma I am having and hoping you can help. 
I have been at my current job for about 14 months. I don't particularity love it, and most days I dread coming into work, but it's a really good company to work for. Honestly it's just my boss. However, my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for awhile and are starting fertility treatments. During the course of working at my current job, I have had two miscarriages and my company has been so helpful and accommodating to me. Hopefully in about ten months we will have a baby and I am planning on stepping down to a part time job. 
Currently, I have an offer from another job. It is .75 cent more than I make now, which I realize is not a lot more, but it adds up. It's better hours, but then there's the added stress of not knowing how to do the job.

I am conflicted if I should keep my job with the anticipation of part time in ten months and the pregnancy will work or do I take the other job with the anticipation the pregnancy won't work. I don't want to take the new job and quit in 10 months because I am pregnant.

164,"So, a couple of times over the past few years i've had the notion to want to move to Canada (from Australia) for a year and work and I had two friends keen to do so 3 years back but the plan never actually eventuated and I started Uni instead.

I now am working as a web developer and have been given the green light to go work remotely if I want to. All is well.

Except I have a girlfriend who is 23 and in the middle of her studies and wants to finish and get a residency at a school (studying to be a teacher) before she travels again.
I'm turning 27 in a month and the cutoff for the visa is 30, and I also really want to do this trip now and not in a year or two, so I can come back and save for a house, and the fact it plays on my mind every single day.

We've been dating for 1 and a half years which isn't the longest but we're pretty close and she is very dependant on me so I'm not sure how she is going to take this or what I even say.
I've been told by everyone I've spoke to though that I will strongly regret not going if I choose that because of a girl.
In saying that though I have given this an extreme amount of thought over the last few months and I've decided I'm going to do this.

So. How do I break it to her? Is there any way to put a positive spin on this - the only things I thought would be to fly her out or i fly home in her breaks or something.

168,"I was randomly attacked on a main, public street in broad daylight by a mentally ill person a couple months ago. I was physically attacked and chased two city blocks before some good samaritans helped me and the police arrived. The trial is tomorrow and I've been given the option to read a statement,  which I would write myself, to the jury and judge before sentencing in order to explain how this attack has affected me. The victims advocate said I should do it because it can sway the judge to give a more or less severe sentence based on my testimony.

But I'm scared to face this person in court. I don't know if they'd even recognize me. I think I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But I'm still scared. I think I'm okay and go a day without thinking about what happened but then I remember and I hate how uncontrollably emotional I get. I hate that I cry and shake and am scared to go outside my apartment.

The trial will probably be over in less than half am hour so if I go it's not an extended all day thing. None of my family or friends have offered to go with me and I don't want to ask them. They're too busy with their own lives. I haven't been called as a witness by the DA or by their attorney so I'm not required to go at all.

170,"Despite my name, I plan on keeping this account around. 

Anyway, to make a long story short, I'm a 24 year old college student, and I wound up $15,000 in debt with creditor (credit card) after a housefire caused me to spend more than I needed to. I COULD pay this at the time, but being forced to relocate afterwards caused me to lose hours, spend more in commute, etc, etc. 

Already living with my parents, who refuse to stop charging me ""rent""  (only $200 a month, but that's $200 I could be using to save my ass while they allowed their kid to have a roof over their head until I could pay them again). This was tougher because before the move, they hadn't charged me anything, but I had no choice as moving with them was the cheapest option. 

I decided to pursue chapter 7 with a lawyer, who after reviewing my case is fairly certain it would go through and my debt would be discharged, but I can't even come up with the funds to pay him in order to file. He's the cheapest and best reviewed I've found, the fees would be $1376.

 I'm living paycheck to paycheck, no luxuries. The only asset I have worth anything, I'm trying to sell off to afford the lawyer, but anyone who offers to buy it (a motorcycle), keeps trying to jerk me around on the price, despite the fact that I'm taking a $500 loss on it to sell it. 

I had considered some sort of crowdfunding, but I've already had to do this for an emergency medical procedure that I couldn't cover out of pocket, and didn't want to do this yet again. 

It's starting to feel like my life is in a spiral with collections calls, etc. 

Has anyone been in this sort of debacle? Any idea on how I could fund this?

171,"Hey Reddit, so I have a bit of a predicament here. 

Pretty much I originally went to school for Culinary back in 2013 and finished (barely) with a GPA 0f 1.77. To give you the quick version, I went through a rough patch and ended up not really caring about how I did in college. I completed my diploma but my marks took a major hit. I also realized during that time that I didn't want to work in Culinary ever.

Now I'm a few years down the road and have sorted things out, I want to go back to school for psychology (I know, big jump). I'm not sure how to increase my marks though and if any college would take me. I mainly took college level courses in highschool so i don't have any highschool courses in university level sciences or mathematics.

Pretty much I'm trying to find out my options for bringing my GPA up and getting back into the schooling system. I know it's gonna be a tough road ahead, but at least I know what I want to do now.

Also, I'm in Ontario, Canada if that helps.",09Aug2017,1
175,"Hey r/advice.

So about half a year ago, I moved to a new country to teach English to adults. My company has five centres in the city.

About me - I am a gay guy. I'm kind of open about it but I guess I just don't really like to talk about it unless it's relevant to the situation. When it comes to my students though, they often ask me if I have a girlfriend/what I think of local girls etc. I normally just laugh it off and change the subject.

Recently, a student/friend of mine (Amber) joined the company as a teaching assistant at another centre. I asked her how she was getting on with her colleagues and she said that they were very strange and gossipy. In fact, she disclosed to me that one of the other teaching assistants (let's call her Molly) had been telling STUDENTS at her centre that I am gay. I don't even really know Molly, but I know a few other people who work at her centre, so although I don't care too much if she knows, I'm still not sure HOW she knows.

Here's the thing. I don't mind that other staff members know I'm gay - since most of them are from the west, and they are colleagues. But I have absolutely NO desire for students to know that I am gay. Many students go between centres, and Amber told me that another student at my centre had found out and told her - i.e. word of my sexuality is getting around now. 

 Also we are in a country where the attitude towards homosexuality is perhaps not as forward-thinking as my country. And finally, it's none of anyone's fucking business, and I have no idea why this random chick who I don't even know is discussing this shit with people.

Should I do something about it? I know her boyfriend quite well - should I mention it to him? Should I get my manager involved? Should I message her directly and ask her what's up? I don't know if it's malicious or just ignorant, but it seems unprofessional as hell, and I can't decide whether to be monumentally pissed or to just roll my eyes and move on.

178,"Hi Reddit!
A little backstory first... I've been living in my current apartment for over 3 years. It's a month to month lease, and has been sort of a revolving door apartment since I moved in. Plenty of roommates coming and going in that time. The landlords are lazy, unorganized, and don't keep the apartments maintained to any decent degree. 
The situation I find myself in, is that my boyfriend, his brother, and I have submitted our 30 day notice, but none of us have ever signed a lease. Now the landlord dropped a lease agreement off, with the expectation that we sign. 
Given the way they have managed the property, and treated us as tenants, I feel like they might just be having us sign to cover themselves. (Terrible landlords providing little to no maintenance, and like to stick their nose in everybody's business)
We're respectful, keep the place clean, and have no intention to get our deposit back. Where the advice comes in... Is there any reason we have to sign a lease as we are leaving in less than a month? Would they have any legal recourse if we do or do not sign? 
Any advice is appreciated!

Saying this coming from me would sound weird to anyone who knows me because they'd think the opposite. I have first noticed this after I've started smoking weed for a while (I no longer do). After a smoke session with my friends I tend to get really quiet and just thinking a lot basically about everything, till the point where my friends would point out the quietness. Sometimes we would smoke at my house and I would go as far as to say that I have to get ready for something so they are required to leave, all just because I wanted to enjoy myself being alone, high. I've smoked with my gf before and I do talk a lot but eventually sometimes I would want to be by myself.

No church since there wasn't any religion in our family, no politics or news stations since we didn't care, no foods from our ancestors or heritage since we were living as nothing, no need to be patriotic so no need to enlist in the army or own a flag.

I'm 15 years into fatherhood now and 16 years into marriage. Life is very hard for me. Everything from my childhood is the same, but my son isn't hitting the maturity milestones. His Asperger's or just him being difficult who knows, but he refuses to mature or make friendships.

Because my wife and I are never home due to work and are very controlling when we are, my son doesn't do anything his peers do. No Game of Thrones, no 50 shades, no sports, no fire pit campfires, no swimming pools, no trampolines, no trips to Disney land, nothing. We are homebodies, and my son is so uninteresting that his peers don't even know he's alive besides to bully him for his stuttering or long hair.

My son is socially stunted because of his lack of indoctrination. And now no one will talk to him because he isn't like the rest of the peers in their age group.

The first day I moved into my apartment, my downstairs neighbor told me she wanted me to find another unit, because she is ""used to living below a vacant one"", which I thought was weird, but whatever.

I have lived here for almost 3 years, and have received probably 10 letters taped to my door complaining about things such as I ""pee too loud"" (lol), my plants are ugly, my balcony needed to have a rug on it, and anytime anyone in the apartment complex is noisy, she blames me and reports it to corporate. My job requires me to be gone for 24 hours 3 times a week, I'm not home enough to have these giant parties she accuses me of having... She has made me come and clean her patio (below my balcony) because she was 100% positive that I had something to do with the wind blowing leaves and dirt from the woods behind us onto her patio furniture. 

Her latest complaint is my blinds. They're those cheap, Venetian ones that are standard in crappy apartments. Well, they fell apart pretty quick, so I rolled them up and put up a curtain. Problem solved.

I was wrong. 

Today, I come home from work, and she has taped a note to my door stating that I must remove my curtains because she believes they are ""ghetto"". She states that she has no idea why I like them, and that she thinks they are hideous. She said she will report me to corporate and that I will be evicted because she believes they will agree with her that the curtains are indeed ugly. She makes vague threats about my cat, stating that she would hate to have to report me for having an animal that causes problems to the property (the cat ripped up the damn blinds, but if I replace them before I leave, the apartment complex doesn't care).

I don't know what to do.These are just the complaints I remember off the top of my head, but it's something new pretty much weekly. Is she harassing me? Am I in the wrong? I don't want her to start making up reports to corporate (she's done it once before) because this dump has a ""three strikes no matter what and you're gone"" policy. Again, I apologize for the length of this post.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone for the advice! I'm saving the letters, and I called corporate yesterday to give them a heads up as to what's going on.

I got married and my wife and I moved from my hometown last year. I got a job offer across the state that came with a small house. It's a really unique job and I saw it as the starting point for us. The job used to be fun. It's not exactly what I want to do but it paid well and I didn't have a house payment. The company was a research facility owned and operated by a local university.  We were a small crew of 6 but ran it fairly efficiently. Three months ago, the company was bought by a private party because it showed huge financial potential. This guy is your standard no-nonsense business man which I can respect. His first act as new owner however was to fire one of us. I made the cut and he fired my co-worker. This put us all on edge. He gave us all a slight raise but our workload increased substantially. I was asked to go to his other facility last week to discuss some things with him. Turns out, he wants to fire my supervisor/friend and put me in charge within 3 months if I can prove myself worthy. I was very flattered but hesitant. He has huge expectations for this facility. So much so that I don't think any one human can accomplish what he's asking. I, of course, told him I was interested for fear of being fired on the spot if I said no. I really don't have an interest in this field. It's just a job to me. On top of that, my boss/friend has no idea this is all in the works.

My Girl and my soul mate(she's 23) and her friends/mentors(they're about 28-30 y/o) are the ones who organize the biggest medieval fantasy events in my country for example Tolkenfest, Gamescon and so on, they also do a lot of plays and award winning cosplays... Everything about that is perfect and fitting for me to learn some more stuff because i love things like that very much(yes I'm a geek xD).. We'll go there by car which my and hers friend will drive(a free ride there and back) and we'll also have a motel reserved for us, everything for free because the four of us are VIP on that event.. But the problem at hand is my mother.. She's never shown interest in my hobbies whenever i try to show her and she has never met in person my girl and her friends who will drive us there.. Me and my are always in bad relationship, we argue a lot and she's always doubtful, so on, you get my point(i hope)..  I even have a lot of money to spend which I've earned with my part time job, so i don't need a single cent from her.. the only problem is that I cannot even consider going on a trip like that without her approval because I'm 17... On top of that I have the phone numbers of the two friends who said that they'll talk to her.. This event is on the 18th of August and I'm afraid that she'll just say ""No"" before i even finish what i have to say... Just to say that the last time i went out to sea was 5 years ago because our country doesn't have one...  This is a huge opportunity for literally 0$, not to mention the sentimental value it will have... And as a cherry on top, I've always been good at school, very social and never got into trouble..

208,"When I feel comfortable around people, talking or typing feels a lot more fluid and natural. I say what's on my mind without hesitation. I'm confident in myself and my sense of humor, and I really like the things I have to say!

Around new people, however, I start to process the things I say a lot more meticulously. It feels like there's a delay between when I have a thought, and when I try to say the thought. As if it has to pass some internal filter before I feel comfortable saying it, but that internal filter is doing more harm than good! I feel like a deer in the headlights.

When I start to feel comfortable again, then I return to being a chatty Cathy, and stop consciously thinking about things before I say them. Depending on how much I end up dwelling on things, that could happen within the span of a conversation, or over several days. 

Ideally, though, I would be able to act the same way around new people as I do around people I'm comfortable with. I want to spend some time practicing to achieve this goal, but I'm not sure where to begin.

I have a coworker older than me, I'm 19 and he's almost 30 and he continually asks me to go out with him. The first couple times I laughed it off but then I found a new job and this guy found out I am leaving in 2 weeks and he got very.... intense.

221,"I'll try not to get too in-depth but I needed to get some thoughts down on paper and get some outside help and opinions, or some advice on how I should proceed.

Basically, I've always been a quiet, introverted person, especially around women.  I don't have a lot of really close friends, but I'm usually pretty relaxed and sociable in group settings - as long as it's with guys. I was a jock growing up and a lot of my life still revolves around sports which has become pretty much my main and only conversation topic that I feel confident, relaxed, and enthused about.

I grew up with fairly strict parents - they've always been protective but have treated me awesome and always provided for me - but my mom was a stay-at-home parent and I had very few freedoms during my childhood.  I rarely ever could go out late, always had to report on my whereabouts and who was with every half-hour or so, never really had friends over, etc. Basically, I grew up with rules and didn't have a lot of chances to go out and ""be a kid"" - in fact, I didn't even have a drink or go to a party until Grade 11 despite hanging out in a group of quote ""jocks/popular kids"" that would be in the middle of the party scene. 

The lack of social interaction built up and started to really bother me over time, but I had sports or video games or books to distract me, and the older I got the more the lack of a social/love life bothered me, which equated to even more time spent alone distracting myself from my feelings and thoughts.

Anyway, fast forward to today and I'm 24 with having had no serious relationships, very few friendships outside of the people I've hung around for the last 5+ years, and very few hookups or even simple dates.

After drifting for awhile and letting my appearance and weight slip, I got my shit together in the last year.  Started my career and moved out into a house with a friend, changed my clothing and hairstyle (not due to pressures from others but from what I believe looks good) and got back to the gym, losing over 30 pounds.

Since that time, I've felt more confident and have noticed more people pay attention to me or compliment me, which was shocking at first as I had never had that happen.  I've been feeling a lot better about myself and my situation, but there's still this same black cloud of loneliness hanging over me and weighing on me and I feel really weird and ashamed about never having any real experiences with women.

I've always been insecure with very low self-esteem, which weighs on me a lot (I just can't imagine anyone showing real interest in me or wanting to hang out with me).  I've been feeling better since my self-improvement and have tried to be outgoing, but it's still there.

Case in point, here's where I'm at.  For two straight weekends I've gone out to the bar with buddies and twice I've had girls either come up to me and introduce themselves or tell a friend of mine that they're into me, and yet I couldn't even get a number, never mind set up a date or take someone home.  I'm so lost in my own head that I freeze in those situations - I don't know what to talk about, what to say, how to show my interest back, etc.  I feel so lost and incompatible and it's always on my mind. Friends of mine are getting engaged or married, and I haven't done anything in years.

I guess the point of this post is just to get some words down on paper for others to see and to hopefully hear some similar tales, or some advice on what I can do about it or where I can get more helpful information. I could go on with my thoughts and feelings for awhile, but I feel like admitting this to strangers is a good first baby step in the process.

223,"I've suffered depression for almost 8 years now. After therapy I was told it was because I literally take on what people say about me, people blaming me for stuff that wasn't my fault and manipulating me by leaving because I fear being alone. 

At this point in my life, I realize that I do do that. I let people manipulate me, I started having bad trust issues and at this point have a general mistrust of people because I believe anyone who claims to like me or love me is just using me until I won't do what they want. 

I can't listen to criticism without getting down on myself and crying because I fucked up again. I feel like a bad person if I'm not doing something for someone else, and a lot of the time I end up alone in my room.

My family generally ignores me if I'm not crying about something, my brother and mother who I live with have a more solid relationship, I can't get my brother to answer me with more than one word statements, and my mother overreacts to small stuff, once threatening to break my fucking fingers off because I turned down the thermostat 2 degrees and more than once has threatened to punch me.

I have low self esteem too, tried to change it, but guys slowly took it away the more they used me. I had sex with a guy recently, who after we were done never responded to any texts or messages so I blocked him. He was only the 3rd guy I had sex with.

I'm at a point in my life where I just feel down constantly. I've honestly been considering taking my own life, but I fear the consequences of doing so. This just isn't the way to live, feeling like nobody will like me if I don't do something for them or feeling like guys will only use me in the end so I should just stay to myself.

225,"My landlord has been coming over a lot lately, always saying that he has a question he needs to ask. He'll show up, just wanting to chat apparently, and when I ask what he wanted to ask, it's always something I've already told him or that could be answered in a text message, so I was getting a bit suspicious. But, I agree to meet him because I don't want to piss off my landlord as he can fuck with my life in a big way (I'm a broke student without a lot of housing options).


So anyway, last night this happens, he's talking and talking and motions for me to sit next to him and I decline. Later, he asks again and I decline, and he gets up, and sits on the arm of my chair and wraps his arms around me. I immediately jump up and say ""NO NO NO I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS!"". I was shocked, and should have left, but I sat down on the couch this time and he follows me, wraps his arms around my waist, said ""You know I like you"" with a sleazy smile and held me down on the couch while I was trying to get up. He let go after what felt like an eternity but was probably only 10 seconds or so.


Because I'm an idiot and was afraid of what he could do to me, I sat down in another place, restated my boundaries, and continued chatting like nothing happened because again, don't want to piss off my landlord, and frankly, didn't know what else to do.


I was so afraid in bed last night knowing he has keys to the house. I barricaded my bedroom door.

230,"I took college classes over the summer because I felt as though I was behind where I needed to be, mostly because many of the people I talked to were in higher classes.

I would much rather get something more personal for the baby that my new niece may one day remember or at least enjoy for now, rather than something disposable akin to paper plates or toilet paper. 

I realize new parents are often gifted too many clothes, but I was thinking about something like a personalized stuffed animal, soft blanket, photo frame, etc., or even something experiential for them to do and enjoy together as a family (Need to do more research here). 

Anyways, I searched about this topic a bit in various forums but most of the threads are in mom-focused subreddits where the general sentiment is that buying off-registry is a slap in the face. 

My SIL and I are already off to a shaky start relationship-wise, so I can't afford to be seen as passive aggressive. I'm just really excited about having a niece and want to celebrate her and value that, rather than toss cash into a fund for disposable household goods.

235,"My mom is not really normal.   

She's stressed from work all the time, and has pretty extreme mood swings. She was on anxiety medication for a while but went over the prescribed limit when she was stressed, which would make her whole mood so much more tired and angry at everyone, which she would take out on us.   

I tend to be a more introverted person in general, but at heart I'm very independent and opinionated, and when I think something I don't hesitate to speak. That leads to my mom's personality clashing with mine, because her anxiety wants her to have control over as much as possible, especially over me, and I make it clear that I think it's overboard.   

I'll be 18 by the end of this school year, but she tracks me on my phone, she tried to monitor my sleeping schedule by refusing to go to sleep if I stay up late one night and yelling at me along the way, *especially* if it's for homework. She dislikes me studying. She dislikes a lot of things really. When I study a lot, she says I need to be more social and not work so much, even though I don't really study too much, I just recognize that my intelligence is about average and I need to work a little harder to compete with some of my naturally brighter classmates. I wanted to get a job, which she heavily discouraged, saying I should just stay home all the time and do things for her for money. If I decide do something social, like last night when I went roller skating with a big group of friends, she has to keep tabs on me, and if I try to establish that I want a little more freedom by not giving her all the specifics she wants, she'll just call up one of my friend's parents that has a strong relationship with their child and knows whats going on with them solely because they want to know how their life is, and get all the information she needs. She won't really say anything about it to me when I do that, but she holds onto it and uses it as ammunition later. For example, when I went roller skating yesterday, my mom was already mad at me as I left because a few hours before I was supposed to leave she called me up with a list of all the things she had planned for me to do that day (go to the bank, UPS, grocery store, pick up laundry, drop off something, etc.) and I had to tell her that I wasn't able to because I only had about two hours anyway before I had my own plans, and that I needed that time to get things done that I had already put on my own to do list, and that she should tell me about those sorts of things ahead of time. That didn't go over well. When I got home she yelled at me for a couple random things. She told me that I don't have a job like every other teenager and I still don't have time to help her so I seriously need to get my life together, even though I have hobbies I commit to, and she's the one who told me not to get a job in the first place. I walked by her cell phone on the ground near her door and accidently saw a text message pop up saying ""No, I don't track my daughter, why?"" She came in my room again later fuming and told me that my dad was in a rage of fury that caused him to *break a chair* when he found out everyone wasn't asleep in bed (11 pm). Now, there's absolutely no way that would happen. My dad has cancer. He's sick. He lays in bed all day. How could he pick up a chair? He can barely go upstairs and get a glass of water. He's also the most rational person I've ever met, even if he does have some anger issues, but he would never do something like that anyway because he doesn't even care what time I go to sleep, *she* does. I felt like she was trying to guilt me by using my dad to make me sleep at the time she wanted as a way of controlling me better.   

Anyway, I know that was long, but I'm just trying to establish what living with her is like. My question is how I should go about dealing with her in a way that reduces how often she directs her anger at me. My dad knows what she's like, and recommended just trying to talk to her more, because if she knew what was going on with me she might feel more comfortable trusting me to make my own decisions and release some of the desire for control. A week ago I tried talking to her a little more, specifically about skincare, which she loves, and it didn't work. She ended up just accusing me of cozying up to her as a way to manipulate her into getting what I want (I recently asked her if I could start birth control and she's having a fit). It just didn't work. But I've also tried the stubborn angry teenager way, by yelling back and trying to establish my own rights, and that was so much worse because she has something to latch her anger on to and an excuse to target it at me, drifting the argument into how horrible her life is and then blaming me for not helping her more.   

Should I just keep my head down and ignore her? Should I try harder to be nicer to her and help her with things? After the really bad reaction to asking for birth control, she later seemed a little more iffy on maybe possibly helping me if I took a bunch of tests, saw her specific doctors, got some specific kind, let her monitor me in the process, etc. although she still acted like I'd punched her in the gut every time I brought it up and asked me to stop talking about it. I decided I don't really need that, I don't want all those restrictions for something I feel so sure about, and I don't want her to hold helping me over my head, which I already know she will, so despite what she said about the law being *very strict* about giving teens birth control and her *explicit permission* needed along with all those *highly uncomfortable* vaginal exams, I found out online that I actually don't need her consent, nor do I need all those tests or screenings, and scheduled my own appointment at a Planned Parenthood. Should I hide it, or would it help our relationship if I told her as a way to open up to her more? Maybe by showing her that I care enough to include her in the process while making it clear that the law allows me my own rights in making this decision, she'll see that she can't control it but will eventually be glad that I made the choice to talk to her about it? I honestly don't know what to do anymore, because it feels like no matter what I do my mom is just going to keep projecting her unhappiness with her life onto me. ",09Aug2017,1

It wasn't in my job description and didn't seem appropriate, but I was new and wasn't sure what my role was at the time. 

The assistant is having similar problems that I had. He would get her to make him coffee everyday (I put a stop to that), he will stop her from her work and get her to grab a file for him (that is 2 feet away from him), get her to do things like call people for him, outside or inside the office, just very minimal things that takes her out of her work for more bigger picture things like taking care of payables or receivables. 

Both have expressed annoyance with another. The accountant often complains to me about her, whether it is personality or work related. The same goes for the assistant. 

I am biased, because I have worked closely with him before and I have been in the assistant's shoes. He is very abrasive and demanding. today, I was talking with the assistant and she began to tear up from frustration. She is miserable working along side of him. 

How can I resolve this? I want to approach this non-biasly as possible. I should also note that the CEO has not been happy with the accountant lately, on a work performance level. ",09Aug2017,2

I've tried to tell him this, but he gets upset and says that it's warranted, that the things I say are stupid and that he needs to point them out. I can tell you first hand he's the only one in our group that feels this way, in fact it's always awkward for everyone else, because they can tell how fucking hard he's trying to fit in, almost too hard. But they don't say anything, just out of awkwardness I think. We're all just trying to have fun, and he brings it to a weird level. He subscribes to a very alpha male mentality, like he has to appear the most dominant in the room. I know because he tells me this himself!

247,"Hi all, this is my first post here. I'd like to start by describing myself and my mother. I'm very laid back, more than a bit lazy, but have been told I'm intelligent and easy to get along with.

My mother is the main reason I'm making this post. For as long as I can remember we've got on well with each other and had a mostly good relationship. However, at least every few months or so we have a fight over something, normally something I have or haven't done. When I say we fight, I mean she fights and I clam up and can do little else but stare blankly until she's finished, which she doesn't like but I'm terrible at confrontation and she terrifies me when she's angry or mad.

I was mostly able to deal with this and in recent years I've been able to just let it slide and wait for her to calm down and for things to be normal. However, much more recently, within the last 12 months or so, I've noticed that now these fights are less extreme but much more common. My dad works away most of the week and has to support my mum, so I would never blame him for defending mum and taking her side, his hands are tied.

I know my mum has to work in a shitty office with total assholes, and gets stressed easily. She worries far too much and rather than talk it out she lets it get to her and takes it out on others, mostly me as I tend to provide enough sparks to set it off. My brother helps out a lot, but I feel that she goes really easy on him because he is slightly on the autistic spectrum. Not that I resent him in any way, we get on very very well, but it's been in the back of my mind that she's easier on him.

The most recent event to happen was that I wanted to stay for a few days at my girlfriend of four year's place for a few days this week. I've just started my training week for a new job and my parents initially said that I was mad for doing this as my girlfriend lives an hour's drive away, but were otherwise willing to let me do it, seeing as I'm 23 and all.
Then mum offered a compromise, just seeing my gf for an hour each night in the city between my house and hers, which I politely declined as I felt mature enough to be responsible for my new job. She didn't take it well and started talking as if I'd accepted, then starting planning dinner for the day after so she'd assumed I wasn't even seeing my gf. I was too nervous to talk to her about this and I felt my only option was to text from work at lunchtime and go to my gf's anyway. Obviously that wasn't taken well and she started guiltily me about not being home to help in the house as my grandmother (dad's side) was being discharged from the hospital for a minor illness. I told her if I'd been aware of this I would have stayed home to help, and she replied that she had only found out earlier that same day, but I don't see how this means she couldn't tell me and at least give me some warning.

So the most immediate choice is that I'm supposed to be going home tomorrow, but I haven't heard from home and know that, at best, the whole house will be awkward and pretty silent, and dad will probably pull me aside for a personal chat, which I actually don't mind because he clears that air immediately. I am tempted to stay away at least one more night and go home on Friday instead when my gf will be off work to come with me and help me to talk in person and explain what I want, which is to be able to be independent and possibly move in to my gf's house as a trial move in, her mum has agreed to this and will be staying with her boyfriend for this period. Honestly at this point I'm tempted to just stay away forever but I know that's a terrible solution.

In short, my question is: should I bite the bullet, go home, be uncomfortable and fail to defend myself; explain that I'll be away an extra day and try to say something with support; or just cut my losses and run? I know emotional choices aren't usually good ones, but I'm tired of 23 years if this cap and would love for it all to just end. Anyone been in a similar position?",09Aug2017,1
248,"so crying, im just so confused. I am a 14 year okd girl. I have had suicidal thoughts and all of that before, and I've been through a lot. My last suicide attempt was 4 months ago. I thought everything was going to be better.

Today I was just playing on my phone, and my little 3 year old brother came and sat next to me. I noticed his hands had become purple, and i immediately knew it was nailpolish. I went upstairs and it turned out he went to me and my sisters' room and broke a bunch of things, and spilled nailpolish all over my sisters' bed. 

I got mad because I had told him before not to go into our rooms, but he did it anyway. But what can you expect from a 3 year old? 

I went downstairs, told my mom what happened and she just laughed it off and said: ""what am i supposed to do, throw him away?"".

Later on wanted to play some games on my playstation, when i noticed my brother was trying to break my headphones. Without thinking i just put down the controller and pushed his face down into my parents' bed (thats where the ps is). He started screaming but I wasnt thinking and kept pushing his face into the bed. 

Then i heard my mom screaming and asking what the hell i was doing. It was like i was in some sort of trance... I just let my brother go and said nothing. 

After that i just felt stupid. My mom thought that it was just one of the dangerous games i like to play with him (i sometimes turn him upside down but not to intentionally hurt him). 

I love my brother too, and i cant imagine what it would be like with him gone, but i just dont understand why i did it... Now im starting to think that if i wasnt born, this wouldnt have happened. All of that therapy for nothing. 4 attempts in total. I dont understand myself anymore.

252,"So first a little backstory. I'm a 32 year old single father living with my mom and my 11 year old daughter in a relatively affluent suburban neighborhood. Three years ago my daughter's mother (due to substance abuse issues) flat out told my daughter she did not want to be her mother anymore and essentially kicked her out of the house. They were, at the time, living in a poorer neighborhood about a half hour away. I had weekend custody until then and had been seeking full custody of her (due to her mother's issues), but until this incident I had no real legal grounds to do so. My daughter's grandmother (on her mother's side) had done a fair amount of the raising of her during the week days, and so after the mother went off the deep end I made a big effort to have my daughter see her grandmother regularly, as she had no contact with the mother and did not support her actions. Then about two months ago my daughter got a text from her grandmother saying she couldn't see her any more, saying ""I knew there would come a day when I wouldn't see or speak to you anymore, and I guess that time is now. You were here from birth until your dad took you away from us."" I tried contacting the grandmother after that but haven't gotten a response. 

So the point being, my daughter's dealt with quite a bit of abandonment in her life. I have talked to her a great deal about all this, reassured her that I would never do what her mother did, and although she appears to have taken this all surprisingly well, I have put her in counseling. 

When I got custody of her, she had to adapt to the pretty large cultural differences of moving from an elementary school in a predominately black urban area to a predominately white suburban area, but she, right away, started making friends, and got especially close to one girl at her elementary. The girl was over for sleepovers often during the school year, but recently the parents seemed to be dodging me whenever I'd attempt to schedule anything, although they did invite my daughter to their daughter's 12th birthday party.

A few days ago that girl's father called me saying that he had found his daughter's iPad and read through their chat history, and that they had been using foul language, had been talking about boys/ sexual topics, and had exchanged some online ""lesbian test"" (apparently some clickbait quiz that determines whether or not you're a lesbian). He said that although he can't keep our daughters from seeing eachother at school, he wanted to let me know that there would be no more sleepovers or play dates in the future. He acknowledged that the girls considered themselves best friends and said that although this news was devastating to his daughter, she would eventually understand. He said that he was shocked that his daughter was using this language and that she should know this is a ""no-no"" (he used the word ""no-no"" several times throughout this conversation). He offered to show me the iPad chat history and I agreed to come over this Saturday to see it.

I can't help but take this extremely personally. I don't consider myself a bad father, and I have always thought that these modern, upper class, suburban families shelter their children too much, and I think that this can have negative consequences. I am definitely more laid back in some ways than these parents are, for example, I got my daughter her own cell phone a year ago, I allow her to watch certain PG-13 or even R movies, I let her listen to a lot of music that other parents would find inappropriate, I let her ride her bike around the neighborhood so long as she brings her phone, etc, although I will say I never allow these things to happen when she has a friend over, because I obviously don't want to impose my parenting style on their children. But at the same time, I have a very strong relationship with my daughter, I encourage her interests and encourage her curiosity, I set limits, give consequences, teach her (what I consider) good values, and I don't consider myself neglectful at all. After this incident, I definitely think that I need to be more aware of and set more limits on her digital activities and communication.

My daughter has a very sweet and kind personality, and while I realize that I need to put behavior like this (which I was mostly unaware of) in check, I also think that kids in general do act differently when they're not in the presence of adults. These girls are about to enter middle school, and I think it's a little naive to believe that a 12 year old isn't going to use or have friends that use bad language to some degree. But mostly, I don't want this to be yet another series of connections that get torn away from my daughter. This parent is in his 50's and is friends with all the other parents of my daughter's friends. As someone who is not an affluent homeowner in his 50s, I never really joined this click of parents as I don't really have much in common with them. Now I'm worried that this parent will tell all the other parents that my daughter is a bad influence, and my daughter will be pushed away from this click of friends right as she's starting middle school.

I really don't know what a proper way to approach this would be. Should I email the father and explain these issues, and/or assure him that I'll put this behavior in check? Or should I tell him that I think he's making the wrong choice? Should I go over there this Saturday and read the chat history, should I just tell my daughter to hand over her phone so I can read it from her end, or should I do neither and just tell the parent ""I hope you change your mind about this in the future?""",09Aug2017,11

255,"TLDR: Should I stay and try to find a job in my country (which is in deep crisis) or should I try to start a new life abroad?

---------------------------------------

Hi everyone!

I need advice on what to do with my own future. I live in Brazil, and as some of you may know, the country is going through one hell of a crisis right now.

I am going to move out within the next three months, so there will be some money coming in. But I have no idea what to do next.

One of my biology teachers (he has a Masters degree and I know for a fact that he was, at least up until a few months ago, earning a lot of money doing the job he did) is now going to live in Portugal. He is leaving behind everything he had here in Brazil and going to live abroad. He made it clear that he was going through a hard time here and not being recognized for his efforts and curriculum.

The thing is, my diploma is for teaching Science/Biology for Elementary and  High School students. In other words, I am a Biology teacher, recently graduated (finished college December last year) currently unemployed. And teachers here in Brazil are really underpaid. Another problem is that schools are mostly looking for people with a Masters degree and experience. So I guess my situation is even worse than my teacher's, from the previous paragraph.

I am studying Brazilian Sign Language and I have plans to become an interpreter and, in the future, maybe even teach Biology and Portuguese to the deaf (after the required study, of course), in case I stay here in Brazil.

On the other hand, I am also an Italian citizen so I have an opportunity to go live in Italy, or maybe a good opportunity in some other European country. My older brother lives in Finland and is engaged and has a job there. Maybe I could go try to live there too.

My diploma is for teaching science and biology. I strongly believe that it will be pretty hard for me, in another country, as a foreigner, to find a job as a teacher (that is, if my diploma is recognized, or valid). So I figure, if I were to live in another country, I would have to work on some unrelated job, just to earn some money, which is actually fine by me.

I know that starting a new life in another country isn't easy. I'm trying to figure out which choice will be better: trying to find a job as teacher during a crisis or getting established in another country.

Sorry for the long post. I really don't know what to do with my life right now, so I would love some help.

Thanks :)

Before meeting I had asked if they would require one and she said ""hell no"" so I brought no cash. So I'm completely naked, and they have my clothes, phone, car keys, and access to my wallet in the car. I was stuck. So they proceeded to tell me that I had to pay them for their time, or rather for the time that I'd wasted because I no longer wanted to be a part of it. But they wouldn't give me back my things, and threatened to just go out to my car and take my wallet and my car, which is damn near brand new.  So I panicked, they still took my car and drove me to the bank in it. I was nervous so they took a hundred bucks, using my card that they had not given back, and forced me to tell them my pin. They then tried another transaction to take more, it didn't work, then they made me call my bank to request that they take the hold off of my account. (I was away from home so the bank put a hold in case of fraud after the first fairly large withdrawal.) So I confirmed with the bank because I didn't know what else to do without my phone, car, or wallet. They took another $200. So after all that, my mom is calling because I have a student bank account that her name is on, and she received a call about a fraud possibility.

EDIT: My mom knows everything, and we are looking into pursuing legal action. I'm worried that even though I never agreed to pay or offered to donate or anything, that I still could be charged with solicitation just for meeting with them. I've looked around and read what I can about Chicago and Illinois solicitation laws, but I haven't really found anything that clearly helps me figure out what could happen.

I feel that this mistake will make her view me as incompetent especially since im a minority.

I apologized a few times and she said it was ok  because she was rushing and it was completely her fault for not being clear but I feel its all my fault. She told me im doing a great job. At that moment I pictured running away from work and quitting.

I moved back to my hometown with my fiance so I could finish my degree and soon we split up.  I am intelligent and was always tested in the top 10% if I really tried, but at this age I keep wanting to finish school but I end up not passionate about it.  I have very bad ADD as well.  My advisor even suggested just learning a trade at this point.

I just worked a landscaping job this summer and it was the best job I have ever had...being in the sun all day, feeling tired after work, and not having to deal with a lot of people was amazing.  My bipolar makes being in public really awkward sometimes, even though I used to be able to talk to girls and made plenty of friends.  I had a bipolar episode at work last week and quit after I was being asked to do things I shouldn't have to do (snitch on people, owner was a drunk)

I have $4400 saved up from this summer and need a new job now.  An employee I worked with who went to the same school just moved back to Maryland to become a teacher and his dad owns an hvac business.  He offered me a job at $11 an hour to learn how to be hvac repairman and earn my journeyman, something I would really like to do. 

 Should I pack my things and go ahead and move?  This place is 20 min from the beach and I lived at the beach in SC and loved it.  There is nothing left for me in this town, but I have no idea how to relocate..can anyone help me out?  Sorry long post",09Aug2017,1

274,"We've known each other for about 5-6 years, and dated for 1.5 years. We broke up this March. He has anxiety, depression, and trouble sleeping. He is trans and his parents don't know and don't accept it. They have kept him from getting therapy by shaming other people and family members who need therapy. 

While we were dating, I gave him some of my prescription of hydroxyzine to help with sleeping and anxiety. Since we broke up, he has been smoking weed and drinking, and has mentioned suicide.  The other night, he asked if he could have some more hydroxyzine. I told him yes without really thinking about it, but I don't want him to use it to get high, or hurt/kill himself (I'm not sure if it can be used for suicide but I don't want to risk it).

I don't want to accuse him if he's just going to use it  like he always has. But I also don't want to risk him hurting himself, because i don't think he believes it, but i still really care about him and want him to be okay. I don't know what to do or what to tell him.

276,"I started college this week and I've been having trouble socializing. In high school I had a big group of friends, more like a family, but everybody else thought that we were awkward and that, but we were and are the most united group, we used to make a lot of things. However, most of them went to different colleges and we separated, but we are still chatting, gaming etc. I realized that half of the people I didn't like in high school were at the same college as me, most of them at the same career as me. They didn't like me either and still, but at some point we will work together, and Idk what I'm gonna do if that's the case, they seem nice with others but all of them exclude me, make bad comments, or is it just me being a bad person, annoying? I don't know what to do, I just want to be professional and focus on the work but their faces and attitudes just, ugh. If I'm the one who's wrong tell me, any advice would be helpful.

277,"I'm a junior at a top public school but my major is political science. I am extremely interested in this discipline especially with regards to international relations. I have pretty good grades although this is an easy discipline so that's whatever. When choosing my major, I idiotically chose what I was most interested in not what was most likely to get me a job. I'm now starting to realize I'm going to be fucked when I get out of college especially since I had to take out loans to attend. atm I plan on going on to pursue a PhD but the likelihood of actually making it in academia and landing a professorship seems low given how oversaturated it is. (also, I don't think I'm smart enough to actually be a professor). I can't change my major now without adding 1 or 2 years (and 1 to 2 years of debt) to my bachelor's. Anyone been through something similar and actually been able to get a decent job? Should I just suck it up and go into some more debt to get an MBA or something useful?

278,"So, a friend and I, let's call him Joe, got into an argument. Today I apologized. Now, here's the problem: I've cornered myself, and I sort of have no choice but to pull the plug with one of two friendships. It's kind of hard to describe. I'll just put the texts here since the apology.

Me:
>Hey. 

>I was looking back on our arguments the other day, and I realized what a cunt I was being. I realized that I was the bad guy in this situation. 
>And for that, I wish to apologize.
>I was accusing you of many things, including hypocrisy, manipulation, not being sincere with our friendship, and more. But what I've realized is that this whole time I was the one exhibiting these accusations, not you. Aside from all of that, I was just being—for lack of a better explanation—a fucking selfish, inconsiderate, bigoted cunt. 
>One thing in particular that I accused you of was trying to separate me from other friends such as Elias. You said that you don't give a shit about whether I was friends with him or not, and I didn't listen to that. Thing is, though, even if you were trying to separate him and I, the incredibly harsh things I said were not warranted and I should not have ruined such a valuable friendship over it.
>Speaking of value, you said that you valued our friendship. Again, I clearly didn't listen. I accused you of not being sincere with that statement, and not truly valuing our friendship. But look at that... I was the one that was shown to not value our friendship. 
>You were trying to be kind, be sincere, be a good friend, and I scrambled it and threw it back in your face. Only a cunt like me would do that. 
>Contrary to what it seems, I did value our friendship, and I knew that it was wrong to do this that you, even while I was doing it. I don't know why I did it. And I'm not going to give any bullshit excuses as to why I did so.
>In apologizing, I do not expect you to forgive me. With that, if you do not wish to forgive me, I completely respect and understand that decision. It would surely take a lot for me to forgive someone for turning on me like this.
>Thanks for reading this. I did irreversible damage to our friendship and I regret it. Regardless of what you think about this, I just want you to know...
>I'm sorry.
>[Invite link to the Discord group that I kicked him out of]

Joe:
>How do i know its not elias telling you what to say
>I was trying to protect you because he wants to manipulate you but you threw it all away. What made you come to your senses

Me:
>Well, I don't have anything to prove against the statement of him telling me what to say. You're going to have to take my word for it, unfortunately, as screenshots won't do much. I'll still send them, though, in case it means anything.
>[Screenshots of my most recent texts with Elias.]
>What made me come to my senses, you ask? Well, my mom was reading my texts and read these. She told me how disappointed she was in me that I was being such a piece of shit to my friend.

Joe:
>Hmm i remember somebody that would always bring parents into things 

Me:
>Exactly as you said, you were trying to help me and I threw it right back in your face. I'm a piece of shit.
>Who?
>...Oh, yeah.

Joe:
>Did Elias ditch you?

Me:
>But the reason that my mom was reading them was different. I was trash-talking my mom in a chat with someone else—Conor, specifically—and I got grounded for it.
>No, he didn't.

Joe:
>I will not be around elias in any way shape or form not through anybody at all. I am not going to subject myself to that
>I will not associate with people that associate with him. I said before that i dont give a shit who you are friends with but im not going to associate with people associated with elias anymore

Me:
>Okay, and I'm perfectly fine with that. One of the mistakes I made was mistaking you not wanting to contact Elias, with you not wanting me to contact Elias. Which it was, to an extent, but not in the way that I made it out to be; rather, you were trying to help, not be manipulative and deceitful like which I accused you of.
>Again, I'm perfectly fine with that. It's your decision not to associate with certain people.

Joe:
>I am not associating with you if you are associated with elias
>you have to evaluate what means more to you.
>Me or Elias?

**EDIT:**

Joe:
>Fyi elias is trying to isolate you so you have no friends but him. I see right through his shit
After a little bit of time:
>I take it you chose Elias
>Congratulations you have made another stupid mistake. Goodbye Noah.

Me:
>Look, Joe... I don't want to give up either friendship. Both you and Elias mean a lot to me. And to pull the plug with either of you two would be hard for me, as you are both very good friends who I value a lot. Is here any way that I can be friends with both of you? >Also, would you mind explaining the whole story to me? I don't have too big of an understanding as to what either of you did to make each other mad. Besides, you too used to be good friends. All I know is that you guys got into an argument with each other, you guys started saying mean things to each other, Eli brought it to your mom and you brought it to the principal. I'd just like a better explanation of what happened that made you guys resent each other so greatly.

Joe:
>He tried to ruin my life and he tried to isolate you too
Actually, Joe, you're the one that is trying to keep me away from not only Eli but also a couple of other people that did nothing to you...
>If you honestly dont remember all the shit elias did to me then its way too long to type
>I dont know how you can be friends with him the only reason he talked to me was because he was pissed at colton and he tried to suck me down. Now he is trying to suck you down and he has almost got you

The thing is, Elias and Joe don't particularly like each other. In fact, they both hate each other's guts. 

But now, as I said, unless I can be clever, I have to stop being friends with one of these two people. Thing is, though, these are two of my closest friends and I don't want to give either of them up. I also need to be quick. I'll edit this post and put any further messages in here. I doubt anybody will care about this, but any advice helps. Thanks a ton.",09Aug2017,1

285,"Before I even begin, I want to add that my decision to drop out was not out of laziness or hatred for school but because of my health. I've had many health problems starting in elementary school that has led me to miss multiple days, and multiple activities. I wasn't able to do sports, or even be in a normal classroom because of how easily I'd get sick. When it came to my senior year I was taking junior and senior classes to make up what I had missed the year prior. However, I contracted meningitis and was missing weeks of school and not promised that I'd get better anytime soon. My mom and I decided the best thing was to drop out and focus on my health. This was two years ago. I recently took the GED and received very decent scores. I'm a smart girl, and I could have done so well in high school if not for my many illnesses. I know colleges won't care about that though, and they'll look at me having a GED in a negative way. I feel so crummy, like I've completely ruined any chance I'll ever have to get into a decent college all because of what I went through in my grade school years. I'm finally healthy and haven't been sick in over a year. What do I do? I'm so passionate about going to a good school and having a good career in social work. The schools I have in mind I'm afraid I won't get into. Help.

286,"Since I was a kid, I'd been told countless times that academic success will lead to success in life. So all I ever did was study, eat and sleep. I was happy back then, because I believed that I was doing the right thing to achieve what I want in life, great career and lots of money. I studied finance in one of the best universities in my country, graduated with an almost perfect GPA, got an analyst job with a large financial institution. Everything was working like I planned. Or so I thought.

I started working, if I wanted any promotion, I had to spend years to study professional exams, which was no news to me. I thought I could just do it like I did in university, afterall, who needs a personal life when you can make lots of money. I was wrong. Not interested in my work and studies, I couldn't dedicate myself to studying anymore. That's when I gave up. But I was actually happier, first time in a while, I was carefree. Show up at work, get paid, go home and chill. I felt that life wasn't so bad afterall. It continued like that for a year.

Then I stopped being treated as the new guy, people came asking me for things, I had more responsibilities. Because I was never interested in my work, I never really learnt much even though I've been there for a year. I couldn't take the pressure and started having severe anxiety. I felt like I couldn't do anything. I went to see a therapist and she recommended me to quit my job and do something I actually wanted to do. And that drove me into depression, because I don't know what I want to do with my life. I came to work, stared at the monitor, and couldnt focus anymore. I started applying for new jobs, hoping for a change that will fix me. Eventually I got a government job, I thought things will go back to normal. I was wrong again. New people and new environment makes me even more uncomfortable, I still stare at the monitor and couldn't do any work. At this rate, I don't think I can even pass probation.

Lately I started feeling very reluctant to go to work in the morning. I feel that I can't do anything, I can only study and get good grades. I feel like going back to my parents' house and stay in bed all day. I'm still working, but I'm scared that I will eventually become a shut in.

I'm at a 2XL, and it seems like a lot of shirts are getting tight around the belly. In my own personal opinion, I'm not like, HUGE, I'm just kind of big, and most of the proportion goes to my belly and thighs. Whenever I buy button-ups in my size, the stomach just bulges out. Seldom have I experienced a button-up that I can actually button up over my stomach, even if it's sizes bigger (if it is and it fits, it looks totally weird and it's most always too big). I wear some T-shirts from the graphic tee parts of stores, and those seem to fit better than name brand clothing. Same with pocket tees and whatnot.

Is there any hope of me wearing clothes during this whole process or am I just going to have to go naked until I get slimmer? I have like, maybe 13 shirts over all, 7 of them being t-shirts, and 6 of them being button-up (only as an overshirt). I have more, but they don't fit at all.

I feel as if he is attracted to me as he will go through my profile and like old pictures I've posted of myself, randomly. 

I'm kind of nervous, and I don't want to come off as desperate. I know he's interested in a lot of the music I'm interested in too, and he's very outgoing.

I'm very confident in myself, and in my looks, I had previously been in modelling and I'm quite fit.

I'm extroverted as well, and I think part of the reason we may have not spoken to each other very much is because I had been really close friends with a guy he knew and I feel as if it seemed like we were together?
