However even with such bad results i still managed to get into an ""okay"" university(ranked 40th) studying Commercial law. The law field in the United kingdom is already competitive and most large and mid tier firms employ graduates from Russel group universities (top 20 unis). So if i do continue on this path it is extremely difficult for me to get into such firms. If i repeated my final year secondary school and attained the necessary grades at i would be able to get into these universities however is this worth it? should i just continue at my current university. I can also choose to deffer from the university, by doing this the university would hold my existing place until august 2018 while i repeat my final year of secondary school",18Sep2017,1
1,"I moved to a new city last year to be with a long-term bf. This relationship soured very quickly and we broke up early this year. 

I have not made many friends since I moved here, plus I mostly wanted to deal with/reflect on my feelings after the breakup. These days I'm trying to make new friends and just meet new people. I'm very much a bookish introvert. I'm good at small talk but I don't find it fulfilling and prefer much deeper conversations.

2 months ago, I was working on something at a coffee shop and a guy started a conversation with me. We seemed to have very similar interests (and this was very rare) and he had good advice about a project I was working on. We traded numbers so we could catch up some other time and he went back to doing his work and I went back to doing mine. 

10 minutes later I met some acquaintances at this same coffee shop, got preoccupied, and left to do some other things with them. Wanted to say bye but felt awkward.

I thought the guy I talked to was really interesting and intellectually brilliant. I'd like to meet him again for coffee but for some reason didn't want to text him sooner and he didn't text me either. I guess I just assumed that I didn't want to date anyone while I still had emotional baggage from a breakup but I did want a new friend in this city. I was reminded of him when I heard someone talk about a certain grad program a few days back and I remembered that he goes there.

Would it just look stupid to text him and say hi after all this time?

7,"Hi!

I recently have been getting pretty mad at myself and finally found some discipline to get my life together. I let a lot of things slip this year after graduating college-gained weight, dead end job, no friends, dating went nowhere, etc. 

So I'm curious for some simple and effective advice to help me along in getting my life more together. I am a 23 year old female, living at home working retail about ~25 hours a week. I've recently started applying and interviewing for real jobs, which is always good. I am also considering going back to school, but I keep getting indecisive and I cannot seem to find the right thing I should be doing. 
 
I really want to move out of my house but I don't have a lot of money saved. I'm just having a hard time with feeling alone and not really having a support system, so I can be really tough on myself. 

TLDR; I'm going through the time in my early twenties of figuring my life out, any advice or words of wisdoms would be very appreciated! ",18Sep2017,2
8,"Please help. I know it's long, but please read the whole thing before you judge. I need someone to hear me out.

I [17f] have 2 best friends at school, Dave [18m] and Jane [17f]. We are all very close. I've been friends with Dave for 6 years, Jane for 2. I've known Mark for 3, but we never really talked until recently. Me, Dave, and Jane were lucky enough to have the same free period this year. However, we also have the same free period as Mark [17m], which has caused problems for us.

Mark is extremely socially awkward. I can tell that he's a bit lonely. He has several friends, but they're lowerclassmen and don't have the same free period as him at all. Since he found out we share a free period he's been following us. He's desperate for friends and I feel sorry for him, but we're clearly not the friends for him. It's hard to be in the same room as him.

Mark inappropriately forces himself into conversations, even if the topic is serious, doesn't involve him in the slightest, or he has no idea what we're talking about. He uses a lot of cringey memes without knowing what they mean.

The other day I was talking to Dave (in a very low voice, almost a whisper) about problems in my home life, and how I escaped for the weekend to somewhere I've never been before. Mark blurts out, across the table, ""Oh yeah I've never been there either!""

A few weeks ago me, Jane, and Dave were watching a movie. We were mid-way through it when Mark walked in. Dave pulled Mark aside and extremely politely told him that we wanted to finish it, alone. Mark stormed out of the room shouting ""They don't like me! Jane doesn't like me, Dave doesn't like me, and OP doesn't like me! They hate me!"" I assumed that was the last time he would hang out with us but the next free period we had together, he was there.

Mark brings an ocarina to school and plays it extremely loudly around us, sometimes when we're talking. He's not supposed to do this at school, at all. When Dave asked him to stop the other day he said ""Sorry, I was just being musical.""

Later that same day he took out a football and began throwing it at random shit around the hallway (including glass windows), and nearly crashed into Jane's laptop screen. When I asked him to stop, he glared at me and kept doing it, until Jane, Dave, and another friend all told him to knock it off.

Ever since Mark has found out where we hang out for our free period, he's been trying to show up there every time, so we've been changing locations. If it's time or almost time for the free period to start, and Mark sees us walking in the hallway or something, he will literally follow us to where we're going, unless it's off campus.

For the last week's free periods we've been walking a mile in the hot sun to the city library just to avoid him. On Friday when we didn't go because we didn't feel like walking, Mark looked for and found us immediately. Dave told him ""We're kind of in the middle of something here, and there's no room at the table."" Mark replied with ""Yes there is"" and pulled up a chair from another room. Later he ""jokingly"" said he would tell the principal ""Mr. Principal, they're excluding me from activities.""
When we plan things to do together over the weekend, Mark tries to self-invite himself, however he gets shut down immediately.

I don't want to sound mean or be like the mean-high-school-girl stereotype, with my clique of bullies that doesn't let anyone join. But we have given him chances to hang out with us and me, Dave, and Jane all don't enjoy his company, especially me and Jane. He has also been somewhat hostile in trying to hang out with us, and has been pushing boundaries. He's been blatantly ignoring body language, social cues, and clear messages. None of us want to be mean by telling him to go away.

I feel sorry for Mark because of his lack of friends and social awkwardness. Please help. How do we get him to stop intruding us without being mean?

**TL;DR: Mark has been intruding on me and my friends and has been annoying by self-inserting into our conversations and activities. None of us enjoy being around him. He's been ignoring social cues and boundaries. He actively seeks us out and when we ask him to leave he reacts badly and continues to do it.**

16,"I am taking an extra year of high school and my last period class is philosophy. My mom told me that it might be a good idea to drop my last period class cause it's not that useful and so that I would not be stressed. I am sort of interested in this course. I thought about the pros and cons, and still I'm not sure. Here's what I came up with for pros of both:

Pros of not dropping- I'd learn something I'm interested in, I'd increase my english/writing skills, I might like the course.

Pros of dropping-I'd have more time for work from other courses, I could leave school earlier, I'd be less likely stressed, I'd have less homework, I'd have more time to finish that stupid manuscript that I've been working on for the past few years.

My main problem is that I'm a stressed individual and not good with choices. Choices usually stress me out. I don't know if I should drop it or not. I also have a dual credit(dual enrollment) once a week and I'd miss this class for it, which may cause me more stress. I don't want to choose something that brings regret, but I don't want to wonder if I chose that right decision.

I'd appreciate it if you could give me advice on how to better convince myself to choose one of them or if you could tell me which you would choose.

21,"Hi everyone! My husband and I are thinking about getting a puppy. The following is our facts:

-we have a 5year old dog and a 3 year old cat, they get along great. 
-we've been together for 10 years, married for 2, age 27. 
- Husband is in first year of tough law school program
-I'm in my first year of big girl job after finishing my masters. 
-space is not an issue
-thinking about getting a German Shorthair Pointer (high energy dog)
-no kids YET..

Background to the discussion:
We LOVE animals and have been wanting to get one for the past few months. I prefer adopting, he prefers going through breeders so we've come to the agreement that we would adopt/shop for every other dog in our lives. We adopted our current dog at the age of 3 and she was already trained. She's a 70lb Viszla mix who gets along great with my cat that I had a year before we moved in together. 
We are both starting to get baby fever but decided that we should wait until he's at least in his second year of law school so that he could get acclimated to the program. 
We'd like to get one now because:
-it can pick up traits from our current dog
-have it at least a year old and trained before we bring a baby into the home
-because we we really really want one (who doesn't want a puppy?)

We're afraid that if we don't pull the trigger now that we won't be able to for the next few years because of our future kids.

Cons: this is our last bit of freedom before kids and are we ruining our last chances to travel or be out however late we want to be? Will it be too time consuming for me or him since this is our first year of new things? Neither of our parents want us to get another because they think it'll be too chaotic and we would probably not have outside help (but we are very responsible)

I don't know guys what do you think?? We need an outside and unbiased opinion! 
Thanks! 

tl;dr: should we get a second puppy and lose out on our last chance of freedom before kids? ",18Sep2017,4

I noticed that even though the first run on that box failed, they still used it for the second run. If he believed that there was an issue with the box itself they wouldn't have used that box, and set up the other instead. 

I texted a different coworker who was there when this happened, and he explained that there was a connection that was loose, so they just figured it leaked from there, and that was it. No mention of this in the note which insinuates an issue with the box itself, and not the setup. If it was a loose connection then that would be my bad, as I setup the box for that day.

I am considerate to live with, pay my own bills, rent etc and generally have become the opposite of the brat I was. People I knew since childhood have seen that I have changed and now no longer critisize me except for my older brother.

For example someone drank his drink in the fridge, he comes to my room, asks me if I drank it, when I say no he then gives me a 5 minute lecture on how he has to ask because I did this all the time when I was a kid. He talks to me in a way where he overexplains to me and talks to me in a very condescending way and brings up examples from when I was a kid 8 years ago to emphasize his point. He also picks on my life choices, my choice to go to university and travel overseas etc even though I pay for these things myself.

39,"To refer back to the title... I'm talking about my best friend. Yes, one of the special person in your life. 

A few months ago, I have been observing my best friend and I noticed her attitude has changed... She flirts with guys alot and she even left me alone in the cafeteria just to talk to a guy she has been admiring. All day at school, she rants about our friends.... Alot ..... She kept on complaining about them over little things they did to her. 

She used to be so friendly and kind... But now, she changed... And it's not in a good way. 

One time, I had a crush on this guy at school. She begged me to tell her who it was, and so I did. And a few weeks after, I found out that she was very close to my crush. As in, in a relationship. She flirts with my crush, and the worse thing is she knew that he was my crush. 

She kept on giving him candies and behaved like a cute child around him. I was mad at her and I was hoping her to at least apologize. I waited and waited. 

But she didn't do it. 

One day at school, she got into a fight with a friend of ours. And it was my best friend's fault. So i told her to say sorry. And instead of apologizing, she said ""why should i apologize? Saying sorry is for the weak, only weak people apologize,"" 

I know what you're thinking... Wow right? It was so rude of her to say that. 

And if i didn't go to school, i would always inform her. One day, I had a soar throat and kept on vomiting from time to time. So i texted her to tell her that i'am not going to school because of those reasons. In reply she said ""noooo!!!! You better come to school!!! Who am I suppose to hang out with?! If you don't come,  our friendship will be broken!""


Excuse me? I'am dying over here and you wanted me to come to school in the situation i'm in? 

It's true. I was the only friend she has. She used to have so many friends but because of her attitude. Non could handle it and one by one started to leave her. And also because she backstabbed them for most of the time. 

Soooo... talk about the present. I have been elected by the teachers to be the school photographer and video taking, the teachers asked me to at least have a friend to accompany with. And my 'best friend' wanted to join. 

And to be straight here, she has no skill in photography at all! The video she took was not even focused and it was shaking. The pictures were not clear. She could ruin my title as the school photographer because these pictures will be print on the school magazine!

At my job a management position was opening up so my boss held open interviews. I interviewed and another candidate interviewed.
I have 5 years of various management experience and received the complete support of 2 shift supervisors and approval from the other 2.

The other candidate has no management experience and has only been at the job a month or two longer than I. They received support from another employee whom we'll call (E). E used to be a store manager but demoted themselves to focus on some home life. Technically they know the role but are no longer officially a manager.

We were told we both did well but our boss wanted to have us become a bit more comfortable with the tasks and operations and as such offered E the position without and interview.

I was just now informed today that instead of just promoting E back into management that the other Candidate would also be promoted.

My view is that E is suited for the job but has an ultra limited availability. And the other candidate isn't mature enough for the role. I've seen him work well but I have also seen him get off task and consistently be told to return to task.

Here's the tricky business myself and every other shift leader have witnessed evidence that suggests E and the other candidate are in a secret relationship. Things like taking break together in one of their cars, arriving and leaving together, staying later, or coming up on off days to see each other, touching chest and waist, constant flirting, etc.
I understand this could be a misunderstanding but literally everyone thinks this is happening but I've seen no irrefutable evidence.

49,"I'm attending university, I'm in my first semester taking prerequisites for computer science. I sorta like it, it's ok I guess, (at least I'm good at it) however I have a part time job as a bar back at a sports bar and a casual job as a banquet bartender. I've been working those for about a year now and really enjoy it, I'm a night owl so the late nights and sleeping-in really work for me.

I want to bartend full time while making music on the side. (I'm comfortable living a modest life) Should I tell my parents I don't want a university degree I won't end up using and save them money but disappoint/crush them or should I get my degree just in case but ultimately waste my time, effort, and their money if things go the way I plan? (I'm 19 if that makes any difference)

TLDR; skip uni for average life I'll enjoy but disappoint parents or finish uni and end up using degree as last resort

The more I reread this the more I think the choice is obvious I'm probably only here 'cause I'm too scared to tell them or I subconsciously want some validation/support

Edit: Thanks for all the advice I truly appreciate it. I think for now I'll stay in uni and try balancing school, work, and hobbies the best I can!",18Sep2017,7
50,"(Background: 17 years old, senior in high school, American, male)

I'm a very obsessive person.  When I put my mind to something, it absorbs me entirely.  It's all I want to talk about.  I find that unrelated
conversations essentially consist of me politely toying with people in a tongue-in-cheek version of small talk.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not being
condescending, and I'm not so severely introverted that I avoid speaking.  On the contrary, I quite like socializing.  However, after a while, I just
slip into technobabble, then stop when I realize everyone else's boredom.  Nobody gives a damn about quantum computing, AI, math, or any of my
personal interests, really.  I know that, and the last thing I want to do is bore people.


However, my obscure interests essentially reduce my social existence to a superficial series of friendly acquaintances.  I'm certainly not my best
friend's best friend, nor can I say that I'm very personal around him.  This friend and I have equally obscure, though completely different interests,
and we're united by the fact that nobody gives a shit about anything we want to talk about.  He's not quite as obsessive as me, but he is considerably
less socially inclined.  To everyone else, I'm that rather whimsical guy who's good for a laugh and/or helping with homework.  In fact, I would say
that I intentionally keep people at arm's length to avoid presenting myself with the temptation to bore them to tears with deeper topics.


I spend a lot of time alone outside of school.  I don't have anyone to talk to about personal matters, so I'm often left to deal with internal
struggles on my own, or (sometimes) on the Internet.  I've tried opening up to people, but nothing comes of it.  I know this is unhealthy, for me,
especially.  I often get into recursive thought-processes, and become 'stuck' on things.  For instance, I periodically 'get stuck' on the subject of
romance, and what it means for me, which was the stimulus for this post.


What can romance mean for me?  I don't feel as though I'm capable of connecting with people on a purely personal level.  I am heterosexual, that much
I know, but I have difficulty distinguishing any particular women of interest to me.  Starting from childhood, with my Thomas the Tank Engine train
tracks, I've always wanted to work with someone on a project.  I want to be with someone who has a burning curiosity for the same subjects I enjoy.
My ideal relationship would consist largely of brainstorming together, trying to combine our bodies of knowledge, thoroughly understanding each
other's similarities and differences, and using them to cover more intellectual ground.  Connection on a personal level would factor-in, too, in that
we would understand each other's goals for the future, and help each other in day-to-day 'mundane' struggles.


Unfortunately, from what I've seen, nobody else has the same idea.  Every time I try to talk to anyone, man or woman, about something close to my
heart, they make it clear that they neither understand nor want to understand what I'm saying.  In their mind, my personal interests are essentially
'homework'.  My research stays in my mind, and I stay alone.  I have so many surface-level acquaintances, I feel as if I'm dying of thirst in the
middle of the ocean.


Sometimes, I just want to bite the bullet and start dating.  Sometimes, I say ""Screw it, I'll just talk.  Who cares if anyone listens?""  But I always
hold back, because I know that what I'm about to do will involve rubbing my so-called 'intelligence' in their faces.  I know that anyone I date will
eventually get tired of not understanding anything I do or say.  Any friend I have will see my interests as even more arcane, alienating them further.
Romance will devolve into ""That's nice, dear"".  They try to tell me I'm smart, that I'm somehow better than they are, that everything is easier for
me, that they simply aren't capable of understanding.  I don't believe that for a second.  When it comes down to it, the hard truth is that whatever
excites me bores them to tears, and there's nothing more to it than that.  If they cared, they could learn what I have learned.  They just don't want
to.  They haven't done anything wrong, nor have I, it's just the way things are.


Despite this, I can't help but keep asking if my situation is as hopeless as it seems.  Am I missing something?  Does everyone feel like this?  Will
it end in college?


Despite having no particular woman in mind, I still want to make someone happy.  I want to be there for them.  I want to hug someone.  I want to know
our minds are inextricably stuck together.  I want to be able to discuss our innermost thoughts.  Hell, if technology allows it someday, I'd want to
us to be hooked together telepathically, merging our minds so that we can't tell where one of us ends and the other begins.


But, then again, that will not happen for a long time, an eternity of searching, and I might not even like what I find at the end of it all.  Is it
even worth it to look?  Should I just compromise and accept that I'll always be vaguely aloof in all of my relationships?  That doesn't seem like a
nice way to live.


I suppose I should just suck it up and keep buggering on.",18Sep2017,3

54,"As the title said, I was given the option of moving into my grandparents home and am feeling very conflicted about it. Rationally, moving in with them is one of the best possible things I could do right now.

Here are the basic points:

1. No rent or other household related payments. They are asking me to assist them with items around the house (taking care of cleaning/the yard/snow) while I work and work on going back to school for my M.A. This would save me about $1,000 dollars a month, which I can put towards savings and debt. Done correctly, I'll be debt free within a year. They've also offered to assist financially on my M.A., regardless of if I move in. Currently, I'm living VERY tightly, paycheck to paycheck, but am at least stable. Conditionally, if I stay there long enough and with some discussion, there would be some extremely generous financial/possession benefits. 

2. I've been thinking about leaving my job, for a multitude of irrelevant reasons. Nothing is lined up, so I was planning on going to a temp agency and tighten up my purse strings even more. Leaving behind the financial responsibility of living alone would be a huge asset. 

3. I'm terrified of giving up my independence. I worked extremely hard to get where I am, and absolutely adore my apartment. It's perfect - it's home, it's me. The location, parking, space, building, everything is perfect. I can bring partners and friends home, I have control of it, and these things wouldn't be an option there. 

4. There isn't the option of redecorating to bring my furniture or, really, the majority of my things with me. My possessions are incredibly important to me, and the feeling of not having my space is terrifying. 

5. They will not allow my two ball pythons, crested gecko, or madagascar hissing roaches to move in. I have friends that are willing to house them for me as long as need be, but they're my babies. I invested a huge amount into them and spend the majority of my free time with them. My grandparents don't have an issue with my cat or bird (a cockatiel) coming with. 

6. Having more financial freedom would mean the ability to actually experience some things I've been missing out on with friends. 

7. I'd be moving out of the city, my preferred environment, to the suburbs. It's not that far out, and it's not a limiting distance from the city, but it adds significant distance to getting to my friends, partner, and normal activities. 

8. I've lived with them before, for decent stints, up to a year. Living there has been fine, but it certainly is stifling, and my grandmother is fairly overbearing. I can see myself being exasperated quickly. 

9. It really comes down to the fact that I have a great amount of pride in my space, and being without it scares me, even with all the benefits that giving it up would bring. There's also the fact that once I give it up, it's gone (the specific apartment).

10. Both of them have declining health, but my grandfather more so. Moving in could mean signing myself up for a decade plus of expected care. 

Right now, my thoughts are to quit my job, try the temp agency, and see how it goes financially. If it's a bigger struggle then I was expecting, I put in my notice and move in. Or I just move-in and deal with it. I'm just torn. Advice? ",18Sep2017,5

Please call me the unusually spelled real nickname. I get the hint. I go there and bamm it is her. Real her! Her college name, her friends, a sister, brother, and bunch of other things. 
I am thinking. This girl is stupid? I could blow her up! We keep talking. I am now getting what i paid for at the famous site for free! Woohoo! She no longer is camming because it wasn't enjoyable to her!

She doesn't ask for money (she never has), but can't come up with the money for the trip. She wants me to go to her town, and a different country!? What to do? 
I have considered I could go(and wake up in tub of ice with a missing kidney! haha), shutting down the apps, and walking (she is saving me lots of money.

I've been trying to get involved in after school stuff but I don't like joining groups in which I know no one, it just feels awkward to me. But I'm trying and hopefully it helps (though I doubt it). And then I don't really have that many interests so I don't even know if I want to join many of these clubs.

Outside of my dorm I try to talk to people and stuff. Honestly, sometimes I have pretty cool conversations. But it hasn't resulted in anything. I've made like 2 or 3 friends through classes and that's it. And only one of them I actually talk to outside of class.

Also, every weekend is so boring since I don't know anyone who's doing anything. I try and go out, but do what? No one that I know (which is already a small group) want to do shit or know anything going on.

And then there's this constant weight in my chest where I've never been in a romantic relationship my entire life. Like, in all my 18 years of life I've never even held hands with a girl! It always makes me feel so pathetic, like no one could ever actually be attracted to me... So whenever I see someone who I'm into I just get really nervous and awkward.

67,"I live in the U.S., I speak English, whole family does as well. 
I took 5 years of Spanish around a decade ago in school, I liked it and had a very strong understanding. Didn't have any way to use it after school, of course fell very far out of practice. 
For the last few years I have wanted to start speaking it again and become comfortable engaging with people in Spanish. Professionally I have an opportunity to help the growing Hispanic population in my small-town rural area, many of whom speak no English or limited English. 
The event that got the ball rolling was the placement of our first foster child earlier this year, a 4 year old who spoke no English. He was able to be reunited with his family, so we only had 2 months with him which brought a lot of Spanish back to the surface for me. Our second placement is a beautiful baby girl who came straight to our house from the hospital. It seems likely that we will be able to adopt her at the end of this year or beginning of next. She, much to her bio mother's ""surprise"" has a Hispanic father. No one knows who, mom won't admit who, and frankly for us it's better not to know. 
So... we have no other children right now. The baby is 3 months old. She is very healthy is and developing very well. Her bio mother admits to (a currently undefined amount of) prenatal drug use, although mom and baby were clean at birth. Because of that drug use there's already a risk of learning issues later in life and it makes me nervous to add extra layers of complication.... but I know it'll be easier for her to learn now than it ever will be in the future. I can't waste this opportunity for her and myself. 
Although I have a very caring and supportive family, no one in my life at this time speaks Spanish. I would want to raise my child this way whether it was a foster child or a bio child. 
I guess what it boils down to for me is that I know what I need to do... (TV, music &amp; reading Spanish... involve myself in the local community somehow and make some Spanish speaking friends...and we would be using the - one parent, one language technique) But I feel a little odd not truly having a family culture to attach the language to. And not knowing who the baby's bio father is means I don't know what culture would truly be hers if she was with him. I know this is the point where we just start anew and use the culture that we have and integrate...

73,"To keep things short, I share a small circle of friends with a girl, and I have noticed she acts slightly differently toward me as to the other people in the group. I'm not sure if I should take these as signs of interest or not.

For starters, I should mention that she has very quickly become one of my best friends. Last semester was when we first got to know each other, and she actually seemed pretty forward about becoming closer friends; she jumped at the opportunity to recommend we hang out over the summer (which we ended up doing multiple times), for instance.

Now this semester has started and I can't help but notice the slight nuances in how she behaves around me. These aren't super on-the-nose, and thus I think I might be reading too deep into them. For instance, it seems when having a group conversation, she maintains eye contact with me _significantly_ more than other members of the group. While speaking, she will hold eye contact me for longer than anyone else, only occasionally breaking it for short periods of time before returning to looking at me. And I do mean significantly longer - sometimes up to what feels like over 5 seconds. Maybe that doesn't seem like a lot, but I've noticed she and I maintain eye contact for far longer stretches than I have with anybody else, really.

Further, she seems to always look my way when something funny, interesting, etc happens. For example, without going into too much detail, we were all posting stupid humor in a group chat while in the same room, and every time she would post something she immediately looked at me with a big grin on her face.

Under normal circumstances I would just assume I was her closest friend in the group (which would be great!), but the other members of this circle have known her for longer, and one of them is very obviously her best friend (her roommate - they are extremely close). They are all very close. It seems unlikely that she considers me her closest friend in the group, so I can't help but wonder if perhaps her behavior toward me comes from an inherit interest in me.

I must confess I've become extremely interested in her, so its very possible I am reading too deep into her actions, but I can't help but wonder. At this point, I have pretty much decided that I will have to ask her out at some point either way - but it would be nice to know what others think her actions imply.",18Sep2017,1
74,"Hi, I'm currently a college sophomore at a very rigorous university. The workload is pretty rough, but I've been able to maintain a high GPA and academics were always my strong suit anyway. I'm mostly depressed because of a lack of confidence, which I attribute to two reasons:

1) I don't have a core friend group like I did in high school. Didn't try and make friends at the beginning of last year and took academics way too seriously. My college is famous for being a social school, but I feel that now that I'm a sophomore, people aren't really trying to be friends with me.

2) I am a very sensitive guy who grew up having a very strong relationship with my mother and sister. This leads me to think having a girl in my life would make me much happier. However, I've always been slightly overweight and untoned, which further ruins my confidence. I've only ever hooked up with one girl before, and I just don't know how this all works. Fwiw, many of my closest friends in high school were girls since I truly think I am more compatible with them, but I have basically no female friends at college. Realistically, I know my weight and my low self-esteem is holding me back, both things that are incredibly unsexy and fixable. I am realistically an attractive guy (I mean my parents were beautiful).

In high school, I never really thought about social stuff. My friends were basically handed to me and formed an incredible group, and I was too busy trying to get into a good school to care about making new friends or finding a girlfriend.

I've started using hard drugs by myself, feel like I'm developing alcoholism, and think that I'm also developing social anxiety disorder (it physically makes me uncomfortable to leave my room now and walk alone). I don't know where it all went wrong; I was so happy and successful and well-liked in high school and everything has been a worst-case scenario, and I can already feel myself not caring about living anymore.

I want a fresh start. I've had a really rough couple of years and I just want to be with my mom for a while, so I'm kind of thinking about trying to head out there around February. 

My landlords are super cool and I think they'd understand why I'd want to cut my lease short by 6 months. The roommates are all on month-to-month so I can shoot them 30day notices whenever I need to. 

I've been in a relationship for 7 months but my heart's just not fully in it. I care about him, he's my best friend, and I know he loves me. But the relationship is stagnant and we're two different people. Without me, he won't have transportation or a place to live, and he's horrible with money. 

How do I go about starting my life over? What do I need to know in terms of preparation? My boyfriend says he'll figure out what he needs to do, but I feel like he won't and I'm afraid for him. How do I detach from my feelings?",18Sep2017,1
78,"I'm 18 and I recently started attending a local community college after graduating from high school. I'm about 2 weeks in. However, ever since I've started, I've been feeling very uneasy about the whole thing. First off, I don't enjoy being there one bit. Classes are very boring, and I feel out of place in general. Secondly, I've heard lots and lots of people saying that the debt accumulated from college is just not worth it (and with my plan I would eventually transfer to a 4 year). Is it really possible for me to eventually become self sustaining in some years without getting a college degree? What should I do if I did decide on dropping out? What would be my best course of action?",18Sep2017,5
79,"I unexpectedly got kicked out of the last place I was living in late August. Since then I've been either sleeping in my car or spending the night at a random friend's house. I also stayed in a homeless shelter (the floor in a church) 4 nights but I can't go there anymore because I work nights at my new job and the shelter doesn't accept people after 10. I've looked into other shelters but most of them are more ""inner city"" and honestly scare the shit out of me. I'd rather sleep in my tiny car. 

I'm 90% sure I have a room to rent starting October for only $500/month as long as the chick doesn't bail on me. 

Until then I really don't know what to do. I am sitting here typing this on my phone exhausted but have nowhere to go sleep. I don't know what to do. Can anyone give me some advice?

I have a sleeping bag and pillow that I could set up outside somewhere but I don't know where I would do that honestly. I sleep better on the ground than in my car for sure but it just seems risky.

I have a bit of money saved up but I really can't be spending it on motels or airbnbs. I don't have too many friends or family members and none of them will take me in. Trust me I've already tried. 

Anyone have some clever ideas to make the next couple weeks of my life less miserable?

81,"Hi all! Need your bits of wisdom. 

My friend is 17, just had her first kiss with a boy this month and she calls me in excitement, telling me that she is in love, and they have decided to wait with the you-know-what until they marry, which will be next winter. 

Her parents don't know she's dating. 

I want to find this boy and slap him upside the head. This idiot is her age, a boy, and he's talking to her about making babies....!!

Someone please tell me if I am overreacting or if I should be threatening everything he knows and loves if he tries to lay a hand in her, with the knowledge that my friend will be seriously angry with me when she finds out because she is in deep for him. 

If I am not overreacting, tips on how to freak the freaking life out of him would be much appreciated.

82,"The reason I'm typing this is because I wasn't able go to a memorial that was being held for my friend that passed away a month or so ago because she was having people over tonight... and she wanted me to make a cake when someone was already bringing one? Like what the f*ck, I'm more pissed that I just didn't go and come back afterwards, at least I would've had gone. I actually cried because I felt so bad I didn't go.

I'm 18, so still living with my parents, sure just to let y'all know. Doesn't mean my life revolves around her. Though I care extremely deeply for my family, they are the closest thing to me. And that's why it hurts me because seeing her being so dumb about certain things and just getting defensive about wrong things that are just plain fact is disappointing.

Everyday seems like a new day. It's almost as if the day I sacrificed yesterday had disappeared and it's time to spend the entire day with mommy again.

I'm almost at a point of just giving up and just being fairly silent and unresponsive around her, just at a point where I'm sorta done. Like she just won't listen to logic or reason. It's as if she was retarded, but sometimes you'd think there was a functioning human brain in there. (That was a bit much, but she's oblivious to pretty much everything at this point)

I don't want to say she's a Narcissist or I was raised by one. She's the ""depressive"" type (Not really, she's just the type to complain about unimportant things), but she can be extremely selfish a lot of the time. But you wanna know how often she repeats ""We're nice people"" ""We're nice, we couldn't do something like that"" etc. etc.

Literally too many times per day to tell you, that's how many. I don't understand why she can't just shut the f*ck up about being nice when she clearly isn't sometimes, and every single time I tell her straight up that she really isn't the angel she thinks, she just says no and continues.

The day to day thing that I started this post for is that every single time she would need to leave the house (Store, or just literally anything) she asks me to go with her. Sure, not too bad on paper. Unless she asked every single time, and even if you said No, she'd make it seem like she forgot legit 15 times and would pretty much just keep asking throughout the day until she leaves without me and I feel like a d*ck (Because I know she's dumb enough to just think about me saying no, not her forcing the sh*t out of it on me) or I go with her after a million questions because f*ck it this is too much so might as well get it over with.

This is long. But it's difficult for me to put into words. I mean everyone's mom is different and I'm just trying to get most of the details in and straight.

87,"I'm currently a senior. I'm a female high school student with severe anxiety disorder, body image issues, and ADHD. I know this seems like a joke or call for attention, but please here me out, ask me anything, or give me advice. :)

I am naturally a good test taker and thanks to having been diagnosed with ADHD at an early age and medication, I have been able to succeed with 5s in numerous AP tests and achieve near 1600 on standardized tests. I've been nationally recognized for performance in academics as well as community service.

However, I hate school more than anything. It is so restricting and is the boundary between myself and everything I aim to be. Schoolwork, deadlines, and rote memorization seriously triggers suicidal thoughts and self harm for me. After going to school, all I want to do is go to sleep due to the mental exhaustion, or at least edit Youtube videos, do neuroscience research, create perfumes, practice singing, etc. etc. but NO. I've got to create notes, analyze history (read: memorize facts and dates which takes me hours to do), etc. etc. 

I am still receiving stellar grades, but in order to do so, the effort and emotional strain I must exert is absolutely strenuous. I am absolutely catatonic and lost, and just thinking of school makes me feel like I've just ran a marathon across Death Valley. 

Even though my parents are very ambitious, they were the first to mention that I should drop out of high school. They said they believed that this path wasn't right for me, at least atm, due to my poor mental health. I was initially upset, but I see where they're coming from. I'm just too much of a coward to be perceived as a ""high school dropout."" I'll feel like a waste of potential.

But what does potential and success even mean? Suffering through school, gaining admission into an Ivy League, then committing suicide on your first day there? At the very least, I aim to take a medical leave of absence or gap year (I've satisfied all my HS requirements I believe) then apply to college.

I get that going to school will bring me closer towards a place I aim to be (I aim to be a psychology researcher or perfumer) but the current steps to achieve that are so agonizing that I am doubting if this path is even right for me.",18Sep2017,1
88,"This is going to be a compounded post as I'm looking for advice on many different topics. I'm also fairly new to reddit so I'm working on learning how it works. So here's the story.....

I've had a friend for awhile now that I have been attracted to. We've connected on so many levels, but anytime I brought up the topic of maybe something more it was dismissed as he had other relationships going on. (I don't mean multiple at once, just multiple spanning the duration of our friendship). The other night we are sitting watching television together and he asks me if I want to fool around. (He is single at this point) Normally I would jump at this 
opportunity but I decline. There was a part of me that thought about the reality of this and how this could ruin our friendship that made me hesitate. So here are the questions I'm looking for advice on. 

1. Is it possible to be too far in the friend zone to start something new?

2. Is it normal to have insecurities about being that vulnerable with a friend?

3. Is there a way to go back to being friends after crossing this line?

103,"First off, the big one, I used to live in a rural town that was quiet and I knew every road and everybody in it. I enjoyed it. I fantasized about city life and good internet so I figured when I grew up some I'd move to a big city to check it out, however I became homeless at 15 for a short stint, ended up in the hospital during that short stint, became SUPER depressed from the whole ordeal, and ended up gliding through high school. 

I graduated with a 2.8 or 2.9 which isn't bad but you don't get scholarships with that. I just wrote it off like I was gonna join the army anyways but my body just fucking REFUSES to loose the last 20lbs needed for me to join no matter what I did (and I was borderline fasting at one point). So yay I lost 40lbs but boo I didn't loose the necessary 60lbs to sign my life away. 

Well, senior year I moved in with my grandparents because my family moved to Tennessee and I spent my entire life in 1 school system. Well, turns out I'm not nearly as popular as I thought I was. My 2 good friends joined the Army and never have time for me, and nobody speaks to me, at all, save for this 17 year old girl 1000s of miles away but that's nothing serious. 

On top of that I am unmedicated adhd (HOPING THIS CHANGES SOON) and have developed severe depression (I honestly think it's BPD) and the EXTREME isolation I live in is KILLING ME. 

Yeah once I graduated the next day I was moved to Tennessee. I have a car, but I literally cannot get a job (or my license) because of all the corruption and since I'm a ""No good Yankee with all his teeth"" as soon as I get a job I'm either robbed, abused, or cussed at until fired.

Do I go into massive debt and go into law school?

109,"I’m a 20-something woman living at home with my mother, while working a fulltime job. And yes I do pay rent; $500 a month. I had trouble finding work immediately after graduating, but managed to get my foot in the door with a seasonal federal job. I have roughly $5,000 saved up. Also, I’ve tasted sweet, sweet health insurance for the first time and have since been able to get a few health issues under control.

This is where my mother comes into the picture. She went from “you need to go to college no matter what” to “I sacrificed for you to go to college!” It’s true that she put a roof over my head and food in my stomach, but I didn’t walk away without student loans. Luckily, I found out while in school that I could finish my junior and senior years for almost nothing because my dad was in the Marines. To paint y’all a picture of my mother, she owns her own cleaning business and has a history of making awful financial decisions, like quitting a state job to work at a family restaurant that failed after 5 years. She’s behind on her taxes as far as 2013 and doesn’t have a set salary, so she uses the business’ money to live off of. She has no retirement and a habit of charging everything even if she can’t afford it. A friend and I offered to do her taxes, so we’ve seen how much she made when first starting out; she should be golden but blames not having any money on some debt she fell into after the second time she picked up to work with family. She always frames it as “I’m in debt because I was supporting the two of us while you were in high school.” Nevermind the fact that she also made decent money there and refused to let me get a job while going to school because “the money would change me” and school was far more important.

Fast forward to my first paycheck. I had a shared account with my mother from when I was in college where she’d drop about $100 a month for whatever I may have needed while at school. This account is where I naively had my first couple of paychecks sent. It wasn’t until a few months that I sat down, did the math, and promptly lost my shit. She had taken out more of my own money than I had used myself; I was hurt, confused, and upset. While confronting her about this, she guilted me about having to support me and about how long it took me to find work. However, she did return some of the money, but not before telling me I was spending it too fast. My skin is fucked up and I bought a lot of Korean beauty products to try and salvage it, plus some make up (which was an entirely new experience for me). I guess she didn’t like that. I also bought new clothes because I only had two pairs of pants throughout college.

Here’s what I’m freaking out over. I would love to get the hell out, but again, my job is seasonal and could end at any moment. If I wasn’t paying rent, I’d have $7,000 saved up but my work history is too short to own anything like a house, not that I have enough saved up for a downpayment anyway. As it is, we’re only paying $300 in rent because a family member hooked us up until my mom got her house built on some land she’s paying for (about $900 a month); she has the hook up with contractors and everything so I believed her when she said it’d be built in no time. We were supposed to only be here for 6 months and it’s almost been a year. The house is still only cement piers.

What should I do? I’ve seen Grey Gardens and I refuse to let that be my life! Am I paying too much in rent? Should I ask her for my rent money back and run since it’s just sitting there in our shared account? Am I being stupid  because there’s no way I’d be able to pay as little as $500 a month in Austin without a dozen roommates? I’d rather live outside the city where it’s cheaper, but she’s still trying to discourage me. I honestly have no idea what to do and it’s driving me crazy. I’ve never been on my own before but I’m more than ready to leave.

117,"So about two years ago I fell into depression. By now I feel like I got it quite under control without big fall backs. Anyway I think this all ""started"" because I always felt lonely, and I still do that however. I also never had a girlfriend (I turned 20 this year) and kissed a girl for the fist time ever this summer at a festival when I was drunk and I dont even remember it. But I think thats also because I am quite picky I guess and I never really met someone who interested me in that way.  However that changed, I met a girl at a friend's party a week ago and I must say she was quite awesome, unlike any girl I've ever met before. But obviously she already has a boyfriend.  
Then there's the situation about my job. I cant continue to work where I'm working now because they dont offer full time jobs to apprentices after they finished their apprenticeship and I will leave by the end of the month. So now I have to search for a new job. And my dad is always pushing me to send out applications but so far I only got rejections.  
And yeah generally I feel like I'm doing shit at life compared to anyone I know. Now people are going to say ""you shouldnt compare yourself to others"" but it's really hard not to at this point, where everyone else's life seems to be going so well and I'm doing quite shitty.  
But anyway, so I'm searching for advice about these things:  
How should I deal with this situation with the girl? I've never been interested to anyone before and now the first time that happens, she already has a boyfriend.  
Then how should I go on about my job search? I dont really feel confident at the moment with everything going on at the moment I'm not sure if its a good idea to even try.  
Yea and the last point mentioned is probably a result of the other things so I dont know what else I should ask for, but I'm generally just thankful if anybody reads this and just tries to help me, I really appreciate it.  
Oh yea I almost forgot. Eventhough I dont think it will happen but I'm a bit afraid of falling back into depression with all of this happening. I'm just generally feeling sad and lonely at the moment, but I dont think it's depression again.",18Sep2017,1

She had switched schools because a lot of girls in my grade didn't like her due to her bullying them and playing the victim. I texted her again and asked her if I offended her and why she wasn't texting me back and that I missed her. I still got no response back. Finally through a mutual friend I learned she wanted to drop me because I was ""Offensive and too much to handle"". I basically texted her and confronted her for not having the guts to cut me off to my face or even send me a simple text and that we're 17 and she was acting like a child. She responded that us not being friends anymore didn't phase her at all and my school was full of ""weird ass misfits"" and she's glad she left. She then said I was offensive because I apparently made a joke of my sexuality (I'm bisexual and she often told me I was just pretending to be and it was offensive even though I've been sleeping with girls since 9th grade) and offended the community which I'm not even sure why she's saying this because she herself is straight. And there would be no benefit for me to pretend to be straight, many people around me aren't accepting and I was actually very scared to come out. She also told me I was a ""Fake"" anorexic who only cared about their looks (I go to therapy for ED treatment and Body dysmorphia treatment). I was so upset after this I changed a caption on an old Insta photo of us to ""fake bitch"" and it was stupid but at the time my anger got the best of me. The photo was so old and we never blocked each other after the incident, but I thought she'd never see it or if she ever saw it I thought she'd just get mad and get over it. Flash forward to a month later and I had moved on from the incident and worried more about taking care of my mom and her cancer and her now being at the hospital for 5 months and having to take care of my sister and write my college applications and take care of the house basically alone. She had seen my post apparently and posted on her personal Instagram a picture of an email she had sent to the Ivy League I'm applying to. I worked my ass off with my family situation taking all the AP courses, volunteering and doing as many extracurriculars as possible so I could attend an Ivy League and not have to pay for college due to the need based financials. My family is very poor and I can't afford college tuition. In the email she wrote that I was mentally unstable, aggressive, faked my sexuality and changed the caption on the old Insta photo of us. She submitted to them the screenshot along with my name and school and emailed it to the admissions office. She makes posts harassing other girls on her personal Instagram and calls them hookers and says they look botched. I'm honestly scared of her and the power she has over me just because I was stupid and changed an Instagram picture caption. Will an Ivy League college be concerned over this and is there anything I can do to get her to leave me alone? Thank you.

120,"Can you give me some perspective on a super tough career decision? I need some advice from those removed from the situation!

Currently i am in a long term temporary role where my contract renews year to year- have been here for 4 years. Love my school, my job and my kids- its a role with a fair bit of extra responsibility, has a lot of variety and is challenging (mostly in a good way). It has definitely expanded beyond a classroom teacher and i have built up a significant amount of goodwill with the principal and school community. I also only commute approx 20min to get to work.

I have been offered a permanent teaching role in my initial area of specialisation. Jobs in my area are notoriously difficult to find, and this one involves a 1 hour commute each way to a small country town. I would have the opportunity to build up the program from scratch as i would be the only teacher in my specialisation, and it is a nice small school with a great sense of community.

My current principal has said that my role at the moment will be advertised as permanent next month and i would have a strong chance to get it BUT this is no guarantee. Do i take the stability of a permanent position with a longer commute, or do i stay where i am in the hope that i become permanent in the future and retain the goodwill i have built up?

Help! I feel paralysed by this decision! Also important to note that i am female and would consider taking maternity leave in the next few years. While both positions offer this, i would only have a guaranteed position to return to as a permanent teacher.

Has anyone else been in this position? What would you do? What else should i consider?

Thanks!

124,"Hey reddit!
Before I address my problem, I feel like its important to understand who/what I am. I'm a Indian-American senior high-schooler in california. I've never had much experience with girls besides getting rejected, a professional relationship in my science programs, or just normal friendships. 

My Main Problem: 
One of the girls in one of my classes started hitting on me outta the blue. Its good to note that we've never talked to each other before however we do have mutual hate for her ex-boyfriend. I'm a pretty direct guy that doesn't like to play around the bush so I asked her what she got outta talking to me. She gave a response saying that she thought I was more interesting than other guys she talked to and she wanted to be friends, which I took as a formidable answer. 
   I've been talking to her a lot personally, but I make sure to respect her as always cause she seems pretty genuine. I've never been in a relationship but she seems like a lovable person. Should I pursue her or wait?",18Sep2017,8
126,"I just wrote this out but it was huge so I'll slim it down.

I spent 4 years smoking weed everyday and not doing anything, just sitting in my room and smoking, I'd only leave my room twice, once to play football and once to see a friend, that's it.

Fats forward to last year, throat is in bad shape so I quit, and I feel like I've spent 4 years in a daze and have finally woken up, and realized all my friend have gotten good Jobs and lives, degrees and houses and I haven't got anything.

I have spent the last 18 months desperately trying to give myself a foothold in life, I learnt coding, I got 2 jobs in the last 6 months but I'm stuck constantly thinking of how to better it, so when I code I think I want to learn harder code to make more money, when I'm working I am immediately looking for a better job.

The truth is I guess I hate myself for not being where my friends are, not having the things I should at my age (23) and I'm now stuck in a cycle of do something, think of how I can do it quicker/more money, do that, try to better it again, become overwhelmed and end up not doing anything.

I can't let go of these feelings, because last time I stopped caring I spent 4 years smoking and not doing anything, im scared if I don't constantly try to better myself I'll do the same again, become 30 years old and realize I've got nothing going for me, I have the opportunity to start university next week, but I'm already thinking about whether I can learn it myself quicker and get a job quicker, I need to stop because I'll never end up doing anything and I'm torturing myself, I feel horrible most days.

Any advice/insight would be massively appreciated, I could use another perspective right now.

129,"I have a co-worker (girl), she join multi level marketing and it's a ridiculous sum in our country, if she get referral, she earn 10% only from $200 bucks / packet, that's the most cheapest package.

It's the third time I drive her to the destination, all my co-worker said don't spoil her, don't drive her, or she will keep asking me in the future, to be honest I feel shit when I think about it.

131,"RL;Dr: I don't feel ambitious or fervent in chasing my passion. I'm don't feel like I'm ever going to make anything or my life or be successful and I don't know how to fix it and improve.  

I know I'm young and I have my whole life ahead of me (I'm still a teenager for God's sake), but it feels as if everyone around me who's my age still has an idea of where they see themselves in the future, what they want as a career. 

I don't have that. I can't pin down where I want to be or what I want to be doing. I have interests and hobbies but one of them (writing) would be enough to support me by itself and the other (Art/Digital drawing) probably wouldn't either. 

I don't want to die one day in old age and have no-one remember me for anything significant. Except I'm not a determined person. It takes effort for me to keep in touch with friends I don't immediately associate with, and I'm not a people person to begin with. I've begun wishing I could just never speak again because I hate my voice (among other body image issues, but that's another tale). I have very small amounts of confidence, and if I display it I'm shot down for being a know-it-all. 

I feel disassociated from my emotions and myself. I look in the mirror and wonder 'who's that?' before I remember it's me, I don't like me. 

My family, even though I'm sure they mean well, are I think one of the main sources of stress. Everyone older is pressing me, asking me what I'm thinking of doing with my life and I only have one answer to give that isn't overly vague or based on my fervent interest in writing stories: I don't know. 

I have aspirations to be a fiction writer. That's something. But in spite of my love for it it doesn't feel like enough. They say 'work smarter, not harder' but I've slowly begun figuring out I'm not as smart as I thought I was. I'm of average intelligence, the opposite of what everyone around me has said. I seem to be the smartest in my family, but I'm not a genius. 

My brain has gotten slow and sluggish, I just want to put enough effort in to stay afloat. I was praised constantly in elementary school for being smart, and not I'm feeling like a damn big failure for not upholding that. 

I think this praise is also the reason for my defensiveness with others; I love a good sense of humour and I self-deprecate all the time but I can't seem to take criticism without getting angry. 

I feel stuck and bad for complaining like this, but I'm at a loss. What should I do? ",18Sep2017,1

135,"I have a long history of mental health issues and suicidal thoughts and have been referred back to mental health services because they've started coming back after a period of being okay. I know the first thing they're going to say is that I should change my meds but I honestly don't think that's a good idea as I'm pretty sure I would go back to being as bad as I was in the past as soon as my medications started changing and that could end with me trying to kill myself very easily.

140,"Hi Reddit. So about over a year ago I left my first position for a new one. This one is a lot more project management type tasks. I thought I always wanted to be in a project management role, but there is too much micro managing for my liking. 

I run into one of my former managers who is still with my first department and say how much I miss the people. The work is always hectic, we both laugh, but I miss the people.


So last week I had a meeting with one of my former managers who told me, if I want to come back there is a spot for me, and a nice raise. 


It isn't just about money and both positions have pros and cons. 


My current role, I don't hate it but I do not like project management. I'd rather build and work towards solving a problem than to just keep track of time and on client calls all day. 


My former and possibly new role would be doing technical level support on the application. I would get to solve problems all day. Yes I do have to interact with clients but it is more controlled on this end. I have my time to send and check email. My current position is about staying on top of email, when it comes in, we have to act on it. My potential new role, I acknowledge the issue, set the time for response, work on it. 


Then there is my wife. I tell her about it. She at first sounds excited and wants to know the details. I tell her. And all I get back in return is ""well you're never going to be happy anywhere, so just go for the money"". 


I didn't think I was miserable, I know what I want to do and now with her saying that, I already feel like ""why bother with anything"". I don't know.

142,"Hello everyone, I cannot say my problem is the narcissistic behavior of my parent, even though my mother shows some narcissistic behaviors and myself too. I have a long story which I did not and could not tell anyone until I found about Reddit. My grandfather(father of my father) shows some ADHD or intellectual disability like behavior and is uneducated who lived in a small village his entire life like my grandmother(mother of my father). So my father has the symptoms which genetically reaches him and also extreme anxiety, and he is almost uneducated too. My mother is uneducated too. I have a young brother who is 8 years old and diagnosed with intellectual disability with severe ADHD and autism symptom like behavior. I extremely hate my father and at the same level have sympathy for him and like him. He has really annoying behaviors. Whenever he comes home, he would radiate some annoying and stressing waves with his bothering and stupid words. I understand him because somehow genetically I have the same problem as he has. It is a long daydream of mine that every time they(my entire family) would go to a trip they have an accident and killed. If one of them dies it would be more difficult because they live barely with the help of each other. My father won't go to a psychiatrist because he is afraid of anything, he has stress about anything( most of the time about traffic jam), he cannot fully understand how much it is hard to bear him. He likes me not so much just enough to not bother him financially or anything else. He raised me with his stress and parsimonious which caused me a great number of troubles like being always under my friend's expectation after helping me financially. I tolerated all of those, and now, after finishing my master of science in best university of my country I am trying to go to Germany for continuing my study as a Ph. D. . My mother recently starts to break because of all the pressure on her shoulder about my father annoying behavior and my brother mental illness, so I have a great guilty feeling about leaving them. I am sure that I will go because nothing is more important to me than science. Science and philosophy are the only saviors of mine. All the people that I know are bothered by my father's behavior, so they have almost no one to have fun with. I am definitely sure that my father's death is better for all the people around him than his alive and my mother agrees most of the time. The main problem is nobody can understand that he is strongly sick and everybody counts his behavior as someone healthy because he looks healthy, so the people around me would not believe me if I say these stories to them and they always would blame me because parents are some fucking sacred fruits of fucking heaven. When I was a child about 15 years old, I hated him to an extent that I would cover the corner of my eye to not see him, or I would wash my body if I touched him. I knew that I have some of his problems too, and because of that, I am extremely bothered with my behaviors which have a tiny smell of my father's behaviors even the good ones. If genetic science won't do anything to cure my father and brother and even me, I will suffer until their death. I hate myself and life when he helps me or shows some empathy for me. Thanks for reading this long story of mine. Just wanted to share some truth and helps human to battle these new tyrants and dictators of our modern world(parents, not the person but the person who positioned in the place) who are more dangerous than old dictators because you inherently have feeling guilty about them, and you think your debts to them because of their attempts to raise you is irrecoverable, even if all the philosophers say you don't owe them. And they will abuse us and use their social power against us. your weakness continues until the death of your parents and will continue with your new family( wife and children). Let's help human beings.
Please help me. Recently, I found out that I am a HSP (highly sensitive person), but it is not official and just through Youtube and some websites I found out that I have the same behavior as HSPs.
I am sure that I have some other mental problem because I get too nervous or furious for some really normal things.

144,"I've been in college for almost 5 years now. I would have graduated already, except my attendance has caused me to fail multiple classes. 

What's weird is I'm not afraid of the work... I'm actually very passionate about learning and I want to succeed. I've had multiple teachers get mad/frustrated at me because they say I'm one of the best in their class but I'm wasting my potential. (This sounds conceited, but I've had two teachers say this verbatim, I don't mean to sound conceited as it just makes me really sad to think about and frustrated.) I'm sure they think it's laziness but a lot of times I will wake up well before my class starts (8 am), get ready to go, then don't. 

But I want to go to class, it's just I just can't bring myself to do it, my anxiety is so high. What I'm worried about changes. Sometimes I just don't want my peers to see me because subconsciously I feel people hold a burning disgust towards me (based off no evidence). I'm worried I'll get nervous and say something stupid. I'm worried I annoy my teachers (I'm sure their life isn't changed either way). I'm also a semi-hypochondriac so I worry I'm too sick, or I will actually develop stomach pain as a result of intense anxiety (this seems to happen worse around ""important"" days which makes it harder). I never have this problem with lecture classrooms because I silently come in through the back and nobody knows my name. It's classes with 12 people or less where I seem to have the most trouble. 

I used to have this problem with work because my environment was very social, so I started my own business so I could avoid people and now I'm making more money than I ever have, but I still need to graduate from college lol. There's really no creative solution to nurture my hermit tendencies in this case. It's not the type of major where online classes are an option (trust me... I've taken all the ones where that's an option lol.)

There's nothing really that repulsive about me, I don't think, or like I don't seem to say or do things too out of the ordinary, idk maybe I do. Objectively I know it's all baseless fears. I seem to have a huge fear of the public in general, as strange as that sounds. It's not anyone's *particular* opinion or anything specifically about me that I think people will judge. I don't know what it is. I just hope someone who's had a similar feeling will read this and maybe they'll know what to do. 

""Go to class"" is the obvious answer but it doesn't really help much, because that's the objective, of course. It's how to curb my anxiety enough to go anyway that I can't see to figure out.

152,"None of this impacts my career fortunately which is as remote tech support. I work about 60 hours a week for two different companies doing the same job. 

It should be noted I don't have antisocial personality disorder, Asperger, or autism. I've been to two different therapists and neither could do much for me, and the first said I didn't fall into the category of the above disorders.

1. I don't do any illicit substance. 

Unless you count coffee. I find drinking in excess reprehensible and something that devalues you as a person. You would be shocked at how many people this puts me at odds with. I don't have any religious reason for this. I lose most the respect I have for a person if I find out they drink, and typically I actively avoid them given (even now at 33) they always push me when it comes to drinking. I don't know why anyone would want to waste their time. When I have drank to drunkenness (the all of like 2 times) other than feeling dizzy, and having shittier memory/reflexes, I didn't feel any different. Everyone just kept trying to get me to go out but given the shitty state of how I felt I just sat indoors and read. I was the same person I was before, and I really don't get it.

Now apply alcohol to all forms of substance abuse, only I've never done anything else. The number of people who have told me in life to 'live a little' and either drink/smoke pot/worse have all been really boring people, working a 9/5 where they don't make a whole lot, and then use that as an excuse to do nothing else with themselves like ""well I would [do something interesting] but I'm poor.""

2. Aggression

I get into 5 or 6 fist fights a year. I only start about 2 of those a year. I took martial arts for several years to try and curb my aggression and it did seem to work for a while, but otherwise has left me in a position where I just know how to seriously injure other people, and fighting just as much. Most of the fights I start are when someone is trying to argue with me about something I either didn't do, or don't care about, where they are trying to get their way. The other fights are when I refuse to back down and someone actively threatens me/yells at me I always yell back. 

This started in middle school when a kid started bullying me and I bashed him in the back of the head with a book as hard as I could. I got suspended despite being the one that didn't start it, just ended it. As an adult he would have been charged with assault, and I probably wouldn't have been hit with anything. After that day I put up with 0 shit from anyone.

My girlfriend rivals my aggression but since I've been with her we don't ever go out. Even less than I did before. I lived mostly as a shut in before and the 40 or so times a year I had to go out was when the fights were occurring.

3. Hobbies

I have 2 hobbies: Reading and video games. I don't play games online as I'm not the kind of person who likes hearing 14 year olds call everyone a faggot for 2 hours, or digging to find a game where my team mates are both competent AND willing to work together.

As for reading, discounting 25-50% of my reading being studying for my job, I mostly read philosophy/science and practice math. I do read other things (fantasy and such) but thats not even nearly 10% of what I read. I typically find characters hard to relate to. I read far more than I play video games. 

4. How I interact with people outside of work.

Me and my girlfriend are like clones of each other, so we never have conflict with each other.

At work I'm really nice, calm, and friendly because I'm being paid to be so. I report people who are excessively upset or angry, but this is rare as most people at both jobs are friendly with me. 

Outside of work I put up with 0 bullshit from anyone. Every restaurant I take any issue with I complain on. I have literal lists of businesses that I don't give my money when it comes to restaurants and chain stores (like wal-mart I mean come on if your revenue is more than a billion a year, you can afford some better staff and cleaning).

If someone starts any kind of shit with me, lies, or anything like that I will argue with them until they either change their mind/what they are saying, or I get into a fight with them. I imagine if I didn't live like a shut in I would be in fights twice a week, but there are whole months I don't leave my house and I wish I left the house less.

I've stopped speaking with most of my family. I'm not going to go over the list as to why exactly, but for my moms (entire) side it was because of substance abuse and how much they begged me for money (I make around 60k a year). And for people on my dads side it was everyone who acts high and mighty, but didn't do anything when he started doing drugs to get me and my sister away from him and all of the kids my age at the time who act like I should 'just forget it'. That leaves me with about 4 family members, dis-including my sisters kids. 

5. How often I leave:

I leave my house about 40 times per year, not including running 2 miles a day, or going to the gym 3 times a week. (I tally it, one year I left once a week which was horrible.) I don't have any kind of problems interacting with friendly, nice people. Its everyone else who I don't like. One year I stuck to a dedicated plan to reduce the 40 times per year to 20, but it worked out being more like 35 times a year due to happen stance. I only leave for groceries (12 times a year), and what I can't order off the internet to my house safely (expensive computer parts ect.) to my P.O. box (unknown times a year), and for work (6-10 times a year).

I find any social activity unbearable if other people are involved. To peoples surprise I actually have traveled, own my own house, and have a retirement plan. (I used to rock climb but that got to be to popular and now I can't go down to the gym for it, or the places for it in my area outside without seeing tons of people.)

And finally from my perspective why I'm like this:

I don't have time to argue with people about something they misunderstand anyway. If someone in public says ""Global warming is a lie"" and I correct them with evidence, all they do is spew emotion at me. Even my ex-friends. I've actually gotten into fist fights over it because the other person starts getting mad and yelling and I tell them they need to calm down which for whatever reason pisses them off more (I mean they are getting mad over talking about something like global warming!) I know why: Its because it breaks what is now called 'their world view.' This applies to everything I read/know about/have a degree in.

People constantly ruin the experience of everything for me, they are either pushy or rude. Movie theater being one example. Once I told a group of 20 year olds to be quite behind me and they just bitched at me. I got management and what did they do? NOTHING. The people kept being loud. I complained again and all they did was refund me for my ticket. I don't *want* another ticket. Me and the *entire* theater want to watch the movie in silence.

I can handle rude, but I can't handle pushy, if someone pushes me I push back twice as hard.

But what I can't stand most is when people talk like its intent that counts: ""Well I intended this."" I always reply with ""Why didn't you say that then?"" Or ""They had good intentions"" So? They are still horrible.

Any advice? I would like going out a bit more but is there any way I can avoid people while doing it?",18Sep2017,1
153,"I'm 16 y/o, and passed the [CHSPE](https://www.chspe.net) which allowed me to drop out of high school and go to community college, but I'm having second thoughts.

I love to draw and hope to do it someday as a concept artist, but then I learned more about other people who have tried that. Many of them end up not getting hired and are in debt for thousands after attending a private University with ridiculous tuition rates. I want to avoid that happening to me ahead of time by practicing my craft 6 hours a day and attending workshops, but I feel that college doesn't give me the time

I am currently in the middle of my Fall semester and am planning to finish at least this semester, but I'm unsure if I should drop out and start practicing. I wouldn't dare settle for aiming for a more stable job if it meant to give up my hobby. My plan is to get a part-time job, practice my art skills everyday for 6 hours. When I turn 18 I'll head to the Pasadena [Concept Design Academy](http://conceptdesignacad.com/) where I can pay for the classes with my savings and live with my aunt who has offered me to stay there while I attend the academy.

I'm young and naive, I don't know everything about what the industry is looking for in terms of people they hire. I hate school and that's no secret to my loving parents who thankfully have been supportive of all of my decisions so far. My major is in Studio Arts and I wouldn't want to spend 2 years in college to get an associate degree that may or may not be helpful in the future. Any advice from more experienced people would be appreciated

TLDR: Not a fan of school, want to drop out of college to go into the art industry. I Am naive and admit that I don't know everything about the industry.

154,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old. I graduated High School 2 years ago and since then have been studying Web Development on my own and with some CC classes. I wasn't able to afford a regular college and my parents have been kind enough to let me stay with them while I study.

That being said, I would like to find a job so I can save up money to help out with my parent's rent and eventually find my own place in the future. I want a job in Web Development later on but for now I need a source of income.
I've never had a job before this and I don't know what to do or what type of jobs to aim for.

I've put in a few applications for retail positions but I don't get calls back. I don't know what to put on my resume as all I really have is some HS volunteer experience from around 4 years ago and I self-study. I didn't put self study on the resume though.

How would I go about trying to get an entry level job? What can I put on a resume when I have no work experience? Should I expect to get no responses a lot more than I expect?

155,"I'm not even sure where to begin, but I will try to keep it as short as possible. 

Basically, my mother is an addict and she overdosed a week and a half ago. She's in the ICU and it has turned my family into utter chaos. I have a 6 year old brother who my grandparents now have custody over and that makes it more complicated. I have been feeling so stressed out about my relationship with my mother.

My relationship has been rocky for awhile now. We live together and he is a great guy, but I am just not sure I am in the right state of mind to be in a relationship right now. I keep trying to talk to him about it but he always convinces me to stay with him and keep trying. The problem with that is, my heart just isn't in it and he only has time for me when he deems it convenient (at least that's how it seems to me). Two days ago, I cheated on him. I feel awful, but not because I slept with someone else, because it hurt him. The guy I slept with is a friend of mine and I stayed the night at his place last night as I went home and told my boyfriend what had happened and then I broke up with him. I felt like it was the best thing to do. Now, he still wants to work it out and says that I have caused so much trouble for him that I have to stay with him. I don't know how to feel or what to do.

I feel so stressed that I basically just feel like it is sinking me into a depression again (I have depression, but am on medication). My meds stop me from feeling suicidal, but they don't stop the sadness, etc.

157,"Hey guys, I majored in computer engineering and realized it just wasn't for me. I did poorly in pretty much every major class, and did so bad to the point where I was able to diagnose myself with ADHD after seeing a psychiatrist. I'll be graduating soon after sticking it out, but over the past 4 years I realized I made a mistake. 

I've always been attracted to the pursuit of making money, but I can't focus well when it comes to very intellectually stimulating work. I'm trying to figure out what career might suit me best, as I'll be graduating soon after grinding it out.

I have been attending my schools entrepreneurship club, but it's been very inconsistent, as I commute back and forth to school every day and I live with my parents. I plan on launching a business as soon as I can, and exchanging ideas with friends at the entrepreneurship club to see if we can get started on building a business.

However, my graduation date is coming soon and I realized I'll need to work a day job in order to start saving money. I've dealt with some depression over the years as I realized I made bad decisions in my life, probably because I had undiagnosed ADHD. After I was diagnosed I tried to implement new mechanisms into my life to stay productive, which has sort of helped. I don't take adderall because my mother is against drugs of any sort.

What kind of career would you guys suggest I pursue as a computer engineer major, who is mainly motivated by making as much money as possible and saving to invest? I plan on moving out of my parents house soon but I need money for that lol. I never really enjoyed computer programming even though I am competent in it. I can't figure out what my passions are besides making money.

164,"In recent years, my parents-in-law have become in an ever increasingly desperate situation.  They live in a terrible neighborhood, have ailing health situations, filed for bankruptcy several years past and have not a dime saved for the future.  Both nearly 80, they are starting to show signs of poor mental health (neighbors spying on them, their phone-line and WIFI hacked, government out to get them etc).  They've always been deeply religious but, now as this is all they have, has reached a fanatical level and they're refusing to think about leaving the area due to the church they attend twice daily.  The best way I can describe it; you know the kind of parents who pray when their kid has meningitis instead of taking them for treatment?... that kind of religious.  Flat-Earth kind.  They both have history of poor decisions making (refusing to feed themselves, car accidents and more) leading to suspicion of mental health issues.  Father-in law recently had a stroke brought on by a blood infection and hasn't been the same since.  Mother-in-law can't speak English enough to be able to communicate here.  I could go on and on and on.

I'm in contact with social services to try and get them help.  The first visit Friday past, went very badly.  My mother-in-law is very distraught and felt like shes been invaded.  Neither of them understand what happened and it's possible social services were very hard on them.  Due to the neighborhood, a police escort was deemed necessary so the social worker was protected.

Needless to say, and this is where things are getting nasty.. Family are very upset.  My Wife is one of 5 siblings.  First Sister is literally certified crazy (ex alcoholic, drug addict with mental issues),  second Sister lives 1000 miles away and only visits every few years, stirs up a hornets nest and leaves again.  She has been trying to rent a property to my parents-in-law for financial gain.  First Brother has a very high paying job, along with his much younger girlfriend.  Both toxic people who want to pretend nothings wrong and be left to their cushy lives.  Second Brother has nothing to do with any of the family and hasn't for years.  The sad part here is he's the only sensible one of the bunch, genuinely cared but just gave up.  Then my Wife, the youngest daughter, expected to be taking care of my parents-in-law by all.  Her eldest Bro and Sis are becoming very nasty about this and are threatening to call the police on ME for being abusive to my wife because we can't take care of them and pay money.

174,"I am a white middle class 23 yr old American male who has no reason to complain. I have everything that most people want, a loving family, a decent car, and a safe roof over my head; but yet I can't find a sustainable sense of happiness. I feel really sad inside, not in a depressed manner, but just like a feeling of emptiness. I have these huge bursts of happiness and excitement and then boring dull lows for a long extent of time. I feel very thankful that I am in the position that I am in. Here is a brief issue I have been facing that I can't seem to find a solution or strategy too.

I am very unhappy with the fact that I feel like I need work to sustain a feeling of purpose in life, and like everyone else in corporate America, feel the hands of societies capitalistic system pushing me towards wanting material objects and lots of money. But I keep thinking to myself, that once I get there I am going to feel the same empty feeling. 

My gut, what some call soul or instinct, is telling me that finding a relationship is what I am missing and that it will solve my loneliness.

183,"My mom has been in therapy for about 25 years now for being abused by her father. Since she has been in therapy she has seen 2 different therapists, this last one being the longest stint. She believes that she is making progress. I [28F] don't think she is and I don't know how to tell her.

Reasons I think she isn't making progress:

* 25 years is a really long time

* she continues to ""learn new things"" about her parents and subsequently deal with and process them

* she seems to be codependent on her therapist and know far too many personal things about him (e.g. that his wife started drinking and smoking with college kids and then divorced him)

* she can't handle normal things like working part time, her friends being busy, her cat getting sick

I'm tired of listening to her moan and groan about things that people have to deal with in every day life. I realize that everything she's been through when she was younger was traumatic - and I have no grasp on how that really should impact someone's life -  but I think that she should be more functional after 25 years in therapy. I think that she is processing every single memory instead of learning how to cope with the disaster as a whole. She uses this whole thing as a crutch to prevent herself from having a meaningful job, friends, hobbies. And she carries her baggage around with her, moping around and begging for people to ask about how she is so she can tell people (which makes them uncomfortable).

I grow further and further away from them to the point where we have argued about Donald Trump, Black Lives Matter and Women's Rights.

192,"I'm a third-year college student who lives in an apartment with four other guys. We're all good friends and get along. One of them is named Gary.

During my first year at school, I met a girl named Ellie. We hung out a few times freshman year, as friends, and I thought she was cute enough, but I wouldn't say I was attached or anything. Ellie ended up meeting my current roommate Gary through me, and from the beginning she was clearly very into him. It bothered me a little bit at the time, but it was the end of the year so nothing really came from it and again, I wasn't exactly into her by any means.

The next year school year rolls around, and I'm actually with a girl for most of it. But about 5 times throughout the year, Gary and Ellie hook up. Once or twice, Ellie tries to push things further with Gary and possibly even start a relationship. But Gary also hooks up with other girls and doesn't have any serious interest in Ellie aside from drunk hook-ups. Regardless, we all remain friends and hang out often. Ellie and I, during this period, grow extremely close and spend more and more time together. 

During the entire spring semester, she ends up going to study abroad in Australia. From the second she left our apartment, we were texting and Snapchatting non-stop. About halfway through the trip, the girl I was with ended up breaking up with me (for reasons completely unrelated to Ellie). Here and there, Ellie and I's conversations would occasionally mention how much she wanted to be back cuddling with me, or how we could have sleepovers when she got back. Nothing too explicit or direct, but definitely some flirting back and forth that implied things might be different between us when she got back. In addition to this, everybody in our friend group knew that we were talking so much, and they all started to get their own ideas about what we were when she started sending me gifts, letters, and notebooks of letters she wrote every week she was in Australia. A day didn't go by for a while where my friends didn't ask ""what Ellie and I were."" I hadn't thought too much into it, I just really appreciated and loved what we were. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't growing more and more attached.

Finally, Ellie got back about halfway through the summer, and we had a great reunion. It was only me and another friend living in the apartment at that point, as Gary and everyone else went back to their family homes for the summer. Ellie and I saw movies together, went to dinners together, etc. But it never went any further than that. During this time, I just kept feeling more and more interested in a relationship with her.

So now, this school year has started, and everyone is back, including Gary. I realized that on weekends ever since we were all together, I had increasing anxiety over Gary and Ellie hooking up again. I ruined my last relationship being too paranoid about things that didn't matter, so I tried to stay as calm as I could. But weekend after weekend so far, Ellie has just seemed to stay a little closer to Gary than anybody else. I tried to ignore it and move on, but it kept getting me even more worried. I did not want to go through seeing them hook up again since they used to just make out together drunk in our apartment or dance together at the bars when we would go out. Obviously there's nothing wrong with this, but I wasn't sure if I would be able to handle seeing it now that I was so invested in her.

This past weekend is where things really got bad. On Thursday night, I invited her to come drink with us (I feel I should emphasize that she is close with all of my friends and roommates, but I'm the one she talks to or hangs out with all the time). We went to a bar, and from the moment we got there, Ellie was all over Gary. I couldn't handle it and immediately found a friend to Uber back with to just go hang out at the apartment. From what I heard, Ellie and Gary were dancing together, but I'm just kind of assuming they were also making out because a friend saw them and texted me asking if they were together.

They haven't slept together again yet and I haven't actually seen them making out or anything, but it's just made my life hell for the past few weeks and only seems to be getting worse. All of my friends were already questioning if her and I were already together just from how much time we spent together, and I never confirmed or denied anything but would just kind of shrug or ignore it if they asked me. People look at my reactions whenever the two get touchy with each other and just wait to see what I'm thinking. Obviously it's killing me to see but I have to act like it's nothing. The day after they got together at the bar this weekend, she visited me at work (not uncommon) to talk and I sort of gave her the cold shoulder, then was a little more dismissive of her from the weekend just so I could do *anything* to make her see how bothered I was by the whole situation. She only reacted by being passively angry at me, texting me less, etc. Since then, I've tried to calm down a little and act like things are normal. I have no idea what she thinks I was upset about, or if she knows I was bothered by her and Gary. But she seems like she's talking to me like things are fine again.

I know a lot of people are probably just going to say that she's not into me and to move on, which is completely fair. But we have grown so close that we are still talking, texting, or Snapchatting 24/7, more than anybody else for either of us (her and Gary do not talk that much outside of weekends, and as far as I know, he is still not into her). I realize it's an asshole move to try and distance yourself from a friend just because she's into someone else, but it's keeping me up at night having to see her constantly hooking up with one of my close friends.

Thankfully, there is somewhat of an end in sight, as Gary is going to study abroad for the semester in Italy in the spring, so he will be gone for about 5-6 months starting in December. But that's still months away, and I am dreading every single weekend.

Is there anything I can do other than wait? I could tell her how I feel, but I just don't know what good that's going to do since she's already hooking up with someone else. There's never been any mention between the two of us of being more than friends, other than once early in the summer when she got back and I invited her to come hang out with us, and my other friend said she had made some comment along the lines of ""being weirded out by me asking her to hang out with our other friends who were all couples.""

I realize I might just sound like a typical asshole who's complaining about the ""friend zone"" or something, but I'm not. I hold no anger towards Ellie or Gary or any of my friends. It's just becoming unbearable to deal with and I don't see anyone I can talk to about it with (normally, my go-to would be Ellie) since that will just be one more person waiting for my reaction when they do hook up. I just feel like I'm stuck in a corner.",18Sep2017,1
193,"Hi,

A little under 2 years ago I bought a laptop (g750) for about £1000, however recently the motherboard failed so I sent it back under my purchased extended warranty.

The company said that they would refund the product (on the phone) however have emailed today saying they are replacing the motherboard.

Is there anything I can do to get the refund instead? Or do I have to accept the repair? 

Thanks for any advice.",18Sep2017,1
194,"This Wednesday will make 6 months of me being at this company. I started a position that sounded more technical than it actually is. It's mostly data entry. I'm trying to get into the IT career, and the IT department is hiring an entry level help desk position that I really want. My company's policy is that after 6 months, I am allowed to switch. I spoke to HR only 3 months into the job and they told me it's still possible to switch before the 6 months if your manager allows it, so it's not a hard rule. Well, I spoke to her and she waited two weeks to give me an answer: she said no because she wants at least a one year commitment from me. It angers me because she's never mentioned that before, although she says she has. If anything, she said this is a full time position meaning that it's long term, which I was fine with. But I didn't think I would have to be at this specific position for a year, especially when the company allows me to switch after 6 months. The IT manager talked to my manager because I had put in an application, as per the required steps. She told him she doesn't want me to switch so he withdrew my application and never talked to me about it. Fine. So now I'm at my 6 month mark and the position hasn't been filled yet. HR told me to try to talk to her again after the 6 months, but they the IT manager probably wouldn't want to cause any problems. I understand that, and I don't want cause problems either. But I hate this job... So much. I've been applying to so many jobs over the past 3 months but there are two problems. One is my lack of experience and education (I have some but maybe not enough), and two, which is the biggest, is that there are barely any entry level IT jobs in my area. It's a small town and there's nothing until I look outside 150 miles from here. It would be so great to stay at this company and do what I want to do. It's just not fair, they encourage growth and transfers like this but my boss is being difficult. Apparently she has a history with her employees where she is really controlling, and I've seen her interaction with other employees and she just doesn't seem like a good manager. She doesn't know how to be impartial and let her emotions get in the way. And I seriously can't stand my job because like I said, it's mostly data entry. Plus, I'm literally secluded from everyone else, I have no team, I'm not involved in anything, I'm not included in anything, and after 6 months I still feel like I don't know a damn thing about where I work. I feel like she's doing this on purpose but who knows. The last person to work my job switched as soon as she became the manager because he's had a difficult time with her. And he told me that she would get mad when others would ask him stuff that she thought they should be asking her, and a lot more crap like that. Ok I know this took a turn into me bitching, but I just want you guys to understand my frustration. I hate this job, can't find another one, can't switch.

Edit- just a bit of more information, I took this job because the title is Support Specialist. I'm supposed to be the administrator for the database software we use. So it sounded really technical and exactly what I wanted but ended up being data entry. Nothing is automated, I enter everything manually. I have an evaluation coming up for my 6 month mark, and I want to talk to her about it again. Is it bad to tell her this job turned out not to be what I expected/what was described? To tell her I'm unhappy and I really want to switch? I mean.. What can I do here? I have the requirements for that IT position, I just need her to ok it and I'm sure the IT manager will be ok with it too.",18Sep2017,3
196,"I'm a bartender and where I'm at it's very slow. Also the management is ridiculously aggressive. Very rude and disrespectful. Snappy and short fused. 

My gf used to work with me but quit and left to a sports bar where it's busier and the management treats you better. Free shift drinks and employee meals. They take care of you. She's also making double what she used to make. They want me to start working for them this weekend because football season is super busy. But that would mean I'd have to quit on the spot at my current job. 

My dad's advice is 
1. Will you be happier at your new job? (Yes) 
2. Are you happy at your current job? (No)
Then it's a no brainer to quit and go somewhere else. Especially if management doesn't respect you.

198,"I have two friends who are dating eachother. Let's call them Mary &amp; Joseph. I've known Joseph for over 5 years now and we're really good friends. We hooked up a few times a while ago. He actually cheated on one of his girlfriends with me at the time which I'm not proud of.

I met Mary through Joseph in the time that they've been dating. I've gotten significantly closer to her in the past few months. I can honestly say she's quickly becoming one of my very close friends.

About 8 months ago, Joseph contacted me through Snapchat telling me he missed me and to meet up with him at 1am. I played along, but I never actually met up with him. At the time, I didn't know he even had a girlfriend. Once I met Mary and realized they had been together while he flirted with me on Snapchat, I got extremely uncomfortable.

Recently, Mary has confided in me about how Joseph is really sneaky with his phone and is always on Snapchat and Instagram. When she jokes around saying ""what are you up to on Snapchat or IG?"" He says ""nothing"" and quickly hides his phone. She gets really mad and tells him to please show her what he's doing on Snapchat and he refuses to.

When she tells me these things, I can't help but to think that he's doing the same thing he was doing with me with other people. It makes me feel really weird knowing how he is and how he has the ability to cheat on his significant other.

Being so close to Mary and knowing these things about him and how he's been in the past makes me want to confront him and tell him he's making a big mistake, but I also don't think it's my place. I also think it would be terrible for me to tell her how he really is and how he flirted with me a few months ago because that's going to make them both hate me.

I feel like this is a very sticky situation and it's really hard for me to just forget about this. What would you do if you were in my position?",18Sep2017,11
199,"Hello,

So I accidentally scratched up my landlord's daughter's rear bumper on her 2017 Tahoe when trying to park into a tight spot.  She just got an estimate for the repair cost and says it will be $900.  That sounds pretty expensive, but I don't particularly want to argue the cost on it and since it's a new vehicle I assume it's pretty costly to do paint repair from the dealer.

She's fine to either go through insurance or out of pocket with me, and I'm leaning towards out of pocket.  It'll be the $900 plus whatever a rental car is for the time that the car is in the shop.  I have an at fault accident from a year or two ago and my insurance is already quite high ($180 per month) with Geico.  Is it pretty safe to assume that the long term cost will be less if I just suck it up and pay for this out of pocket vs. higher insurance cost per month?

208,"So everyday I go into work at my job at the diner in the retirement community and I bring my 30 oz Yeti cup with me. Most of my coworkers have company brand water bottles and so it is pretty easy for someone to be able to tell which one is mine. The Yeti. Anyway, for the longest time my coworkers have been harassing me on the daily, about filling it with Coca-Cola.

Now before I go any further please don't join in saying how I shouldn't be drinking so much soda. I am aware of that and I know it is not good for me but there are much worse things than drinking soda. Just refrain from saying that and I would appreciate it. 

I can count on one hand how many of my coworkers have never cared what I fill my Yeti with. For whatever reasons though the majority of my coworkers seem to make it their mission to get me to drink more water. I get it but they won't drop it. I don't go and grab their cigarettes out of their hands as I see them smoking outside. I mind my own business and yet they will not.

Just yesterday one server held me up as I was trying to get a drink and he wouldn't let me leave! This is really getting out of hand. I don't need an intervention I need to be able to do my job.

214," Hello Reddit, I have been in this situation for almost a year and I could really use some help.
 
 To begin, I must say that I have a pretty good life. I live in an apartment in the center of my city, go to a private highschool (even though my family isn't a wealthy one, my father always managed to work his ass off so he could pay it), have parents who care about me and three sisters who I love. My grades are pretty good, I practice Taekwon-Do and had the privilege to travel all across my country (Argentina) because of competition.
 Everything good you must say, and geez it is good, but I somehow still feel alone, weird, insecure amoung other things. I've noticed that I tend to complement this feelings with vanity, prejudice, fake self-confidence and this makes me feel that I'm not a good person, even though I try to.
 I have problems socializing, even with my own friends and family, it's hard for me to relate to other people. Of course I do my best to pretend I'm normal so I can have friends you know, but deep inside me I don't feel fully comfortable.
 When it comes to romantic relationships it gets horribly worst. Most of the times, a girl starts talking to me and saying that they like me, but when I start getting involved and growing feelings for them, they all tend to back off and it feels awful. I'm not the kind of guy who is looking for hook-ups, I've always wanted (and still want) a serious relationship, someone who cares about me. It's been like this the last 4 times I've tried and I don't even know if I want to still trying.
 I feel worried because even knowing what are my failures, I can't help myself and I feel that I can't be objective on this, so maybe the answer is seeking for help. 

 But then... I may be exaggerating thing's, I mean, I'm 17 yo maybe this is just a fase and it eventually will get better, maybe I am trying to rely the guilt of my own problems on someone else instead of taking care of them by myself.
 I don't even know anymore, I would like to read your thoughts on this, maybe you can help me clarify my thoughts. 

Thanks for reading.

217,This is gonna be a little long so I'm sorry. When I was 18 I went to prison for three years for a non violent drug crime. When I showed up it happened to be a rough couple of months at the facility and being a scared kid I joined up with the first group that welcomed me. I guess you could call it a prison gang but it only existed inside the fence so when I got released I walked away from it completely. The issue is while I was incarcerated I got a tattoo on my ribs.

I'm now 30 have a  college degree a good job own my home and all that good stuff. I've never been back to prison and haven't gone near drugs since my release.

218,"I (27/M) have only had one serious girlfriend (let's call her Sarah) (3+ years). Since our breakup around 1.5 years ago, I've dated around casually, but nothing serious--no serious sparks or chemistry. But then I met this girl, let's call her Beth (23/F), and wow was it amazing. We clicked on everything, basically all the same likes and dislikes, physically matched well, and we were sharing all of our deepest and darkest fears and stories by the second date, staying up texting all night. One such story of hers is that she was raped, and hasn't been in a relationship for four years. I know, a red flag you could use to fly with, but my last serious girlfriend, Sarah, experienced something close to rape prior to our relationship, so I was thinking I had this under control. Additionally, when I was dating Sarah, she was known to be somewhat flirtatious with other guys without even knowing it, to the point where stayed over at another guy's house (??). After that experience, I basically forbade her from talking with guys like that, and we recovered. Our relationship went on for another couple years, and we ended on amicable terms. But that insecurity apparently has never gone away, as you will see later.
  
  Beth has serious trust and commitment issues, and despite us agreeing to be exclusive after the second date, and me leaving the dating site we met on, she remained on the dating site. Now I'm traveling a mile a minute in my head, every stupid thing you could imagine. ""Is she talking with/seeing someone else?"" (Logical answer: no, she's in class or texting me pretty much all the time). ""Why hasn't she deactivated, didn't we agree?"" (LA: We never agreed, I unilaterally did it in the wake of being exclusive and she never said she would do the same).
  
  So I feel we have established that Beth has agreed to be exclusive, but isn't removing herself from the dating site, but also says she has no intention of dating anyone else. On the face of it this doesn't make sense, but when you put it through the lens of her being a submissive personality, and her having the past she has, it would have been way better for both of us if I had not even asked her the question (yet) and accepted things as de facto just us.
  
  Ok, this is where I think I become the bad guy plain and simple. I become super jealous, awakening that jealous rage I had with Sarah before, and create a fake profile on the dating site, posing as a girl (I figure if I send a message to her as a girl I would at least get a polite response/it will stick out in a sea of dudes messaging her). I do this to verify if she is still even using the site, or if she just has it on in the background. She replies back to my message in minutes, saying thanks no thanks. But this is proof enough that she is still using the site for me, and I basically lose all rational thought. 
  
  I tried texting and calling her for a day prior to this, with no answers. Our last interchange over text had us both agreeing we would work as a team to address any and all issues. And then poof, she disappears. All of these things are not the actions of a teammate, I think, so in my haze I decide I have to confront her using the fake profile. Needless to say she contacts me back and explains she hadn't replied back since she needed time to think things over. She felt I was becoming possessive (true), and she reaffirmed that she never said that she would deactivate the profile, so in her view it wasn't a deceptive practice. The nail in the coffin was using the fake profile, and for that she is ending things.
  
  Writing this all out, I think it can be seen as both of us being stupid at basically every significant turn, but I feel I am the primary one to blame for asking her to be exclusive in the first place. I think that is what set everything here in motion, and I doubt we could ever get back together but of course I still want to. I feel like I betrayed her trust, and pushed her too fast. This is all way out of character for me, and I am horrified that I did all this, but it is what it is. I feel like Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde right now, and Mr. Hyde has never truly appeared before.
  
  This is only day one post breakup, so I am still sorting out where I am and what I should do. I want to make things right with her, but of course she is very hurt by all this and I don't want to hurt her any more than I have. But I do want to be with her, as we did have such a strong connection and I think we could have made it work if we got over this initial ""are we a thing or not, and what are the rules"" phase. The dust hasn't cleared yet so I'm not sure if I'm seeing things clearly, so please, someone tell me if I was totally wrong or not. And I guess, would writing a letter to her apologizing and recognizing what I have done work to reestablish communication?
  
  TL;DR Her insecurity to having a relationship and my insecurity stemming from her somewhat agreeing to a relationship led to me being an idiot, confronting her, and her shutting me down. What should I do?",18Sep2017,1

221,"So I ( 21f ) have been looking for a decent full-time job for the past 2 years or so, and have been seriously looking for the past 6 months. I live with my boyfriend and for the past year or so, I've been doing freelance art full time, but obviously it's not an ideal long-term situation, especially since my plan is to go to college part time next Fall. As a self-employed freelancer I spend a lot of my personal/free time doing unpaid work. About a month ago I got desperate, having found no good full-time opportunities for the past year or so. Doing freelance art full-time, I can ""make ends meet"" but that's about it. Can barely put away any money, and there are a few significant things I'd like to save for. I decided to get a part-time ""real"" job to supplement freelancing until I found a full-time job.

I immediately got hired as a retail merchandiser, and at first was grateful for the position. However, I soon realized that the job was nothing like they made it out to be- I'm spending ridiculous amounts of gas money driving from store to store with laughable compensation, printing tons of pages from my home printer, and those costs are a huge offset to the money that I'm actually bringing home. I've also had endless technical issues with the reporting program for this company, which has resulted in me not being paid on time, or not getting paid at all for certain jobs. The management of the stores that I'm sent into treat me like human garbage, and hours of my personal time are wasted (which I'm not paid at all for) because they avoid me when I come in to do my work. 

About two weeks after taking this emergency part-time job, I found an ad for the perfect full-time job as an office clerk and graphic designer for a local business, 10 minutes away from my house. After two interviews and a tour of the building and my office, I got the job offer, and I start on Wednesday. It's higher pay, and a consistent schedule with weekends and holidays off. The management and my coworkers are lovely, and there's room for growth. 

Would it be excessively rude or uncalled for to quit this part-time job without two-weeks notice? I legitimately have only spoken to my supervisor on the phone once over the past two weeks, and had no training- I was just thrown out into the field on my own and left to flounder. For my past 2 jobs I've given at least a month's notice before leaving, because I respected the management and the company, but I've been treated so poorly here that I can't justify endangering my new job to convenience them. Just looking for advice on how to proceed- I plan on leaving this job off of my resume entirely since I've only worked there for a month. ",18Sep2017,1

Another thing I notice often is extreme body pain, like I can't even lay my boyfriend at times or hug people. if he tries to touch my arm or anything it hurts too much. It's like a weird throbbing body ache. He thinks it might be fibromylagia but I haven't looked into it because I'm always at the doctor for other things. 

I would also like to say I am a clean freak, I change my tooth brush, keep my room clean etc, and I wash my hands constantly. I eat healthy and I try to work out when I'm not ill. I don't smoke either. I am underweight on and off when I'm sick. First thing a lot of doctors say is I could be sick because of my lifestyle but I take care of my self. Anyways my family says I'll grow out of being sick, but this year I started college and I've missed so much class already. I have a sinus infection and a high fever today but I'm going to class anyways because I don't want to get kicked out. I feel horrible going today because I could get others sick but I don't know what to do.. I won't get a refund at this point if I drop all of my classes this semester. I took online classes in Summer but decided I'd try to go in person. Bad idea. This year I'm fed up with feeling this way, and missing work/classes and have scheduled a tonsillectomy for about a month from now. But what I'm wondering is if I need to get my blood taken, or something else. I think the tonsils being out would benefit me since I have tonsil stones and get strep so often, but another part of me feels like something else is seriously wrong regarding my immune system, since it's not fighting back very well. I'm tired of constantly filling my body with antibiotics, random medicine and steroids when I'm sick. I'm not sure where to go that'll take me seriously or what steps to take. Also not sure if this is the right forum didn't really know where to post. Thank you",18Sep2017,1

229,"Hi everyone. 

I need some advice. My heart has been hurting lately.

I've been seeing a girl long distance since about the beginning of July. I really like her, and my impression was she really liked me. Since things are long distance, we've only physically seen each other a handful of times (about 5), but we talk every day. She and I met at a time when we were both relatively fresh out of relationships - she was broken, I was broken, and our feelings for each other were completely unexpected but they developed and we kind of just fell into each other. She opened up and was constantly telling me really sweet things. It made me feel so hopeful, and much to my surprise I have absolutely fallen for her.

She warned me a few times that she tends to get in her head about things and can get distant, because the thought of getting into another relationship really scares her since she's been so hurt in the past and has a lot of trouble trusting people. But she told me that she was falling for me, that she knew I was different, and I felt like I was breaking down some of her walls.
But for the past few weeks, she's gone into her head and has become really distant. We still talk each day, but the tone is different and hours can go in between messages. I can tell she's got her defenses up and is pushing me away a little. We haven't been able to see each other for almost 3 weeks, which makes this feel shittier, but hopefully this coming Friday we will. We've spoken about all of this a few times and again she's said she's not ready for a relationship and that yes she's being distant because she's scared.

This is just all really hard. I really like her, and it's hard to know how to act in this situation (especially since when we spend time together, we act like we're together, and the feelings are absolutely there). It's really hard that she's not talking to me with the same level of attention and affection. It's kind of like I'm being punished for something I didn't do, punished for what other people have done to her in the past. I don't want to give up on her or let this go, because I think something could really develop with us and I'm just as scared as she is about getting hurt - especially now that there's this wall she's put up. I also don't want to push her into something.

I guess I just needed to vent. I don't know what to do :(.",18Sep2017,1
230,"Title pretty much says it all. I lied on my health insurance about being a smoker. The past week or so I've been getting some weird feelings in my left arm and sometimes like chest pain. I think I might just be paranoid and psyching myself into feeling this way, but I'm not sure. I want to go get a heart scan for some piece of mind, but if they find out I'm a smoker I'll likely face some financial and possibly legal repercussions. Should I come clean, or perhaps double down on the lie? Could I tell them that I started smoking after I signed up for insurance?",18Sep2017,1

232,"I'll try and explain this in the most succinct way possible. Basically, when I'm well-rested and healthy, I end up overthinking things and deliberating on something until the opportunity has passed by. I end up getting into my own head too much, and as such, I'm not as great at getting stuff done. Put simply I think I'm too introspective in a way that's hard to self-regulate.

I also have had a terrible sleep schedule my whole life and regularly stay up past 5am when the situation allows it. This is what confuses me - sometimes I pull an all-nighter to reset my sleep schedule. I get tired, my awareness slumps, and I almost fall asleep, but I stick it out. When I manage to hit that second wind, I consistently end up feeling more energetic and motivated even though I'm running on LESS sleep. Despite a lingering 'tired' feeling, I'm articulate, I'm more confident, and my general work product is usually BETTER than when I'm on a healthy amount of sleep. The feeling that accompanies this is quite strange, too. It's like my brain has shaved off the excess weight and I'm more alert. I do become more prone to basic mistakes like typos, but I feel more conscious and alive. Is there something I can do to make myself feel this way without tormenting myself with awful habits? It's probably really bad for me and definitely a suboptimal way to live your life. Also, creativity during this altered-state is pretty much moot and I can't make anything worth a shit.

I hypothesize that this has something to do with excess physical and mental energy. I've never really exercised regularly in my life, but I suppose that would be as good a starting point as any. I want to learn more about this phenomenon and why it happens.",18Sep2017,3

But the problem is that she is often with her friends (who I talk to sometimes) and she does not talk a lot, so it's quite hard to approach her, and in addition I know nothing of her, never talked to her.

235,"This may be lengthy but I grew up in a strict household where school meant the world. My parents moved to America in hopes of better opportunities, I was born and raised here but knew that life here is better than where they came from. They thought going to school was the only way to have a nice house and be successful. I was constantly forced to study a lot and I wanted to do good in school, just for them. I was the nerdy high GPA kid, double majored in college and just graduated this year. Obviously they were proud.  But I never really was a big fan of school, didn't want to have a nice big house, fancy car, or anything luxurious. But it was hard to tell them that. 
After seeing my first Cirque Du Soleil show when I was like 10, I knew that is what I wanted to do. Unfortunately my parents were never supportive so I never got any training but since then I have learned a few skills on my own and have performed in high school and college. They always said school comes first. So now that I have graduated I want to go for it, I just don't know where to start or if I am too old for this (I'm 23). 
I was considering moving to Vegas and honestly living in my car until I found any kind of job where I can afford housing. I just don't know if this is a good idea? I have taken many risks in life but nothing this drastic. I feel like my parents will be ashamed or think I am ungrateful to them for not being the engineer they had in mind. Is it insane of me to leave an office job that I know provides me with decent pay? I just feel miserable here knowing every day I could wake up and perform on a stage, but instead I sit for hours in front of a computer. 
I hope you guys aren't reading this thinking it's a joke.  Joining a circus probably isn't a person's dream job, but for me it is. I feel lost and don't know what to do. I feel as though they will feel ashamed that I wasted their hard work in getting here.

236,"So at work a new set of interns got hired and I was one of them. To my knowledge they hired me another guy and two girls at this research place. I tried to be friendly to everyone since we'd be working here for at least two years together. But last week when I had my headphones on I overheard the two girls. One looked quickly at me which I caught with the peripheral of my vision. Quickly lowered the volume if my headphones and caught someone of the conversation. 

Something about ""does he say hi to you..."" And other things Im going to assume were negative. I didn't want to get angry on the off hand chance they were taking about me but from the tone it sounded like they didn't like this person and quick glance at me (probably to check to make sure I had my headphones on ) made I very very likely they were speaking of me. 

So I took a vow of silence to just not speak to them again. I didn't want to lose this job or anything on the off hand chance they didn't like me and would say I harassed them or something. 

All I did was treat them like normal. Asked about projects. Offered to give them a ride back to campus since the bus system was slow. (the latter I also in the same time asked the dude but his brother was picking him up and we did get lunch together before using my car its not like I'm being creepy in that aspect. I just thought it would be a nice gesture.)


But the idea of why they thought the way they did or if they did at all think like that bothers me. 

There's a slight chance they didn't think this and this was a misunderstanding. 

But I really like this job. And I don't want to lose it. 

This is massive conflict for me tbh. I want to find out why and improve if they did or to be friends if they didn't think that. This job is kinda dull and having people to talk to would be great. But it's all vain if I lose it over something this small. 

Also 2 years. It's hard being silent for 2 weeks.

238,"To keep this kind of short and sweet, I live in Chicago and haven't really needed my own car for quite some time. Recently on my birthday I had to renew my state ID and figured I would get a new copy of my drivers license since I had lost it some time back.

The woman at Chicago's DMV informed me that apparently my license had been suspended since about 2011 (sometime after I moved to Chicago) because of an unpaid ticket from around the same time. I called the office for re-instating your license here in Chicago to try and get some more information and they told me it was for an unpaid traffic ticket somewhere in Indiana and provided a phone number for the county in Indiana. Upon calling them, they informed me that the ticket in mention had been paid and there was no remaining balance and I should be fine. They also mailed me a sheet of paper showing that the ticket was paid and there is no balance. I tried to call the Chicago reinstatement office and ask what I needed to do next but it keeps becoming an obnoxious circle of people telling me to call other numbers and I can't seem to just get a straight answer on what I need to do. Anyone have any ideas on what I need to do to re-instate my license? I figured the Reddit hivemind would be able to help me out quicker than a bunch of people giving me different phone numbers to call. It's been a headache!

tl;dr - need to reinstate my drivers license that was suspended for a ticket that was apparently paid but can't seem to figure out what my next step is because i'm being jerked around by an endless loop of Chicago government employees giving me different phone numbers to call that always seem to be incorrect!",18Sep2017,5
239,"I moved to colombia South America from Ireland for a year. Got a pretty good job there, and met some cool people and made a really good Colombian friend there who I hung with a fair amount. Very kind hearted and cool. 

When I came back to Ireland we kept in touch on and off. Then a year later they got in touch again properly over Skype. Now I don't know if this is just coincidence, but a month later they asked for money. Saying they had some family issues and would never have asked unless it was urgent and they would pay back in a few months. 

As I felt we are close I felt like I needed to help. I asked how much do you need. They said a couple of thousand. I was really surprised. But maybe they thought i could afford it no problem. Though I've always had the notion you should never mix friends and money so felt uncomfortable. I said I couldn't afford that but would give half of it. At the back of mind I felt like I was never going to see that money back though. So I thought just give what you can afford to not get back. But what I was disappointed about more than the money was the thought of possibly being taken advantage of by someone who I regarded a good friend. 

After I gave the money there was no mention of a thank you. No mention that the bank transfer had even gone through. I had to keep asking if it had. After confirming it had, no mention of it was ever made again. 

It is now coming up to the time of when I was told it would be paid back. I'm almost certain I won't though. We are still in touch sporadically. But I haven't and won't mention it. I will just put it down to this person not being the friend I thought they were if I don't get it back. 

What's weird though is I truly believe they really love and respect me as a friend, and that it's genuine, because of so many cool conversations we've had and the advice they've given me to help me out when I've had problems etc. So I'm really surprised to think that it seems unlikely I'm going to get it back.

I'm a junior(11th grade), and I'm unsure in how to proceed. We talk in class, and we make each other laugh, but I don't know whether to just ask her out, or wait and get to know her better. Here's why.

So, last year I have heard that she previously has dated a girl, but upon asking one of her acquaintances, I was told that she is Bi. I don't want to ask her out and then have her turn me down because she is gay, because that would make our budding friendship crash. But at the same time, I don't want to wait a long time, and her to start only thinking of me as a friend.

249,"Long story short, my wife is a highly regarded scientist who recently started working under a researcher (Boss A) who is also very highly regarded. She also semi-works for her bosses assistant (Boss B) who pays for around 30% of her salary through grants etc. 

6 months in my wife is burned out. Prior to taking this role I never heard her speak of being burned out for more than 24 hours and I never witnessed or heard or be distressed about her work. She used to be extremely excited about her work in what she did (cancer research), now she can't see the joy at all. 

However, since taking this job she has been working ridiculous hours. Going into work at 8am, coming home at 9-10pm and repeating Mon-Friday. Weekends aren't excluded and it isn't unusual for her to work 14 hours over the weekend just to keep up with the work load that Boss B sets her. This has put a strain on our relationship and I have gone to her work with her when she has worked on weekends just to be able to spend some time with her. We had a heart felt conversation and my wife felt horrible because she felt like she was putting a wedge between us and that she is trying to keep three women happy, me, Boss A and Boss B. If she keeps Boss A &amp; B happy, then I won't be happy, if she keeps me happy, Boss A &amp; B won't be. 

My wife has spoken to Boss A about this and said that she can't handle the work load and has no life-work balance. Boss A said she understands and that my wife should tell Boss B that, ""There are only so many hours in a day and that she will need to tell you what her priorities are so you can work on those first"". 

My wife speaks to Boss B and the following conversation ensues: 



**My wife: I can only do so much in one day and I've been working weekends just to keep up. I need to know what your priorities are so I can focus on one thing at a time that you need me to do.**

**Boss B: I don't know what's the most important, just do what you want.**

**My wife: No, I need mentoring on this and to know what you want done as a priority.**

**Boss B (training to be a professor/mentor): Oh, well, uh, I don't have any mentoring experience, just do whatever.**


My wife is someone who wants to do everything and anything and this response isn't helping. Boss A has lost two employees prior to my wife joining her lab because of Boss B and is trying to keep my wife in the lab with new fancy gadgets, the promise of a greater salary in the future and training. 

My wife has stopped caring and has actually told me she wishes she could be admitted to a psychiatric facility, writes, ""I want to die"" on her notepad at a conference she is at presently and just wants to be fired. She said she wants to work at the warehouse like I am currently, because she just hates her job and her work. 

She is currenty out of state for a conference which I wish I had gone to with her because she is really struggling mentally. She recently visited her doctor for a physical and was recommended to a nutritionist to help her lose weight (stress eating) and was given the number to an employee assistance program/number that will give her free therapy. 

I asked her if she was interested in the therapy and she told me that at the time because they forgot her: didn't take her blood work when they said they would/before they closed, she left and got discouraged. 

She messaged me today saying she was struggling on a minute to minute basis and thinks she has bi-polar. I told her that it's worth getting professional help when she comes back and we'll work through it together. 

Ideally, I would have her quit her job. Boss B is making things extremely hard and other members of the lab have been exposed to Boss B's wrath, i.e being screamed at, spoken down to, treated like they are Boss B's employees, etc. and she changes when Boss A is out of town. 

Boss A has suggested a program to my wife that could get her a large salary increase in a three year program with a guaranteed role in a job earning her a three figure salary, my wife's dream job. 

However, I feel like the current stress of this job and Boss B is driving my wife literally mad and is affected her mental well-being too much. I hate that my wife may end up not getting this dream role because of someone else's poor professionalism and unrealistic expectations. My wife has worked all her life towards this and it infuriates me that she may be chased away from it because she's literally being worked to a breaking point. 

I'm currently not making enough money to support us both, but I'm looking into extra income revenues. 

My question is.. has anyone been in a similar situation? How can I best support my wife while she's going through this stressful situation? telling her that things will get better and we'll get through them together can only help so much and she really needs professional help right now. If she works any less hours than she is Boss B gets on her ass, but when Boss B pops in for 15 minutes on a Saturday and sees us both, she says ""Oh why are you here?"" to my wife, she can fuck off. /rant. Boss A thinks my wife is wonderful and can only say great things about her, as well as everyone else in the lab. 

I really appreciate y'alls input and have a great day.

250,"I am returning to university next weekend and I am so excited, but a large part of me is not looking forward due to past links. In my first year, which was last year, I had severe depression and I hated myself and my course. It took a very long time to recover and I had to face some real tough questions and stuff. Thankfully I recovered but not before heavily considering suicide, and I slowly dragged myself out and have gone on to embrace life. I lost most of my friends from before university then, and felt ok with the ones I had at university.

It went wrong however. One day, a ""close"" friend revealed that she deliberately ignored me and would bitch about me when I was depressed because she didn't know how to deal with it. Odd, but people act differently right? Some others were really helpful but over Summer I have been doing so many things that I love and embracing my passions so much and enjoying life, meeting people who I like and care about. My confidence is high, I honestly love myself (WOO!) and I am actually planning on considering athletics as a hobby to further push myself. 

So prior to Summer I made a housing contract with my ""friends"" but I found someone to replace me as a tenant and I will be living in halls, alone. JUST HOW I WANT! So I can start over at university again, discover myself and generally enjoy my first year which I never got to do. Even when talking to old friends, I hate it and they all speak of meeting up to go drinking and blah blah and it just repulses me. I also find that *a lot* of them pour out their issues to me and so selfishly of me, I just don't want to know. I want a fresh start from everything and I feel it burning up in me.

264,"SO heres the story ~~ I went out for my birthday a few nights ago and I literally met my perfect man. He was a great dancer, he didn't bat an eye when I said I was vegetarian (you'd be surprised the things I hear) and he was nice to my friends. We had an amazing night, talking half drunk, but not really, and he just made it seem like he was actually interested. Not much more than a kiss came out of it (because my sis and friends had too much of a close eye on us), but he asked for my number at the end of the night and said that he was going to text me the next day. Its. Been. Three. Days. 
Is it time for me to give up and move on? Like why did he have to be so perfect? *sigh*",18Sep2017,0

267,"Hi guys,

I recently was gifted a car by my brother who I am so thankful for. My job opportunities have opened and my locations of interest have expanded as well as I am able to go anywhere on my own or with friends. Overall, the car gives me freedom.

The problem is I am spending nearly $10 on food every time (every day) when I am driving somewhere. Be it DD, McD, BK or SubW or other. I know that these foods are garbage and I shouldn't be eating them but I just cannot have control over my spending. I get the feeling of 'I must buy something' *because* I am on the road. Something warm and tasty to be in my tummy. This lack of self-control is only for food and not for any other thing such as clothes, shopping, electronics, etc. As ashamed as I am of this figure, I have to be honest, I have spent more than $150 on food in a short period of time. It is upsetting/thrilling to see the transactions in my bank history.

To add more context, I have gained 8-10 pounds within 20 days, the car was in my hands on Aug 22nd of last month. I used to weigh 230lbs but these days I weigh around 236-240lbs. 

I don't really have this problem when I am home. I eat whatever it is that is cooked, or what I cook. I don't have the urge to go out and eat unless my friends have invited, or I invite them.

Does anyone here have any advice on how I can better control my spending while I am on the road? To be completely honest, it is negatively affecting my health and my wallet. 

Thank you for reading, and thank you for your suggestions/advice!",18Sep2017,1
268,"As the title states, I have a couple of sisters I haven't spoken two in years. I've kicked around the idea of trying to reconnect with them. I regret not being around to be their big sister like with my other siblings that I do know very well.

The problem I have is whether or not I even should. Would they appreciate me contacting them again after all these years? Or would it just leave a bad taste in their mouth?

As far as I know, they've all been taken away from the ""mother"" (used in the loosest of terms) we shared. I know this woman has attempted to reach out to me, but because of her treatment towards me when I was an infant until that last time she have visitation rights to me, I denied her. I don't know if she did the same and succeeded with my half sisters.

And if it's even a good idea to reconnect, I don't know how I can find them. Since we were so young and saw each other so little, I don't remember their names. But I have many memories of playing with the older of the two. And I can't find them through my birth mother because I really have no reason to reconnect with such a toxic and manipulative woman. So is there any way at all to find them if all I have to go on is our shared mother's first name and maiden name? (I have no idea what her current last name is.)

Tldr: I haven't spoken to two of my half sisters in years. Should I try reaching out to them? How should I go about finding them if I should?",18Sep2017,1
270,"A couple weeks ago, I got into an accident.

I tapped the bumper of a car when I was going too fast and couldn't stop in time. I had been driving for about 4 hours at this point on highways and was very anxious by now because I hate driving on them. But that's just an excuse.

I didn't have insurance.

I'm barely making ends meet at the moment. Had planned to get insurance literally that week. But I needed to get to work. Without work, I can't make money. Without money, I can't pay for car insurance. I know, another stupid excuse, but I had no other choices. I was barely making rent and was relying on free ramen at work that week.

So, when it happened, I barely registered it at all. It had to be THE slightest possible bump in history.

I drove away. They pulled into a parking lot, I expect to take a look at the damage, and I just drove away. Like a piece of shit. I know.

I got a good look at their car at the light, and it definitely didn't look like there was any damage. My car was also undamaged. The only problem was, if I pull in, they call the cops, ask for insurance, I would probably lose my car. It was such a meager tap that I seriously doubt the car next to me or behind me even noticed it.

If I lost my car, I would be homeless right now. More excuses, I know, but my life absolutely sucked that week.

So I am wondering, what are the chances at this point that I am caught? Should I just turn myself in, if I am 99.99% sure there was no harm done? I have insurance now, and I am starting to get back on my feet. So I can finally think a little more clearly and am really tempted on just going and explaining what I did. But it would be a real shame if I end up doing that, lose my car anyways, and find out the person I hit didn't even care enough to call the police, or that there really was zero damage done and I just threw my livelihood away for literally nothing.

What do you guys think?

edit: It also happened quite a ways from where I live too, if that makes any difference.",18Sep2017,1

273,"I made a post in my other account but then it got messed up so I made this one /: 
So 'see original post' (in blue)

I have a very F**ked up 'sports schedule' (for my age) 
Here it is:

Monday- games (rugby)....... school
Tuesday- PE....... school and rugby..... school
Wednesday- rugby...... out of school
Thursday- rugby.......... school and gym....... rowing (so it's a lot of courses and fitness)
Friday- rugby matches........ school 
Saturday- rugby matches....... out of school against people twice the size of me 
Sunday-rowing 

I need to clear a day or two for homework and just so I don't get to hurt. At the moment I'm always soar and I think if something hurts tremendously it's not good for you 

I would preferably want to quit out of school rugby because I don't really like it. The people are always twice my height and are all the next usain bolts. 

I'm not great at rugby but at school everyone's my height so it's fair and I'm far more included in the matches (Also we get conducts and detentions if we don't show up for training or matches 🙁🙁😢) 

I don't want to stop the gym or rowing because I feel that everyone's more of a friend there and not a teammate. I also enjoy it far more than rugby 

I've tried getting out of some of it but my mum (who isn't the ideal person to talk to about sports) says that it's good for me and that ""we should give it another go"" which I hate. She's started saying that she hates me talking about it and has stopped listening to me and has been really rude and insulted me by doing so 

I feel like my opinion doesn't matter and that my values don't either 

My mum makes me feel like I'm being selfish and insulting to her but I don't think I am 

Thanks for any and all replys in advance 

TL;DR: want to quit some sport but mum doubt let me plz help me. 😫😫😫

275,"Hi reddit, 
I'm a 22M Sorry for the long read!
I am generally an introverted extrovert, if that makes sense. If someone initiates conversation with me I can manage myself well. And continue conversations, But I can't for the life of me do the opposite with females. I have some self-esteem issues, insecurities about my height and also some other insecurities. But I don't let that affect me socially as much, but recently I had let my insecurities get the best of me 8 months ago with a girl I've known for a years and later I realized that she was just stringing me along, which at the time I didn't know which caused me to be insecure and just be overall clingy and needy, in the end she just completely cut me off and avoided me like I was the plague. Since then I had put myself in therapy and I've learned to control most of the stuff I had done with this girl(long text messages, fear of abandonment etc etc)and have gotten really good at controlling myself and managing my feelings.I am still in therapy getting better at dealing with my issues.

BUT I still have issues initiating conversation and generally talk to a girl I find cute on the bus or something, I keep thinking that I will appear as a creep or they will feel bothered by my presence or something and I also even do this with girls in class that I am kind of know, I don't approach them because I think they will automatically think I'm creepy, avoid me and generally not find me desirable .so I just don't make the effort. Any advice or tips on this issue will really help me out, it's just something that I would like to do better.",18Sep2017,1
276,"hey guys, first time poster here. i seriously need someone to break my balls because i can't seem to do it for myself. i want to thank everyone for reading this because i know it will be long, and if you decide to respond it would mean more than you know

i could live a good life if i really tried. if i made some simple changes. if i did things that everyone else my age does. if i went to therapy to figure out what is wrong with me because i am so emotionally dependent it exhausts me and i do not know why i am this way. 

i am 18 years old, i have been with my SO for almost a year. i'm currently on my second year in college (which really hasn't started yet due to details below) and just came back home. i went away for my freshman year, but my grades were not enough to keep my money from uni and ended up relocating back home and planned on attending community college for the year and transferring next year. 

my first semester was okay. i'm not sure if it's because i wasn't involved with my SO so i didn't have emotional pressures/problems in general to worry about. but i developed the worst habits possible of a uni student like not going to class, never studying until the days before the test, not being responsible in the least without thinking of consequences, and things like that.

comes my winter break. back home and my now-SO, before ex-fling, actively pursued me and while he was technically a fling we were also more and i realized how much i loved him. he has had some issues in his past relationship with things like cheating and behavior in general, but so have i. i decided as i have changed he has too. so we spent time my entire winter break, and i did not expect it at the time but he did end up making things official. i have never been happier with anyone else. he treats me so well, other than his moods (his mother is bipolar?) he gets in he always is the sweetest to me. and many moods have been caused by me. i understand i am so much to put up with and i endlessly adore him for taking me into his heart the way he has. 

we have a very strong relationship. sounds silly because we are 18 (him 19) but the other night he cried to me because he asked me if i loved him and i kind of took it as a joke because he KNOWS I love him. but kept asking me over and over if i would truly love him forever, get married to him, etc. i am not saying this as a wearegettingmarried thing but as a its-only-been-a-year-but-we-are-so-close thing. i have never loved anyone like i have loved him and have been romantically involved with others in the past of course so i know this means so much to me 

so back to winter break, we get together. i leave for school the week after and have initial problems during my first month, but that's what we get for starting a new relationship right before my leaving when we both have trust issues. 
after that everything was great. he has his own issues, including serious oxycodone use (what i believe is an addiction as i have caught him looking up withdrawal symptoms before, he spends all his money+time into it etc, but functions as a normal human too, i honestly don't know what's up with him but i love him so i support him thru everything) and his failure to realize what is important (like school but we will get to that) 

during my second semester i was a shell of my old self, i only made good friends with a  couple people on my dorm floor and wasn't really friends with my roommate outside of our room. i barely went out at all because my friends didn't want to during the start, and i feel like that messed up my whole goingout vibe. went to a couple parties during me and SO issues but ended up abandoning the party life as i didn't want anything (and i mean anything) to interfere with my SO's trust. he would encourage me to go out but i declined because i was truly happier in bed on facetime with him more than anything else could make me there. i tried going to a counselor for therapy, took a long test and they told me i exhibited signs of depression and asked me about my suicidal thoughts (which were often at school. 5 months ago)

i also barely went to class unless it was mandatory, really. i feel as if maybe i had exhausted so much emotional energy into my relationship and making sure it was always in-tact (as we would fight somewhat-often while i was there, and i would always knew in the back of my mind we would always make up and we would, but i'm such an emotional person INFP problems)

so i ended up not making my uni scholarship requirements and i spent all summer pretending i was decisive over going back to school or staying home for school and saving money. ofc me being the self destructive human i am i think let me stay home my SO is here and even if i went back to old uni i would be wasting my money because im unhappy there. my summer with him was amazing and i just did not feel mentally stable to go back to school as i was such a depressed mess who would lay in bed all day and dread things that included just leaving my room like eating or showering.. i was truly a mess 

my first few months back my mom would always pester me about getting a job. august comes and i get a job and don't get praised much but i know it means a lot to her and my family to feel like im doing something right bc im so pathetic....

and right around the time i got my job me and SO took a t-break from each other but were back and better than ever. i felt as if things would be okay for me. having a job made me feel responsible because at least i was good enough to maintain something good and stable in my life....

now would be a good time to add that i have been essentially-living at my SO house for over a month now. while i know it's probably not normal his dad (is single) doesn't mind. my SO lives further from my job than my house is but i love spending time with him so much more than anything that i literally prioritize our time over everything else in my life that is actually important/more important. 

i ended up losing my job recently due to faults on my own part. not being responsible. it seems as if this same idea keeps pestering me that i am not good enough for anything and i feel as if i really am depressed or mentally ill/unstable in some kind of way considering i revolve my whole life around my SO and love and can't care about anything else. i have barely seen my family in this time as i said before i prioritize him over everything. 

school started two weeks ago for us. i went to school once in that whole time. it seems as if my old horrible habits from uni are taking over me again or they have simply not left. i can't find the willpower to put in effort to my school. my family is becoming fed up with me. 

my mom says if i don't get all A's this semester she won't even pay for my next semester. I have been lying to her and everyone else about attending school, i make it seem like i am a regular student and am all caught  up with everything, meanwhile i have literally went to two classes in the same day. i haven't bought any of the textbooks or done anything for myself. i have a quiz this week and other assignments due too or ones i have missed already and (this inspired this post) i can't believe i am letting myself become entirely consumed by SO and not caring about my school life at all. must i add that he does not care about school either which definitely rubs off on me because it seems we keep picking up eachothers traits.. 

I don't know what i should do. i don't want to live home again as selfish as it sounds because i like being able to have him come home to me. i like being able to b with him whenever i want and not have to pester him to come and pick me up etc... and i love sleeping with him. i love waking up to him and i love everything about him and it seems this feeling is mutual since our relationship has been so great recently. it's just that nothing else in my life is going in the right direction because of how absorbed i am into him. 

but i also feel like going to school this semester will be pointless unless i go back home and have to share my moms car with her to use it to go to school. because i am so absorbed into him if he does not go to school i won't go because i won't walk there, it's 15 min from his house driving... i know right from wrong but when it comes down to choice i always choose anything involving him. 

or maybe should i try to get a money refund while my mother still can and stop going to school this semester and just go to therapy and work on my mental health and jump back into it next semester. maybe even go back to my old uni as i know i am currently on leave of absence and may be able to go back if i wish. but my mom has said if we do that she will have to start paying my loans... 

i have no idea what to do. i haven't told anyone how bad i've been fucking up school because i don't want to hear it. but part of me knows i need discipline or at least guidance. which is why i came here. 

tl;dr: my SO consumes my entire life because of how much i love him and i completely allow it and it is screwing around with my ability to care for things like seeing my family and my grades and everything else in the book. need help deciding what is best for me and what to do about school (started 2wks ago, have gone once and feel that school this semester for me will be pointless because i won't do well anyway). i have barely done assignments/attended and don't know if i should just call it quits now to save my grades for one semester to get my mental health together as i feel that has a lot to do with this as well.

277,"I like dark comedy. I laugh at things I shouldn't laugh at: at cancer jokes, suicide jokes, Holocaust jokes and a whole bunch of other stuff. And up until this point, it never truly affected anybody I cared about...

You see, a friend of mine recently tried to commit suicide. Lets call him Norman. He slit his wrists, but fortunately, it was unsuccessful. He told me because he trusted me, and I truly felt so devastated. I imagined what would have been if he did end up killing himself, how he wouldn't have helped me when I was going through my own problems. How we wouldn't have had some great experiences together. He's such a great guy.

But today, another friend and I were telling ourselves some stupid dark jokes, and talking about stupid crap we'd seen on the Internet and whatnot. It was stupid. I am stupid. I don't know what's wrong with me. Anyway, Slitting wrists came up. We started laughing. But that wasn't it. Instead, we decided to be even more extreme, and decided to talk about Norman, and about hin Slitting his wrists. We thought we were being funny, when in reality everything that came out of our mouths was repulsive, disgusting nonsense. But Norman found out. He said ""So y'all are laughing at the fact that I tried to take my life,"" then walked away. You don't understand how much like shit I feel.  He told me it's fine , and that we should move passed our stupidity through , but I can't help but think this is going to make him suicidal again. He trusted us with a serious thing, and we betrayed him. What should I do? Should I talk to him? If so, what should I say to him? Should I leave him alone for awhile? I understand I'm a piece of shit, so if you want to just go ahead and call me that, so be it.",18Sep2017,1
278,"So today I went to the mall on my college's shuttle, and unlike my previous year at this school, I didn't have any friends to accompany me. I went in a boutique and was looking around when a young male worker approached me. We began conversing and he suggested some things I should try on. So I tried on things he gave me. As I was trying them on, he came into the dressing area and helped me finish getting dressed. I thought it was a little weird but I brushed it off because I figured he may have been gay. But then he just stood with the curtain open, so much that anyone that would be at the register could see me changing.

When we started talking even more, I joked about being broke and that I would just be a stripper and he agreed. So I went to change but he asked me to dance for him and he would throw money on me. Thinking it would be funny, I did reluctantly. He threw a couple dollars, put one right above my underwear and then went to put one in my bra, then he pulled down one side of my bra, exposing my nipple. Just because he ""wanted to see what it looked like."" I was shaken at what he did, so I quickly got dressed and went as far away in the store as I could away from him.

284,"I'm a high school student and this happened today.

I take Spanish and there's this semi-special kid in my class. He's not full on special needs but it's still there, as in he can function with people well but if he gets upset you should probably stay out of his way.

Today we had a test in which we would get randomly assigned a partner and we had to go up to the board and improvise a skit with them. The special kid, E, went up and totally blew it, I mean he's special needs so of course he's going to have a hard time. But I wasn't laughing at that, or anything related to his skit. He had a hard time, and could only answer like 2 questions in very broken Spanish. Then the teacher sat the two down, but he just stood there in embarrassment, for like a minute straight. Then he went outside and started hitting his head unto the door. 

It was at this time that me and my partner were called up to improvise our skit. At first the banging was very light, shallow, and you couldn't notice it. It's like if someone just tapped their fingers on the door. I'm in the middle of the skit blowing through it and eventually the banging gets louder, and then he starts kicking lockers, which was pretty loud, and he starts groaning and yelling. Keep in mind I wasn't laughing at him, I was laughing because it sounded like someone was getting beat up or injured outside and here I am just talking nonchalantly in Spanish. I was trying not to laugh and contain myself, and I was doing good until I said, ""what is that noise?"" The class responded with that it was the special kid, and just to carry on. Normally I would but at this point he started hitting his head on the door again. And it was getting really loud. Louder each time he did it. 

Then my partner asks me what the date is, the skit had been running for about a minute, and I said the following:

""Hoy es lunes, el diecio-""

then I coughed and started laughing, my face red and nearly losing my balance. Everyone else started laughing too. Then I fully said the date:

""Hoy es lunes, el dieciocho de septiembre, dos mil diecisiete.""

Then the teacher sat us both down, and everyone clapped. She went outside to talk to the kid and convinced him to come inside. Then he went over to his desk and tore a piece of paper and shoved it in his mouth, ran over to the trash can, and started beating the shit out of it. I'm sure that if it was a person they probably would need treatment for internal bleeding. Then he sat down and calmed down.

Then this kid I sit near started laughing and he pointed at him. I was laughing because he was laughing, so it's not my fault. Then the period ended and I felt really bad, and I'm just wondering how can I contain my laughter in an efficient way, what is your favorite method of controlling your laughter, etc.

Also, am I going to Hell?",18Sep2017,1
285,"WARNING: very whiny and self depricating post ahead!

So I'm supposed to be a sophomore in college, and I mean supposed to be because I've dropped nearly every class I've taken.

I'd never been a fantastic student. Aside from math (which I am horrible at), I was an A and B student in high school, with a 2.9 GPA. I then went to a community college to be a teacher. First couple of classes went well, then I changed my major to criminal justice. 

Then something happened. 

I got this overwhelming feeling to stop going to class. I don't mean like general laziness, but like, I can't explain it. Like almost the thought of going was out of the question.

After I found out that my anosmia (no sense of smell) would hold me back from my projected career as a cop, it kind of hit me hard, but I also saw it as a potential gift. Maybe the reason I didn't go anymore was because deep down I knew it's not what I wanted do? So I took this opportunity to say fuck it, I want to take a risk and do what I really want to do. Go to film school.

Only problem was I was on probation, because of not going to class and all.

So I talked to my counselor, came up with a plan to get me out of it, and get on the right path. I was genuinely excited and motivated to stop being a useless piece of shit.

Four weeks later brings us to today, the day I dropped my classes yet again. The feeling is still there, even though these classes are leading to my dream.

What the fuck is wrong with me? What do I almost get this feeling of dread just at the thought of going to class? Why am I continuing to fuck up my life over something so stupid and immature? I feel like I need to go to a therapist or something, but there's no way I can afford it.

- at a get together, we were all in a circle cutting cake just randomly but it was in a decently big room so i'm on one side while she's on the other, i catch her looking at me so i look at her and she looks away, repeat about 5x and than i stop looking
- there was a fire drill and i walked down to where my class meets up and hers is next to mine, the girl watches me walk down in glances and when i finally stand in my group which is next to hers, she turns around from her group to look at me and than turns  back around

288,"(Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this)

 Lately ive been finding it really hard to concentrate when im doing homework or studying. This year in particular is crucial to me. Its the last year of school before college. I suppose i can be considered somewhat academically accomplished. But in the past 2 weeks i felt rather stressed about the upcoming year. And was overwhelmed by the work and study. Should i take some time off to relax my mind? The problem with me is that being unproductive makes me feel so bad about myself. Always thinking "" could have used that hour to study more"" ect. How should i combat this type of situation in the future as exam pressure builds up?",18Sep2017,1
290,"I would like to state, in the past, I have made mistakes about sleeping with co-workers. It was SUPPOSED to be an NSA friends with benefits deal. I was doing this with two co-workers at the same time and it ended bad when both developed feelings and found out I was sleeping with another co-worker. I had to quit my job and find a new one.

I finally got a new job and a decent one for school. I don't find many woman in my town I want to date. Always too much conflict with personalities (I live in a very religious and conservative city) and it's a real turn off for me.

I've been at my job for about two months now and this chick started at the same time as me. We never really talked until this past week and she is awesome. We like the same stuff, similar hobbies, and ideologies. Today as we were talking I could tell she was into me, but I kind of just ended the convo and she kind of gave the hint I should talk to her more often (she told me I should stop by her cubicle more often).

I wanted to, but didn't ask her to hang out. I don't want this job to go down the shitter because I need it. the difference between this situation and the last one is I just wanted to have sex with the two girls at my last job, this girl I want to get to know and date, if I'm going to be blunt.

Do you peeps think it's a bad idea or should I go for it?

291,"I'm one of those people who need around 10 hours of sleep a night to feel fully rested. Uni is starting soon which means I'll switch to sleeping around 6-7 hours. The mornings are usually the worst, I have no energy to the point where I feel a bit physically sick, am grumpy and can't focus on anything. Any tips? 

P.S. I'm not a fan of coffee.",18Sep2017,1

293,"I'm quite conscience of how this will come across, but I do feel as though I am in need some advice. I'm currently at university studying a journalism course, and I can't help but feel like I am at a dead end. I went to an arts university to get out of my home town and to seek other people like me, which i feel as though i have done to a degree, but i can't help but feel empty. I don't enjoy my course and although it has shed some light on what my interests are, I can't help but feel I have no future. I'm 20 years old and up until recently was in a relationship with the love of my life. I am aware of how naive this sounds, but I had totally prepared myself to be with him till the end. We were alike in interests, music, and our conversations never ran dry. He was my best friend. We couldn't be together because of how much we argued. He was cynical, judgmental and unforgiving. Bearing in mind we got together when we were both 17, I found it hard to adjust to someone like this, which always conflicted with how much I adored him, as i never felt adequate for him. I am now starting my third and final year at university and i cannot help but feel lost. Until now I have been at university with the idea that I was going to have a partner, and that we were going to improve our lives for each other, but now I cant help but feel lost. I hope to find someone who is/has been in a similar situation where they have suddenly had to think about the prospect of life on their own, and how to overcome that realization. I am currently taking CBD oil for my anxiety. I took anti-depressants when I was 17/18 but they made me feel numb rather than relaxed. I understand this is sporadic, but with my crippling anxiety and recently broken heart, I can't help but feel this is all for nothing. I waste my days watching tv shows, merely dreaming of my potential. This is potentially the most cringe worthy thing I have ever written but I need to know - what do you do when you lose sight of purpose?",18Sep2017,1
295,"We would love to hear from anyone who has been in this situation.  It is hard for us to believe how many people sleep train their kids, because from our point of view it seems almost cruel.  However, everyone in both of our families sleep trained their kids, (so that includes us as babies) as well as all the parents in our parent group.  So if there is anyone out there who has followed the attachment parenting style, we would love to how what strategies you used to make it through you nights.

297,"I've been worried about my boyfriend for a while now, he's been extra depressed. So I decided to go to my school counselor to tell them I'm worried about him and that they should check up on him. Rather than talking to him they just took him away to be evaluated at a mental hospital and I've been worried sick. When he finally messages me, he tells me that he got sent home and that he's not staying at the hospital but his family now hates me and wishes to kick him out or send him to live in a different state or in foster care and he doesn't know if he'll ever see me again. I can't live without him. What do I do?",18Sep2017,1
298,"Hi I am 13 years old and am really interested in learning/getting a guitar currently. I just want one to be able to just pick it up to play it and have fun. I don't want to learn to play it for a career but a hobby. First I am putting my mind on getting one and then I'll worry about other things like learning, tuning, ect. I found a used one on an app called offer up and it is pretty cheap and the guitar looks reasonable. It's a black les paul(epiphone) with an amp. I am not sure if I should get a new one online or a cheap used one. I also really like the heavy sound on guitars so any recommendations on that?? I'm also thinking about learning by songs on YouTube and work my way up to heavier music and challenging myself every time I learn a full song. So should I get lessons or learn online. There are a lot of questions here, but hoping anyone can answer some or all.",18Sep2017,1
299,"I started college not too long ago. My mom lives directly across the street from the campus, so i commute, however I spend most nights in my boyfriend's dorm. Tonight is the first night I've been home in a week, and I really want to leave again.

For context for what happened (below this paragraph): my boyfriend is choosing to be abstinent, which I totally respect, however I enjoy sex. Whenever I go home, I take the opportunity to ""have fun"". I lock my door, turn out the lights, stay quiet, the usual. Whenever she's even on the phone and i walk in on her, I apologize and leave the room. My mom and I also smoke the same brand of cigarettes, and she's aware I smoke. Additionally, I have a bathroom in my bedroom and when the door is open, it looks directly out to my bed.

I guess I forgot to lock my door, and my mom walked in when I was almost *there*. I didn't even notice her walk in. I only noticed when I heard my lighter from my bathroom. I saw she bummed a cig from me (I don't really care about that part). She was on the phone with her boyfriend, smoking away out of my bathroom window, with the door wide open. Instinctively I stopped, covered up with my sheet, and stared at her like ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING???"". She kept babbling away on the phone, noticed I had stopped, pointed out that she had nabbed a cig, then slowly strolled back out without closing the door all the way.

Needless to say, I'm not okay with this total breach of privacy. Obviously it's her house, but as an adult, I believe I retain the same right to privacy as she does. How do I tell her that she can't just do that? At the very least, she should knock, regardless of whether my door is locked?",18Sep2017,1
