3,"I just recently graduated and I landed a full-time job at an advertising agency that pays pretty good money + benefits for a position right out of college and the location happens to be an hour and ten minutes away from where my boyfriend lives. When I accepted the job, he said that this would be temporary, and I should look for a career in the town he lives. I haven't had any luck finding a decent marketing/PR/Advertising job, other than Ad SALES. I really don't want to downgrade my career...I'm beginning to really enjoy my profession. And I would hate to take a pay or benefit cut. My boyfriend thinks I'm critiquing the jobs I am interviewing for, but the job descriptions are just offputting, and mostly sales positions. I would hate to switch jobs just to live near him and then absolutely hate going into work every morning. I wouldn't mind commuting the long drive, but in the meantime, I am living with my parents to save money and seeing him on the weekend. If I live with my boyfriend, he'll charge me rent to live in his house, which will be $600 - and I can't afford that right now.... And - he won't consider moving cities because he doesn't want to leave his mom...Should I feel guilty?  It's hard to walk away from a relationship, but I am always going back and forth... I want to move states or stay in the city with my job... or even commute back and forth to his house but I can't afford $600 in addition to the credit debt I acquired in college... and he won't let me pay a small amount in the meantime..just so much expectations and guilting me in not majoring in a degree that was promising in the city he lives in..",20Oct2017,1

Fast forward a month later I reached out to the recruiter and was told that the department wants to rehire me back as an intern this time with full time opportunity. It's been half a month and they still need two more approvals... Are they serious about hiring me and should I wait? It's the ideal position with great benefits. On the other hand, I am going to be interviewing with a smaller company that is farther but is a full time position next week.

6,"Hey, so a little background.

So I'm a junior Biochemistry and molecular biology major in college and as the year progresses the stress of ""the real world"" is beginning to loom over the horizon. I'm interested in persuing graduate school (most likely a pHD) and I'm wondering if i've essentially shot myself in the foot in regards to research. 

So in sophomore year I volunteered in a biology lab (involving sea urchin legs and the chemistry of their attachment to objects). However the professor left so I jumped ship and began research in synthetic organic chemistry. For about a summer and a semester i've been conducting my own research project (its a branch off the professors) on optimizing a synthesis of a NADH analog. 

My rambling aside, I'm growing paranoid that future grad schools will look at my research and go ""not biochemistry enough"" and disregard it. Any advice regarding evaluation of under-grad research would be greatly appreciated. ",20Oct2017,1
7,"Hi all!
I am in a committed relationship with my boyfriend, we are both 20. We have been trying to have sex for a few months now but I get a lot of pain, so we haven't been able to do too much penetration/moving in and out.
Anyway, about two weeks ago we tried having sex (I understand this was around my fertile period which is why I'm worried). I know that this is probably irrational, but I really need someone to reassure me.
We always used a condom when he was inside of me and he never ejaculated. (It's not that he pulled out right before he did, he just didn't get to the point, we had to stop a lot before because it was too painful for me.)

In the meantime, I got a UTI and have been treated with 4 days of Macrobid followed by a full week of Ampicillin.

Now, my period is 4 days late, and usually it's pretty consistently on time.

Could I actually be pregnant? I don't know how it would've happened, unless there was a hole in the condom and precum seeped through? I don't think there was but, obviously, I'm worried.

Could antibiotics be affecting my period, even though I wasn't taking them during the time of ovulation?

Thank you so much for your help and reassurance!!",20Oct2017,1

She’s really cute and funny and I just don’t know how to become a better friend so I can be comfortable enough to ask her out. I’ve complimented her a couple times and I start conversations but J don’t really know where to go from there.",20Oct2017,1
10,"I was this this person for awhile, a few months short of a year. He was a really depressed, messed up kind of kid but he had a good sense of humour and I felt inclined to be there for him. 

Things were great at first, up until my current partner, I had never felt so much for someone. It wasn't a very physical relationship, and mostly consisted of conversation and so on. He was the one who portrayed the relationship to be more serious than he actually wanted to be, but would constantly tell me things like I'm the perfect person for him, I'm his soul mate and he loves me. Real corny stuff, I'm not the most attached person but I did eventually start to believe everything he told me. 

But soon enough, he started spiraling into a deeper depression. 98% of our conversation would be me counselling him, comforting him and so on. I would put so much on hold just to make sure he was okay, and mentally sane but it never seemed to work both ways. One day something really bad had happened to me, for once, and I sought comfort from him. He replied with, ""I don't have comforting words for you, I'm not that type of person.""

I couldn't believe it, I had spent so much time comforting this person and he couldn't even try to help me. I cried myself to sleep that night, but wanting to see the best in him I continued this situationship. 

We fought for the first time and he told me we should just leave it if it's not working out, no trying to make it work, no trying to talk it out. The fight was about him never seeing me (we saw each other less than 1 a month despite being 15 minutes away, his fault) but always being able to go out to clubs with friends (never inviting me with) and to top it off these are the friends who did horrible things to him that I constantly had to comfort him and counsel him about. 

He just stopped speaking to me after this fight, entirely. I wasn't rude or crazy, I just asked him to make time for me. I was depressed, couldn't eat, sleep, hand in assignments, you know how it is. I used to be a bit of a savage, but I changed for this person and I was faithful. On the fifth day of silence, a guy from uni asked me why I don't look as happy as I usually do, ended up taking me to eat since I obviously looked malnourished and we ended up hooking up and dating a few weeks later.

He then messages me, implying I'm a hoe because I just started seeing someone else. I said but you haven't replied to me in 2 weeks? And he's like oh it only takes you 5 days to move on? 

A lot of other toxic things happened but you get the gist.

Over the next couple of months we started speaking again, building up a bond again but I kept my wits about me and essentially spent time with him out of spite. I made him fall in love with me all over again, just to cut communication. I also kept seeing other people during this time, because clearly you shouldn't change for people who haven't proved themselves to you. 

So I forgot about him and the whole ordeal entirely, didn't care, fell in love for real with the most amazing person in the entire world who has given me everything I've wanted and more and I'm happy.

Now this guy keeps messaging me saying I was one of his best friends and he's so thankful for me being there for him and all that jazz. I still didn't care.

What bothers me is that he's seeing someone else now, but the problem is that he's doing everything for her he promised he'd do for me, posting pictures of them together and trying to know her friends, he never did that for me and it makes me angry, why am I so angry and what can I tell myself to stop feeling this way.

He was also very private and not social media active so he never did things like post pictures of us, or even acknowledge me online.

11,"Okay, so last year I met this guy in one of my classes and I thought he was super cute. So as the weeks went on I started to develop a crush on him, which is super rare for me. As soon as I realized I like him, I started to feel more shy, and nervous and I just acted weird, so things never really went any where. We were friendly and cordial, but he had no idea I liked him. For our class we basically just worked on a big project all semester, so I would hangout with him to do the project and our homework but that's it, in hindsight I have so much regret, I never really showed him my true self because I was so nervous. Then things go really weird, one night me and my friend got really drunk and we drunk texted him/snapchatted him. Of course he didn't answer, if someone did that to mean, I wouldn't have either, it was so embarrassing and immature. After the semester ended I'd still see him around, and we'd smile and say hi but that's it. I know I blew things with him, but for some reason I still can't stop thinking about him, I check his social media, when I see him around campus my stomach gets butterflies, I still really care about him. I feel like I'm so obsessive crazy person, it's not normal. Why do I still have feelings for him?? I know I need to get over him. ",20Oct2017,1
12,"There is a big festival lets call it by me. Tickets are expensive but the costs go to charity. Its like an all day drinking and horse race thing. Me and two friends are going along with other f other friends in other cars and one is driving. 

Later on the friend who is supposed to be driving there as its his car asked can you drive? I was like wtf? I do drive-am a car hobbyist but I kinda feel like its personally not right for him to ask as they are going to be drinking all day and such and then not be able to drive home at the end. I feel like you knew it was your car and you should be aware that drinking is going on. I basically figured out he wants me to drive so they can drink all day and be drunk and not have to care. If I do get into an accident there could be alot of risks involved and stuff too possibly. I do want to go but overall I feel a bit confused on what to say and not make everyone upset. I also just feel its kinda careless to ask if I drive and I guess taking advantage of me as I do not drink. What should I say here?

I’m not sure exactly what’s wrong...and finding real help seems to be next to impossible.

Basically, I graduated college in May, got a job that doesn’t let me utilize any of my strengths but pays well, sit at a desk all day as my brain turns to rot bc I’m not doing anything challenging but I also can’t figure out how to do things that pertain to the job because I just don’t care about what the company does. I’m applying to other jobs with no luck, I’m applying to grad schools but that takes time, I’m looking to move out of my parents house to ease to commute and my sanity...but I just feel so extremely lost. I’m scared that I’m never going to have a life that will make me proud, that I’m always going to have to settle like I’ve done in the past. I don’t know how to accept the fact that there truly may not be any meaningful relationships, any careers that I care about...just any sort of fulfillment in my life. And I understand I’m young, but I’m just so scared I’m going to think I have time to go do something and then wake up alone and even more useless when I’m 40. 

So, I guess what I’m asking is, how do I truly just accept life the way it is. How do I stop dreaming of all these awesome things I could do and try to do? How do I make myself believe that growing in a career I’ll have to force myself to like is the only option? 

It kinda takes any enjoyment out of life but I guess it’s realistic.

She calls me a bitch all the time, calls me useless (even though I'm in school, I work, and pay bills), among other things.

I once overheard her on the phone saying she wishes I were more like my sister. She's never been satisfied with me and though I don't care to have a good relationship with her I despise her.

It's bitch this bitch that, I'm gonna beat you up if you take off my recordings again. To make matters worse I also pay the electric bill and if I adjust the temperature I'm also a bitch.

Let me remind you that I got home from work at about 5:20 and I cooked something small for myself because I was starving. I didn't wash the plates because I wanted to rush to the park before it got dark so I can have enough time to jog. I also hadn't walked the dog because I was at school and work all day. She's beyond fucking annoying when it comes to walking the dog, everyday that she gets home she opens my room door to ask if I've walked the dog, if I haven't she begins to insult me.

22,"My mother in law is disabled and uses a crutch to walk and so needs some help around the house. She has had a lady come and clean for her for a few hours a few days a week. This lady has some serious issues, including alcoholism.  At my partners 30th birthday, she arrived at his mums house hours before the dinner was due to start, already with a buzz on. I wasn’t present, but she proceeded to drink throughout the party, behaving terribly and then stole two expensive bottles of wine that had been given as gifts. 

This lady has been bouncing between different family members, she has a car and is working so I’m not sure why she doesn’t have her own place to live, and has badgered my mother in law to let her come stay for months. MIL finally relented despite myself and my partner telling her it wasn’t a good idea. She said it would be for two weeks tops. 

About a month later MIL calls my partner to say that this lady was smoking in the house (MIL is asthmatic) and going out drinking a lot so she had asked for the key back. The lady said no and a huge argument ensued and the lady went out and got drunk. The next day MIL says everything is fine. 

5 days later my partner gets a call from this lady to say that MIL has had a stroke and we need to get to the hospital.  It’s a 2.5hr drive due to weather conditions and rush hour traffic.  We get there and her sister is there, obviously we are all extremely emotional and worried. Her sister tells us that the alcoholic lady found her unreponsive and phoned the ambulance. She did not go with her to hospital. 

A few hours later the lady calls me to ask how she is doing. Something is not right. She’d clearly been drinking, saying some odd things like “she’s my best friend, she’s very good to me, but I’m very good to her as well.” She then went on a spiel naming all the people she knows that share my name, listing them (I have a very common first name). The whole tone of her conversation was completely off. She was extremely upbeat for someone who’s “best friend” was on life support. When we see MIL she has a small black eye. The doctors couldn’t find any evidence of a stroke or heart attack, suggested it could have been severe asthma attack. 

She is now stable so the nurse told us to go home and get a few hours sleep and come back in the morning. We do exactly that and head to MILS house. When we arrive at the house, the alcoholic lady is playing dance music and smoking a cigarette in the kitchen. She’s in great form. She is clearly inebriated, not slurry as she’s quite tolerant I’m sure, but drunk. I ask her to smoke outside as I have respiratory problems and she launches into a completely mad tirade and says “you’re lucky I was here.”, refused to go outside. Trying to calmly de-escalate the situation I asked her to go to bed as we needed some privacy and she was clearly drunk. 

Things are calm for a while until she bursts back in saying that MIL didn’t like me anyway, etc etc this was her house and I had no right to be there. Partner explained that this behaviour was insane considering what he’d just been through and for that reason this would be the last night she spent in the house. She storms into her room. 

Minutes later we hear her car pull away in the driveway. She’s gone. She has taken the only backdoor key with her. She has a front door key. She had used MILs phone to contact us and the emergency services all day. When we checked the phone, she text MILs sister at 14:37 to say to get in touch urgently. She phoned a GP at 14:52. Only after this did she phone 999. With all of this, the strange behaviour and the black eye I think she must have hit her? I don’t know if I’m just emotional or jumping to conclusions because it’s a stressful situation.

I studied music in college but realised after completing my course, along with a few others, that in such a cutthroat business that relies so heavily on what is popular at any given time and not really dedication or skill as much as it should, that that wouldn't be for me.  So the one skill I had was rendered useless by not wanting to enter into music as a career.  Since then I've considered my options, and decided that I need to find a career to enter in to that I actually enjoy, at least a little bit, or just give in to working a soul crushing job that I eventually grow to hate, or flitting between entry level jobs in varying industries which feels too transitory, don't want that to be my life.  So I came to either something to do with IT, video games (game design, that sort of thing), maybe working with animals, but all of them are based off of minor interests in my life and don't really feel right.  I paid for some online courses on a site called Udemy, running through a web development course at the moment but I'm really struggling to find the motivation to keep going with it, I enjoy it while I'm doing it, satisfying learning something new that I can understand but it doesn't feel *right*.  There are a lot more informative courses that cost a lot of money (for me, ~£1000) in more specific subjects within IT, but I don't want to shell out that much money and get half way through and realise it's not for me, and waste that money as well as even more time.

And lastly, I've felt like I can't talk to her about my mental issues because I feel like I won't get support. (There was one day, though, where I got fired from a job and she told me ""I'm sorry"" and invited me to hang).

47,"I grew up with an abusive alcoholic father, was bullied for years because of my weight till i eventually lost it, and also been in some very hostile work environments. I'm trying to find the positive to being bullied. Yes, I learned to stick up for myself however, I sometimes feel that's it's done alot more harm for me than good. It's made me much less trusting of people and I always assume they are out to harm me or take advantage of me in some way. It feels like the emotional part of my brain is always on hyperalert. Is there any way to make this go away? Sometimes when I ask people I get obvious answers like ""you just gotta find a balance"", really?? I know they mean well but it's like telling someone bipolar 'you just gotta stop being bipolar'. My logical brain knows what I need to do but yet it seems like my emotional brain has alot of trouble following suit. It's almost like I 'stick up for myself' too soon and my emotions overpower me in the moment I think someone is about to do me harm. Is there anything you can recommend that would help me?

However, if I see someone who needs some help, can I just ask if they need some items? How do I do this?

50,"I'm a sophmore in college, and I'm gay. The thing is, I study agriculture at a small school, and it's not the most gay friendly place on earth. Being not so gay friendly, there aren't very many gay students, and those who are gay live life in the closet. Personally I've only come out to about 5 friends at home, no one at my school knows (neither do my parents or the rest of my family). I'm just not ready to tell some people.

Despite this, I still really enjoy school and the friends I've made here. But when the school year started a new transfer student started, who will call Jack. Now Jack new a few of my friends and during the first week of school I met him at one of their apartments. Most of the kids at my school have like never met a gay kid in there lives, so they don't have what you might consider gaydar. But the moment I met Jack, I was like, this kid is as straight as a circle. 

So that night I head back home and turn on Grindr. I happen to see someome close by with the same kinda body as Jack. I end up talking to him, he sends a picture and it was Jack. So I told him who I was and I also said I wasn't going to tell anyone he was gay. But regardless he blocked me on Grindr. Now I normally wouldn't care about this, but for some reason I did. And I know it's not cause I'm unattractive (not saying I'm a ten, but I'm def not ugly).

So the thing is, Jack and I have talked/seen each other many times after this incident. But we never bring it up (which is good with me). 

But lately, I've been feeling these weird feelings about Jack (which I think are jealously). Like every time I look at him I always think about how Jack is such a great people person. Or that all of the ladies really like him. Or that he has so many more friends then me. And lately every time I see his name or his snapchats, I just get really angry and upset, and I'm not sure why. Sometimes I just wonder why I can't have what he has, but at the same time I just can't firgure out what it is he has that I don't. I've never felt these feelings before.

55,"This is partially me taking a step back and reflecting on myself and partially genuinely asking for advice. I spent a good while deciding whether or not to post this knowing how I may be perceived, but decided to post it for better or worse. This may be choppy and not flow very well, but I am just laying things out so good advice can be given. I know some of you will have your little red flags going off like crazy for the sake of another human being, but understand I mean to cut down on the number of red flags set off.  I am mean, I am full of myself, and I am manipulative. I cannot hold a conversation without insulting someone involved. It is just how I manage. I tend not to keep friends very long because they bore or annoy me, or I got something I want from them and we just tend to stop after that. People disgust me and I can't stand them, and so for the most part I have pushed them away. I have 2 ""friends"" that I might talk to once every 2 weeks, really just whenever it suits me. I have a girlfriend of nearly four years, and she is the reason I am asking for advice. She is not aware, and hopefully will not be, that I am posting this. When we started dating, she had a small group of people she was with and over time I pulled her away from them. She has a lot of emotional baggage and I love helping her out, but could not stand anyone else being there for her. I hated them, saw them as lesser, I still do. I don't think anyone is good enough to be her friend. I push everyone away from not only me, but both of us. Neither of us have close friends as a result. She no longer feels she is capable of socializing with anyone, and I know it is my doing. Lately, past month or two, I have been putting a lot of effort into letting people close to her and trying to keep from directly insulting them or to make make my girlfriend feel like said people are worthless, no matter how much I believe they are. I would like to give back to her what I took. Friends, opportunities to do things with them, and a chance at being a normal social person. I ruined those things. I can't stand most anyone, but I have an attachment to her. I have no worries of her leaving me, but I do want her to be happy. I have talked to her about my goal of becoming socially functional, and asked her help in it, so that she might see that she can talk to people still. My hardest thing is to accept people. I don't understand how I am supposed to do that when they all strike me as such a pointless waste of my time short of getting something I want or simply the feeling of superiority over them. My girlfriend refutes it when I say I was wrong to do what I did to her, but I believe it was. I want to make amends for it and restore what was lost. They were just people, and that can be replaced. The opportunities, not so much, but more will present themselves to her. So, first step is to learn to tolerate people. How do I do that? ",20Oct2017,2
56,"This is a long story. My mother &amp; I live in my grandparents house. My grandmother passed away two years ago &amp; my grandfather has remarried &amp; moved into his new wife’s home. My grandfather didn’t want to sell his house so, my mom moved in from a different state after her and my father got divorced. I decided to move in with her because I wanted to go back to school and she needed help with bills. My grandfather doesn’t charge us rent, but we do handle the electricity bill &amp; other miscellaneous bills like internet &amp; cable. My mom doesn’t pay any of these bills. She sometimes will pick up the electric bill, but most recently has stopped. I pay for cable, internet, &amp; even her cell phone. I’m also the only person who cleans the house. I cook dinner. I take care of her dog, which she actually abuses. I do everything and she just freeloads. 

She’ll go out to the bar after work, come home at 2 or 3 in the morning, slamming stuff and blaring music which wakes me up. I have to wake up around 6AM, so it’s really starting to bug me. She’ll also bring home random men from the bar &amp; sneak them into her room. This freaks me out because I have a lot of valuable stuff here &amp; I just in general don’t trust some drunk from the bar coming into my home. Most recently she’s been bringing around someone who makes me incredibly uncomfortable. He’s done &amp; said some things which I’ve told her about &amp; told her I’m not comfortable having him in the house. She ignores me. I’ve talked to her about bills and picking up some slack around the house, she ignores me there too. 

I honestly have no idea what I can do. I can’t afford to live on my own. I can’t talk to her because she acts like a toddler. I know I needed to vent all of that...but I’m honestly at the end of my wit. What can I do to make this situation better? ",20Oct2017,4
57,"I am not sure if I am in the right place.  I adopted a dog, Missy, around 4 months. She is a mix (boxer, pit, heeler???)  She is about 7 now.  I have basically raised her since she was a pup.  She always had anxiety, protective and dominate personality. She is a really sweet and loving dog (if she likes you).   I have tried Prozac and tramadol and doesn't seem to do anything. Did a several sessions in a dog trainer and dog behaviorist. I don't trust her around children. She nips them. She has never attacked a person. When we have guests over I put her in her cage. I have taken her to the dog park and she goes after the l dogs. (Not attacked them but very dominate) she has been in two dogs fights. First one I was trying to do a play date with my neighbor dog. But it was the neighbor dog that started it and they did not want to let go. 

The second was tonight with her adopted brother, Gunner, (boxer) he is super submissive. Been together for over a year.  They just got done with food and I think there was some left over food so got dominate/aggressive??  Missy poked some holes and he bleed a bit.  Other than than that tiff she lays right to him or on them.  Again she is a dominate/corrective / a literal bitch. 

So, I feel like I can't get rid of her bc she has sooo many problems no one will want her and she is gonna be stuck in a shelter or get put down. I feel like I am giving her the best quality of life (vs the alternative).  

Since I got her as a pup I feel it's my fault her being this way bc I didn't train her well enough.  If I got rid of her I would have less stress worrying about her.  How can I trust other people that she will be in good hands? And now it will be worse keeping an eye on her with feeding times. 


What should I do? Try to re-home her with an adoption agency? Keep her?  It would break my heart to get rid of her but it also would be a relief as well.

I would have returned it within that week, but it has ""Postage Required CP"" meaning I have to pay for shipping which sucks because the error wasn't my fault.

75,"Warning: LONG POST

This is a throwaway account for privacy reasons. This situation started yesterday. I asked a coworker, we will call them Jasmine, to help me finish the rest of my work since I was clocking out soon and my boss didn’t want me to do OT to finish it. My boss also specifically told me to tell Jasmine to finish it for me. Well Jasmine agrees and says she will finish it for me. I even explained to her what to do and some of the difficulties I was running in to to give her a heads up. Well today I come into work and I noticed Jasmine didn’t finish one of the two things I told her to do for me. I get irritated and annoyed because now I have to take time to finish it while also trying to finish all the other things I planned to do today. Now I don’t want to be misunderstood and make myself look like I don’t finish my work and just pass it on to my coworkers. My work is team based, so according to my boss, whatever I don’t finish, I can pass it on to another coworker who works a later shift than me to finish it for me. Another thing is Jasmine was also not very busy last night so I knew she had time to help me. 

So I see Jasmine today when she starts her shift and I confront her why she didn’t finish the rest of the work for me. She responds with, “There was another part to do?” and now I’m just annoyed and face palming myself because I remember specifically walking her through the process because she is known to be a slow and oblivious worker. She is also known for not finishing her work and just handing it off to someone else because she works so slow and can’t meet deadlines. She also has worked at this company longer than I have. I also was told by others to stay away from her because of her bad habits but I have always given her the benefit of the doubt because I thought people were exaggerating and since we were cool with each other, I thought she would take one for the team for me and help me finish what I had started. This is also the first time I asked her to finish some work for me and she reluctantly agreed. Another time I asked her to finish something super simple, she kept giving me excuses and it literally was like pulling teeth to just get her to finish it.

So after I confronted her, I start to ask her some other questions because I wanted to see why she didn’t finish the other parts for me but she just started giving me excuses. So I start to get irritated and I knew she could sense in my voice that I was annoyed at her. This is also not the first time I’ve gotten annoyed at her. One time in the past I came off a little too strong at her because I kept having to repeat myself but I apologized afterwards and told her that I’m not the most patient person and that I am trying to work on that. But in this situation, she straight up just let me down. Like I can’t rely on her, which also means more work for me while she just sits around and does nothing. So then I start getting petty and my emotions are getting the best of me when Jasmine starts giving me stupid excuses on why she has to work specifically in my work area. I told her that she can work in the other room and can still accomplish what she needs to do with out getting in each other’s way. But she resisted the suggestion, so I involved another coworker because I wanted to prove Jasmine wrong. So now I really escalated the situation but it’s not like I started to blab about it. I just tried to keep my anger inside until I was able to take my lunch break. The other coworker I involved most likely didn’t even realize me and Jasmine were annoyed at each other.

Once I came back from lunch, I saw my boss taking her lunch so I sat down with her to chat a bit. But I noticed the conversation started to take a weird turn when she started to ask if I was doing okay and if I was okay with everyone working. Of course I told her everything is okay but then she starts to name drop and then I realized someone must have told her the situation between me and Jasmine. My main suspicious is most likely Jasmine went to our boss about it because I don’t think anyone else would say anything. I for one didn’t think about bringing it up to my boss at all because this is between me and a coworker. We are working, professional, adults and we can resolve it ourselves. I didn’t think to get my boss involved because first that is so childish and another reason is my boss doesn’t have time for stupid shit like this. However, my boss was dropping names so I told her a bit of my frustration because I am petty like that. I was thinking, if Jasmine thinks she can get me in trouble, well I have more dirt on her than she has on me. 

So now I’m here asking, what is the best thing to do? I honestly just wanted to keep my distance from Jasmine and just never ask her to do anything for me again or we both just figure it out between the two of us some other time. But instead, she is a little bitch and went and told the boss, so now I just lost all respect for her. She decided to take the cheap shot which is another thing that annoys me. Another thing too is now I’m most likely labeled as “difficult to work with” all because Jasmine had to be a narc. In reality, the only person I have a problem with at work is with Jasmine. I get along with all my other coworkers. Also me and Jasmine are the same age if that clarifies anything.

I'm also open for advice about me as a person and/or advice about work and/or the working world. I am a recent college graduate, so I know there's a lot to learn.

So earlier today I got fed up with working and doing school work all the time. Instead of going to class I went and got something to eat, drove myself up top a hill and just watched the sunset go down.

I took it all in and *felt* everything around me. Just enjoying the fresh air and being alive. It felt like the first genuine breath I've taken years.

I realized I constantly needed new experiences, like back in high school to remain simulated. It's a high I get from trying new things. And just waking up doing school work or going to work. No wonder I've been so depressed as of late.


But in that feeling alive I had some nicotine cravings ( I quit shisha awhile ago) and I was like

 ""why don't I get a cigarette to watch this sunset with?"" 

- but I didn't since cigarettes aren't healthy.


I also thought 

""I should ask my certain coworker for weed""

- but I'm not going to because my last dealer's stuff made me paranoid and it's illegal in my area.

I also thought.

""Since the girl I like isn't texting me right now, I should download tinder just for the potential ""new experiences"" that might be there""

- but I figured it was lame since I live with my parents and I'm one of those people who look good in person but takes horrible pictures.


My strongest though that I had while watching this sunset was 

""forget school, forget your parents. Take your car drive west until you reach a point where you have to figure out the rest yourself . Maybe even ask that girl you like to come with you""

- but we're both locked into this position in life. She has to work to maintain her apartment , and I have to finish school because my parents would rather bend all the way backwards than see me not finish college 


So all in all. I find life boring and not stimulating. I feel like maybe I'm not living life the right way or how I should be. I'm making safe choices to secure my future just to do the same ol same ol everyday , pretty much like how I am now. 

What do you think about life ? Is life too short to not smoke bud every once in awhile , or explore , or stay up all night playing videogames even though you have a 9 hour shift tomorrow , or get yourself in some serious shit where you have to rely on your wits to get yourself back on your feet? 

Or is life all about safe choices? Being praised for being a token civilian? Achieving goals such as getting a six pack , or graduating college?


I believe I'm on the path of the latter, but at the same time none of it makes me feel *truly* alive. I need to re-evaluate how I live my lif",20Oct2017,2
78,"First of all, this isn’t a case of identify theft nor is it a case of two similar email addresses being typo-ed. 

This situation has gone on for quite some time, maybe over a year now. My email address on gmail.com is my first name “.” my last name. It is a chinese name so there are literally thousands of people with the exact same combination of first name and last name. Now one quirk I’ve discovered in my researching this phenomenon I’m faced with is that gmail completely ignores periods in email addresses. So from gmail point of view my email address is both firstnamelastname@gmail.com or firstname.lastname@gmail.com. Both look the same to gmail and I can log onto my account using either. 

This brings us to my situation. I’ve been getting emails for another person with my same name but addressed to the email address without using periods. I have been and continue to use a period when I sign up for services or share my email account. I know this is another person. I know they aren’t stealing my identity because they have given this email to their children’s PTA who have subsequently been emailing me about their child’s upcoming activities. Other correspondence I receive are hotel notifications, flight reminders, and even some shopping cart save lists. 

I attempted to contact this person once by notifying their PTA that they are emailing the wrong person and that it is likely that the person they should be mailing thinks this is their email address. Needless to say it was an awkward email exchange trying to convey the misunderstanding and I begged the PTA to please let the parents know that they are misusing their email address. It didn’t resolve the situation. 

Now what really confounds me is why I continue to get emails from different, new services for this other person using my email address. They must have figured out by now that they aren’t receiving any of the notifications they should be expecting? I’m also getting new emails from school distribution lists for their kids. I keep requesting to be removed but I want to put a stop to it once and for all. 

Any advice on how best to resolve this situation?",20Oct2017,1
79,"Hey Reddit.

I'm a student going to school in San Francisco, and over a year ago I moved 700 miles out of my parents' house to live at my aunt and uncle's second house in the east bay, and it's the only family I have that live close enough to attend school (I still have nearly a 2hr commute each way via public transportation).

I don't own a car, and I struggle working as a freelance 3d character and environment artist against clients who just don't want to pay me. I'm making more than minimum wage, but that barely funds my commute/food/tuition at best, and my parents 700 miles away are struggling to help me due to their own debts. I have a $30k student loan, so dropping out isn't an option, and a year and a half to go until I graduate.

Today was my birthday, and after coming home from my grandparents taking me out to dinner (they love more than an hour the other direction from school - staying there isn't an option) my uncle was ""furious"" because I'd had a cooking issue the night before where I spilt grease in the bottom of the oven (I didn't realize - it was clear and I'd forgotten to clean it up and didn't realize the extent of it), but apparently that was his last straw after coming back from traveling and I'd done everything else they'd asked to a tee (feeding their fish, picking up mail, the house was cleaner when they got back than before they left, and my room is the only part of the house that's not 100% spotless, but they typically don't come in and I just had a few dishes).

While they haven't given me a time frame, they basically want me to find somewhere else to live, and judging from their suggestions they want me out sooner than later. I forgot to mention that these are my mom's aunt and uncle, not mine directly, so they're in there 70's and typically don't live here outside of coming to take care of their godchildren once a week who stop by for that specific day.

I just don't think I've done anything wrong, and if I'm forced out I'll literally be on the streets. I'm a full-time student and work full time freelance, and while it makes more than minimum wage, it isn't enough to live on in the slightest, especially around here. I just don't know what to do, and this was extremely unexpected, and ruined my birthday entirely to say the very least. My uncle has never really liked me, as far as I've been able to tell, though he's not a fan of people in general - my aunt, on the other hand, is extremely humanitarian and always opens her home to anyone who needs it, and she was reinforcing my uncle's suggestion that I figure out somewhere else to live.

I would fucking love to live on my own, and not have to rely on their house to stay at, but I just don't see how they think it's realistic or how I've been a bad tenant in any way outside of bad timing. My grades suffered last quarter due to my struggle to pay for my tuition but they were still passing, and every class up until then has been A's and B's, not that it matters for my degree.

I just don't know what to do. I'm blindsided and this is the last thing I was expecting of them, given they haven't even suggested it up until tonight. They know that I'm working on my degree and while I'd like to be progressing faster in my life, it's just not possible as a student. They think I sleep all day when I wake up at 6 and go to bed at 9:30 on a strict schedule. I run every morning and keep myself fit, and they think I'm lazy and sit on the computer all day. They think, when I'm working - on said computer - that I'm just on the internet all day doing nothing.

Happy fucking birthday, I guess. I just don't know what to do, and don't have the means to help myself out of this.",20Oct2017,0

83,"As some of you may know there is a whole #MeToo movement going on where people are coming forward w/ their stories of sexual assault. I was sexually assaulted 2 yrs ago by a drunk ex boyfriend, in front of a huge crowd at a party (most were friends) and no one did anything to help me. As a result I've removed myself from this group of ""friends"" and I've been doing ok, but not without copious hours of therapy. I didn't report him and b/c none of my friends did anything I felt like it was my fault that it happened, so I sort of buried it all.

I've been pretty inspired by all these stories and was wondering if it would be a good idea to post on my FB feed revealing him for who he is, I'm just afraid of the attention it will receive but I also think it will be a big step forward for me, personally.

89,"I work with two very similar organizations, both host Socializing/Networking events. They both target college students but each of them specifically targets certain programs of study. 

I single handedly run the marketing campaigns for both organizations and it was brought to my attention today by the head of one of the organizations that this is causing a conflict of interest. 

The events hosted by both organizations are very similar (they gather students and have them network with each other and with professionals, not much you can do with that) and hence the marketing strategies are very similar. And if I come up with a marketing strategy it almost always is viable for use for both organizations. This creates as an issue as now I have to prioritize on which organize I want to execute that idea because it is unacceptable by both organizations for them to be running the same marketing campaigns. 

I don't want to leave either organizations, I love working at both. I have friends from both and literally without me there would be 0 marketing done at both of them and that could potentially be a huge loss.

93,"My boyfriend of about 4 years has been feeling extremely down about himself recently. He is so smart and puts a ton of pressure on himself in school and professionally. He's starting to apply to jobs and grad schools and feels like he's run out of time to accomplish what he wish he could have and he expressed this very deep sadness about never feeling like he does enough. He also admitted that he's felt this way, more or less, since high school. For him to be open about being this down about himself is unusual and alarming as he typically is pretty quiet about his deep emotions (not in a super unhealthy way, he's just not one to constantly elaborate on this kind of stuff, he's a quiet guy overall). I know this stressful time is bringing this feeling out more than he typically allows, but nevertheless, he is looking at it in such an unconquerable way, even though he's basically brilliant and truly an inspiring person. He says it's a waste of time to give himself any credit. How can I convince him otherwise?

94,"So I'm going to preface this by saying this is by no means an attempt to humble brag, I genuinely need advice and want to provide as much information as possible. Skip to the end for tl;dr

All my life I've been generally good at just about everything I try. ""Now wait UnsafeHaven, I don't see how this could be a problem,"" you say. The problem that this has produced is that I find myself having a hard time putting in the effort when things get tough. I'm so used to things coming easily to me that when they get difficult, I generally give up and move on to something new. I can't commit to anything and it's starting to cause a lot of problems in my life.

I have an extremely high overall IQ, but my processing speed is well below average. At first everything is easy to me, then exponentially begins to require more and more effort as concepts grow more advanced. By the time I'm learning intermediary concepts I'm spending twice as much time figuring them out as my peers. 

By the time I reach advanced concepts I'm spending up to ten times as much effort to learn them as others who struggled with the basic concepts. 

As a result of this I've gathered a highly varied base of skills, but for almost all of them the knowledge doesn't extend past basic or intermediate concepts. It's becoming incredibly frustrating, because I find I don't have anything I can be truly proud of. They say that no matter what you do there's always someone who knows more, but with everything I do I'm average at best.

I'm 4 years into a degree in computer science, and when I started I was top of my class with minimal effort, but just recently I set the bottom of the curve of one of my classes.

TL;DR is that I excell at beginning to learn a skill, but struggle far more than my peers at mastering it. I don't know how people can become so passionate about a topic, as the difficulty curve always seems to dissuade me from truly exploring anything. 

My question is: how do you do it? How do you decide what your ""thing"" is? How do you stick to it when things get rough? Where does that drive come from?

Again, not a humble brag, this issue is genuinely ruining my life. My relationship with my family is strained to the point of snapping, I'm listless in just about everything I do. I just can't seem to find something I love.",20Oct2017,1

98,"My fathers girlfriend left the house 10 minutes after me in the morning and I saw her waiting down the end of the street. A man in a trade vehicle stopped and she got in. She’s Chinese and she apparently only has Chinese female friends from her English school-which she’s supposedly at every day. There’s never been any mention of another guy and my dad would certainly not be happy about her being picked up by some guy so I really doubt that he knows about the guy. 
Also a bunch of things in the past few months that are slightly suspicious that have already lead me to have suspicions about her cheating on my dad.
Morally is it wrong to turn a blind eye?
I don’t want to get involved because it’s not my business and also it’s a drama I would like to avoid until I move away. But if it was me I wouldn’t want someone to turn a blind eye.
If I was to do anything I would probably only approach her and casually mention that I saw her down the street and ask her who her friend was or something?
In the few months that I have known her she’s always been very nice to me and stood up for me, cared about me. I have a really strained relationship with my father who I am currently living with and don’t particularly like, also haven’t had much contact with him while growing up. I am now in my mid 20s. I don’t know if this is relevant to what I do or don’t do.

99,"Basically my sister left her phone in a driver's car, driver proceeded to make 0 effort to return it, and often ignored phone calls, emails, and texts asking to setup a time to give the phone back.

We were trying to get it back for several days before my sister grew frustrated and told him to THROW it away, (I will explain my emphasis later). It has been 2 weeks since the incident and suddenly he contacts me asking for our personal account info so he can get into the phone and use it himself, (account info on phones has card info and other personal identifiers. Easy fraud.)

My sister obviously wasn't too happy because she feels he was avoiding meeting with us to get it back on purpose, the driver and his daughter are angry because they believe my sister only wants her phone back because they want to use it now.

Essentially, we filed a police report and reported the phone stolen. When I initially called, the dispatcher told me to ""Call back later"" because she thinks, ""he wasn't trying to steal it. He probably just thought you didn't want it"", which is weird to me because I was pretty sure that by law, theft is when you take someone else's belongings with the intention of keeping it, (which he made clear through his actions). He also sent me a text saying ""Sorry, you can't have the phone"", which pretty much sent my sister through the roof.

Essentially my question is, what would happen if they're caught with the phone? I'm not exactly sure how we would track it down since corporate isn't likely to help, but I assume if they take the phone to a store somewhere to continue trying to unlock it to use it, the phone will appear as stolen and the police would be called. I'm not sure about all of this, I've never had a phone stolen before. :/


P.S. I put emphasis on the ""throw away"" because the dispatcher said that we ""technically said that anybody can have it"", and I feel that is false. If we said they can have it, or if we told them to GIVE it away, I would agree, but since we explicitly instructed them to destroy/discard the phone so my sister can replace it, (and they decided to keep it because of their own assumptions,) it is still theft. I wanted to point that out in case anybody else had the same idea or question.

P.P.S. The only offer he ever made was at the time of initial contact, and that was to go to his house and get the phone. We weren't comfortable going to a stranger's house and let him know that we could meet in a public setting. He agreed and never showed up, and every time thereafter never answered a call, text, or email, and the ones he did answer he declined the meeting spot, (Tmobile store, McDonald's, etc. etc.).



Edit: Other than the police report and extended exchanges with the driver, I'm not sure what else I can do. We would track the phone, but my sister never installed the gps tracking app that came on the phone. Is there another way we can find it and cancel the police report? We didn't want to bring the police in this in the first place if they had just given it back...",20Oct2017,1

This then opened up the flood gates and everyone started chiming in.

112,"Okay so obvious throwaway account. I am currently going through a really tough point in life.

I'm always quite bad in the morning when I first wake up and normally I'm okay for the rest of the day...most of the time. Anyway the health anxiety has gone now but this stomach problem is persisting. I know it's related to my stress levels as whenever I'm feeling bad it gets awful and really loose (excuse the TMI). Then when I'm feeling less stressed everything is calmer. I went to a gastro who simply said IBS. The absolute bullshit term I cannot abide and don't even really believe it at all. My biggest problem though is that I've now developed a phobia of diarrhea. It's truly awful but I fear it everywhere I go and it has a truly huge impact on my life. I pop Imodium like Smarties whenever I have to go anywhere. I used to have bowels of steel and nothing ever bothered my guts. Now I'm like a shadow of my former self and I'm obsessed with it.

113,"This year I am a freshman in college and I live with three other guys in school-sponsored housing.  Due to my ""situation,"" my parents and I decided it would be best to request a roommate in a similar situation.  Unfortunately, the school does not have any other students in a similar situation living in their housing, so instead, they paired me up with the RA.  The RA and I have a shitton of shared interests and actually became fast friends, the only problem is that he has been living in the same cluttered apartment for the past six months and I am brand new.  How do I tell him to keep all of his shit organized and out of the common area?  At first, it didn't really bother me cuz that's pretty much how my home life was (I'm one of four with a shitton of pets there was no way was the house staying clean for long lmao), but now, three months in, I am feeling super overwhelmed by the lack of space.  Even though my house was a cluttered mess, I could always return to my own room and have it as clean or as messy as I wanted.  Now, the common areas are piled high with mainly his junk.

It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't also share a bedroom, which is equally as cluttered.

118,"Sorry it’s long (in an epic way) but it relates to a serious problem I (50M) have with my (22F) employee.  We work in a large company within a very fast paced industry...  it’s tough to get to the top.

Background: I’m a fat, balding 50 yr old that has never had problems attracting/dating girls.  I’ve churned through more meaningless relationships than a decent person would do, and had a habit in the past of attracting the wrong girls (because to be honest I was the wrong guy).

I’ve almost reached the highest I can in my company...  don’t love the company...  but have a good reputation in the industry.

I settled down about 10 years ago after playing the field over and over...  great wife now...  three awesome kids...   great career (always had a great career)...  BUT:

A new girl came in my team about 3 months ago and she’s is young and stupid, but to be honest she has lots of potential in her field.

The first month was fine,  she was settling in...  but her over-confidence and inappropriate behaviour went too far today.

Let me explain...

About 2 months ago she was visibly upset on the Monday so I pulled her aside to see what was going on.  She apologised and said it was “relationship problems”.  I terminated the conversation as quickly as I could because to be honest I’m not a “feeling manager”...  I don’t really care about her relationship problems. Not good, but true.

Over the next week she’s chatty...  she seems to have gotten over whatever upset her and then one day she comes into my office to apologise for Monday “but my boyfriend stayed out the whole weekend and all I wanted him to do was come home and pull my hair and spank my ass -  that’s not too much to ask is it?”

I terminated the conversation without responding and to be honest it made me feel uncomfortable because by my measure my wife would have been pissed off hearing that. (Thus the throwaway because my wife would be furious if she knew this).

Over the next week a few things happened like her showing me photos of her scantily clothed friends as examples of what they wear when they go out clubbing “I might get slutty but I don’t dress slutty like that.”

Again,  uncomfortable...

She has an Asian boyfriend and commented to me one day, “I love him but I want to be man-handled sometimes,  you know,  used by a bigger man.”

Uncomfortable!  In hindsight I should have addressed the problem at this point but i didn’t and it’s continued.

She has met my wife when my wife came to the office one day and flatly said to me afterwards, “she’s hot,  I bet you guys are at it every night.”

At that point I said “Thats inappropriate [insert name here]. Please try to maintain some professionalism,” which she just made a joke out of.

Now she says stuff like, “I know I have to be professional but my boyfriend is taking me away this weekend and I’m ready for it!”

Another time she said (about her upcoming holiday), “We’re going to Tokyo so it’s pointless to be unprofessional and sneak away from my boyfriend because I’m hardly going to find a big cock in Japan!”

I’m serious...  this has been getting worse and worse...

So today was the Clanger...  and I feel like I need to take some action,  but it’s difficult.

I could hear her and a colleague talking outside my office door about elite sports men taking steroids blah blah blah... later she come into my office and says, “my friends boyfriend takes steroids.  Is it true guys on ‘roids need to cum like three times a day?”

I said, “I have no idea,  I’m busy,  close the door.”

Then she comes out and says, “she’s going to dump him because she hates the taste of cum [pauses then laughs as she says], but I love it”.

So we all know it’s gone too far but I am certain I won’t be believed if I raise it with HR.

Even if they believed it and tried subtle action no one else is going to believe it.

I’ve mentioned some of it with a trusted colleague and his only response was, “I heard her say something about hair pulling (I mentioned that incident, but not the seriousness of others) but didn’t know what she was on about.  Just go ahead and fuck her!”

The company culture is a bit like that.  One manager in a different region was caught fucking his PA at the companies annual conference and it was laughed off as “Fuck mate,  keep it private.”

So...  what I’ve done:

- I can’t completely avoid contact with her but every now and then it’s unavoidable to go out of the office for meetings with her clients

- I am diarising each of these incidents but frankly it won’t help me if it all turns to shit

- I stay away from her as much as possible but a few days ago someone in the office said to me “do you have a problem with [insert her name here] because I’ve noticed you’re very cold towards her.

I’m m not an indecisive person,  I am usually in control of every situation BUT human instinct tells me to fuck the living daylights out of her,  the loving husband and father tells me not to be a complete idiot,  the professional in me tells me to get rid of her as soon as I can and the realist in me tells me this is not going to end well.

I feel like the hunter has become hunted, and it’s like I am being tested to the extreme in many different ways.

Advice would be appreciated.

I’m anxious about the next steps!

He thinks I'm a few years older than I actually am, but I'm not sure how old he thinks I am because it's relatively irrelevant to our conversations.There's nothing sexual about our friendship to me, although he throws hints that he's interested in something sexual here and there, which I casually dismiss because i didn't really give a fuck since he lives a flight away. 

We usually snapchat and he's recently discovered how DANG CHEAP flights are to my city... and he booked them without asking me anything??? I feel extremely pressured to 1. meet him even though I wouldn't feel comfortable at all to meet him, if I'm completely honest 2. have some sort of sexual thing with him, which I'd rather not because I like him as strictly a friend and obviously I'm a kid and he's an adult that's just really deceiving and putting him into a shitty position (legally)... I have this gut feeling that I shouldn't meet him and it's freaking me the fuck out. 

But you see, I can't really tell him ""I know you made an effort to meet me and spent money on it, but I don't feel comfortable meeting you"" because he's genuinely a really nice guy and I think I've made a mistake on my part not being completely honest with him. 

I'm so lost if I should just meet up with him really quick for a lunch but that seems rude to me for the flights and hotel he's booked.

We have somewhat opposite personalities, but in a good way. She honestly intimidates me a bit but that's another reason why I like her, she's not afraid to speak her mind and call bullshit when she sees it which is something that I can't do.

I'm starting to realize now that I'm crushing on her. I get excited whenever she talks to me, simple things like her commenting on a social media post I made brightens my day, and I always look forward to working with her. 

This is where the unhealthy part comes in though. I can't stop thinking about her. I'm always wondering what she's doing. If I'm going out to eat or going to an event or something, I'll often be daydreaming about what it'd be like if she were here, what we'd be talking about or what we'd be doing, things like that. I'll often post pictures of my dog on social media in hopes that she responds to it. Stuff like that.

I don't mean to be this obsessed with her, I just think she's a really, really cool person. I sometimes think she likes me too but in reality that's probably just me seeing hints from her that aren't really there, just her being friendly. I don't want this to turn into a stalking situation or something crazy. Even talking about it right now makes me realize how bad it might've already gotten, or maybe I'm over-reacting and this is normal behavior. I don't know because I've never felt this way about someone before.

The reason why I'm so worried about this is because when I was growing up, I was constantly emotionally abused by my parents. It made me lose lots of confidence in myself and now I have trouble showing affection or trusting people. Because of this I've never really tried dating and pretty much suppressed all of my past crushes because I just assumed that they'd think I was a creep or loser. I'm constantly doubting myself too. It took me months to even build up the courage to add her on social media because I was so afraid of her being creeped out.

The reality is that we're not really all that close. We're somewhere between colleague and casual friend. We joke around at work a lot and she's given me rides home a few times but we've never really done anything together outside of work. She's a lot closer to the other employees there and does things with them outside of work. That's why I feel like this crush is becoming unhealthy.

Is this normal behavior for people who have crushes? Am I bordering over-stepping my boundaries? I don't want to fuck up and do or say something stupid to her. I really like her even if we're just friends and don't know what to make of this thing I have for her. I don't think we're close enough for me to tell her any of this either which is why I'm posting this here. I really need help figuring this out.

TL;DR: I recently realized that I have a crush on my co-worker. I think she's amazing and think that our somewhat opposite personalities work well together. It's gotten to the point where I daydream about us being together and I often find myself thinking about what she's doing. I think my behavior comes from emotional abuse that I suffered throughout my life and now I have trouble showing affection. The reality is that we're only casual friends at best and I don't want to create tension between us because I really admire her, even if we're just friends.

I'm aware that this is or could potentially lead to unhealthy thoughts and behavior. I'm trying to tread very carefully through this because I don't want to ruin our friendship. I'm asking for advice because I'm at a loss on what to do next. I'd love to date her but I don't think my chances are very high and I don't want this crush to take over my mind.",20Oct2017,7

131,"Hi Reddit, I have a conundrum;

I have a girlfriend who I’ve been with for 2 years, yet I am living in China for a year as part of my degree. She is in England, and when I return we are planning on moving in with each other. This isn’t my issue, however

I am an *incredibly* sexual person. I can have sex 2+ times/day, every day. She is more of a ‘3 times a week’ kinda girl, and this doesn’t bother me too much, when I’m home.

However, she refusing to engage in any sexual activity over the phone/internet/etc. What I mean is, there’s only so often you can masturbate to porn before you want a personal connection. She has sent me 2 nudes in the 2 months (so far) that I have been here. She refuses to do FaceTime sex, or even do sexual chat on messages or w/e. 

I absolutely love her to pieces, but I am only human and can’t go a full year without a sexual connection. Every time I say to her stuff on the phone along the lines of “oh babe I’m horny” - the response is usually “why is everything about sex?!” Or words to that effect. 

Any advice for a horny bastard? I really don’t want to cheat on her, but I get more and more annoyed when she spurns my advances and makes me feel like a pervert (I maybe bring up sexual conversations perhaps once a week?) that I’m not sure how long I can wait, especially when I’m drunk and my mind is inhibited.

I've always been told that I am some kind of a phenom.  Everyone around me has always remarked at how this, or how that I am.  It's flattering.  Things come easy.  First fucking world problem, bitch.

I don't really have any concern at all that I can do or be successful at things.  Anything really.  Mental, physical, endurance, strength, pain... 

But EVERY SINGLE FUCKING time I start to do something I almost immediately torpedo myself.  That or I quit unless there's been some kind of impending doom that's keeping me around.  But when the chips are down, fuck me running...I don't even bother to figure anything out, it's like I already knew how it works and I do it well.  When I'm thrown something new/important my first try is usually very good.   It's also unfortunately almost exclusively my best.  I don't think it's for lack of trying but I get worse at things the more I do them.

Fuck, I don't know, maybe I am such a bitch that I can't stick with anything to actually get to the point where I am good at it.  Maybe I am some magnified Genx-millenial megadouche.  Maybe this is what everyone else goes through but they just figure it out and I haven't.

But at this point i'm not sure what I am telling myself, what I believe, what's real, what I can do, and what my friends/family think I can do.

I think that if I can really find something productive to focus on it might snap me into the opposite side of this fucking stupid feedback loop of negativity.  But that also sounds like a cop out.  The dumbest part of all of this is that I DO HAVE THINGS TO FOCUS ON.  I have 3 viable businesses that I have committed to starting or are in process.  I have a job that pays bills.  I have a phenomenal girlfriend.

All I know is that I haven't made any real progress in the past year.  I know that I have been losing confidence and consciously choosing to isolate myself.  I will literally make almost any excuse to sit at home isolated and not engaging in anything that I need to or should do.

I've also tried to not edit this like it's some kind of a professional email and just say real words for once.

Probably not even the right sub.  At least point me the right way.

144,"Asking this not because im looking for a specific answer, but because I actually need advice. Some backstory here so skip to the end if you just want the run down.

Im 22 years old. Never haven't lived at home due to just circumstances which are kind of out of my control/lacking drive and or friends who wanted to move out. Last winter I started going back to community college so I could transfer and move to a state school. I got accepted to the state school last month with plans to move in, however the cost seems so high that I feel like its not a good idea. Im not sure I want to do that anymore. I feel like people I know have had success without going to college or going for stupid degrees. 

For instance, I knew this girl who got a bachelors degree at some art school and now she lives in California as an administrative law assistant.  

Pretty much I don't want to spend 100k in the next 3 1/2 years (tuition and board) if I don't have to. I like school and have been doing well but it just doesn't seem worth the price at all.

152,"A bit of back story: I was very successful in high school and made it to a great college, but only because I was ""guided"" very strongly by my parents and directed exactly what to do with my time and energy. However, when I got to college I struggled with mental health issues and without the rigid external structure I was used to I crashed and burned. (though I did learn a lot about myself, oddly enough).

I am currently on a gap year and doing well. I am going to therapy (honestly haven't found it helpful, but focusing on exercise and work has made me feel closer to mentally ""normal"") and working about 45 hours a week doing warehouse work.

However, I am struggling finding enough time and energy to go through with everything I want to do, even though I've cut a lot of time from the ""reddit/goofing off"" category. This inability to do things outside of work has really been getting to me for about a month now.

Aside from work, sleep, and exercise, I find that on workdays I only have about 1-2 hours max of time left. Non-work days are pretty much free but I feel burnt out from working during the week. (I usually have 3-day weekends though, work 10 hour shifts 4x a week).

In my free time, I want to both self-study computer science and work on personal programming projects (to improve my career prospects down the line) and teach myself music production as a hobby.

I don't have any other commitments or hobbies, so it feels like I should be able to find adequate time for these two things, yet I'm still struggling. Should I completely ditch music production to make adequate time to work on my computer science skills?

165,"I grew up in a very dysfunctional household headed by a profoundly mentally ill man. We all are diagnosed with bipolar disorder: my father is Bipolar Type I, and my siblings and I are Bipolar Type II. My entire childhood was one of violence, fear, and confusion, as rules and regulations in the house could change at any given point. I moved out at 17 as soon as it was time to go to college.

Well, I got a phone call the other day, and my mom's finally decided to divorce him. She's put up with more than 30 years of domestic violence, financial theft, emotional abuse, alcoholism, and watching him threaten to kill his children (and that's when he's *on* his medications!). The final straw came when, with the help of some relatives, she discovered he's had a mistress for a while now and has started doing cocaine. (Well, that and he made a complete ass out of himself while drunk and manic at my cousin's wedding, but that's a whole other story...)

I'm so happy she's finally getting him out of our lives. He's on a month-long business trip, so she's taking the time to consult with an attorney.
Only problem is she can't figure out exactly how to leave him when she gets back: whether or not to just leave a not or to confront him in person.

The first option could mean her physical safety, but he could also smash everything and burn down the house (something I could honestly see him doing, I don't think my mom's being paranoid there).

The second option could make sure he wouldn't burn down the house, but he could also commit a murder-suicide (again, something I could totally see my dad doing) with one of his 27 firearms that he's stocked up for the eventual political armageddon he's been predicting.

169,"I am in a bit of a confusing and unfamiliar situation. I am a 23 year old recent college graduate who's girlfriend is finishing her final college semester and is likely pregnant. I feel in need of some guidance but in order to ask for advice w/ some clarity, I believe some background information is probably in order:  
  
  
I graduated from college in May, 2017, with a B.S. in Biology (minors in Chemistry and Mathematics) and a 3.8 GPA. My current position at a tree nursery is ending and I have been applying to various new positions. However, the fact that my girlfriend is likely pregnant has obviously complicated things. She is from Rhode Island and I am originally from D.C. I may potentially have a job opportunity in Boston as a research assistant in a high level biomedical lab, or alternatively may have a job as a Teaching Fellow at a charter school in DC. Neither will pay extraordinarily well for the cost of living in the area (about $30,000). The research position could launch me into a PhD program in a couple of years, which would be desirable (I love studying and want to get my PhD some day) but would likely come with an even smaller salary, probably around 20-25,000.   
  
Also, I have the opportunity to sit for an aptitude test for an electrical apprenticeship in DC. I am extremely confident that I will get every single question correct on this test given that it is concerned with basic algebra and reading comprehension and may likely get into an apprenticeship program.   
  
So, my question is this: which path is the best one to choose from if I am going to be a father soon? I know electricians make very solid pay, though if I went the electrician route I would pretty much be giving up on any ambitions towards getting a PhD in the sciences. Teaching would never really provide any upward trajectory in terms of finances, though I enjoy teaching. The research route is a great intellectual opportunity but may have the lowest financial payoff and I am not sure that it is feasible to do a PhD program with an infant child. **So, in which direction should I head?**
  
Finally, my girlfriend's family (in Rhode Island) is larger and probably able to provide more emotional support for her and for the child, though my family (in DC) can probably provide more financial support if need be. **To which area should we relocate once my girlfriend graduates in December?**

170,"So basically how I got suspended was last year I needed to work on a project for TSA. The project was that I needed to create a musical production and my group and I chose to create a beat. I used FL studio and downloaded it at home and brought it in on a flash drive. When I tried to open it at school, it said I needed administrative privileges to run said program. I didn't think much of it at the time so just created another account with administrative privileges.  After we finished the project, nothing happend. However, the next year (current year) the principle alerted everyone that doing this was against the rules to everyone, but this is a new year so he reimaged (wiped) all computers for everyone to get a fresh start.  So I never accessed the account until 2 days ago when I needed files off the account for a huge inventor project which required some pieces/parts from last year. I didn't think the account was still going to be there but when I tried using the old login it allowed me back into the account. This must have set off some kind of alarm because 5 minutes later the tech team came in an basically immediately checked the whole computer., and I received a 5 day suspension from school along with a friend who did the same thing for the same reason last year. My parents are very strict and they've already taken away everything electronic that I owned. They also won't listen to anything I tell them. Is there anything I could do/say that would lighten them up or any advice on the whole situation?

tl;dr - Got suspended for creating a local user on a pc at school with administrative privileges. Account was created last year. Parents are very upset, and don't listen to anything I try to tell them.

172,"TL;DR at bottom

Before I explain the situation, I’d just like to say I’m not a complete asshole, my good friend (we’ll call her Amy) did follow-up with some good qualities of myself but just hearing that I’m a selfish person, then looking back on past actions and realizing she’s right is completely humbling and devastating, especially since my parents had always preached being kind and considerate to everyone and to “treat others the way you’d want to be treated”. 

So anyways, yesterday was my birthday. I received some nice bday msgs and wishes from friends and family. Then Amy reached out. Her and I were good friends in high school (should add I’m a sophomore in College) but drifted since she went back for a victory lap and I went off to College. No biggie, we still kept in touch. Her bday msg was the first form of contact from her in quite awhile, so I asked jokingly where she’d disappeared to. She replied with: 

“I think we’re old and mature enough now handle the truth of why I distanced myself” 

As soon as I read that msg, I knew I’d obviously done something wrong. So I asked for the truth. It started off alright. The distancing between us was natural as we went different ways in life. She noted how I’m naturally a funny guy and always knew how to make her smile cuz of it and that regardless of what anyone told me, I was always calm when people told me something. From there she drops the bomb that all my negative qualities far outweighed the positive ones and is the reason why her, along with the 3 other friends from our friend group distanced themselves with me (I assumed we all drifted from each other but found out they all still talk daily). She notes how I was very selfish and self-centered in high school: 
- I only did things if they had a benefit to me, to her it seemed never out of the goodness of my heart
- People would listen to me rant and rave about my problems but I very rarely reciproated
- I talked a lot of shit about people to other people behind their backs
- While funny, she noted I beat a lot of jokes into the ground, but continued to use them because I found them funny
- Everything had to revolve around me and my schedule
- I rarely considered others feeling or reactions when making a decision

After reading that, the only thing I could say was I needed examples for this, not only cuz I was in disbelief, but also cuz my memory in general is garbage. Needless to say I got more than enough examples to prove my actions. Amy noted that her and our 3 other friends considered telling me to fix myself, but since it was so close to us graduating they agreed to “put up with me” (that stung the most) and then drift naturally. 

It was incredibly humbling to have heard all this, especially since all of it was true and totally goes against how my parents had tried to raise me growing up and against the type of person I’ve envisioned myself becoming. I thanked her for the brutal honesty and immediately broke down into tears. Even though these past actions where from 2-3 years ago, a lot of them still hang around today and that’s when I realized I’m a monster. I’m nowhere close to being the person that I should and I’ve been living a lie. 

I don’t know how, but Amy knew I was struggling with this and started suggesting some things I do. Mainly that I need to take a step back from everything and reinvent myself, find my self worth and learn to love my new, built up self again. 

So this is where I turn to you reddit, and ask how do I go about doing all this, I actually don’t have the slightest clue, other than this is a wake-up call for me and I need to change. Any other suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated.

Good friend told me I was a selfish person in high school, I realized they’re right and I want to change but don’t know how to go about doing it

177,"Helloo,
So, I have this internet friend, we've been knowing eachother for 2 years and we are really close, closer than I am with my real-life friends. We are both struggling with mental health issues while we're trying to survive our last year of high school. 
Her family is absolute crap. I think her mother doesn't give a shit about her, which is why this is happening. 
We usually communicate via Twitter - and there's the issue: I've been extremely inactive in the past couple days because I'm studying my ass off, but she's always active there. And I think she's starting to develop an eating disorder or something. I mean, I just took my first study break in 3 days and looked at her tweets - most of them are about her not eating, being excited about not having to eat and so on... 

The thing is, I'm obviously trying to be there for my friend. I just don't know how. She hates help. She doesn't really want to talk about it to me because she knows that I have problems and am stressed. She doesn't want any advice or pity or whatever (she literally tweeted that it's not a call for help because she doesn't want anyone to stop her from starving... haha). But she still wants attention, right? I mean, she says that she doesn't want attention, she wants people to understand her and her boundaries through that.. oh my god my brain hurts.
 
I don't know anymore. I think my approach to her twitter vents is always to text her and to ask her what's going on, I tell her to eat and to take care of herself because I'm worried and I want her to be happy and whatnot. 
It's sooo difficult knowing that you have a suicidal, depressed, anxious, soon-to-be anorexic friend hundreds of miles away from you. I've told her so many times to please go to a therapist, or a doctor, or anyone. 

I know I can't make her do what I want her to do, that's wrong. But I want her to be better, I feel like she doesn't want to be better, though. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to help. I'm scared to say anything anymore, she'll just end up being annoyed by me. I'm probably going to just make it worse.

I'm sorry for this long text, I don't know how to shorten it ;( But thank you to everyone reading. Please give me advice on that friendship. ",20Oct2017,11
178,"I started seeing my therapist through a neighboor.

The therapist normally charges a $20 copay but has waved it since I am friends with his neighboor. He just charges my insurance so I pay nothing out of pocket to see him.

That being said he is extremely flakey. I’ve been seeing him for 6 weeks and he’s rescheduled 6 times. These are same day cancellations too. As in we are scheduled to meet at 10am and he texts at 7am saying he needs to reschedule. (He has no secretary so all appointments are made in person and all communication is through personal calls and texts.)

We can usually reschedule for the very next day. However it really irritates me. I’m not sure if he treats all his clients like this or if it’s just me since I’m not paying a copay. He’s mentioned he only cancels when he’s contagious or when there’s an emergency at the hospital (patients he needs to access). I’m not sure if he’s aware he cancels so frequently, or maybe he’s too busy too admit. 

I have really bad anxiety issues and I typically look forward to my appointments all week. It is a very big dissapointment when he cancels. I feel as though a therapists role is to provide a safe stable place in a clients otherwise tumultuous world and that this is unacceptable. I don’t understand how a therapist can get away with or justify acting like this.

180,"I thought this would be the best place to put it-- please tell me if it should go somewhere else.

I am a high school senior very worried about getting into a good college. I have somewhat decent grades and extracurriculars, but I don’t know how to spin my life in a way that would not risk my chances of getting into one. 

Up to now, I have had a lot of hidden struggles, and could not find much on how to address my specific situation-- they have been lifelong problems, so coming up is a (long) stream of consciousness. For context, I am a first-generation Asian American born female.

I lived with my mom and cousins in a cramped house in the city for the first few years of my life. Since we were poor, they had to work a lot so I ended up switching a lot of hands. My dad immigrated to the US around when I was three-- I don’t remember it but from what I’ve heard, that’s when hell broke loose. I was a child who loved crying a lot and my dad would beat me for crying, which ended up in a vicious cycle (he has used a belt, thrown me on the floor and in trash cans, left my whole backside black and blue, gave me a scar, etc). No one did much about it, and I did not know what was normal.

My dad then decided to have a sudden move to the midwest and took my mom and me. I switched classes three times that year for first grade and ended up having minimal friends as I had to remain with the same people for the rest of elementary school. I was gullible, trusted everyone immediately, and was timid from my dad’s actions, so I was bullied a lot. From all of this, I developed a mindset that has stayed with me: Avoid pain-- immediately. I started procrastinating and not turning in work, and I grew really good at hiding things that would end in punishment (I did forgery and documentation manipulating by third grade). However, I could not hide everything and continued to be physically punished until I was twelve. I also continued to exchange hands as my parents could not care for me, as we were still poor. When I was in second/third grade, I was molested by the caregivers’ teenage grandson up until I switched places again. My mom would take me to gambling late into the night on weekends (and would drag me out of the house if I refused), then I would be blamed by both parents (???) for letting her go gamble and would get punished. I was also not allowed to do anything on my own, play no games (zero tolerance) and any activity perceived as masculine was not allowed-- any interests I had eventually faded. I still did not know what was normal.

Since my parents basically follow every Asian stereotype and more, they pushed me hard to apply to one of the best schools in the city that would allow me to start high school courses two years early. I got in and that’s when everything started changing-- my parents did not physically punish me anymore, became completely distant, and gave me “free reign.” They also started comparing me to everyone else’s children, pestered me about success at regular intervals (eg, the infamous become a doctor or engineer talks), and were annoyed that I had no tangible skills or interests (again, I was not allowed to do anything before). I had a very rough time in high school, as I had issues (and still have) with making decisions as all of them were made for me before. There were many opportunities as it was a very good school (I do not regret being forced to apply, and now I understand the very real merits of going to a top tier school), but I took none of them from my indecisiveness, lack of interest, and continued naivete. Thankfully, I gained some critical thinking in high school and knew a few people who helped me eventually realize what sort of situation I was in. Although my parents were not physical anymore, they made up for it in other ways. I was now constantly held to double standards, and our views diverged-- I became more and more liberal, and they conservative and traditional. They were also racist, homophobic, sexist, and everything in between and took many opportunities to show it (for perspective, they supported and still support Trump).

That was a huge problem for me. I could say I certainly had depression, but it was stigmatized. I discovered that I was trans, did not want to fit a traditional female role, and was also gay-- a triple no. I had many diverse friends-- another no. I was suddenly very interested in the arts at one point and not math-- also a no. Every issue I had ever brought to my parents was shot down and blamed on me, so I learned to never tell them anything (or trust adults), so I always kept to myself. I tried to get out of this pit by sheer willpower, and joined a bunch of extracurriculars to try to make myself more well-rounded and clung to the hope that I would eventually be good/interested in something-- I acted like nothing was wrong all the time, and to others I probably just looked liked another socially awkward kid who laughed too much. However, it was not enough-- I was still the same person from elementary school who could never do any work, had no real interests, and could never talk to anyone. I was a dilettante who never got high level positions and a bad student who alienated all my teachers by never speaking, doing the basics, and seemingly caring less and less about the class as the year went on. Every time I tried (and I tried many times, and am still trying), a mental and physical weight seemed to push me under and leave me to die.

I also experience mental dissonance every day over how I should act towards my parents-- am I really ungrateful, or do I have a valid excuse to be distant and potentially not contact them when I’m older when they provide me food, shelter, and resources (I am an only child)? One one hand, I was treated terribly as a child and have continued emotional unfulfillment. On the other, they are also my family who let me hangs out with friends, have fun at concerts, and let me never have to worry about food or doing the chores. I feel like it’s bad but not bad enough to warrant me a pass from doing poorly and acting negatively.

Now, as a high school senior who is almost 18, I feel like I am at a crossroads. College is a significant part of success, and I want to be able to go to the best ones in order to ensure it. How do I show myself as a good candidate when the only visible thing is that I didn’t try hard enough in school? How do I ask for recommendations when all the teachers see is me seemingly blowing off their class? I know that most colleges are extremely wary of people who may be emotionally unstable, so I feel like telling my story would affect my chances negatively.

I have always wanted to get help, but with it also came the fear of potentially risking my somewhat decent life for a worse one. I have heard horror stories of requests for help from appropriate authorities ending up with a situation less optimal from before, and as a very anxious person, I never wanted to try. That is why I am asking for advice for both the present and the future on Reddit. Please share all your thoughts, and if you need more info, please ask.

My first shift at my first job was yesterday and it was much more difficult than I expected. I'm working at a very popular cafe and basically I'm in charge of cleaning all the tables, the bathrooms, the floor, taking the dishes to the back, restocking, talking to the customers and stuff. My first shift started right when the busiest hour started and ended 30 minutes after closing. It was so busy I didnt get a chance to take a break or get any water for most of my shift. it is a part time job technically so I'm pretty sure breaks arent mandatory, but I worked for almost 6 hours on my feet the whole time. 

my question is, does it get easier ? I know ill get faster with clearing tables because of muscle memory but its a lot of balancing responsibilies and its not like I have a ""buffer time"" to learn or be a bit slow at the beginning because if im not taking care of tables constantly it brings the whole rest of the team down too",20Oct2017,4

I love my wife dearly but I can’t ignore the facts. My wife suffers with chronic shoulder and neck pain from a condition known as Chiari malformation. She had it when we meet and it wasn’t an issue for the most part, she was only limited to driving for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.  We ensured for her condition to live less that a 20min drive without highway to her job and this worked fine until 18 months ago. She has lost the ability to drive to the point we sold her car and for the most part somedays do anything at all due to pain meds. We tried to use medical cannabis but she goes out of body when she uses with cbd doing nothing for her. I fear she will get worse and I can’t stop it. Than we come to me.

I am a very tall person with constant back pain, doctor will not go near pain meds for not because he doesn’t believe me but I will need them for the rest of my life. I’m bi-polar making outburst more colorful then needed and my lows near suicidal, I cannot be on meds for this or I lose my mind and my job.

191,"I began a new job last week, good opportunity, and I was enjoying it.  Day 3, I'm paired up with this frumpy old gal who seemed like she'd been there forever, and was a bit rough around the edges.  Fair enough.

She spent the next two hours not only NOT training me, but also making snide remarks (in front of and TO our customers) about everything I was doing wrong.  Think worst training ever.

The kicker was when I grabbed the wrong dish at one point.  Instead of vocalizing to re-read the order or whatever, she grabbed my arm.  Grabbed me and held on, and jabbed at the order screen.  I told her right then and there to never touch me again.  Ensue snide remarks, and a panic attack.  I cleared out the last few customers, then found my supervisor and said I needed to step outside and cool down, then talk to her.  She listens to everything and agrees to document it and pass it on.

Day 4; I go in, and my manager is working.  Great!  I'd been expecting to talk to him.  I hadn't slept the night before due to wicked anxiety, on top of already bad insomnia, but I show up for work clean shaved and ready.  We go into his office, and he proceeds to tell me that what he saw on the camera didn't look like an assault, that that type of contact was normal in this line of work (bullshit, I've been in kitchens for 10 years and NEVER physically grabbed by another person), and that I should have advised him of any phobias (his words) I had going in to the job.  Basically, he made me fell like shit, victim blamed, then refused to take part in mediation, saying he's not our dad and we have to work it out ourselves.

Obviously in the midst of another panic attack and unable to see a workable solution, I walked out, came home, and tried to process.  I've reached out to corporate on twitter and am planning to call HIS boss and report the details, but I don't know what else I should do.  No idea even what sub to post this in.


I know this was pretty minor compared to what a lot of other people have been through, but I'm really shook up.


This took place in Canada.

Throwaway for obvious reasons, and seriously looking for some advice.  


tl:dr assaulted at work, wasn't handled at all by management, no idea what to do about it.


edit:  This is a second job for me, an evening thing.  My day job (barely) keeps the bills paid, but I'm not  life or death dependent on making this work.  I also have a ton of experience in other industries and do a fair bit of tech work on the sly.  I know I can find other work if need be.

edit 2:  Turns out there is no real ""corporate HR"".  My only recourse if the franchise owner doesn't come through is a social media slam by the looks of it.  Thoughts?

UPDATE:  Talked to the franchise owner.  He hadn't heard anything, so he listened to the story, and then said he'd have a talk with the manager today and figure out what happened.  He did start to go on about how that can be the environment in their restaurants, many restaurants, to which I reiterated that I had never experienced that kind of physical reaction in any of the kitchens I've worked in before, and that it shouldn't be accepted in any workplace.

Three months ago, a girl that was in my class back in China messaged me and said that she has feelings for me, I was shocked and don't really know how to feel or react. I talked to her and I figured we don't have much topic or things in common, she like to read books and go out with her friends, I like to stay at home and play video games. We talked for about a month, and she asked me to be her boyfriend, I accepted. Since then we haven't talk much, there is just no topic for the conversation to flow. I try to express myself more and be more inquisitive about her, but sometime I just don't know how to reply to certain things(like when she kills the conversation, it just make me silly to carry on). Its exhausting to be the one that do all the talking, basically talking to a wall, everyday we would just talk about the same things. 

Also, I am not a social person, I can go on without my phone, so I am not always on my phone especially when I'm working or studying. She claims the reason of why she isn't very interested is because I take my time to answer and where as she would answer immediately. 

Bare in mind that we are in different time zone, only have a few hours before her bedtime

Then came the fall, I completely flunked. I got 4 Fs in 4 classes and then got a 2nd chance and completely blew that. Here I am years later trying to move on. I dropped out of school and bartended for several years recently I have been working in software sales but I'm finding this industry tough without a degree. A lot of jobs I have experience for require a degree. I want to go back.

206,"Had the midterm less than 1hr ago. The subject is data structures and algorithms. It's my resit of the course and I took it the first time 1 year ago when I was going through a lot of shit.    
&amp;nbsp;
There wasn't enough time to finish the test and I prioritized time to the wrong questions. I also didn't study the right things in enough depth.     
&amp;nbsp;
I kept up relatively with the class material and was pumped to do well at the beginning of the semester. I guess a month in my morale started to decrease because having to wake up at 6:30 and staying up late to do assignments took a toll on me. When we were told to stop, I saw only a few people had finished and left before that. My classmate who read the prof's reviews said he scaled a lot for the midterm, but I'm pretty sure I'm below average. Another classmate who's resitting killed assignments his first time and he only had to resit because he fucked up on exams. 20% is on our midterm and 50% is on the final, and the weighted average of the midterm and final has to be 60% or higher in order to pass the course.
&amp;nbsp;
I don't know how to recover from this besides doing really well for the final. I don't see a way to ask for a regrading that'll get me a higher mark. No re-exams allowed either.

208,So the last time my boyfriend and I had sex was two weeks ago. It was amazing and I had him moaning out loud. Normally he's quiet. He was literally saying Oh God and complimented me the next day. We also went from room to room. We've been together over a year. We've recently hit a patch where he said he feels unsure about wanting to be in a relationship and I've said if he wants to end it let's just do that to which he says that's not what he wants to do. He's still supper cuddly and loving. Emotionally still seemingly connected. We actually seem closer now than before he said he felt unsure. We just haven't had sex in two weeks? He's still touches me in sexual ways just no sex. He has started working out in that 2 week time frame and has been really sore and tired.  We do occasionally go through periods where we don't have sex for a couple of days. Advice? ,20Oct2017,3

211,"There's this guy, and we once had a thing for each other. I'm sure it was not only me, I clearly understood he had interest from his text messages. But I guess the timing was not right. Things in life were not actually going good for me and I was feeling depressed, and I think that's why I gave a bit gloomy impression at the time. 

We needed to give a concert for a course, that's how we met, and we spent 1 hour every week for an almost 2 month period to rehearsals together. (there were other people also)

He even arranged a meetup with somehow common friends of ours, which went a bit awkward because none of them I knew very well, but since he insisted I said I would be there. I was a little late for the meeting and he asked me where I was when I was on the way, and offered me a ride both before and after the meeting. But I declined since I simply wanted to walk, and be on my own, not because of anything else. Anyway he was clearly interested, but (I think) because of the gloomy image I've given, and probably because I went a bit far in initiating conversations (it was always me) he lost interest. So one time I try to talk to him he replies late and says he is busy. I gave him a bit space and a couple of days later I asked if anything was wrong. And of course he says no :), he just does not talk to his friends ""this often.""  Very classic scenario.

So I took the message and never contacted him again. I got over it quickly, kept myself busy and so on... At the end, it was not that serious. It's been over 4 months now, without a deep contact. Though during summer (we're going to same college) I've seen him in a common lecture, and saluted, we chatted over some course just one or two minutes, that's it.

I want to make it clear that I do not want to have a romantic relationship with him, and I'm completely over him. [That's why I decided to post it to here but not to /r/dating_advice/ ]But, we're taking the same courses, and I see him for like 3 times a week (bleh), he never looks at me, he doesn't give any sign of recognition, and I find it rude. I might as well just ignore him like he does to me, but I would feel really uneasy if I had to talk to him in class right now. Not because my feelings but because of his actions. Plus the class is like 20 people, not that crowded.

Anyway, now comes the real question. Should I express my thoughts to him and say ""Hey, I'm feeling super uneasy to pretend like I don't know a person, it just feels wrong and disturbing"", or should i just let it go and pretend I don't know him as well, continuing to feel uneasy? Would it worth trying?

P.S. It might also highly likely be that I want to show I'm OK with, and mature enough to move on and stay friends. I admit.

P.S.2: No I definitely certainly do not feel anything towards him and will not ever contact him for that reason. I'm confident enough. I see that we would make a really poor couple now.

214,"I work for a larger corporation. My supervisor was promoted twice in one year, more due to need and manipulation than ability. She tends to make things more complicated than they need to be, and she micromanages everything my department does and says.

When she became our supervisor she sat down with each of us individually and explained how she could not be our friend anymore. She was never anyone's friend in my department except one woman. She and I were on friendly terms, but we were not friends. I explained this was not going to be an issue for me, and everything was kosher.

My supervisor then explained how she wanted each of us to succeed, so if we wanted to move up or forward she would be glad to put in a good word for me elsewhere. This idea was soon completely negated when I applied elsewhere and she sat me in a room and asked if anything was wrong and questioned me extensively as to why I was wanting to leave the department. I had to explain to her it wasn't personal, but that I needed more money, and moving within the company laterally meant a raise.

My income was increased in my department before I learned I did not get the job in the other department. It was later that I learned accepting my raise meant my supervisor thought I was agreeing to stay in the department, and she told the supervisor for the department I interviewed for I was no longer interested in the position. When I inquired with HR a few weeks after my interview, they said they thought I didn't want the position anymore, and gave the position to someone else.

A little while later I applied for another position, and the same thing happened. At this point I was bored with my job and really needed new and different responsibilities and I was not being given those opportunities when I asked for them. I was just given everyone else's work and told to pick up everyone else's slack. Which I did. For over a year.

The slack was picked up, everyone got caught up, and instead of being praised for helping as much and as often as I did, I was given a larger amount of the same work. I was trained to back other people up in other departments, and given minor projects here and there to keep me occupied. They took all of the smaller projects away from me and gave me one massive project there is no way I would ever have time for unless it was my regular job, and they are not willing to give me any overtime hours to complete all of my work.

I recently got sick. I have pcos, menoragghia, depression, and high risk of stroke, so I have to be careful about which birth control I am on. I lost 30 lbs, and I started to bleed heavily on the birth control I was on, and lost so much blood I started to feel depressed and fatigued. I told my supervisor I was not feeling well after about a month of heavy bleeding (my doctor estimated I lost 4 pints in 1 month), and told her my doctor advised me to go pick up my new birth control prescription along with prescribed iron, and go home to take a nap and relax. When I told my supervisor this, she laughed. Like it was funny I was bleeding to death.

My supervisor then grilled me for 10 minutes about how much work I had left to do for the week. I felt guilty for needing to leave, so I stayed. About an hour later I blacked out at my desk. It was around lunchtime, so no one was around. I was the only one working in the office, so I have no idea how long I was out. I sent my supervisor an email that I was leaving for the day, grabbed candy off of my co-workers desk for a sugar rush to get home, and left. I had to call a friend on the way home just in case I passed out while driving.

The new birth control gave me such bad depression I almost killed myself. I was lethargic, I didn't want to get out of bed, and when I was at work I felt dead. I felt dead at home, too, but I just didn't want to be at work. I didn't feel the same drive and motivation to do my work that I previously had. I contemplated suicide a lot more in that week than I had in a really long time. I explained this to my supervisor, and explained I was asking my doctor for a different prescription, and she laughed at me, again, and said I better get all of my work done, and medical issues were no reason to not get it done. Like suicidal thoughts were funny, and like I never got all of my work done before.

To be clear, I have always gotten my work done, no matter what. They have a record of my work performance, and unless there was something really crazy going on that affected everyone, I always got my work done.

We are not allowed to talk to each other. If we talk for longer than a few minutes my supervisor will come over and ask what we're talking about.

We are not allowed to go to the bathroom or take a phone call for longer than a few minutes or she comes looking for us.

She doesn't actually know how to do our jobs, and has asked me multiple times how to do something, then ends up giving me the job because she doesn't want to learn how to do it, or can't do it.

I have papers on my desk that I purposely put upside down. They were medical papers and I was going to the doctor that day. She picked up my medical papers and read them, noticed what they were, and continued to read them in front of me. I had a paper on my desk upside down because it was a survey of how I felt about certain aspects of the company, it was my private thoughts and opinions on what was going on. She picked it up, read it, even though it was supposed to be anonymous, and put it back down on my desk face up.

We have weekly meetings for things that could be said via e-mail. In these meetings my supervisor lectures us individually for things, in my opinion, have nothing to do with me as a worker. If I am not behind, then don't lecture me about being behind. It doesn't make sense.

Today was the last straw for me. My supervisor asked for my help in teaching the new guy how to do something. I took over training him how to do what she was asking. My supervisor then came up to me later and said, ""I felt like you undermined my authority in front of one of my subordinates."" The only thing I could think to say was that I was sorry, but had no idea how I could have undermined her, unless she meant taking the control of his training away from her.

At this point, I am so frustrated and angry with her, and she has mis-managed an autonomous worker so horribly, that I want to contact HR.

How do I handle this situation?

Tl;dr: Supervisor has horribly mis-managed me as an autonomous worker, has violated a few laws in managing me, has become a micro-manager, and has accused me of undermining her authority when all I did was do what she asked me to do. How do I handle this situation?",20Oct2017,1

A few months ago my boyfriends move down half way across the world, he will be gone for 4 years (due to work). He told me he cannot take me because that would requir getting married, otherwise his work will not allow me to go with him. 

We been togeather 5 years, we moved to diffrent cities togeather for his word before. The last year and a half I decided to finally go to University (I’m 26, I am late starting).  The city we were now in Ian suppose to be a permanent place of living for him (when he comes back in 4 years, he will live here again), so I decided that I would finally go to school. It was somthing I always wanted to do for myself and haven’t taken that step.  So, I moved out and to be closer to school and I been in school for a year and a half now. 

Our relationship was great, there was no big issues and he said if it wasn’t for moving we would probably still be togeather. It’s been a very hard adjustment for me, we shared a life togeather for so long and they whole city is symbolic of us. 

I don’t think I would want to getting married so casually. I also have a fear of legal obligations that come with marriage. But if he offered me to move with him I would say yes, if I’m writing there was a statement on what will take place if thinfs did not work out. A mutual agreement. But I was not given that oppratuinty. 

We decided that it would Be best to think think everything is over for good, because he said he doesn’t think he will chnage his mind while away and he doesn’t regret his choice to go (I don’t think it was wrong to go, btw, I want the best for him). He also said he can’t predict what will happen when he comes back and that we should just be friends. 

I been trying really hard to put him in that friendzone and it’s really hard. I don’t think I can view him as a friend and I also have very strong genuine feelings that I belive is timeless. I was the type of person that didn’t belive in timeless love too, haha. 

We used to text how we miss and love eachother until one day he said he likes to hear it but he’s not sure if he can say it back anymore. He said it’s really hard for him to think about what he is missing and is trying his best not to harbour on that because it really makes it to hard for him to cope with the loss because he still deeply cares for me. 

He then said he is happy there too and that he is meeting people and making friends and trying to be out as much as he can because if he doesn’t he will Think about those feelings.  Needless to say on weekends o hardly hear from him... I guess he is busy with his new friends to a point he can’t text me like he does on weekdays. 

I understand it will be impossibale to not date anyone in 4 years... but dating and fall in love with someone else is another story. I kinda worry when he comes back he will be bringing back an exotic beauty with him. While I couldn’t move on at all. 

I keep thinking of dating other people, because even though I have a fear of legal commitment I have very high domestic goals that fall just above career goals.  I want to share my life with someone in an intimate way and support and love them in diffrent levels in life. But... I can’t see outside my vision of mhm ex. I can only see myself with him and the fact there is no one identical to him to “replace” I feel like my dreams and goals are crushed. It really hurts when you have serious feelings for someone that doesn’t want to be with you. 

I have had plenty of people ask me out sense then without trying and I refuse them all because I can’t being myself to do it. I don’t want to date other people I want my ex, I am very headstrong. Eventhiugh at the same time I had respected his wishes about being friends and make sure I only speak on that level. He told me he would like me to visit when I belive I can only consider him a friend. 

It’s only been eztreamly hard the last few weeks when I could not express how I love him and miss him. Well, I told him I missed him once (I couldn’t help myself) but it was a positive conversation. I don’t want to ruin his happiness he found for himself there, even more so if he is struggling with the loss badly and is trying to ignore those feelings. So, within these last few weeks I kinda realized there may be no hope. No matter what I was always holding onto hope, even when we said we should act as if nothing will happen between us again. I just held onto that hope so much things would chnage while he is there or afterward. And I felt like I could work on that to give me the best chance possibale. I read books and stuff about how to her long distance ex’s back (yes, desperate). But now I feel like I can’t work hard to make that glimmer of hope there, it’s based on him and I think no matter how I talk to him won’t chnage anything or make things better or worse. I just don’t want to accept this is the end. And if my feelings will always stay like this I’ll never be willing to “settle” for someone else. 

Additionally this strastkc chnage In mhm life has caused trouble with school on and off. Mainly around tiles where there are a lot of deadlines and I am very stressed. It’s like school stress seems 10 times worse when I am very distraught about the chnage ans dreams in my romantic life. It sounds so silly. Here I am 26 and I cant prioritize my feelings or get over it. 

What do I do when my romantic ambitions in life are crushed becUSe I won’t settle with anyone besides someone who doesn’t want me?  How do I lesrnnto just be friends? I told him before if I can’t just be friends I may have to stop talking to him, because it will get very hard if he starts seeing someone else and he keeps telling me how important it is to him to keep a strong connection of friendship because respect and trust has morning been broken and he has had too many people come and go in his life. 

I been trying to be an adult about this, and I been crying much less. Like, not getting over it but learning to live with it to some extent... but living like that will be hard. 

I seeked clissling at my school and my first session will be at the end of the month where they will try to help me overcome this change. But right now I would like to hear words from other people.

237,"I am having a actual problem answering this question in some recent interviews I have had.  I cannot seem to come up with a satisfactory answer to this.  Some background:

I worked for an agency for 10 years, I resigned in August this year for two reasons, toxic environment and stress (extreme amounts, I was working nearly 80 hours a week, it was effecting my home life).  I have the support of my immediate supervisor and can use them as a reference.  There is nobody at my former agency that would question my ethics, work product, reliability, or integrity (I have everybody's support, and quite a few of them miss me, as I miss them).  In addition, I like the work that I did, just not the field I was working in.  I recently transferred within that agency to a different area (moved from New Jersey to Dallas) about 2 years ago to be closer to family (take care of my relatives), one is now currently in hospice.  In addition I have a 8 month old.  My wife has a good living, we have healthcare and enough funds for 2 years.

I am looking at positions related to what I used to do, and have found many, but I cannot seem to answer that question of why I quit my last job.  I know I cannot mention stress, time spent, or the toxic environment (as that would be negatives I do not want to bring into a interview).  I have looked up this question on google but the answers given don't seem to be good enough ""I left for Family reasons, to take care of my child, etc"" because I am looking for a position a few months after i left (this would be 3 months later).  I need some advice, preferably from people who were or are hiring managers, on how to properly answer this question.

I would appreciate any feedback.  Thank you.",20Oct2017,2
238,"I am so frustrated with this situation and want some help as to what to do. I’m in high school. English has always been my favourite/best subject and I’ve always been the among top of my classes. My teachers have always praised me for my strength in writing and communication. Grade 10 and Grade 11 I took English AP and did very well, getting an 87% in 10th grade, and a 92% in 11th.

This year, there weren’t enough students who requested a Grade 12 ENGLISH AP class to make one. So, I got placed into a regular English class.

The teacher is a charismatic person, but she is making me very frustrated. She gives us a huge amount of projects with little time to complete them. It is difficult to be able to manage all of the assignment with other classes and extracurricular a. But I’ve been working hard on my essays and assignments and my grade is at a 70%. But it’s not like I’m halfassing anything, my writing has improved since last year if anything. She’s made it seem like it’s basically impossible to improve any mark from an 80 unless you have a wildly complex and thorough idea.

One thing that makes it even more frustrating is the example papers she showed us of an 80 quite honestly were not that good, by anyone in the class’ standards. I’ve worked hours on my papers and I just got a 60% on my last paper. I don’t know what to do. I’m mad, and feeling like i’m being unappreciated. What should I do?",20Oct2017,2
240,"Recently, I've just hated going out and hanging out with my friends. I dread having to get up and get ready and then be out of the house for an extended period of time.  The entire time I'm out I'm just counting down the hours until it's time to go home again.  

Tonight, a friend of mine wanted me to go over to her house and carve pumpkins.  We also invited another friend of ours who is home from college this weekend.  Now, she's an avid weed smoker and I do tend to like to partake in smoking as well every now and again.  As the day has gone on though, friend 1 (the one whose house we will be at) has talked about these other plans she has going on at the same time.  Her sister coming over and placing tile down and how she'll have to help with that.  Also, she'll have to watch her sister's kid.  The more she mentions that she has other things to do while we are there (she's assuming we'd help watch the sister's kid) the more I don't want to go over. I feel so awkward introducing myself to people.  I don't want to go over and have this ""job"" I have to do aka help babysit either. I don't want to hurt my friend's feelings though and not show up.

I'm not enjoying it very much either so far. My girlfriend studies a different course and I've extensively helped her with her work and so got to read her material as well and I find it much more interesting. My current course and her course were my two main choices when deciding on what to switch to and I very much regret not picking the same course as her. (To clarify; not because she is in it, purely because of the course). 

I'm in Europe so the fees aren't going to ruin my life (Around 2000 euros a year for three years). I'm mainly concerned about time and me flip-flopping around. Any advice?

245,"The dealer’s father* 

The title says most of it. The person previously had  a distribution arrest in the next town over. At least once a month, there is a police response for a domestic disturbance that never amounts to anything. The response calls come from inside the dealers house. Despite half of the neighborhood constantly calling on (literally) dozens of deals per day, there is never any response. Every so often we’ll have a cruiser drive by, but that’s it. I’ve never seen a dealer be more in the open about what they do and so little repercussion for it. I have young children, as do many of the neighbors, which is the biggest concern. I have a nest cam pointed directly at their home and footage of numerous deals every day. People are driving dangerously, leaving needles in the area, and I’ve even seen people shoot up with young children in their car. The person’s father is a retired cop for this town, and it seems like everyone in the neighborhood is just being “yessed” to death by the police despite what is clear as day. It has become clear to me and the neighbors that local law enforcement isn’t going to handle this. Reddit, do I have any options here?

In the past two weeks he’s been through two major negative events in his life that are really causing him to downward spiral into general depression. 


He refuses to talk about it and is just generally sulky (which I understand, I would be too). It affects his personal life but also his work ethic which could eventually lead to some trouble. His friends and I have been trying to help an talk about it but I’m worried he is just bottling up and getting worse. 


How can I help someone who doesn’t want to even think about their problems or tries to ignore it? I want to try to lift his spirits but I feel like I can’t and it makes me feel like I’m not being there enough for him. 


His friends will text me while I’m at work to give me status updates because otherwise I’ll be in the dark and he won’t talk to me about it (his friends have also been affected by some of these tragedies as well so he is more willing to discuss with them). When he comes home he just wants to forget and pretend it’s not happening. I suggested therapy but he refuses. I told him he can talk to me but he just says he doesn’t want to talk about it anymore.

255,"I'm graduating in December and have been looking for jobs to start my career. At first I wanted to stay in my area because I was in a relationship that I thought was going to be long-term. However, 3 weeks ago she broke up with me (and left me devastated). I have pretty much only applied to places in my area with the exception of one job, and it's getting too late for me to start applying for things in January.

However since she broke up with me, I decided to pursue that one job out of state. I thought it'd be the perfect opportunity for me to start over and try a new life. After getting called in for an interview I also got a tour and honestly that job became my dream job. It had everything I wanted in my first real job and the pay was higher than anything in my area. It seemed perfect.

I also told a couple people I know that I was applying there. One of them was also applying there and got interviewed earlier and got it. We were even discussing moving there, rooming together, and I thought about my new life in a completely different city (it's a big city, which is something I've also never experienced).

About an hour ago I just got a rejection call from the recruiter. I asked for feedback and she said the interviewers like to keep it confidential. Now I'm left with the mediocre jobs in this area with lower pay and a completely single life. Today was the last day I had to respond to one of my offers here and I ended up taking it, even though I know I won't like it and the pay is average, at best. I'm thinking of continuing to apply and if I get something else I will take that instead, which would force me to burn the bridge but I don't see any other option.

Honestly I feel super depressed right now. I don't have that many friends to begin with and am not great with girls. I was recently starting to feel a little better since the breakup but now I feel like my life was a waste. Part of the reason I feel that way is because I know people around me that put in like 25% of the work that I did and ended up with similar job offers. 

I'm not trying to sound cocky but I'm in this place where I know my resume is better than the people I'll end up working with but it's not good enough for the jobs that I really want. I thought this 'dream job' would be the perfect opportunity since they reached out for an interview but I ended up not doing so well on the interview, and I'm not entirely sure why. 

Any thoughts or ideas? I don't know how I'm going to cope now, my only source of hope after my breakup was that I was going to finally get a decent job (and start over in a new area) and end up being half successful, even if I wasn't that successful with relationships.

262,"I am 24 and I have lived with my mother or mother and grandma my entire lift. I have been sheltered and spoiled my entire life. I have never had to deal with any consequences because either one of them always picked up the slack or carried me or us on their back.

As of right now I am living with my mother and grandma. They are financially in a pinch. My grandma is getting worse and her funds are running low. My mother just got messed up at the hospital and now she is out of work. I love them but the sad thing is all I can think of is more and more burdens that I have to deal with. When I was working my other job I managed to pay all of my share of the bills. I got terminated for something stupid and currently work 2 part time jobs but offer low hours. Now I ONLY pay rent which I don't even pay in full (even though I can) because I'm a stingy fuck and my phone bill. I get upset when they ask me to drive them to the hospital. However, I am more than happy to accept their help and money when I need something and I'm more than happy to meet up with a girl 20+ minutes away for a date. 

 I don't know how to say this correctly but I love my mother and grandma but I am tired of dealing with their shit. I have spent my entire life with them so far and I take them for granted. To the point that I care more about going out a fucking girls more than my family. Even when I made enough money for pay my entire share of bills if they ever needed me to pitch in extra I would always get butthurt about it. Basically I am always grateful to receive but hate giving out. However I will toss away money on dates (not on the girl). I tend to abuse things as well. Even though I morally know it is wrong and feel awful doing it, I do it anyways. An example would be my grandma gave me $80 to get the car checked out. I procrastinated a few weeks and then she went with me to get the car checked. She ended up paying for it and I kept the $80. Awful. That is why I try very, very hard to stay away from drugs and illegal activities because I know I would be the type of person that if I can get away with it a few times I am going to keep doing it.

265,"Hey everyone, sorry in advance but this is a bit of a venting/long write up

I have been researching for new places to live for what feels like years now.  But whenever I start looking into finalizing where I want to go, I have an almost full blown panic attack and basically start over at ground zero and start researching again.  I'm scared I am going to fuck up and move to the wrong place and end up screwing myself over in some way shape or form.  Or move somewhere and then realize that was not where I wanted to move and regret my decision.

I currently live in Indiana, which isn't a bad state by any means, of all the Midwestern states, Indiana is my favorite.  But all my friends have left and I feel really alienated from others, not from a lack of trying either.  I go out and try to meet people but I just feel like there is just this social/personality disconnect where I just don't fully get along with Hoosiers all that much anymore.

I work in the IT field in both a civilian and military capacity as a Army National Guardsman. I enjoy the work but ultimately want to move into the Cyber Security space so I am trying to give weight to states that have a high demand in IT/Cyber Security.  Like I just mentioned, I like my work, but I have also realized that I cant stand being cooped up behind a desk for weeks on end, so I have been romanticizing more and more about camping, hiking, mountain climbing and being on the beach.  Which is also another reason why I want to leave Indiana, which doesn't have really any of those things, or at least have them in the capacity where I feel like they are worth doing (Indiana is really flat)

Apart from the career aspect of wanting to move, I don't really care for the cold so I would want to move somewhere with a more mountainous scenery that stays warm through most of the year.  I have been trying to be flexible with these requirements because that really narrows down the possibilities of places to move, but I would be really bummed if I moved somewhere that didn't have at least one of those things.

I have a handful of places I have been that I have considered moving to, such as California, Texas and Florida.  Texas and Florida so far being fairly notable because when I was there to visit friends I got along with what seems like everyone.  I was able to have organic conversations, didn't feel out of place and genuinely enjoyed being out and about for a change.  But for every few Pros I find for each state, there is one life changing, really shitty negative.  Either its the job market for my career choice is bad, or the cost of living is so extreme that you would have to be on the high income earners bracket to live comfortably.

I have been trying to look around at other states that I haven't been to yet but sound interesting places to live based off of what I would like to live around. Such as Arizona, Colorado, Seattle, Oregon.  But I have no personal experience with these places and don't really have any friends there.  So if I were to move to one of these states and it feels like I'm speaking to Hoosiers again, or generally don't get along with the population there, that obviously would be really shitty.

Ultimately, whenever I search for something and start to put together a game plan on how I am going to manage uprooting my life and moving, I freak myself out and ultimately don't do anything.  I don't want to be stuck in Indiana all my life, but the fear of failure keeps me from moving.

I apologize again for the long read and hopefully it all makes sense ha, I am kind of venting/vomiting up words to express how I feel and to try and have it make sense.

TL;DR I live in Indiana and cant make up my mind if I want to move to California, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Seattle, or Oregon",20Oct2017,1

273,"Hi, I'm here because I'm going to learn how to drive soon, and I want to see if this problem may hinder me in the future when I do drive. In case it's necessary, I'm 16 years old, female, and have Asperger's syndrome. This is something I've never talked to anyone about mostly out of fear, but also because I never knew how to bring it up.

I have a huge problem with directions and dimensions. Even simple things such as right and left may confuse me from time to time, even though I know the difference between them. 

I guess these symptoms started to show when I was very young. I excelled on IQ tests, but whenever a question included a picture of a die with 6 faces, I never knew which one would make the die fit. At the time, I assume it was ignored because I scored high on other aspects.

In art class, I always had extreme problems with symmetry. Drawing a butterfly freestyle would result in hundreds of erase marks as I try to make the wings symmetrical. But I never could. In my 2nd grade class, me and my friends had a trend of dotting our 'i's with a heart. While their hearts came out looking decent, mine never satisfied me. They were always lopsided and I simply couldn't do it. 

Another sign was when I was learning about parting my hair from a youtube video. (Maybe when I was 10). Right parts and Left parts always confused me, and I realized it was because mirrors confused me. And mirrors are still a problem with my life today. It takes me a few seconds to figure out which eye is my right eye when looking in the mirror. And don't even get me started on makeup, I am officially the worst makeup artist. With the direction issues as well as shaky hands, I can spend hours trying to perfect my eyeliner. So I really don't wear makeup unless it's a special occasion, and my mother usually helps me with that.

When I was learning how to cook and operating the stove, turning the knob left or right was something I never understood. I was turning the knob left by moving my hands from right to left, but since I was starting on the right, that confused me.

I got diagnosed with Asperger's at the age of 13 and I was fine with it. I always knew something was off about me, and I attributed my awkwardness to that. And I know that the Autism spectrum can include many things, which I think has something to do with my direction problem. 

We also had this rubik's cube phase in my middle school, and I was the worst at it. I could read all the instructions for hours and never figure out how to solve it at all. It just confused me so much and I never understood why.

I signed up for Tinder when I was 14 (Don't judge me, I was stupid) and swiping right and left was a nightmare. I got confused about things like ""if I move my finger right, then am I swiping left"" or ""if I move my finger left, then am I swiping right"". I had to wait 3 seconds to figure out which direction to swipe. Overall, it was not a good experience and I never matched with anyone I met up with in real life anyways. 

I guess the breaking point for me was this year. I'm taking geometry now and everything is confusing me, transformations especially. I can't see something upside down unless I physically turn my paper. That usually suffices except I can't remember how the shape looks at all and it really confuses me. Negative numbers are also something that I hate because if I forget the sign once, everything's wrong. Even with a graph, these transformations are so convoluted for me. Dilations are the only ones I kind of understand. Once we get to 3D objects in the future (It's on the curriculum), I know that I have pretty much no chance of succeeding.

The issue for me is driving though. I've always wanted to drive, but scared to start. But I'm 16 now and I think that I want to learn how to drive. I want to be responsible and if this problem I have with directions might influence my driving negatively, then I don't want to do it and end up hurting myself or somebody else.

I've tried several driving simulators online and failed miserably at them. The WASD ones were the worst, since I usually use the arrow keys and even though I know where they are and I can type 90 WPM, playing a game with them was difficult. I never actually even touched a driving wheel except maybe in an arcade at one point. I also have anxiety so I'm worried about little things like sneezing that might cause me to die while driving a car. 

So anyways, do you guys know what this problem may be? I'm 100% sure I don't have dyslexia by the way, but I don't know too much about other developmental disorders. ",20Oct2017,1

I'm aware that I could just do retail work for the year but I would rather build my experience for psych. I think it'll be beneficial if I end up doing occupational therapy. ",20Oct2017,1

278,"Hello friends. I am new to the adult working world and need some advice. First time posting here, so bear with me.

My boyfriend of over 8 years just found out today that his ill grandpa was moved to hospice and has maybe a few days to a week left. We live together, 9 hours from our hometown, which is where the funeral will eventually be. He will obviously be taking time off to drive home and attend the funeral. 

I, however, just started a new job as a speech therapist on Monday of this week. I already have a good relationship with my manager because I did a clinical placement under one of her speech therapists this spring. She's very nice and seems like she would be very understanding. But I mean, I JUST started this job, don't have any PTO, and feel like I would be asking a lot to take a few days off to drive home with my boyfriend for this funeral (which obviously doesn't have a date yet). Part of me is thinking it wouldn't hurt to ask, but then again, it might? 

I really want to be there for my boyfriend during this time but also don't want to tarnish my relationship with my brand new manager. 

What do you think?

Edit: I forgot to mention that I did look at my company's policy for this, and it mentions that time off would be given to attend the funeral of certain family members. Grandfather-in-law is listed, which is what I consider him, but this isn't technically true because we're not married.",20Oct2017,2
280,"I just bought my 11 yr old a backpack for his scout camping trips and we were limited on what we would purchase. He is still in the kid sizes and our options were very limited.

282,"I think I just need someone to tell me I'm okay. I'm 23, have a degree, and am in graduate school getting my masters. I am working part time at the school gym. I am in a relationship with the man I want to marry and we have been together for 3 years. We just started doing long distance (2 hours) in July. 

The problem is is that I feel like since I graduated undergrad I've done nothing but fail and I just want my life to be how I want it in my head. 

I had a second interview for a full time job in my field that I was well qualified for and the interview went well and I thought I connected with everyone I talked to. But I did not get the job. This sucked me back into a depression phase where I'm just upset and questioning everything. 

I'm thinking about taking this as a sign that I'm not meant to work full time while also in school full time. I'm also considering beginning yoga teacher training as it is something I've always wanted to do and now I could have time to devote to it. 

I don't feel like I will feel successful unless I'm making more money, living on my own with my boyfriend, married or moving towards marriage, and happy. 

My boyfriend is still in school also so we are being responsible and waiting until we are financially stable and in the same city to get engaged. I feel like I have to wait for everything.

Overall, I don't want to feel like I'm forever waiting to be happy. ",20Oct2017,3

286,"Hey guys, I just bought a washing machine yesterday and it looked like it was good to go. I got it for a fair price and it's a kenmore 90 series (for all you appliance buffs out there) so it works... and washed the clothes... but... the inside part that spins (big cylinder that contains the laundry and where all the magic happens not sure what it's called) seems like it isn't completely attached. It clunks around and clearly somthing is kind of fucked up lol it works but I'd like to fix it. Is this an easy fix? Is it going to be expensive? Do I just have to tighten a few things? I'm mechanically inclined and won't have any trouble if I know what to do, just not really trying to do exploratory surgery on my washing machine. Also is it reasonable to call the guy and ask him to pay for repairs? Or since it's a Craigslist deal is that out of the question

287,"Last night I had a little too much to drink and when getting up out of bed to go to the bathroom during the night. I tripped beside my door over a pile of clothes and went bang smack into the wall. Hit my forehead very hard against it and also hit the left side of my nose. So much so that my nose was gushing blood. Also managed to hurt my wrist and think it's sprained because I dropped to the floor like dead weight and bruised my elbow really badly.

Now I have a massive bump on the left side of my Forehead, swelling and redness above my left eye and my nose is red and very sore too touch. Any advice on the bump and my nose? Because they're honestly so so painful. Also advice for a sprained wrist?

I'm terrified and I have no way of knowing that she's read it unless she decides to accept the PM, so if she read it and doesn't respond I'll be so embarrassed to go back to school cause it will probably be super awkward and ugh, it's complicated. btw, i'm in 8th grade so yep.",20Oct2017,19
290,"Hello
So i've been a night owl all my life but recently thought it would be a good idea to try and see whats it's like being a morning person.
My friend tells me he does to bed at 11pm and wakes up at 5:30am.
Do you think this is a good plan I should try to follow?
I normally go to bed at like 1am on a good day and have 9-10 hours of sleep.
Would appreciate the advice",20Oct2017,1
291,"Ever since I broke up with my ex I can’t “get it up” for anyone. She fucked my head up so badly that I am finding it very hard to just be comfortable in these situations with other people. It makes me get angry with myself and when that happens I spiral into a deep thought void where I constantly shit on myself and just feel like I suck as a person. It’s happened multiple times and I’m tired of it. I don’t know what to do, I’ve tried breathing, but it’s more than just feeling uncomfortable, I just can’t trust or feel good with anyone in that situation with me. Any advice ",20Oct2017,7

However, they make will make very subtle or very racist/homophobic/sexist comments often at lunch and other times when talking about the current world events. These people claim to be Republican, NRA-loving Christians. I don't want to rope everyone who claims those qualities in the same pile. Some of my co-workers have also been in the military. I am one of the only people in my work space that doesnt agree with their opinions. I am not very good at confortation so speaking my opinion and quoting sources (usually NPR) can be difficult. I don't know how to treat these people. One coworker I would even consider as one of the best friends I have at this stage of my life (I am 23 and just entered the workforce and she is 36 and has worked at my company for 10 years) is someone who makes these comments.

293,"Got kicked out at start of October after I told my mom I wasn't going to go to college because I was not ready, she took that as ""I'm a druggie, I wanna do drugs all the time"" and kicked me out after pretty much burning my stability to the ground. Lost job at dead end supermarket, which honestly I didn't mind because I was treated like shit anyways.

Ive been living at my uncle's house and things just are not getting better it feels. I fill out countless job applications only to get no calls whatsoever. Now, my car is useless and uncle lives out 7 miles from town, so I have to rely on cousin, who exploits the shit out of my money, demanding gas when I have no money and should be using it on my god Damn tires.

Its been two weeks and I still haven't ""gotten my shit together"" and I'm trying every single day. I thought I could get away from the negativity of being labeled a junkie all the Damn time by coming here but it's just The same. My aunt and uncle stole my adderall and only give one a day, which I don't mind, but its prefaced with 'oh you don't need it, you cant get high on it if you have adhd!"" And despite being diagnosed legitimately, I still apparently ""don't have it""

It was the same way with my anxiety meds, the same ""oh, I have anxiety and when it happens to me I'm crippled, and since I don't see that with you, must means you aint got it!"" I hate it so much. I already feel like shit for relying on my pills to even function anymore. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, im stuck where I am. I never escaped any of the damn labels, and no one even thinks I'm trying. I got accused of fucking using because aunt saw mark on my arm when in reality it was because I had to donate plasma just to pay bills and my fuckwad cousin ""gas money"". 

I hate that all this effort isnt even showing anything. I just want to get job and get my own place, even if its a shitty one. No ones calling back though, and I'm out of money. I still have tickets to pay, health insurance, medications, a car to fix, etc. 

It just sucks so much, I got out of my moms house so I would be happy and not bullied but its just the same here. I have no options. The only positive is that I still have my gf, but shes in similar situation. Sorry if I'm ranting I just don't know what I should even do anymore. I have bills out the wazoo, was planning on getting delivery job to have steady cash but car is Apperently a pos. 

I don't want to crawl back to my mom, shes offered I come back but under a ridiculous ""contract"". I only even contacted her again because I got approved to be a paid provider for my grandma but shes refusing to give me more than 10 hours a week and demands I pass a drug test and gets mad when ""I try to convince her amphetamine is adderall""",20Oct2017,1
294,"We met in Chicago a year and a half ago. A year into the relationship he gets transferred to Tampa, FL. I stupidly quit my job and tank my career as a teacher to move down to Florida with him. We get here and 3 weeks later he quits his job. 

""We"" (read:he) bought a house which is why we're still here. He put on this big charade about valuing my opinion and wanting me to feel like it was ""our"" house but at the end of the day he put in an offer before I even saw it. The first time I saw it was the inspection.

He's 45 and I'm 28. It's a gay relationship. Since we've gotten to Florida he's been treating me more and more poorly. I recognize the downward spiral and I've told him many times that it's a problem, that he needs to change. I give workable steps. He does the same for me. Where I do make changes in quantifiable ways he doesn't seem to be making an effort. 

Things have come to a head essentially because he doesn't seem to be really making an effort in improving things and I dumped him. The problem is I've been living in a massive renovation the last 6 months and can't really get any of my stuff to leave. So I'm still living in his house in something of a relationship limbo.

I'm torn because we did have a lot of positive qualities but since we moved to Florida and had this house to renovate it's been a slow downward spiral.

301,"Obviously as a teenager, I was super dependent on my dad. Then immediately after, it was an older boyfriend who I moved out to be with.

I've needed to go to the dr for a couple weeks, my boyfriend won't take me, I can't drive, I have no money, ect. And it was kinda a breaking point.

I decided I can't live this way. I'm not happy like this. If I need to go somewhere, I shouldn't have to ask someone. If I need to buy something, I should get it myself.

But there's so many roadblocks and it's discouraging.

I never got passed like.. 3rd grade due to my mom taking me out of school. I have to get my GED, so I've been studying, but when the time comes I have no money for the test. I need tutoring but don't have money.

I need to drive. I don't even have my license. I desperately need a job. But before that, I need GED , car, ect.

Anyone have any advice on where to start? Living this way has caused severe social anxiety, because at restaurants I don't even order my own food. I'm basically 22 but feel 14. Please help 😭",20Oct2017,7
302,"I worked at an organization where I was managing volunteers for the past 2 years. I recently left. There was a volunteer there who everyone knew had a crush on me (not because I'm so great, but i was friendly and chatty with him, because this is my personality) I think he has asbergers, so I am not sure he has many friends.
However, I have my plate really full with the friends and family I do have in the area, and I'm not really interested in spending time with him now that I've left. I appreciate his acquaintanceship, but i'd prefer to draw the line there. 

He just sent me a message saying, ""In the two years we have known each other we have never hung out outside of the office and I want that to change."" I don't want it to change. I'm happy as things are. I still volunteer there as well, so I still see him. I don't want to make it awkward.

307,"I'm a high school senior who's earned 95%+ marks in English classes throughout my schooling, and recently decided to start tutoring a student (adult) this fall. My student's main problems are their lack of practice and confidence in their English (they're not a native English speaker). Before meeting them, I thought that I could form easy conversations with them and just correct their grammar along the way. I now know that that's much more difficult when your student has trouble answering questions and keeping the conversation going. How should I help my student develop his conversational skills? My plan is for them to read news articles and then have a discussion about those articles and other recent topics, but I'm having trouble coming up with other ideas. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as this has been stressing me out!",20Oct2017,3
