3,"My fiance and I are getting married in 2 months.  We both live in the USA.  Im middle-eastern but grew up in USA most of my life.  She is American.  My parents were not big on my marrying an American girl, but they have warmed up to the idea since.

Neither of us really wanted to have a big extravagant wedding.  But we ended up deciding on doing a small 60 person wedding here with friends and family, with a small reception afterwards.

The issue: my parents live in the USA, but the rest of my family lives in the middle east in one town.  My family wants us to travel to the middle east after our wedding and have a wedding ""party"" / reception.  Neither of us really want to do it.  We would rather just go on a long honeymoon.

Couple reasons why:

* we only were able to get 3 weeks PTO off of work for our wedding + honeymoon.  If we decide to do this trip for a family wedding party, that would knock off at least 5 to 6 days from our 3 weeks that we have.  We both consider that time wasted and would rather be traveling somewhere else

* My culture is weird about marrying Americans and I feel like we will both be silently judged the entire time there, even from family members.  I think I will feel uncomfortable the whole time there

* She doesn't know any of my extended family members, and can't speak their language, so it's not exactly going to be exciting for her.

* I personally wouldn't enjoy the wedding party there.  I dont like dancing and being the center of attention, and thats very much a thing in middle eastern wedding
  
* It's going to be expensive.  Although guests at wedding parties in the middle east typically give a fair amount of money at the reception, so we might make most of it back. 

 
  
Now...for the reasons why I should go...

Basically it's all my family, my mom especially.  She would be devastated / heartbroken if we didnt go.  She has been playing the mom ""guilt"" card very hard.  She says this is her only day to be happy, and that she's been looking forward to this for years, and so on and so on.  The rest of my family overseas also really wants us to come and have the party over there and would be upset if we didnt.

I have already tried telling my parent ""no, we dont want to go"" and it blew up in my face.  My mom started crying, it turned into a fight, and we didnt talk for a couple days.  And I felt very guilty about it afterwards.

So, now I have to make this decision soon, ideally in the next couple days.  Should I do it to make my mom and family happy (even though I would probably not enjoy it) or just say screw it and put my foot down and say we are not doing this, deal with it?

Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks",23Apr2017,1

5,"A little background about me and my boyfriend (we'll call him Max). We've been best friends for months and he recently confessed to me and I accepted since I harbored feelings for him too.

Moving forward to now, relationship is great! We always want to spend time with each other, but also keep our individual lives as well. However, we've been moving really fast and sometimes our ""deep"" talks are through texts nowadays. I'm not really sure if we're really compatible. His interests aren't the same as mine, our personalities are seriously the opposite of each other and hobbies are not the same as well. 

When we meet in person, we both have to ""tuck away"" stories for us to talk about just because we don't have much to talk about in person. We just end up doing lots of physical stuff now. 

I'm not really sure what I want advice on. Any advice or comments would be much appreciated! (Please comment nicely)",23Apr2017,1
7,"Hey, So Been reading Reddit for a while but never posted, So thought this is a good one to start with.

I am 24 Living in A capital city in Australia.

I am an Electrician for a medium sized company. On about 80k a year + Car.

I am looking at going to be an engineer at uni and just work 3 days a week. 
Just last week I told the boss my intentions, He then offered me a position of becoming a machine safety expert. This will lead to more money and skills and become a specialist in safety, But no formal uni qualifications.

I'm sure the skills are transferrable but I know lots of employers look for the Degree.  

I am struggling to decide what todo. I want to keep my options open for the next 40+ years of working.

TL;DR- Keep working and specialise or go to uni and keep a broad range of options open?",23Apr2017,0
8,"This is kind of a weirdly specific question.

I've been living in kansas city for a few years now. I have made no friends in that time. I can't find anyone to hang out with, and going out alone is just boring as hell here.

I've been to a number of cities, and I've never had trouble meeting people or having fun. Nashville, St. Louis, friggin' El Paso. You name it. In KC, everyone just feels so...exclusive. Cold. Everyone has their friend groups and doesn't seem to want to include new people.

And it extends to dating apps too. I am on 4 of them. Whenever I change my location in them (well, in the two which support it), I probably get matches ~30-40% of my right-swipes. Asheville, Boulder, New Orleans, they all tend to work out well. Many interesting people and chats. In KC? I will literally swipe right on hundreds of profiles throughout the course of the day, and nearly zero matches. When I do get a match, it's either a bot or a catfish.

Don't get me wrong. I've been convinced for so long that I'm just socially incompetent, and ugly, and bad/whatever, but my friend (from Atlanta, not KC, of course) suggested that it might just be that kansas city sucks.

At first I was like, nah. Everyone here keeps talking about how great it is. Everything I read online says that KC is supposed to be a fun city for people in their 20s. But now, I'm not so sure.

I don't know what to do.

I've got two voices in my head duking it out over this; Me1 and Me2:

&gt; M1: I've gotta get the fuck out of KC. I'm pissing away my 20s with isolation and loneliness.

&gt; M2: KC is fine, you know this, its plastered all over the internet. The problem is you, dumbass.

&gt; M1: Oh yeah? Then why isn't this an issue anywhere else?

&gt; M2: Idk, why would it be a problem here?

&gt; M1: How the hell should I know? I'm just observing.

&gt; M2: Yeah, well I'm just being logical.

Neither of these stooges have a good idea besides...get the fuck out of KC.

So, should I get the fuck out of KC?",23Apr2017,2
9,A few days ago my 504 plan ceased to exist. I was fine with it since I didn't need it. It was a few minutes ago that I realized I did need it and that my life might depend on it. I figured that if I had a 504 plan the military might decide that disqualifies me if they attempt to draft me and force me to kill. I thought that if I consistently cut my arm my school will be forced to put it back. I know from experience how to cut in a way that won't leave a noticeable scar. Does anyone have any tips on how to go about doing this new plan of mine?,23Apr2017,1

13,"A bit of background:

I was hired nearly a year ago through a recruitment agency I trusted to the role I am currently in. It was a call out of the blue and a godsend. I had been getting bounced from one unsuitable role to the next by another agency, impacting my mental health and financial situation horrifically. This current role gave me stability, independence and hope, all the things I desperately need. I am also able to use a wide set of my skill and really make significant and positive changes.

In the first few weeks, the recruitment agency I trusted lost the tender to the agency who had burned me so hard I swore never to associate with them again. I rolled with it though, and the employer keeps them at arms length, so I settled into my role to learn as much as I could. I was put onto special projects and told that if I nailed them, they would be my ticket to permanency.

I believed this and put in a stunning effort, most of my documentation for upgrading the system, working with new software was taken by another project team and I get to see my work distributed out to the rest of the organisation. Pretty neat!

But I don't know my actual role all that well, after investing in all that project time. So I've been doing my best but the senior they promoted to cover a senior on leave has turned from a nuisance to endure to a nightmare.

The senior in question is a junior, after asking all other experienced staff to fill the senior role, they declined, as the manager wanted to do some shake ups and they didn't want to take on that stress. The experienced staff are all permanent and while there has been stress leave, in-fighting, nasty comments and the usual office disapproval-without-action, the general consensus is that by acting as the managers sock puppet, the junior-senior has accomplished goals the other senior failed to reach. Changes for the good. Almost.

The junior-senior is an asshole, and we don't get along. Speaks to people like they are five, or pieces of shit. Focuses on the negative, treats everyone like the enemy. Favourite response? No. Interrupts conversations that aren't their business to correct everyone, told one staff member she was spending too much time on her phone AFTER a conversation that staff member had to inform the junior-senior that a family member had just been diagnosed with cancer, and was with her phone for information while she was stuck at work.

After 9 months of dealing with this, the senior who owns the role is set to return... but the junior-senior is being kept on too. I knew the manager didn't like the actual senior's passive approach and ability to dismiss issues and goals, which is fair, being good at the tasks isn't the same as being good at the job but with junior-senior staying on it was promoted as 'finding balance'.

I have found out that it's about throwing the actual senior under the bus, actually.

I have had many off the record conversations to see if I was taking the abrupt manner, inconsiderate behaviour, micromanaging and most of all the stunting of my training from the junior-senior personally, because I'd hate problems to persist after that asshole is fucked off back where they came from. I am always looking for areas I can improve anyway and like to take a beat to assess things. Mostly I got back a lot of negative opinions from fellow staff, so I went to my manager to see what I could do to resolve these issues I was having. I've followed their suggestions and had meetings, tried to work out strategies. I have been frank and honest.

My honesty, that the junior-senior was holding back my learning by shutting down conversations I needed to have to get information to learn, saying there was a procedure when there wasn't, letting other staff find my mistakes and bully me rather than train me etc was all interpreted later as a personal attack and nothing improved. So I went back to my manager to let them know that this junior-senior is basically an asshole, and my lack of growth is terrifying. I am coming up to one year and still casual, no holiday or sick leave, the contract not even mine but the recruitment agency's, and I want to ensure that all my hard work is going to put me in a good position if the permanent position that keeps getting dangled will open up. Permanency is more than just a job I have so show up to every day, it's holidays, sick leave, maternity leave. My life, my future family, it all hinges on my role as the provider and I have worked tirelessly to ensure I'm a valuable asset worthy of such an honour.

Then a different conversation happened, and I am at a loss as what to do, all I do is cry and vomit and feel tight pain.

The latest conversation started with my explanation: 'look, the junior-senior is an asshole. People like this pander to their friends and their bosses and suddenly all their relatives work around the place. They don't give positive feedback and make people feel valued, they pander to their friends and sycophants. Sure they know the tasks and by golly they will get down on both knees for seniors above them but they make sure that valuable people 'beneath them' who aren't at work to be best friends but to fulfil a role so they can get back to their friends are made to feel like pieces of shit. They won't take advice, they will overreact to criticism and the first time that someone disagreed with this person they had an anxiety fit and no one has been able to disagree with them since 'in case we upset them'. This person craps on about 'reasonable excuses' because they think their age and gender is why people aren't respectful when I can PROMISE its the fact they THEY ARE AN ASSHOLE. Not once have they implemented anything to help staff improve. They abandoned procedure making and berate all staff over a lack of consistency. They say things like 'I'm sick of hearing it, it's not good enough' to people who have more than 10 years experience. It's stressful, demoralising, and it's clearly showing in our work because we are behind and we are STRESSED about it.'

The response, I did not expect, as it was not consistent with what I had been told, or what I can thought as the junior-senior should be going away soon... not turning into Satan.

I was told my contract would be up to the junior-senior and I should snuggle up to them. That their roster system, a broken system causing the team to fall further behind due to its short-sighted militant approach, and putting people who aren't fully trained into tasks so other team members have to go back through the work and forward the mistakes to the poorly trained staff to fix, wasting three times the amount of time, is the be all and end all.

I was so aghast I agreed to meeting with the junior senior who assured the boss there was 'nothing wrong between us'.

I won't cover all the snide nasty remarks, the dismissal of concerns or ideas, or stealing of and not acknowledging, the criticisms and negative feedback but I would have a pretty solid bullying and harassment case if I wasn't an third party casual.

The boss then told me, in a meeting with this junior-senior, that this junior-senior was the 'one they chose' (interviewed after advertising the role as it couldn't be filled by team members as they refused) because they were the only one who saw the vision and values.

I had to ask again... THIS person, is what you think everyone should be like?

That's when it hit me. The boss, with his slight digs at the other team members, has a spiteful vendetta against most of them. He bit off more than he could chew a while ago accepting two teams. The second team is understaffed, and one person hates it so much they retired on the day I was having these mortifying meetings. I won't get to learn my job better no matter how hard I try because the junior-senior can stack it against me and as I don't like them - I'm appropriately respectful as I can be and do as I'm asked as I remember its my boss asking, not them, and it gets me through - I can be the first warning to the others when contracts are up. The phrase 'yes you did great on that, we couldn't have done it without you' came with a distinct tone devastating consequence.

I got along with my boss. I have always felt that he had my best interests at heart and I was shaping up to be a valuable asset, which is satisfying. I'm not on a career ladder, I'm ready to settle in and do my best til the next big opportunity, and I could forsee a long happy settling, and it was making me a happier, healthier person than I've been in years.

I'm the provider for myself and my partner, and being casual we squirrel away every penny but all this effort to get a permanent place in a team I love at work I am good at has just been revealed as smoke and mirrors, and I'm heartbroken, and devastated. I spent most of the day this realisation occurred in the bathroom sobbing, then throwing up, then trying to get my face back on. I have been sick ever since but I have to work to get paid, so I have to go back knowing I'm doomed and it's killing me. I need a good reference, I know that, and I looked online to see if there were other jobs available. Not in my area, but I found one and had a close look at the job description to ensure I could apply...

... I am so poorly trained that I don't even qualify for the job I'm doing. I can't get extra training because I have to adhere to a roster that micromanages daily duties down to little shifts, with output being the KPI. I have no procedure for a lot of the tasks involved and while I write notes, other staff will still send me back my work to correct. The boss, of course, listens to the junior-senior who sings their own praises. After all the person next to me, who's not on the roster and is getting intensive training before they do get on it, is getting it? So I've been rostered all the way back to the mail, which as you know, isn't quite rocket science.

I am at a loss as to what I do. I know that jobs are scarce. I am one pay away from financial crisis, not because of overspending but simply because keeping two people alive on one income in modest poverty is hard. I've been properly poor and I don't want to go back. How to I salvage my effort, my dignity and move forward with my life if it is so far out of my control? I am supposed to turn up on Monday, I don't think I'll make it out the door. If I had another job, sure, but jobs are so scarce, so hard to secure and this job, this job has been such a godsend. I don't know what to do. I can go to the senior and tell her what they told me, that she's being forced out because the boss has an agenda to serve his own ends but then that won't prove any loyalty. I can't suck up to this fucking asshole because I'm not that insincere, and I see them doing genuine harm. Half the team is looking for work elsewhere on the DL! The boss is basically asking me to step up and cover the junior-senior and I won't, they are the biggest part of the problem. They have no interest in my wellbeing, this much is clear, and I feel so betrayed by my boss I don't know what to think of him. I can't stand the thought of ever speaking to him again, when I have followed his directions from the beginning all based on this promise of permanency. Two positions that have been submitted for approval... in a team that has three contracts.  I work hard, my appraisal should be on merit, yet I can't get myself to a standard of even basic re-emplyability and we are due to be renewed for July. One staff member is a brown-noser, and while she is a stressful disruption to the team with low output, she is 'friends' with the junior-senior, and is permanent in another department while on contract in this one. The other just isn't me. We work equally as hard and we get on great, she knows even less than I do and hasn't done projects, and has strong opinions about what an asshole this junior-senior is, but she's not me.

I don't know how to put my my mental health aside to deal with this issue. Is there any insight based on this 'summary' anyone can provide?

TL;DR - I've been casual for a year and strung along on promises of permanency, but now that the deadline is coming up the boss is so stubbornly determined to prove that he didn't make a mistake putting an ass-kissing asshole in charge that he's giving determination of contracts to them, something above their role and authority and this person doesn't like me, and is responsible for a roster that has stunted my training and all hope of retaining my role, and I'm having a nervous breakdown because I want to keep the job, I need it if I ever want to have a family.",23Apr2017,1
14,"I (F/22) have been seeing this guy (M/25) for about 4 months.
We first met in Mexico on a family vacation when I was 16. His dad is best buddy with my step-dad. I saw him maybe once every 2 or 3 years.. we were not friends back then but our dad/step dad were.
We started seeing each other in January.
He says that he doesn't want a relationship because he doesn't even love himself, so he has nothing to offer, or believes so. He has very low self esteem and always brings himself down.
One evening he told me that if we continue seeing each other that often (we see each other once every 4 days), he will start to get attached and he doesn't want that.
Last week he even said out of nowhere that he was going to cut ties and delete my number. When I asked why, he said that he is starting to get attached and it would be better off this way.
4 days later he texted me to see me.
Yesterday was his birthday.. I didn't even know it was his birthday. He texted me to see me and he drove for 2 hours to the town where he used to live for 10 years because he had to pick up something from a friend. My guess is that he wanted me to come with him so he could show me to his old friends. But I might be wrong.
I just find it weird that 8 days ago, he wanted to cut ties and yesterday, he invited me to come for a 2 hours ride on his birthday...
Why did he want to he with me on his birthday?? Usually when it's my birthday I want to be around the people I love the most.. so I'm guessing.. perhaps he does love me?
WHEN WE HAVE SEX
Ok so when we have sex.. it is the most incredible thing in the world. The only kind of sex I had like this was with my ex-boyfriend (I was in a relationship with him for 3 years).
I had pleeenty of sex in my life... but this is the kind of sex that touches my soul. Very rare. I do not feel like he is fucking me. In fact, he never said ""let's make out"" or ""let's have sex or let's fuck)
He ALWAYS says LET'S MAKE LOVE
He takes the time to caress all my body.. plays with my hair.. kisses me a lot... We cuddle when we sleep.. I'm the big spoon and he fits perfectly in my nook :) He says he never cuddle while he sleeps usually.. and that he doesn't understand why he can with me.
He always asks me if I can caress his whole body.. not necessarly in a sexual way.. I find it super intimate. Not the type of intimacy I can get from a fuckbuddy... which leads me to wonder if he loves me!!
Whenever I sleep at his place, I always spend at least the whole afternoon there. Sometimes we also go for breakfast. We also see each other at his friends place sometimes. So we don't see each other solely for the purpose of sex.
He also said that he has not slept with anyone else since we started seeing each other.
One day he told me that he went to the corner store and the owner asked ""where is your girlfriend?"" and he replied ""she's coming later"" Why did he mentionned that to me?? To see my reaction??
He always insist that we are not a couple, but sometimes he's gonna make some references about it.
My guess is that he has feelings for me but he is scared to be hurt and more specially to hurt me... He said that I am a good girl and hat he will break my heart. He has emotionally hurt many girls in the past and he is scared to do the same to me..
He also said that I am the only person he feels comfortable enough to be around when he is on cocaine.
He is very ashamed of himself and he knows that I don't judge him. He also is one of the very few person I feel super comfortable to be around. I've had a very rough past (you can see from my others posts), so it's not easy for me to connect with people... because I feel like ppl usually don't understand.. but he does and he never judges me.
For your record, I know that it might sound completely fucked up that I love a coke head. But he is seeing a therapist and at least he is getting some help.. he wants to change his lifestyle but it's hard for him. I know he wants to and I believe in him!
I love him and I just want him to feel loved... He sees himself like a piece of shit and it makes me terribly sad that he sees himself like that. I have cried two times over that... not because he hurted me, but because he is hurting himself.. I see a light in him that he cannot see... and that's why I cried.
I just want him to realise that he actually is a good person and that his addiction does not define who he really is. I want him to realise that he is worth it. I want him to realise that he can be a good man, and that it's not because he emotionnally hurted other women that he will do the same with me.
I don't necessarly want to be in relationship with him because I know that he doesn't even love himself and we all need to fix ourselves before being able to be OK with someone. But I just love him... sometimes I look at him and I just want to say it!! Just I love you!! that's it!!
But I am just wondering.. does he love me? Is he worth waiting for? Aren't we all broken anyways?
My plan is to continue to see him and that eventually things will develop.. welll I think they are already but he is scared to take things further.
I love him and I don't want to make him feel like he is being trapped. I know that this man needs his space too; I don't want to be a controlling girlfriend. I just want to be there for him and to love him. I just think that he doesn't want to accept love because he thinks that he doesn't deserve it. It breaks my heart.",23Apr2017,0

22,"Is this even normal? I just feel so sad all the time I hate it. I hate myself for being this way, I hate that I missed so many opportunities to tell him I love him. 

We were pretty much best friends, he had no one else and neither did I . He had to walk to work because he had no vehicle and I started walking with him. We listened to the same music, we liked the same things, and we were both lonely. We didn't have a way to cope, we're both broke. I spent every weekend with him in his raggedy trailer, even when he couldn't afford electricity.

We just had so much in common and we had planned to go see a show by his favorite rap group a week after he passed away. I just have no one to talk to the way I talked to him, I see him sometimes still. He's in my dreams, I swear I've even seen him walking on the road. I haven't had a day go by that I haven't thought of him. 

I lost a best friend and I'll never have one like him I just don't know what to do. I have anxiety and every time I try to do something it just messes me up. I just wanna be sitting on the couch talking to him, ya know? I got no one to vent to, I got no one to tell them how my week went, I got no one telling me how *their* week went.

24,"I just started a new job at a big box clothing store as a cashier a few weeks ago and it has been super easy. I have enjoyed working with everyone and thought everyone was being super supportive.  I have been going through depression but wanted to make sure I didn't let that reflect upon my job. I bath everyday before work, I put on deodorant, I brush my teeth, and before I leave I put on some type of body spray. Fast forward to tonight when I thought I was having a productive work night, an employee approached me and asked me a few things. First she asked if I knew if I checked out a lady and I said I didn't know and asked why. She said ""the lady thinks you are super nice but you smell so bad."" In shock I asked her if she could smell anything. Mind you the whole time she is speaking to me she is laughing at me. ""Yeah you smell like piss! LOL!"" And continued to laugh until I told her It could have been my shirt didn't dry all the way or something. Continuing to laugh and mock me, I had to stand up formyself and tell her she has no tact and can end the conversation. I went back to my register and asked my other  employee if I smelled. She smiled and started laughing. So I go to the manager and find her talking with the first employee laughing about me. Should I even do anything?  I really don't know what to do.

30,"Is this normal? I'm 18, I consider myself lonely after my close friend's death last year. I talk to people, but I don't consider them friends. I have a thirst for love, and to be loved.

I'm sad for two reasons. 

First thing is, I miss my son. I remember the dream so nicely. He looked so beautiful, he smiled so bright, and I'm just upset I can't have him in my hands again. I want to have another dream of him and my wife.

Second thing is, I fear I'll forever be lonely. I consider my face nice-looking, *I* like my personality. I don't know why I can't ever get someone to stay. Maybe I don't talk enough? Maybe I don't seem appealing to them? Maybe I set my standards to high, but I don't know.

I've broken down in tears over this dream, I just don't know what to think. I want a child badly, and have always had, just not as bad as I do now.

31,"I currently go to a small Catholic high school, and I've been having a lot of social problems. Since my school is so small, I have about 6 people that I could consider my 'friends'. the reason that I have  quotations around friends is because all of the people I call my friends have created a group chat with them and other people, and I'm the only one not in it. In this group chat, they plan parties and things to do together, and since I'm not in it, I always stay home by myself. 
I used to go to public school and i had friends there, but I'm scared to transfer back because I don't know if I would be able to recreate friendships that I used to have. I've been really sad lately and my current school situation is making me even more sad, and causing me to hate going to school. What should I do?

is creative/competitive


can be done alone


does not require a ton of equipment


things like art, programming, etc.

so if anyone can suggest things along the lines of these 2 i would really appreciate it.  i want a hobby where i can always get better, i can show my skills in some manner (i can sell it or use it in competition), and doesn't require some insane $$$ investment or starting when you're 6 years old

activities i've tried and not liked/already done/sick of: esports, programming, art (see what i did there)

hopely someone can help me out here, i already do a lot of reading now (will help for grad school!) but i need an outlet for my competitive side that isn't fucking video games

35,"So one of my friends (Morgan) set me up with her best friend (Paige). We talked over kik for a while and she seemed great. I was really starting to like her. Then last night they both came over and I was severely disappointed. The girl is overweight, bratty, hits everybody, was dressed like shit, and would literally bite me if I stopped paying attention to her for more than 30 seconds. I did not enjoy it at all. We did end up kissing once Morgan left because I wanted to see if maybe there was some chance I could salvage this. So today I invited her over again. She was a little better this time but is still pretty gross physically. I let her suck my dick and as soon as I came I just wanted her to get the fuck away from me. I didn't want to touch her or kiss her. I felt absolutely nothing. I like her over text but in person she is pretty awful to be around, not to mention that she looks nothing like the original pictures I saw. So I'm in an awkward spot. She has most definitely caught feelings and I have most definitely lost them. Should I see where this goes or should I just break her heart?",23Apr2017,4

So obviously the best thing to do was to tell people on reddit.",23Apr2017,2
38,"I have a friend of sorts or ex as she would say that I had a fling with that lasted for maybe a week. Told her straight up that it's been fun the last couple of weeks, but I don't see this going any further, as I didn't want to commit to a relationship I didn't see happening. In the time we spent together she didn't tell me she was bipolar or was suffering from any mental condition, all in all she acted a bit too childish and care free for my tastes. 

A couple of days after we agreed this would not work she called me and said she had an issue and wondered if she could come over, I said yes I would gladly help as we were still friends kind of. She came over and sat on my couch for a while until I asked what the problem was and she answered ""nothing, just wanted to be with you"". Immediatetly some sensors went off in my head, but I let it rest and let her stay. I watched my show and did my normal routines while talking to her as a friend. 
This went on for many hours with her just sitting on my couch. After she'd been there for a good 8 hours I asked if she didn't have somewhere to be (she has 2 kids) she replied with a quick no.

Time was getting close to 11pm and I had early work so I kinda just said that I had to go to sleep, it had gotten quite uncomfortable over the course of 10 hours, but I didn't want to throw her out. Her reply was ""can I sleep next to you?"". Now there's a limit to how intimate I wan't to get with a person I actually don't like (too childish), so I asked her kindly if she would leave. This is when stuff got strange.

She started crying and clinging onto me telling me how much she needs me, that she wouldn't survive without me. I couldn't believe this was happening so I roughened up my voice and told her to leave, I was baffled and didn't know what to do. She left.

Next day she sends me a message saying that she is bipolar and suffers from depression and the like. Finally it started to make sense. I said that it's fine and apologized for throwing her out. Later that day I got a message if she could come over again, I was kinda baffled and asked why. The reply was that she likes being in my apartment and that it calms her. I agreed that she could come over once in a while to chat. This is when stuff got annoying.

Remind you that she was still her childish self which I really don't like or appreciate. Regardless I let her come over once in a while.
Move to present day, I can't deal with it anymore, she pesters me everyday about coming over, every waking hour, she stays until the AMs everyday, everything she does annoys me, the ONLY reason she is still in my life is because she keeps saying she is gonna kill herself or die if she can't be with me whenever I say no to her coming over. This happens every time. What the fuck am I supposed to do, she keeps asking why I don't love her I say because I don't, then she says I should force myself to love her. 

What do I do reddit? I am terrified she is gonna kill herself if I ignore her.

Sorry for any typos typing on my phone, locked myself in my room while she sleeps on the couch (again thretened to kill herself)

Tl;dr 
Ex is bipolar.
Asks if she can come over everyday
Stays for hours, doesn't leave until I basically throw her out.
Keep telling her that enough is enough.

40,"I'm really bad with people. I'm even worse with women. Here goes...

I was talking to this girl online who had just undertook a month long, 5000 mile journey across the continent, and had only been in the state for 2 days. I tried giving her a heads up that the northern lights were out really strong that night. She's not a night owl, so she had already gone to bed. She messages me back the next morning and tells me that she hasn't seen them before. She later suggests that we go to the lookout spot outside of town and watch them that night. So... We do.

She picks me up later that night and we go 20 miles north of town and wait for the sun to set and the aurora to come out. It never really did. :( I'm really shy, so talking to people is a challenge. I'm also really quiet. Needless to say there was a lot of awkward silence. We did talk about her trip up here and found out that we have a ton of stuff in common. Like very niche things too, surprised me. Haha. We're both sleepy and nothing is going on in the sky, so she ends up falling asleep. I try to stay up on lookout and eventually nod off for a little while too. We wake up freezing at 2AM and decide to call it a night, we drive back to town and she drops me off.

I get a text like 10 minutes later suggesting that we hang out again a little earlier in the day. I'm absolutely down for it!

I don't know where to go from here. I've never really done this. That night I realized that I could really like this girl. But I'm scared that I'm doing everything wrong.

I really need some advice.

I feel as though I am very good at getting my baseline work finished. I can do my homework before it's due and I know how much the bare minimum I need to study to get good grades. What I struggle with most are any additional life skills. 

I stopped smoking weed because I thought it was heavily interfering with me improving my own life but what I really realized is I can't commit to anything. I love instant gratification. I'm able to watch hundreds of 10-minute youtube videos or scroll through every sub on Reddit but when it comes to focusing on other things I can't.

I've tried playing guitar(lasted 2 weeks), meditating(comes and goes as a habit but never lasts long), and even running(also comes and goes and at it's longest I did for a month straight). I can't even commit to a god damn Netflix show. I've tried to-do apps and post-it notes. 

I feel like an absolute piece of shit and I know I'm wasting so much time but I can't get myself to consistently do something.

46,"So I [23M] have recently been thinking a little bit about my social situation, or lack thereof. I graduated college about a year ago, and have been working a full time job since September. 

I have always be a very quiet, introverted, and socially anxious person and have never really had a lot of friends. Through high school and college I had a few friends that I would hang out with occasionally but most of those relationships have kinda just disappeared after school. One of my long time best friends just kinda decided to not be friends with me anymore a few years ago (long dumb/childish-sounding story), and my only other friend that has kinda stuck with me since we were like 4 seems to always be too 'busy' with his girlfriend of like 6 years. Basically what it seems like from my perspective is that if I don't actively try to keep a friendship going by starting conversations, suggesting to do things, etc then I'm just forgotten. And sometimes that doesn't even work. As I'm sure you can imagine, this makes things very difficult for someone with a personality like mine. 

As far as intimate relationship go I have had two, and my last one ended like 4 years ago. Over the years I've gone through phases where I'd really like a girlfriend but once I'd start talking to a girl that I actually like, I'd get too scared to ever really say anything. As of now, a romantic relationship might be nice to have, but not exactly a priority of mine.

So when it comes to starting a relationship (intimate or non) I have this problem of not having an exciting life. I'm interested in cars and video games. I don't drink. I don't smoke anymore. I never have anything going on that I could invite someone to join me in unless you want to play a game or go for a drive. And those two things sound like good activities to do with other people except it seems to be very difficult to find people around me that share my interests. I know they're there, but quiet socially-anxious introvert...yeah.

So what was my problem? That's the thing. I don't know if there is a problem. I'm kinda okay with the way things are now. Sure I might like to have a few friends I can do things with or a girlfriend that I can be really close with and get the 'when you get a girlfriend'-style comments from my parents to stop, but I don't know. I'm happy with how things are right now. The question is how long will that last? Who knows...

TL;DR
I live my life pretty much alone. I'm happy with how things are for now, but I'm unsure if I should try to make changes. And if you think I should, what would you suggest?",23Apr2017,1

As a result, I end up forgetting half the stuff the next day. For example, Duolingo, It teaches you conjugations and translations but doesn't go in depth with the alphabet.

51,"I apologize in advance for how lengthy this post is going to be, but the background info is painfully necessary. So my mother has been in relationships her whole life.. She just went through her third divorce. She has been with nothing but abusive men and knows no other life than that of catering to them in order to feel secure.

My mother lives on a farm in the midwest with her absolutely evil and insanely abusive (now ex) husband. She has no job and my wealthy grandmother pays for her to live, but only that. She bought my mother's home for her in an attempt to help her start a farming business, which never really came to fruition. 

My brother is a heroin addict in a constant cycle of relapse and recovery an has been for ten years. He relies on my grandmother as well, who seems all too willing to enable him, and even guilt trip my mother into keeping him in the family. He has a child that has been taken by child services and may come back into his custody in the next few months. My mother has talked about taking her so that she does not end up in and out of foster homes.

So the summary of my issue is this: my mother lives in an abusive, isolated environment in the middle of nowhere with 14 dogs, zero income of her own, a (ex) husband that refuses to work and still bullies her into submission, a potential baby that may become her responsibility, a heroin addicted son that is her responsibility, and a mother that is seemingly (only through the communication I've been told about) but is also my mother's only means of survival right now. My mother has a myriad of health problems that make her virtually unemployable (she recovered recently from a massive jaw tumor that required a complete reconstruction of her lower jaw, and is now battling patches of skin cancer on her arm, not to mention, crippling anxiety and depression due to her toxic, agoraphobia promoting environment). She refuses to get rid of her animals because they are her only means of love and security, she refuses to get help or accept that she has trapped herself in this situation, she refuses to cut ties with my brother, and she claims that he has begged my grandmother for financial help to get out of the situation only to be met with a ""you need to make your current situation work for you"" response. I don't know if that's true or not. It's just what I've been told. Unfortunately, my family is very small and very gossipy, and I don't believe that my reaching out to my grandmother would do much good.

At this point, I feel like my mother is a lost cause and that there is nothing I can do. We used to be best friends and now we barely talk because I don't know how to talk to her without trying to psychoanalyze her and make suggestions that make her feel invalid and condescended against. What makes me incredibly sad as well is that, though this story sounds like the saga of a drug addicted white trash zombie mom livin' in podunk nowhere, my mother is actually an incredible soul. She used to be a practicing Wiccan and is now some kind of Christian mystic. She is an online certified crystal healer and reiki master, yogi, and brilliant artist. All things that she is unable to fully express in her current situation. I feel like I'm watching a goddess drown in darkness. 

i live about thirteen hours away from her and am a burgeoning artist, actually making some headway and gaining momentum. Am I a bad daughter for not staying closer and trying harder to help her? Am I doing the right thing by still trying to progress in my own life? Does the situation seem entirely hopeless? I don't normally ask for advice for things this personal on public forums, but I don't have much in the way of trustworthy family and the few friends I do have are at a loss. I am desperate.",23Apr2017,2
52,"I'm new here, actually is my second or third post.

I don't even know where to start. That's why I am here, maybe someone who reads this post can help me.

First of all, I'm not a native English speaker. I know someone could ask, why is this guy looking for help in a different languaje? The reason is that I'm learning English. I always have loved this language, and due my current job (I work for a US company in a third world country) I have to send and receive emails every single day (feel free to correct my mistakes) sometimes I have to attend phone calls and believe, I do my best.

Well, I have several issues to solve but the main thing right now is an issue about my aunt. She's an Alzheimer's patient for six or seven years. Her husband abandoned her, he took their possesions and belongings, sent her to her native country with nothing except some clothes and some money. The first months, one of her ""friends"" was sending my aunt's Social Security benefits, amounts were different every month. Since we have to take care of her, I decided to changer her Social Security settings to be received here in our country.

Some weeks later, this ""friend"" called me stating that she was coming to take my aunt with her to the US, when I asked why, she didn't say something clear, she started giving excuses and whatnot. So I asked for legal advice and what these people told me was, don't let your aunt abandon the country, because you don't know what do these people want to do with your aunt. They tried to take my aunt with them one more time. 

Social Security benefits are not enough to give her a better attention. And I think it's not fair that having her home and belongings, she has to go through so many difficulties.

Before she became ill, she suspected that her husband was cheating on her; in addition she felt ill so she decided to save money. When the Alzheimer's symptoms began, she gave her savings to a relative, now this family member doesn't want to give her back.

A lot has happened after she was sent to the country. I had just started on a new job and I asked for so many personnal leaves (paperworks, appointments, etc) that I jeopardized my work. I had to delegate another person as her representative.

My mother became ill because of how difficult it is to care for an Alzheimer's patient, I could not help her much, because I have small children in my charge, and just a few relatives and friends have helped us.

My mother became ill because of how difficult it is to care for an Alzheimer's patient, I could not help her much, because I have small children in my charge, and just a few relatives and friends have helped us.

I have been very sick because of the stress of this situation, the stress of my job, all this situation. My mother was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, so we  had to look for an institution of the state to take care of my aunt, that was some months ago, my mother still does not recover completely, me neither. Even though people on this institutional retirement home treat them well, is not enough for this kind of patients, in fact, her disease has progressed.

There are many other things that also keep me on the verge of collapse, but I know that I must being with something.

I am open to any kind of comment, advice, help, whatever, I really need advice and guidance.

Thank your for your attention.

I am single and she has a great boyfriend. I started struggling in my classes while is in the top 10 and earning scholarships. She is even going abroad for an internship which obviously I couldn't afford. I get very depressed when I compare myself to her, because honestly I don't have anything, she is even my only friend, and she goes out every night with her new group of friends. I am so happy for her, but it is getting so difficult to get perspective with her shining so bright, and i don't want to be mean to her but I am starting to resent her. Especially it hurts me that she doesn't see how much I am hurting, and how I miss her, because she is now so busy with her new an exciting life. I want her to be happy with all my heart, and I love her very much, so I want to get away from her so she be successful and happy without having a loser friend like me.

57,"As i'm writing this post, I'm feeling more and more like the worst human being on this planet, so all i ask is that you guys answer with constructive advice rather than ripping me a new one. 
A little background: I've grown up with an array of animals and have been a huge animal lover my whole life. We bought our dog at a pet store when he was about 6 months old at a pet store (probably a puppy mill puppy, but we were young and unaware of it at the time). He has been a pretty big handful the entire time we've had him (he's 9 now). But despite his naughtiness, we loved him dearly. And then 4 years ago, we had our first kid and that's when things started to change. 
I really wanted my kids to grow up with animals because I remembered how great it was for me. But of course our priorities changed and he was kind of put on the back burner. He started acting out by peeing in the house. I was overwhelmed and frustrated and didn't know what to do. I finally came to my senses and realized that he was just stir crazy and i'm sure feeling neglected. So I hired a dog walker to pick him up and take him out for a couple hours a day. Things with the peeing got better, but his other quirks still aggravated us. A year ago, we had our second kid and moved houses. Our new house had a better backyard, so we were able to leave the door open for him and at this point, installed a doggie door so he can relieve himself. But since moving into the new house, we've completely restricted him to just the kitchen and dining room because they don't have carpet, so easier to clean the pee if he were to pee in the house. We used to let him snuggle/sleep on our couch with us. He no longer gets to do that. He basically doesn't get any attention from us other than an occasional pat when we walk by him or frustration at him when he does pee in the house (despite having 24hr access to the outdoors). We're at the point that my husband and I have had serious discussions about how he would probably be better off if we adopt him out to another family because the guilt of how awful we are to him is eating us away. But the guilt/disappointment/shame/embarrassment in myself is so overwhelming that i just don't have the heart to let him go. I don't know if i'm just holding out for things to magically get better or what. I think I also just have this unrealistic belief that he's going to feel abandoned. But he's a dog...am I crazy?
We haven't gone back to hiring a dog walker because money is tight for us right now.
So understand that we are completely aware of the fact that we are neglectful, selfish owners. Do you guys have any advice on what we should do? I know it's probably an easy answer for you guys: ADOPT HIM OUT!!!! But if you guys could help me see the light, i'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks...",23Apr2017,1
58,"I (F/22) have been seeing this guy (M/25) for about 4 months. We met 7 years ago on holidays with our family (my step dad and his step dad are good friends), but we were not really friends back then.

He says that he doesn't want a relationship because he doesn't even love himself, so he has nothing to offer, or believes so. He has very low self esteem and always brings himself down.

One evening he told me that if we continue seeing each other that often (we see each other once every 4 days), he will start to get attached and he doesn't want that. Last week he even said out of nowhere that he was going to cut ties and delete my number. He said that he is starting to get attached and it would be better off this way.

4 days later he texted me to see me. And yesterday was his birthday and he said that he wanted to see me.. We went for a drive and he drove for 2 hours to the town where he used to live for 10 years because he had to pick up something from a friend. My guess is that he wanted me to come with him so he could show me to his old friends. But I might be wrong. I just find it weird that 8 days ago, he wanted to cut ties and yesterday, he invited me to come for a 2 hours ride on his birthday... Why did he want to he with me on his birthday?? Usually when it's my birthday I want to be around the people I love the most.. so I'm guessing.. perhaps he does love me?

**WHEN WE HAVE SEX**
Ok so when we have sex.. it is the most incredible thing in the world. The only kind of sex I had like this was with my ex-boyfriend (I was in a relationship with him for 3 years). I had pleeenty of sex in my life... but this is the kind of sex that touches my soul. Very rare. I do not feel like he is fucking me. In fact, he never said ""let's make out"" or ""let's have sex or let's fuck) 

**He ALWAYS says LET'S MAKE LOVE**

He takes the time to caress all my body.. plays with my hair.. kisses me a lot... We cuddle when we sleep.. I'm the big spoon and he fits perfectly in my nook :) He says he never cuddle while he sleeps usually.. and that he doesn't understand why he can with me. He always asks me if I can caress his whole body.. not necessarily in a sexual way.. I find it super intimate. Not the type of intimacy I can get from a fuckbuddy... which leads me to wonder if he loves me!!

Whenever I sleep at his place, I always spend at least the whole afternoon there. 

Sometimes we also go for breakfast. We also see each other at his friends place sometimes. So we don't see each other solely for the purpose of sex. He also said that he has not slept with anyone else since we started seeing each other without me even asking. One day he told me that he went to the corner store and the owner asked ""where is your girlfriend?"" and he replied ""she's coming later"" Why did he mentionned that to me?? To see my reaction?? He always insist that we are not a couple, but sometimes he's gonna make some references about it.

My guess is that he has feelings for me but he is scared to be hurt and more specially to hurt me... He said that I am a good girl and hat he will break my heart. He has emotionally hurt many girls in the past and he is scared to do the same to me.. He also said that I am the only person he feels comfortable enough to be around when he is on cocaine. He is very ashamed of himself and he knows that I don't judge him. He also is one of the very few person I feel super comfortable to be around. I've had a very rough past (you can see from my others posts), so it's not easy for me to connect with people... because I feel like ppl usually don't understand.. but he does and he never judges me. For your record, I know that it might sound completely fucked up that I love a coke head. But he is seeing a therapist and at least he is getting some help.. he wants to change his lifestyle but it's hard for him. I know he wants to and I believe in him! I love him and I just want him to feel loved... He sees himself like a piece of shit and it makes me terribly sad that he sees himself like that. I have cried two times over that... not because he hurted me, but because he is hurting himself.. I see a light in him that he cannot see... and that's why I cried. I just want him to realise that he actually is a good person and that his addiction does not define who he really is. I want him to realise that he is worth it. I want him to realise that he can be a good man, and that it's not because he emotionnally hurted other women that he will do the same with me.

I don't necessarily want to be in relationship with him because I know that he doesn't even love himself and we all need to fix ourselves before being able to be OK with someone. But I just love him... sometimes I look at him and I just want to tell him that I love him. But I am just wondering.. does he love me? Is he worth waiting for?

**Please I don't want to hear advices like ""you shouldn't pursue this relationship"", I just want to know if he loves me or not**

60,"So as the title says I am currently an architecture student and I'm wondering if staying in school is actually worth it. I currently working for an architecture firm part time while I'm also going to school full time for a degree in architecture. I struggle with school quite a bit, especially the discipline and homework side of it. I'm really very happy in the field though and am very proud of my work. So now I'm just curious if I should abandon school in pursuit of my architect licensure through experience. In the architecture field you don't have to have a college degree in order to get licensed, it all depends on experience. The degree just potentially shortens the time by about a year and a half. 

I'm also nervous about how my bosses will feel about this even though 2 of the 3 partners of the company never got their bachelors degrees and are still licensed. It's probably just my own insecurities whispering things into my ears since one of the partners has said that the company will always be there for me if I need a job. So this also brings up that fact that continuing college puts me in debt while the experience route has me earning money year round. Any advice would be very helpful.

TL;DR - Architecture student that sucks at school but is okay at architecture, would like advice for continuing on school path or experience path.

61,"I wasn't sure where to post this but I am currently kind of freaking out.

Last night I was hanging out with some friends and it was a spontaneous decision that we would go to our high school because there's a really cool spot on the roof of the gym where you can see the entire city. For some reason it never even crossed my mind that the school has security cameras and as we are walking towards the gym, someone points out that there's a security camera. I don't think I ever looked directly at it because I wasn't sure where it was, so my face may not be on it but I'm really not sure.

We legit just stood on the roof and looked around, we didn't vandalize anything. 

I know this was stupid so please spare me a lecture because it will never happen again. I can't believe I didn't think this through.
 
Do public schools check security footage from the weekend if they don't have any reason to? I know this is tress passing but how much trouble could I really get in? What are the chances they could identify me from the footage?

64,"Okay. So I've made a post on this a while back deleted it. My friends have a reddit so this is a throwaway. Where do I start? 
    There's this boy I've known since middle school. Let's call him ""Steve"". So Steve and I recently started talking again last year. We're in drama club together and I had a tiny crush on him last year around this time but I tried to flirt and he didn't really respond so I dropped it. Earlier last year, (like Octoberish) I caught feelings again and I tried to see if he was into me. We just finished doing another show together. In this show we were a couple and I was careful to not get caught up in a showmance. But oh my goodness. I'm pretty sure he likes me. There's so many signs pointing to him liking me. For instance: we do that weird lingery half hand holding thing when we talk, he compliments me when I look nice and we've danced to music together like chest to chest face to face (not like prom style but he saw I was having fun and laughing and smiling and he kept it up). 
         We're always around each other and I've tried gauging his interest in getting close to him and seeing if he backs away.... He doesn't. We give each other that look (y'know the look). I keep getting this feeling that I want to kiss him and I just wanna do it but I'm scared he won't want it back. Whenever we take pictures his arm is around my waist. He texted me earlier and mentioned an event (can't get too specific) where I thought some of our friends would be attending for later next week. He was so subtle about it but mentioned that it was ""$5 for US"". I said I'd love to go and asked if everyone else was going. He said he didn't know. Was this a sly way for him to test the waters and hang out with me? What if it was? I wanna really make a move and make it OBVIOUS I like him and that I want something out of this. But in the past he denied liking me when I asked over text. I thought maybe he was being honest but actions speak louder than words. I've liked boys in the past and said I didn't like them even though I REALLY did.

**TL;DR:** I guess what I'm saying is I really like this dude and just wanna know if he feels the same and he's shy so if you think he likes me what should I do? I just wanna kiss him or hold his hand or do something to show him I obviously like him and to obviously gauge if he likes me.

I've had poor self esteem from the moment I knew what self esteem even was; and for that reason, it's kind of become my identity over time. I am ""the girl that hates herself"" at this point. My humor could be summed up as ""I hate myself"", and it works because people find it funny. People laugh when I act like I hate myself. I don't know, it's just natural now.

68,"Live in a flat/apartment with neighbours all around me. Guy upstairs has been an issue from the start - stomps around his apartment carelessly (heavy enough to shake my light fittings), singing (last year he sang the same two lines from Adele's Hello over and over, every evening for weeks), etc. Found out both the guy living here before me and the landlords (who lived here themselves before him) knew him as a noisy neighbour. Landlords even nicknamed him Mr Stompy. From the sounds of it nobody actually did/said anything about it though (typical Brits!). 

Mr Stompy got himself a girlfriend a while back. Not only could I hear her now clomping about in heels but I also had to hear them have sex. Not simply a bit of headboard-banging you sometimes have to expect living in a flat - I could hear what they were saying during sex too, which is a little too intimate I think by most people's opinions... 

Enough was enough. I don't need to know when my neighbour's girlfriend is coming. Plus I know I'd be mortified if my neighbours could hear things that I said during those moments. But due to the awkward nature of this noise complaint, I wimped out (typical Brits!) and left an anonymous note in his letter box informing him that I could hear *everything*. He left a note in my box apologising and for about a week afterwards he was much quieter. Thankfully I never heard the sexing again but he soon went back to his regular stomping ways. 


A few weeks later I was watching TV when it got drowned out by repetitive thumping - it sounded like someone was jumping up and down. It went on long enough to be more than just a stumble or something. I got my broom and ladder (I live in an old building with VERY high ceilings) and pounded back. Yes, I could've gone up and asked him to keep it down, but it was the evening, I was in my pyjamas and had rubbed my make-up off/around my face. I didn't want to have to leave my flat to speak to someone, I just wanted to relax. Besides, I had already let him know how easily noise carries. 

Anyway, Mr Stompy obviously didn't appreciate my methods as he stomped out of his flat, downstairs and pounded on my door until I answered. He then proceeded to yell at me for daring to interrupt his granddaughter's (yes, he's that old) dance rendition. Basically his opinion was we live in flats so you're bound to hear each other so tough luck. I don't disagree that you have to expect some noise, but I think you should also be a respectful neighbour so they don't hear everything you do. I walk softly on my floors, feel guilty if I drop something heavy, keep my music to a reasonable level etc. In other words, yes you're gonna hear each other but that doesn't mean you have free reign to make as much noise as you want. I tried to stand my ground while he was yelling at me but honestly he scared me and left me shaking. I've avoided him ever since (*thankfully* he continues to be noisy so I can hear him leave his flat, i know to wait a few minutes so I don't run in to him). 

The new problem:
Recently he's decided to use what I'm guessing is his phone as an alarm, and presumably putting it on the floor so the vibrations travel through and I can hear them in my room. This wouldn't be an issue if he switched it off soon after like a normal person, and I would probably just sleep through it. But he leaves it on (sleeps through it?) for at least 45 minutes!

He first started this two weeks ago when I was off work. I tried to put up with it believing that it would at least be less annoying when I was back at work and would be waking up before then anyway. Turns out it wasn't really - I could still hear the 'bvvvvv bvvvvv bvvvvv' over my radio as I was getting ready. 

Obviously, it's the weekend now so I thought I'd get a break. But both today and yesterday I've been woken up at 5.30-5.45 am. It's driving me insane. 

Things I've tried:
- primal screaming (out of frustration rather than any belief it would stop the noise. It did not) 
- slamming my bedroom door (again mostly out of sleepy frustration, but also hoping a little the noise and shaking would carry up to his flat and wake him. This worked, but I felt terrible for my neighbour downstairs who probably also felt/heard it) 
- the old broom trick again (not particularly practical as I have to balance on my bed, but it worked twice. This morning, it did not work.) 

So, reddit. Where do I go from here? I had hoped that my broom-banging would let him know that I can hear the alarm and he'd then do something about it (like turn it off in good time) but apparently not. Or maybe he just doesn't care. My brother in law reckons he's doing it deliberately now, although I'm not sure because it's been a while since our last run-in. 

I know the rational answer would be to talk to him, but after the incident, I'm pretty scared of confronting him. He's a bully and he's quick with his words. I'm quite sure he'd just argue his right to make noise again. It would be the pigeon/chess scenario - only with the pigeon also shouting and flapping its wings angrily... I'm single and live alone so there is no one I can send up with/instead of me. 

Also, I'm probably only 99% sure it's him... Because it's a vibration I suppose technically it could be carrying from the flats either side of me. However, 1) I've never heard any noises from my side neighbours ever; 2) the 2/3 success rate of me banging on my ceiling/his floor shows a clear cause and effect; and 3) within minutes of the alarm stopping, I can hear him stomping in to the bathroom (where I can hear him pee too. Great.) 

So it's a pretty safe bet it's him, but I'm just worried if I spoke to him about it he'd either deny it or tell me I'm over reacting and to put up with it. 

What should I do?

78,"Back story:

My sister was dating this guy for a while and they even moved in together for a few months. One night he left.

About him:

He is incredibly bipolar, but refuses to take his medication. He would get her black out drunk and take advantage of her almost every night. He almost punched a hole in the wall (left knuckle impressions). They had a gun at one point, and he would threaten to kill himself. The gun was disposed of. He would threaten to kill himself with knives, and would turn on her when she would try to stop him. 

Now:

We just moved, and left no addresses to where we are now. 

We found out that he's dating a 17 yo, and she's informing us that he wants to hunt my sister down and mess up her car and her life in general. And even hire a group of people to do it for him. 

Now she's showing signs of ptsd, is very paranoid, and doesn't feel safe anymore. She still thinks he can get her, hurt her.

I'm focusing my future money making into stock piling some weapons (I'm good with a pistol, going to work on rifles and shot guns so I don't blow out my shoulder). She has a pit bull puppy, we're working on training him to be get esa and body guard. So if people do show up, we can mess them up before they can mess with us.

89,"so I had this friend 4 years ago who I used to make music with. he hit me up recently saying he was hungry, turns out he's homeless.. I bought him food.. he called me again for food a few days later (give a mouse a cookie, you know), and I told him I would bring him food if he applied to a bunch of jobs. cut to today; after getting applications to a bunch of places near where he sleeps, he shows me where he's sleeping. it's a shed next to his mom's house, no mattress or anything. apparently his mom won't let him in the house to shower, sleep, or do laundry until he goes to rehab. why rehab, you ask? he was arrested like 15 times for stealing booze, vandalism, smoking meth, public intoxication, and impeding police business. the judge told him he had to go to rehab, or he was going to jail for 90 days.. when I asked him why he wasn't going to rehab, he said ""I just need to get a lawyer, and they'll get the judge to accept the last rehab I went to in oakland."" I was like ""that's not how this shit works, you need to go to rehab or you're going to jail,"" and he said ""I'm not going to rehab, don't rain on my parade, I'm just going to attract good things with positive energies,"" and then he invited me to a drum circle / barbecue tomorrow. he has a court date late next month. 

If he would just listen to me, within a month he would have a job where his coworkers and boss like him, a place to stay with hot showers, a fridge stocked with groceries and beer, a good progress report from rehab to show to the judge, and probably $700 left over to put toward a car. fuck, if he gets that far I'll even lend him a few hundred to buy a cheap car and get him a job at a pizza delivery place I used to work at where I made about $25 an hour.. But if he doesn't go to rehab, *he is going to jail.* 

All of this great stuff could happen to him, his life could turn right around and we could be making music again like the old days, but he seems to think that if he gets a lawyer for the court date and/or somehow schmooze his rehab place into writing a good report for his judge, he can just keep doing drugs and sleeping in bushes or his mom's shed until he makes enough money bussing tables to afford a place and a car like I told him he could before I knew about the rehab thing. tomorrow I'm going to offer him food if he goes to rehab, but I don't know wtf else I can do.

**TLDR; An old friend of mine is now homeless, and has a court date next month. if he doesn't go to rehab between now and then, he'll go to jail. if he starts going to rehab now, he'll be able to sleep in a bed, shower, and get food *while* working to get money to move into his own place in a month, but he refuses to go to rehab, and won't accept the fact that he will go to jail if he doesn't.**

**it's so obvious; rehab, hot showers, food and a bed, and THEN drugs, or drugs, sleeping outside, hunger pains and then jail.. but how do I convince him to do it?**

100,"Dear /r/Advice,

We are two medical students, seeking advice about a moral dilemma we have found ourselves in. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Recently two of our classmates published an article in a very prestigious medical journal (together with a team of researchers from our university). Both of them are undergraduate medical students like ourselves, and thus have no degrees. However, in the recently published article, they both have listed medical degrees after their names. We have noticed this, but to our knowledge, no one else at the university is aware. 

 &amp;nbsp;

(Disclaimer: We don't know who was responsible for putting the degrees next to their names, and we also don't know whether it was an honest mistake or not.)

 &amp;nbsp;

We have found ourselves at a crossroads. Do we either:

i) Ignore this and go on with our lives, without telling anyone, avoiding risks to our personal reputations.

ii) Talk to our classmates directly and see if they are aware of the situation.

iii) Talk to the head of the medical school about the article.

iv) Email the editor of the journal involved and make them aware of the situation.

 &amp;nbsp;

We would greatly appreciate any advice about this sticky situation. We believe this constitutes pretty serious academic dishonesty, but are worried about the consequences for ourselves as whistleblowers.

109,"So, here is background about me that I believe to be relevant to my current predicament:

I (21, F) grew up in a small town in the bible belt and attended church on a weekly basis up until I started college. I only had a handful of ""crushes"" on boys in elementary school, but now that I look back on them, I can see that I only made them up to assimilate with my peers, as I never wanted to pursue anything the way they did and only would express feelings towards them as a performance as opposed to feeling any kind of emotion towards them. My mom first asked me if I was gay when I was in the sixth grade. I told her no, as I had not experienced any kind of feelings towards women at that time, either, and sexuality is a pretty foreign concept when you're that age, anyway. A boy asked me out when I was in the fifth grade and I turned him down because I knew dating at that age was stupid.

In junior high, I had no romantic/sexual feelings towards any of my classmates, so I did not date, and openly identified as a homophobic Republican due to the way I was raised. Despite this, however, I was questioning my sexuality at this time and educated myself on LGBT culture in secret. The only consensus I could come to was that I definitely was not straight and had a slight interest in men and a stronger interest in women (never any that I'd met in real life, but people from the internet.) I did not tell anyone this because I figured it was just a phase that I would quickly get over.

In high school, I did not have any romantic/sexual feelings towards any of my classmates so I did not date at this time, either. I did a complete 180 on my political views during this time and strongly identified as Pro-LGBT Liberal by my Junior year of high school. Due to my lack of interest in dating, I came to the conclusion that I was asexual by Senior year. Additionally during my Senior year of high school, my best friend who I've known since preschool (currently 20, F) came out to me as a lesbian, and our shared interest in LGBTQA+ culture brought us closer. Despite openly identifying as asexual, I still had an annoying voice in the back of my head telling me that I probably feel some sort of romantic/sexual attraction, but I had difficulty identifying why since I did not want to date anyone I knew, specifically.

Things began to change during college. I went to a Wesleyan (Christian) college for one year for financial and proximity reasons and every anti-LGBT word from professors and/or classmates felt like a personal attack. One of my male (similar age to me) coworkers when I worked a fast food job ended up falling in love with me and telling me that he loved me through text and the entire ordeal made me extremely uncomfortable. Friends and acquaintances were starting to pick up on the fact that I wasn't straight due to my word choice and demeanor regarding certain subjects so would openly ask me if I was gay, which also made me very uncomfortable.

After that one year of college, I moved to Florida, where I currently reside. During this time, I got more conventionally attractive and received more advances from men; all of these interactions ended in me finding them clingy and them scaring me off (I would usually have to end up blocking them on social media). There were some women that I would openly admire (personalitywise and physically) but it was never anything strong enough to where I would wish to approach them or even later remember them. There were men I found attractive as well but again, none I wished to confront or later remember.

I now work in an office environment that is very LGBT friendly and one of my coworkers (21, M) who I have a lot of respect for has been mentoring me not only on work related matters, but personal matters as well. He quickly picked up on the fact that I don't identify as straight and has already started using they pronouns when referring to people I could potentially date because he can see it makes me more comfortable. Upon learning that I've never dated as a 21 year old, he told me that I need to live my life and give dating a try now, as it will drive me nuts if I wait too much longer. I've been brushing off similar comments from other people in my life for years, but honestly? I think he's right. I've been curious about it for about a decade, and if I was truly asexual, surely I wouldn't think about my sexuality so much. And honestly? I am kind of lonely. The friends I grew up with live back in Indiana and I have only a few friends here in Florida. The idea of having a partner in crime does have some appeal to it.

The problem is, I just...can't. I always just kind of hoped that someone who's a good fit for me would fall into my lap if it was meant to happen but I'm too oblivious for anything like that to be able to work even if that were to happen. I have so many questions and reservations regarding dating. Would anyone want to date a 21 year old who hasn't even had her first kiss yet? Would anyone be patient enough to put up with my lack of romantic/sexual experience? The idea of FWB and one night stands does not appeal to me at all; how do I go about looking for people with long-term intentions? What if I try dating a girl/guy and end up accidentally hurting their feelings by later realizing that I'm not actually attracted to them? Will everyone who finds interest in me end up getting clingy and scaring me away like my previous experiences?

I feel like I socially and sexually retarded myself by not getting any dating experience in high school and I wouldn't even know where to begin should I wish to give dating a try. I don't understand what's holding me back. For a while, I had the excuse of societal judgment, but now that I live in here in FL, pretty much all of the people whose opinions I care about wouldn't mind.
Any abstractions of my explanation that might help me better understand myself or any pieces of advice that might help me confront my feelings? Oh, and if anyone wants more information to better help me out, feel free to ask; this is a throwaway for a reason.

TL;DR: I'm a twenty-one year old female virgin who has never kissed anyone and hasn't ever been on a date who is curious about both dating and sexuality but has no idea what she is actually feeling regarding either matter and does not know how to address it to figure it out.

P.S. Damn, it was really hard for me to write this all out; I've been keeping all of this bottled up for about a decade and I'm a pretty emotionally detached person so this was definitely a strange experience for me.",23Apr2017,2

113,"As an engineer the last time I coded was my last semester of college in 2007. Ever since then I never used it. However seeing all these beautiful app designs and websites, I feel I never capitalised on the tech bandwagon having worked as an engineer past 7 years. 

It seems that computer science would have been my calling instead of Electrical Engineer, because quite honestly, the sector is dead. 

I feel I wasted too much time behind video games and watching tv shows and movies. That time could have been better spent learning a skill like app or website design.

I'm keen to learn many things but I think instead of learning several things at once, it may be best to focus on one and move forward. 

Is it easy to pickup Xamarin and go through codeacademy, udemy, coursera or youtube to get up and running in C#? How much time should I dedicate to it? 

If it's easier to learn something else, should I start with Python or R (data science)?

My plan is to dedicate the time I would have wasted playing video games, playing guitar and watching television can be better spent learning to code. This would be as a hobby and hopefully someday can help with personal projects or a business I'd like to start. 

Things I'm interested


* Learning data science and data visualisation with R (R Studio)


* Learning AI with Python. Is it overkill to learn Lisp and Prolog?


* Learning app design with Xamarin (C# and Visual Studio)


* Building websites with CSS and PHP? 


* What's all the fuss with Ruby, is it really needed?

Now the idea at first did sound hot cause we are very comfortable and trustworthy with each other. One night we found someone for me to meet with and started making arrangements, then at the last minute my SO changed their mind and said they just got excited and didn't want me to do it. Fast forward a few weeks they've brought it up again! He's telling me how he wants it 100%. I told him I'm worried I'll go do it and he will regret it and it will ruin us but he has assured me it won't happen. 

Also the fact that he has brought me sleeping with another guy up more and more over the past couple of months is making question what the real reason behind it is. I've asked him if something has happened to make him want me to do this so badly and he just assses me it's cause he thinks it's hot, nothing else.

So Im sorry;; But there's been a lot that went on in my life for the past few years, financial problems in my family, dropping out of school because of said problems, and because of that it's been affecting my life. I've also been dealing with lonliness from lack of friends around me (I have friends but theyre online and in different timezones) and a romantic lonliness that I've felt during the recent years of a relationship and also after the breakup. There's a sort of anxiety I get when it comes to my schoolwork because I'm 20 and I havent been able to afford school for the past three years till now. I just need the remaining credits to graduate highschool but it feels like I have a time limit and if I mess up my future is over. There's low self esteem issues based on my appearance, a low sense of self worth and self hatred for myself based on mistakes and being called ""useless"" enough it still makes me upset to this day and that I'm not worth having a future or I'm not worth self care. I'm chubby and I don't feel like doing anything to take care of my physical because I'm awful. I don't want to vent to my friends because they're so busy and they've dealt with enough and also my low self worth makes me feel like they shouldn't bother with me. I can't vent to my parents because as loving as they are they can't understand, or just don't know how to deal with it. It's all pent up and I've had no idea what to do. Sometimes I just want everything to go away but then I have no other choice but to live with it. It's fine when I'm busy but sometimes at night these feelings affect me and even trying to preoccupy myself doesn't do much. I don't think indulging in escapism is helping anymore too. Especially when it's quiet.

128,"Hi all,

More of a lurker than a poster but here goes.

I'm unsure of how to go about wording this so please in advance excuse the potentially long post. This is a painful subject for me but I have no one else to turn to. 

My youngest sister (23) and myself (24) have always been good friends. We have very little in common but its never proven to be a problem. Over the course of the past 2 years our relationship has been stretched to breaking point. 

Things have steadily been going downhill in this time frame. My sister split up with her partner of 5~ years and this is where I noticed a worrying change in herself. I first believed her tendency to argue with me about nothing much at all was related to frustrations of her relationship ending however the decision was entirely her own and it was not a bitter end. 

Since then... She has had more ""boyfriends"" than I have had hot dinners... Then came the friends with benefits. We are talking a minimum of two DIFFERENT men a week who would turn up unannounced to our home and then creep out in the early hours. This went on for months and months and no matter how many times our mother spoke out against it did she continue. Some of these people are known drug addicts, dealers and also mentally and physically abusive. We have had the police here to deal with one of them who took it upon themselves to damage our property and yell abusive things through the windows after being turfed out after their booty calls ended. 

Next followed the drug abuse. My sister is slim, yet she easily dropped weight to the point where she was unhealthy. A bag of bones draped in skin is the only way I can describe it. Over the course of a few month's she operated on little sleep (sometimes none at all) and no food or drink. Yet always found the energy to party until the late hours. We suspected she might have been taking something and sure enough we started finding worrying things about the house. Empty baggies and straws (cut in half to shorten them?) to be precise. She always claimed they belonged to whoever had most recently stayed over, never denied that cocaine had been in our mothers home. Her former friends have only further backed our suspicions with more than a handful of them telling me that she regularly took coke on nights out.

Following that? Money troubles on a level I dont understand. She kept it secret for many many months and whilst we knew she had taken out a small loan (Â£200) she stopped opening mail, started ignoring calls that she didnt recognise the number to. Then came the various people who would knock on our door and present me with contact information cards. It took a long while for her to tell the truth, it was always that they came in error because her direct debits was returned or something similar. There is a very high chance there is more, but I can confirm that she owes at least Â£10k to credit catalogues, payday loans, bank overdrafts... You catch my drift. My mother finally after much hair pulling convinced her to enter a debt management plan but even that is not being taken seriously.

Its awful, there must be a reason why she got this way. I have only tried to help. I am not confrontational so pushing any of these subjects with her was always done in her best interests yet every time I was met with lies and arguments. Same for my mother. Each and every time we raised it with her nothing was resolved and as if coincidental timing was a super power of hers there was ALWAYS something she would say or do that would remove all attention from the problems at hand. She invented mental health issues, claimed she was diagnosed as bipolar and this was why she was how she was. However... We live in the UK and our mental health care is in shambles. This was a diagnosis she received from a single ten minute doctors appointment, we have seen no medicine nor paperwork/leaflets to support this claim, no further appointments have been attended, not even months on. 
She lies frequently about anything and everything, whether it's where she is or what she got up to, What she had for dinner, you name it. It can be a harmless steady stream of white lies or something that is said at anothers expense often behind their back. The final straw for me was when I discovered I was the laughing stock between her and friends, I snapped and brought it up with her immediately, albeit in an explosive way. She told me I had an attitude problem and that it was okay because they were jokes, yet they were so far from okay and said in a matter of fact way and were of a sexual nature. 

I hate this stupid girl as much as I love her. A lot. What can I do or say at this point? I have made up my mind to have nothing further to do with her at this point as its less hassle for me and I no longer have to sit by and watch her destroy her life but outside of finding a magic wand, what have the wisest of Reddit got for me to try?

See, I'm not your average angsty teen. 
I know that school is important, and your future depends on it.
However, I've had very poor grades all of this year, mostly because I failed to keep up with the work.
I was taking World History Honors, Art, Spanish 1, English 2 Honors, Guitar, Chemistry Honors, and Algebra 2 Honors.
I switched schools in the middle of the year, and at the end of the 3rd quarter, I dropped chem honors, and started taking anatomy online, and I switched out of Algebra 2 Honors into a normal Algebra 2 class.
I've definitely been doing better, but I still have trouble keeping up with some of the work in school. I tend to zone out in class and focus on personal endeavours, like writing and music.
I don't do any drugs other than what I have prescribed for my ADD, and anxiety, and I don't go out and party or drink.
I've also missed a ton of school due to chronic illness, and have a lot of unexcused absences, more than what's allowed. I may be able to get my doctor to sign notes for my missed days, but I'm not sure.
Overall, I'm just worried about my future in general.
I don't want to go into any of the usual fields that are known for making money, except for maybe the medical field, and even then, I would only go into it because I get to help people and make a lot of money.
But I know that art and music aren't promising careers, and that I have a very small chance of being able to make a living off of it.

I've never really been very fond of my dad and our relationship has mostly been on hold for my part, because of other issues relating to him failing at providing proper care during my childhood - emotionally speaking, mostly, I've never experienced any serious or harming neglect in that manner. 

But about 1Â½ year ago I decided to give it one last shot at building something near a proper father-daughter relationship, after finding myself mature enough to handle possible disappointments.

136,"Here's a bit of backstory.

I'm 17.

While I was growing up, my dad suffered from Motor Neurone Disease, and my mum was looking after him full time.

He died when I was 7.

Before he died, I grew up with very little attention, and this caused me to bottle up all of my emotions around my family.
This developed after my father died, and I continued to bottle up my emotions, giving me a severe phobia of showing emotions, and talking beyond basic phrases around my family.

This problem has led to pretty severe depression, as every time I think about it for more than 3 seconds I spiral into a depressive episode for the rest of the day.

I think normally, I'm not autistic, and I am currently seeking professional help, which I don't think will change a thing.

I can talk to friends and strangers just fine (although I have difficulty expressing myself such as laughing and smiling, but I can still talk.)

I want to be able to live normally. Please help me, I want to know what I can do to make a *FULL* recovery, and be able to express myself and talk around my family. 

I have spent a good 5 or so years of my life full time working on solving this problem, (since I found out it wasn't a normal thing) and very little has changed, I need help.


Before anyone suggests, no I cannot text my family or 'write a letter' to them, that won't change a thing, since doing this still involves expressing emotions through words, which I have a severe aversion to doing.

Even if I could do that, wouldn't I still want to actually talk to my family? Like any other person ever.",23Apr2017,5
138,"Hi, Im 23 yo male with absolutely no romantic experience. I have been living alone all the time and it was always making me feel depressed and it destroyed any confidence that I ever had.

Recently I graduated from college, found a job and I want to finally find my SO and not look like some kissless nerd loser.

I tried tinder, but I was being mostly ghosted and I understood that I will not find anyone willing to even meet with me there. So I made a profile on dating website and there I found a bunch of girls that I find interesting. I texted one of them, we talked a bit, then we added each other on facebook and I proposed to go on a date.

We went to a mall and talked for 2 hours and I think we both had a good time. 2 days after that I texted her again, talked about something irrelevant and I proposed to go on a second date to a pub. She agreed, and it was basically same thing - we talked and at the end I escorted her to the bus. Recently I asked her to meet up again, she said she will be going to a theather and she proposed me to go w/ her. Ofc I said yes and after the art I proposed her to go somewhere like club or pub. She was okay with it. Sadly I dont know any clubs or pubs, so we walked around the town and couldn't find any place in which there were free seats. In the end we went to mcdonald and talked there for like an hour. (What sucks is that most of the places where we tried to go were her choices, basically she was in charge and i feel it made me look like some beta loser). After that I escorted her again, but I wanted to make some move, so as we were huggin for goodbye i awkwardly kissed her in cheek (she wasnt expecting this so she was already moving her head away and Im not even sure if my lips even touched her [the bus was about to ride and she need to go in]).

Now Im getting to the point: what is bugging me is that I want her to be my gf, but so far all we do is friendly talk. All these ""dates"" feel like they are not pushing me forward the way to do some romantic stuff with her and Im pretty sure its either annoying for her or she just labeled me as friend and we are going nowhere. Especially when I read that some folks just fuck on first date (like wth, Im doing something terribly wrong :l)

Should I just text her that I want to have a relationship with her or ask her on a next date and say it in person or invite her to my place and try to do some moves or what. How this looks with ur relationships, im talking about the begginings of it? How to get to holding hands, kissing, sex?

TLDR: Found nice girl, but no balls to do anything romantic with her (I dont even know how to do it...) and I'm afraid I will be only friend to her (so im wasting mine and her time).

PS. Maybe she doesn't even know these dates are suposed to be dates? Im not writing something like: ""lets go on a date"", rather: ""are u free on monday? We could go somewhere, blah blah"". But on the other hand we met on dating website, so my intentions should be clear to her...",23Apr2017,1

147,"A little over a week ago my grandfather was discharged from the hospital to go home to one of my aunts under hospice care, given the note that he may have 2 weeks left. While at the hospital, my family told the doctors we wanted him on antibiotics (pneumonia) and IV to keep him going for as long as possible, however when he arrived home, we found out the aunt requested no IV, no antibiotics, no feeding tube (as his esophagus was swollen closed), and only to be given oral food and water. 

From the first night he returned him until 2 nights later, they didn't let him sleep, fearing that when he sleeps, he'll die. But they also weren't feeding him and were giving him very little water via a sponge that he'd have to suck on. When anyone asked if there's anything else that could be given ( chicken broth, any kind of broth, protein drink), they would be yelled at, being told that it's just not possible ( with no valid reason). 

He's finally getting sleep (it's been 4 days since) but his condition really is improving towards how he was prior to going to the hospital even without getting any food to eat and very little water to survive on. 

A family feud broke out a few nights ago when the question was raised about why an IV and antibiotics were not continued when he was discharged, leading to the point of other family members getting pissed, nearly slapping the questioner twice, and asking ""why do you want to prolong his life.""  
During the family feud as well, another member had said that whoever calls for an IV to be given, then they will be paying for it. 

There have also been moments where I've only stood in his room and witnessed the care taker yelling and screaming at him before he pushed away the sponge. And when he still doesn't take the sponge to drink (at that time),  she'll slap his arm or his side or grab him and shake him a bit. 
When anyone asked if there's anything else that could be given ( chicken broth, any kind of broth, protein drink), they would be yelled at, being told that it's just not possible ( with no valid reason) and ""Because I say so!"". 
My grandfather used to have quite the round beer belly but now, it's flat and he's quite just skin and bones. 

Supposedly, someone [nurse] said that if he survives the weekend, he'll get signed off the hospice program and return to the hospital for treatment, however I am worried that the caretaker will not follow through. The reason being she has a very big ego and does not take well to .. ""humiliation"". In the sense, if he survives and returns to the hospital, then she loses face and she was wrong  ( which she hates being wrong). 

I don't know if there's anything I can do at all, I can't think of anything to do that can ensure that he'll return to the hospital and get proper treatment. Is there anything that can be done? What do you guys think? Or am I just over thinking?

There's so much more I can add but I don't quite know how to add it without detracting from the current situation ( past incidents, care taker's personality)

152,"So I live in a beautiful beach house, and there are 3 rooms. I live here with 2 friends, and next year I was planning on living her with 3 friends. There are 3 bedrooms; the masters, and two other. Of the two others, I live inthe larger one with 2 windows. The smaller one is still cool but has only one window. Now for this year coming up out of the 3 friends; two will be living in the masters and one in the room I am not living in. I live in the room with 2 windows, and my 3rd friend, Jack's, items wouldn't fit inside the room with one window.
Jack has lived in other places over the years and has aquired a lot of furniture; this house is already furnished.

 I am not entirely opposed to the idea of living in the smaller room; but I cringe at the thought of being the original owner of the house and then getting the shittiest room in the house. Jack has a bed and a bureou that wouldn't fit in the smaller room at all. Now Jack is a cool guy and a good friend and it'd be a blast living with him. The biggest thing is if I move to the smaller room, I'd have to get rid of my bed and downgrade to a twin XL.

What should I do? Should I give Jack my room and accept the smaller room? Or should I just look for another roommate to take the smaller room (The rooms are fantastic and the rent is cheap).

166,"I have not lived with other people in years, mostly because every person I have lived with ended up screwing the situation or owing me money. Living with my girlfriend has been difficult mostly because of limited space, but we manage. Depression doesn't help when we want to left alone but there are only two rooms to use.

A friend offered us an apartment with him and his girlfriend as well as another friend. He works for a rental company and he made an offer on the unit when they got it. It's much larger than our apartment, easily 5x or more the size. We currently live in a basement apartment, one large room for living area and kitchen, a small bathroom, and bedroom. The unit we are considering is four floors with the basement.

Basement would be ours, so that we can avoid people if need be, though they want the first room of the basement to be a common area, while it would contain most of our collectibles and such.

The second floor is living room and kitchen.

The third floor is three bedrooms and an office. My girlfriend wants the office.

The fourth floor is two bedrooms for the main couple. Each couple would, in theory, get two or two and a small third room.

The pros:

My girlfriend would get an office, I would get a room to start a small business. My main issue with living with her has been that her office space consumes much of our apartment and she is messy.

The rent would be similar, but cheaper, between 10-30% less than our current rent, and around 3-8% less of my income every month.

The apartment would put my girlfriend much closer to her work, either one metro stop or a 15 minute walk. She current spends 2-3 hours a day getting to work. It is about 2.5m away but our metro is very unreliable and she has to give time for that. It would be a similar distance to my office as the apartment we are in now.

It is in a neighborhood we like, where we tend to travel to to be social or spend money. Our current neighborhood is quiet and sort of dull, but safe.

Parking. We currently have to struggle to get street parking and have collectively got probably 25 or more tickets since we moved in more than two years ago. This unit has parking for all tenants.

Space. Our main issue with the actual apartment we are in, personal things and exterior things ignored, is space. We both build things and need space to construct and store our items, as well as display collectibles. We have limited space, which creates conflict and has kept me away from starting a business.

Cons:

Other people. These people are our friends, and hopefully we could distance ourselves if we needed space being in the lower unit, but it has been years since I lived with others. We are both reclusive maybe 75% of the time.

Price. While it will definitely not be more expensive, they want to judge the distribution of the rent cost after a few months to see who uses what space, which means if we get the space we want, we may not save as much.

Maturity. I feel living with other people at my age is immature. I also understand that this city is both expensive, one of the highest COL in the country, and rental space is always small, so if we want more space to work, we may need to feel immature.

Possibility of moving after. Our current rent is very cheap, which means the unit we are considering is ridiculously cheap because we aren't paying a rental company; the person we are friends with gets the direct cost. If we disliked it and wanted to moved elsewhere, we wouldn't find something as cheap or close to our work for this price. Our neighbors have lived in our unit for 10 or more years because the rent doesn't increase as often as the majority of the city.",23Apr2017,1

171,"For perspective, I live in a neighborhood of single family homes. This is not some college complex or something where you'd expect noise, although it isn't exactly a high-class area. It's full of cheaper, smaller homes and it's somewhat ghetto. There are lots of kids in this neighborhood. Many of these homes are cookie cutter, so this guy actually has the exact same home I do and knows full-well that the master bedroom window faces the street. ps, sorry if this is way long. I'm pissed.

I've tried to ignore the noise (he's blasting things like megadeath, and occasionally his drunk friends sing along to country music in a drunken chorus of alcohol fueled stupor). A few weeks ago my husband had the flu. It was 11:30 at night and not only was my husband sick, but we both work long hours and just wanted to sleep. After a year of living in this neighborhood and dealing with this, I decided to finally go out and talk to the neighbor. I walked across the street in my pajamas and called over the music until someone finally heard me. I then said ax politely as I could: ""listen, I think 11:30 at night is a bit excessive for you to be doing this, the music needs to be turned off and you all need to quiet down."" His response was: ""Uhhh, I mean.... uhhhh, the limit is midnight but yeah I can turn it down a little"". I responded ""no, the limit is NOT midnight, I actually looked it up and city ordinance specifies 10:00 for quiet hours and actually, at NO time should you be playing music so loudly as to be heard clearly at a distance."" Que argument like something off of Maurrey during which I mentioned that not only do I have to put up with the music at night, but he constantly revs his motorcycle and drives up and down the street at all hours (early morning when he's not too hung over, late at night during his parties, etc). While I was at it I mentioned that I don't appreciate his pit-bull being off-leash running freely all day. I have nothing against the breed, but this one IS threatening and pit-bulls when they ARE mean can kill you. This one likes to stare me down whenever I go outside. He didn't understand a word I said. Guy is not only stupid, but drunk all the time. It was like talking to a trained ape. My husband and I are about to have a masters and a Ph.D respectively, but for now are poor grad students who live in a low-class neighborhood, and I literally feel like I don't know how to communicate with a guy like this. It was like I wasn't speaking his language.... he didn't get it. He's like a poorly trained ape.

For more perspective on this guy, he has giant beer banners in his garage, a large beer-gut, a random assortment of what I can assume are his children, step-children and god knows who else living at his house, and shortly after moving in about a year ago he had an argument with his (girlfriend?) in the street that culminated in her trying to drive drunk and attempting to run him over. So this guy is just not exactly citizen of the year. 

Anyways.. the night I talked to him turned into a yelling match that obviously wasn't helpful, but I was just so frustrated. Finally, long after I went inside again that night I noticed the police showed up. I assumed someone else had reported the noise complaint (after trying to talk to him calling them was my next step). However, apparently they only called because they heard ""yelling"" not because of the megadeath, the drunk idiots, or the loud graphic verbal descriptions by this guy of sexual acts he'd performed on his girlfriend the night before (proclaimed loudly to his drunk friends right in the middle of the street below my bedroom window). Apparently, the 10 minutes of yelling is what made other neighbors call. I have no idea why they tolerate his shit and why I'm the only once seemingly bothered by it, but apparently I am.

So the night after that, he decides the blast the music even louder out of spite. Out of options, that time I called the police. They talked to me first when they arrived, assured me that what he was doing was illegal, and said they would talk to him. They also said that if he did it again he could be cited. While they were talking to him, he told the police that ""all his neighbors loved him"" and that ""we had moved in like a week ago and "" and ""he didn't know what our problem was"" (we moved in a year ago). 

Last night he was at it again until about 1:30 am. I wanted to call the police again, but I just didn't have the energy to deal with them. I'm feeling frustrated and defeated. This guy is a lunatic with the mentality of a trained ape. He's inconsiderate, but too fucking stupid to see what he's doing wrong. I'm tired of the motorcycle reeving, the drunken singing, the music blasting and his general bullshit. I don't want to have to call the police very other night.

What prompted me to write this is the fact I've been absolutely dreading going to work. I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety and it is negatively effecting my life and education. I've lost a lot of sleep because I have a shift the following day, I've skipped school because I have work the next day, just stuff that doesn't make sense but I do it anyway. Am I just being a lazy bastard or what? I can't pinpoint anything specific about the job other than that I feel we are understaffed during shifts. It doesn't help that I'm usually the one working the hardest while most of everyone else I work with takes their time. We almost never have a manager or shift leader on site, so it's always awkward when someone asks, it's either insanely busy and stressful or painfully slow and dull, and there really isn't any advancement of any kind. I've been there for two years and all I've done is come to hate it. It doesn't help that depression has been hitting hard lately and I don't want to be around people.

I've been dreaming of and looking for a daddy dom kinda guy in my life for so long but I can't seem to find one. I found out over a year ago that I was into this sort of thing so I don't know why I've been having so much trouble.

A little about me: I'm five feet tall. I weigh 106 pounds. Pear shaped and athletic. I'm a yellowbone and even with my hair tied back with my work clothes on I get hit on all the time so I know my face is pretty even though I used to be insecure when I was younger. I'm a full time student and I have a part time job. People say I have a beautiful smile and eyes. I mean I agree but if I'm so attractive why haven't I been able to find a guy right for me? I don't have a problem attracting guys but they are never the ones I want to date or go home with.

What I'm looking for: a guy who is tall, at least somewhat attractive with a decent body (if I work out 4-6 times a week for what I have, he has to too) and someone who will take control. I want do date someone tbh but I will settle for a friends with benefits guy too. Like a guy who will finish what he starts. A guy who is very dominant but is not looking to physically hurt me. An alpha male kinda guy who knows how to give direction but who also cares at least a little bit about me.

To be honest, I think the reason why I have not found this type of person is because when I do see someone who fits into most or all of what I want listed above, I am so shy and cant even say anything. I work out a lot outside in my city... Like I run by the river and stuff like that and there are always so many guys there. And some I really like when I see them... But then the sexy, dominant ones will be you know, dominant and assertive and I have no clue how to respond and then they take that as me being not into them. But it is just who I am as a submissive girl to be shy and not know what to say or how to respond.

I guess my problem is this: I want a sexy, assertive, dominant guy. And I know I deserve him too, and whoever he is, he deserves me. But whenever I meet ""him"" (""him"" being any guy like that) I am too shy and I become frozen which makes ""him"" think I'm not into him.

Please, any dominant guys or alpha males out there... help. give me advice so that the next time I meet someone I like, I dont make him think he should give up on me.

As a shy person I just need to know what to do when a super NOT shy guy who I like hits on me

179,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post, there will be a TL;DR at the end. I just want to be thorough so as to get actually helpful advice.

 I am a girl currently 17 years old and living in Western Canada. I am a Canadian citizen not born in Canada, as are my parents. We are from an African country and my parents are quite religious (Catholic). I am the youngest of 3. My siblings have ""unique"" names too, but their names are not inherently embarrassing. My name sounds like a word that is very embarrassing. The meaning of my name is equivalent to something like ""A Gift from God."" It's quite lovely and I don't take issue with the meaning, but it's not an english name, so the meaning is lost. All anyone can hear is what it sounds like. 

I will not say my name (for obvious reasons), but I don't want to change it just because it's boring, common etc.. I don't just dislike my name. I hate it. I feel a complete dissociation from it and am uncomfortable saying it aloud. I believe it has contributed to a lot of my social anxiety, anxiety, and depression as it has held me back from doing new things, meeting new people, and being part of the group, because I don't like to introduce myself to people and I cringe when I hear it or have to say it/read it. I have hated it for probably about 6 years since the other kids and I realized what it sounded like. Before then, teachers would always pronounce it ""wrong."" At the time it confused me and it wasn't until later that I realized that my name wasn't hard to pronounce, it's just that people avoid saying it the way it's spelt because of what it sounds like, so they just assume it's meant to be pronounced differently. I donât blame these people for this and I often donât correct them when they pronounce it wrong. 

A similar one I can think of would be the name Cum. If youâre name was Cum, your life probably wouldnât start sucking until you were about 10 and realized what it means. Other people would pronounce it Coom even though itâs pronounced how itâs spelled and you probably wouldnât correct them because you kind of wish your name was Coom and not Cum. People would tell you that youâre name is so âbeautifulâ or âuniqueâ even though they have no idea what it actually means and you know for a fact that it doesnât sound beautiful and everyone immediately thinks of semen when they hear it. You wouldnât have anyone to talk to who could understand exactly what it feels like and you would probably feel very hopeless and depressed (at times suicidal) because of the way your own name affects your life until you got a bit older and realized that you could actually change it one day and leave it behind for good. This only begins to describe what my own life is like. On top of my name being off-putting, itâs also harsh and masculine sounding. MAYBE I could deal if my name was Isis, shitty connotations, but at least itâs a girlâs name. I donât even have that going for me. 

So, I have only brought up my problems with my  name to my parents a couple of times, and each time my parents reacted with complete confusion and sometimes even anger even though I gave them the most watered down reality. Itâs understandable. They know English, but they also know the language that my name comes from and so they hear the meaning of it when they say it. They would feel personally disrespected for me to just change it despite its pleasant meaning. They donât understand the way my name puts a barrier up. Like I said, I donât just dislike it. I have a pretty rocky relationship with them and they have never been big on communication and probably never will be. Itâs incredibly hard for me to the point that I eventually decided to just shut the fuck up and wait until I am a legal adult (less than a month from now) and can change my name without their consent. That being said, weâre kind of in an okay place and Iâm not a dickhole who wants to sever all ties with my parents over this. I also rely on their financial support and live with them I should add, not that independence would very drastically alter my situation.

So, here are my questions:
1. How do I tell my parents and when? Itâs not a matter of asking their permission as I wonât need it, but I want to tell them in such a way that doesnât get me kicked out or permanently sour our relationship. Honestly I could live out of my car for a while if I absolutely had to, but I really donât want it to come to this. I would just tell them after itâs done, but see question 2.
2. What if I canât afford it? Iâm not completely sure what the fee is as there are additional fees on top of the $120 that include fingerprinting and other services that I cannot find. I have some money saved up from an old job, but not a whole lot. If I canât afford the fees, then I will need to ask my parents for the money. How do I possibly go about this? Especially if they are completely against it?
3. What if I need supporting documents that I donât have access to? So, say I can afford it and I donât have to ask my parents or even tell them yet, what if I need my passport or birth certificate which my dad holds on to? My research says I need a piece of official ID (my driverâs licence), but there is a chance that my registry agent will require more documentation or my passport. I donât think there is a lie convincing enough for me to obtain them without letting them know about the name change. I doubt they would just give these things to me.
4. Any tips for how to smoothly transition my new name in with friends/family? There is a 6-8 week wait while the process is carried out, so Iâm planning to tell people (that I give a shit about) during this time and get them used to it by the time the change is official. After I get my certificate, Iâll announce to acquaintances/strangers over snapchat/social media and I will also go back to my old job or get a new one once my name isnât holding me back.

Yikes, this is long. Thanks to anyone who read it and I would really appreciate advice on any of my questions or general advice that could help me. 

TL;DR: I have a very embarrassing name that affects my mental health and relationship with others. I plan on changing it when I turn 18 next month, but I need to be tactful due to the nature of the name, my relationship with my parents, and possible barriers related to the name changing process. Please answer any of the four questions above or offer any general wisdom. Thank you in advance :).  ",23Apr2017,1
180,"Hi everybody. For background, I am a high school senior looking into my next step in furthering my education.

Ever since January, my mind was stuck on going to university A. It's a great school and somewhat in my budget. I applied with a major in Communications because I loved talking to people and as a minority, I did not see a presence in my community in the media and I wanted to change that. It sounds incredibly idealistic, but that was in my mind. Overall, I was set on this school.

A couple of days ago, my father suggested that I do speech pathology because he sees me becoming a speech pathologist in the future. After I told him there was no speech pathology program at university A, he suggested I look into going to university B-- a school I haven't applied to. The school has rolling admissions, but the process of getting my transcripts in a week seems hectic and the possibility of university B getting back to me at such a short notice is low.

When I told my sister about this, she suggested that I got to community college C to get my gen-eds out of the way before I make any decisions on my major. Believe it or not, this is my least favorite choice. This may sound shallow, but although it is technically the cheapest option, I find no room in it to grow and prosper like I can in either universities. Not to mention that the classes are extremely easier and I want to be challenged.

I'm stuck, on choosing a major and choosing a school. Here are my options (feel free to add any if you think of another option):

1) Go to Uni. A with the same major
2) Got to Uni. A with a different major
3) Apply to Uni. B and see where that takes me.
4) Go to college C

It's not that I mind changing my major (trust me, I've read enough on this website to know that a Comm major is not the greatest), but that just leaves me at square one. Call me superstitious but I've even considered contacting an astrologist about this. I don't know, I'm desperate, and scared, and stressed. I don't know what to do and it seems like my future is on the line. Anything helps.

Thank you.",23Apr2017,1

190,"Hey, guys I really would like some advice from you wonderful people. 

TL;DR - College has become a really impossible reality for me and doesn't seem worth it for the trouble. I think I should enlist in the Air Force (or maybe Navy not sure which ones better for what I want to do) and go into Cyber Security/IT. I want to become an officer and work in that field. I need some advice and guidance. I am more than happy to go even more in depth if need be!

So I am stuck in between a rock and a hard place in life right now. I am a high school senior (in 18 in June not sure if that helps) that wants to go into Cyber Security and the IT field. My initial plan for the longest time was to get a scholarship with the army (Due to some circumstances that were the only one I could apply for at the time) and go to college with that scholarship get a computer science degree and be in ROTC come out as an officer and go into cyber security with very little debt to pay off because of the scholarship. 

Well, that has changed due to some bad news I didn't get it because I didn't meet race demographic standards according to my JROTC instructor. Though I have been offered scholarships to the schools I applied for but none are enough to help me cover the full cost at all. If I were to go I would come out with 50,000-100,000 dollars in debt and I am not guaranteed an MOS or to become an officer right off the bat either so I would be on debt and not certain if I will even get to do what I want (Cyber Security) or be an officer so a lot is on the line if I go to college. My parents canât help either and will be moving out of my city too when I graduate high school so I canât stay with them I would have to live on campus making me more in debt too

I have been looking at enlistment into either the Air Force or the Navy. I have mainly been looking at the Air Force due to my interest in Cyber Security/IT and quality of life. I still feel like I donât know a lot about the navyâs Cyber Security/IT and quality of life, I know it's likely I will end up on a boat though. And please excuse my ignorance if I am wrong. I want to become an officer as quick as I can and pursue a computer science degree and be a part of Cyber Security in either branch. I would really just like some advice and what not as this is the biggest decision I have ever had to make and it's on such notice for me as I had everything I planned for before just become so difficult. Is enlistment a good idea for what I want to do? Is the high debt worth it?  Is the Airforce better for what I want to do? What do I do? Anything helps guys, if you have questions or want more details please let me know I am more than happy to talk about it.

Now let me say I have always wanted to serve in the United States military that has been a dream of mine since I was just a few years old, my father served in the army as a green beret and I have always felt that calling to serve. I actually wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a green beret till I found out that I have a talent with computers and a love for technology. My desire to serve will be fulfilled I want to be in the military no matter what. I have talked to recruiters in both but I still feel like I really didn't get a clear answer from either of them. My parents think I should enlist. ",23Apr2017,3

206,"First off, I'm so sorry this is probably the definition of a first world problem. The blur of finals and sleep deprivation, moving, and health insurance hunting for the first time is making critical thinking hard. I would really appreciate any and all advice! I'm thinking about this as a cost-benefit analysis: 

I'm relocating half way across the country, and currently apartment hunting. I met someone online who seems like a great potential roommate, and for the past 3 days or so we agreed to apartment hunt together. 

We have the same budget, and similar priorities. Since really starting to search, I noticed I could save a some $50-$150/month on rent by snagging an open room in group house. I'm not going to be making much money when I move, and the prospect having extra money in the case of an emergency is really appealing. 

If I snag a group house room, there will likely only be one opening. If I continue apartment hunting with the roommate I've been talking to, I'm going to hit the upper end of my budget. 

As much as I want to save money in a group house, the only thing holding me back is: I'm worried about sacrificing the stability of hunting with a roommate, and possibly not getting a good open room in a group house (I'm also a POC and worried that stereotypes about my ability to pay rent might make my search harder lol). 

I usually make decisions by sitting on it and thinking about it for a bit, but I don't want to wait too long so that if I do flake out then my roommate can find someone else asap without getting screwed over.

211,"I know the conventional tips like, ""did you wear this in the past xx months?"" or ""does this still fit you?"" etc. I need advice that goes a little beyond that.

All of my clothes fit (I've gotten rid of anything that doesn't). Some things I wear more often than others. Other things I used to love but I'm not sure if I'd wear them again or not, because I'm getting older (college student transitioning to ""the 20s,"" becoming more mature). So I'll give some examples... general advice is welcomed too!

- I have a few pairs of shorts that I used to think were really cute (and in a way still do), but they're very short and I don't know if I'd ever wear them again. I used to wear them to fraternity parties and tailgates, but I rarely if ever go to those now, and if I did I'd probably want to wear something a little classier/more modest-ish. On the other hand, they're super cute and I feel bad getting rid of them, because if it weren't for me feeling immodest wearing them (not ashamed of my body but I'd rather not wear super revealing clothes), I'd totally love to keep them.

- I have a bunch of school shirts that aren't flattering but aren't ugly (free shirts I got from football games, student organizations, etc.) Some of them are cute and/or super comfy and I wear them often. Others are alright, but I'd probably never wear them post-grad (I have about a year left, possibly two if I go for another degree here). There's a few that I feel a need to keep in case I need them for events (like for specific student orgs I'm intermittently involved with) but that are otherwise not great looking (one of them is this ugly neon color and whoever designed it needs to be kicked out of that program lol, no offense). On the other hand, would I ever want to keep a few of these to give to kids one day, or because they'll eventually be considered ""vintage"" and might be worth more money or cool in an old-school sort of way? I'm silly, I know, I know

- Some older sundresses from high school that I'm not sure if I like or not anymore. If I had a huge closet I wouldn't mind holding on to them, but like even if I did have a huge closet, are they worth keeping or is it time to let them go? They're cute in a way, but they're nothing special, I don't think... is it worth asking my boyfriend if he likes how I look in them? Lol lol lol

- A few concert shirts that I feel weird wearing in public because I only actually know like three songs from the bands they're from, lol... otherwise most of them are cute. If these were favorite bands of mine I'd probably wear them more often. Also these might get good money from people who do love the bands, but I probably wouldn't get rid of them for free. One of them was a gift from an old friend who I don't talk to anymore because she ghosted me after getting into a fight with another friend (silly story, I know) so like idk if it'd be weird to wear it anymore, or if it's bad karma to sell it for money when she gave it to me as a gift?

- Old long-sleeved shirts that might be good for layering, but I wouldn't wear them on my own because like, middle school/early high school vibes... think old graphic tees from American Eagle, Victoria's Secret PINK, etc. BUT on the other hand, are they practical to keep to wear underneath hoodies and stuff when it's cold out? (I live in an area where it only gets really cold for about 2-3 months a year tops)
There's also basically a lot of clothes that look okay (and some I used to love) but that I'm not obsessed with or anything. Like, if I could get decent cash for them (by ""decent"" I mean like, $5-10 for a nice top that originally cost $20, for example) I'd consider parting with them, but I'd feel bad just getting rid of them.

- And again, general advice would be great, too! Points to focus on: College student, will graduate in like 1-2 years, I have a small closet (like, small even for a college student) where I live now but once I graduate I'll move to a place with a bigger closet. I'm also gradually moving toward a more modest/classy style (but still casual for the most part) so there's a lot of things (tank tops, shorts, etc.) that are harder to work with without looking frumpy or anything, but on the other hand I otherwise still like a lot of those clothes (if that makes any sense at all)",23Apr2017,1
212,"Hey guys. So for some back story: I met both of these friends in high school around 10th grade. I'm currently a college sophomore about to end my 2nd year. I've been friends with them for all of that time, some times more sometimes less. They graduated a year ahead of me in high school. They never went to college and don't want to. 

Now some of this might sound harsh, it's just a lot of emotion built up over time. They are both overweight, one has a job that he hates, they both sit at home and plays video games all day when not at work, they do not have any ambitions, they're both exceptionally insecure, socially anxious, awkward, they both hate themselves and have said this outwardly, they both view themselves as massive disappointments, they're just pathetic. The problem isn't really any of that, the problem is that they take out this emotional angst in the form of negative comments, behavior, judgements, and actions. Some of that is directed at me. They both seem to enjoy saying exceptionally mean things, things that it sounds like they are saying to themselves as they don't really apply to me when they are directed towards me, but nonetheless still both me. They are both embarrassing to be around in public, sometimes, as it seems they lack any semblance of social skills or grace and still act like they're in middle school. 

I've been friends with them for a long time and while it was fine for a long time, they weren't always like this, over the years it seems that I have grown and matured both emotionally and mentally while they have not. I'm under no circumstances saying that I am perfect and that I do not have my own issues. I do. What I am saying is that while I have my issues I do not take them out on other people. 

I'm asking for advice on if I should stop being friends with these two people. I've honestly stopped enjoying the time I spend with them and I've grown to loathe and despise them for their immature and negative natures. I'm thinking that I should stop hanging out with them I just have the fear that I will be more lonely and sad without them. That really sounds like what people say about an abusive relationship wow. 

The reason I'm asking for the advice is partly to vent about it and get some outside information.",23Apr2017,6

I forgot to call a client back for the first time in 1 year because I was on vacation after I got the email and my manager was furious with me. I have 10 months of expenses put away and I want to quit really badly. Everyone is advising me to wait till I find another job, but I'm losing my mind every morning going there . Should I stay till I find something else or just quit. I was told I would be unattractive to other companies if I am unemployed and will make it much harder to find new work. ",23Apr2017,1

219,"I'm 17 M and so is my best friend. We met freshmen year and really clicked. As high school went on he started getting into drugs and abusing girls. I'm not like an anti drug person or anything but I've never really had this urge to do them but when he got into them so did I. I started buying weed LSD and other stuff and tbh they feel great but idk if their the best for me. I also don't like how he treats girls, he finds ones with emotional issues and uses them. Once again I don't think there's anything wrong with hooking up with someone without starting anything but he knows what he's doing.

I'm just asking should I do something? I don't want to cut things off because he's a funny and cool guy who's real. I just don't like some of these decisions.",23Apr2017,1
222,"Hey guys, 

So to start off, I'm 22 years old and I have less than a month until I graduate. I'm wrapping a load of things up and I'm getting myself prepared for the next chapter in my life. I have things planned out for me; I just applied for a summer job and hope to hear back from them, I've been studying for my permit that I've yet to obtain (long story) and hopefully I'd like to get into grad school in the fall. Afterwards, when i complete my master's, I'd like to take some time off of school to teach abroad and save up some money to pay off loans and then find a way to apply for a PhD. As you can see, I've been planning out almost everything (though I understand life happens and nothing is set in stone, trust me lol). 

**Though I've been more productive than ever and have been taking the time to meditate/practice yoga, I've come to this realization that as I get older, it's sort of unrealistic to be 'selfish' in my 20s.** Like, I'm taking care of all of these tasks for various people, and, it's like...you may have your parents and their health are declining, so you've got to take care of them. You've got your professors to keep satisfied, making sure you're passing that class. Or the friend who needs that shoulder to cry on when they've got all of these heavy issues. Of course you don't want to be thinking of yourself all the time; it's important to help others when you can. But right now, I'm learning that i have to take the time to figure myself out and help myself properly before doing so for others in the way I'd like to. 

I'd just recently had a conversation with one of my parents on how they'd been seriously considering moving close to my sibling's college, in an entirely different location, and **though I'm a family-oriented person...I don't want to be the point where I'm in my 20s and I'm still making almost *all* my decisions based on my family, if that makes sense.**

Of course, I have plenty of growing up to do, especially considering I'm 22, but **I've missed out on so much up until this point. I've never obtained my driver's license, I've never had a long-term relationship (or any for that matter lol). I've never landed a job and I see everyone out beginning to live 'independently', and not relying on their own parents for *every single thing*, if not necessary.**With all that happened during my undergrad years, **I feel like all is lost for me forever** and I may end up living the rest of my life just working at a job, not seeing any friends and repeating it all over again. Sometimes I feel like I live according to my family and what they want, according to the decisions that indirectly affect me. And it's not just them, but it's also been others in my life, both former and some current people in my life. 

**I want to be able to live an happy life, where I'm in a consistently good place and I'm being self-sufficient.** Where I have deep, loving relationships with others, both platonically and even romantically at some point. Where every once in a while, I can travel and explore the world. Where I can live each day doing something productive. Where I can get deep into my inner self and absolutely know how to love myself, who I am and what I stand for. Where I make enough to provide for myself and my family. 

But I feel like it's never really never about me. I've recently been getting out of a mental health rut and I'm learning to take better care of myself first. **I've been tending to others first, but I rarely ever get the time to fully focus on what I truly want;** what I'd like without always feeling guilty for working twice as hard as some others or sabotaging my own happiness for others. I've been far too passive for too long and let others disrespect/walk all over me and decide what I ought to do/how I ought to feel. Working so hard, partially out of guilt, and having this fear of losing yourself in the process. Seeing people in their early 20s grow lost and cynical, and I'm doing what I can not to end up down that path. 

What can I do to achieve that happiness, the fulfillment? What have you learned in your 20s that would apply here? 

I know this text probably makes no sense, but hopefully it's understandable enough. 

Thanks! ",23Apr2017,4
224,"I'm pretty lost right now. I'm a transfer student from San Diego that just finished up a business administration Associates for Transfer degree (from a community college). 

I narrowed it down 2 choices, San Jose State or San Diego State

SDSU Pros:

-Live close, no dorm

-Supposedly better business program?

-Graduate Debt free/close to debt free. I could use the left over money to hike the Pacific Crest Trail which starts in San Diego.

SJSU Pros:

-Silicon Valley Job Prospects

-Somewhere new, break out of my shell type of stuff

I'm not really into dorming, but I never dormed so what do I know.  

Which college would you choose? And aside from these points, ANY help/information is appreciated.

Other info: I also got into a bunch of other csu schools, SFSU, CSULA, SacSU, and East Bay SU in case you'd want to recommend something else.",23Apr2017,0

226,"Some context to begin with. My younger brother (let's name him Jay) calls himself a romantic. But he only dates girls who need fixing. Badly. He has zero standards. For fuck's sake, he doesn't hang out with his friend who picked up smoking and he's willing to date smokers. Jay's been with this girl (let's name Katie) for a year now.

About 2 months into dating, Katie's mom died suddenly. Her real dad is an alcoholic that she doesn't see and, from what she's said, doesn't want to see. Her step-dad decided to move back to his family, about 2500Km away, she wanted to stay in town. My brother twisted my parents' arms so she could move in with my parents and brother for about 4 months until she could ""find a better job and live on her own."" She eventually ""did"", if you count that my brother gives up a good majority of his every paycheck to pay her rent and get her gifts.

The only bill Jay has is an 80$ phone bill and he is constantly broke despite his full-time job. The other day she demanded he buy her some 300$ earrings. And that was the tipping point that she would even dare expect that treatment in front of my family. Nobody in my family liked her before that anyway and I didn't like her from the start just because, well, she was somebody Jay wanted to date.

She just has to go and I no longer care if I hurt him because I know he could only do better. But to make matters worse, Jay is... stupid. The harder we might try to break them apart, the harder he'll try to stay with her. So Reddit, got any pointers for someone trying to save his brother?",23Apr2017,0
233,"I will try to make it short. I am taking a Math course at a public State University in New York (Under the SUNY school system). I have maintained a GPA of 3.85 up until now. Then we get an adjunct professor and he has weird things he does during examinations. Anyways, he got upset at me and snatched my exam 25 minutes into the class. He is like those weird paranoid people who are sort of ""out of it"". He does not let people keep their exams so he does not have to write them. Very weird grading criteria to a point where he is just destroying your grade for no reason. But this is not what my problem was. My problem was that you should never take a student's exam from them, that is beyond just grading issues; it is unfairness to the core.

I got upset. I then sent an angry e-mail to our school's dean, and to the head of my curriculum department. Accusing my professor of being very unfair, and perhaps racist in his actions towards me. When I went to the head of the department, instead of saying anything about helping me get a fair exam, or get my exam back, he turned the entire situation around and told me that I ""Seemed abit stressed, and off. And that you should go the university counseling center"". I dropped the whole racism issue entirely and had long, civil conversations with both individuals regarding the unfairness towards me - there is no reason to take away a person's exam if they are not cheating or being disruptive (even if you do not like them).

Then I went to the Dean of students. I had few appointments with her. She also brought up how the head of the department suggested, that I should go see counseling services on campus regarding my mental state. 

Thing is, I have no mental issues. I am loved by all my professors. And I am friends with all my peers. I have no criminal record and I work two work-study jobs on campus. So these guys, instead of getting me fair treatment, and telling the prejudiced old Iranian professor to give me a fair examination, are turning the thing into me being ""insane"" so to speak.

Is it possible that they will make up lies about me and my mental state? then next thing you know, they will kick me out of the school? I was even thinking about suing the school, but apparently public state schools are immune to lawsuits unless it involves hardcore racism and evidence towards it. At this point I just want another exam with full time, the right that he took away from me.

Please advise me. I have worked really hard in my life, and up until this point, I did not have any issues. I did have a professor do something similar to me at this university two years ago, but I dropped the issue after complaining alittle. This time I am going through the dean of students. But instead of helping me or even looking at me like a human being, they are started to make up these lies about my character.

Edit: So the reason why he took my exam. He has a policy that there are two questions on the exam. You give him one question, then he gives you another. You do that question and you are done. This prevents students from cheating. I soon realized that both his questions differ in sizes, so the first question can be short and second question can be long - it is often best to do both questions really quickly, and then revise them. So I would do question 1, turn it in (quick), then do question 2 (quick) turn it in. Then I will get 1 back and revise it slowly, then I will get 2 back and revise it slowly. This got me 100s on previous exams. 

This time he said no, and snatched the exam from me. No prior notice before class, no prior notice before exam or during it. When he snatched the question from me, he even kept me from revising question #2 which I still had in my hand. I have done all the 100s of exams I have taken before this class the same way, never had any issues.",23Apr2017,1

238,"So I just overheard and ended an argument between my mother and father after her and my sister had one.  

Basically she was mad at my sister for not finishing preparing dinner even though she was never specifically told to. But after the argument my mom went on for around three minutes out loud to herself (I guess) about how ridiculous my sister's actions (or lack there-of) were until my sister snapped.  She then would not listen to anything my sister would say and after my sis stormed out she started berating my father for not defending her until he eventually started replying and they had their own mini argument. It ended but my mom kept making comments out loud until they started bickering again and I eventually yelled shut up"" and explained how the argument was well over and there was no need for further arguing and how continued remarks were sparking further argument.  She then stormed out and drove away, most likely to church. 

I felt so so bad about doing that because She is going through a lot of emotional stress right now, (her mom has dementia and her aunt has been struggling with cancer).  This has been such a recurring thing lately and nobody is ever right except for her, even when everybody tells her that she is taking it too far she never listens and constantly cuts people off and berates them.  So this leads to my question...

TL/DR

How do you get through to someone who refuses to admit that they're wrong no matter how many people tell them.  I just don't understand anymore and it only stresses everybody in the house out, (me, my dad, my sister, and obviously her too).  This happens quite often and it's getting really old.",23Apr2017,1
240,"My mom was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2005 and I had to find out in 2014 when she was in the hospital. When I questioned her about it at the time she shut me down and refused to answer any questions about it. At the time I relied on student health for any medical care. I had no primary care doctor from the time I was in school because I relied on clinics. And all that time I said nothing to the doctors because I didn't know. I'm also overweight and aside from the ""you should lose weight"" talk I had no motivation to lose weight.
Fast forward to now: I have medical insurance and can now afford to see an actual doctor and I have an appointment on Tuesday. At that appointment I will get my labs done. 
Today I asked my mom ""when were you diagnosed and why didn't you tell me?""
Her answer: ""2005 and I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed."" 
Me: ""I'm not mad at you but next time something comes up you need to tell me"" 
So we're talking about medical history and I mentioned I'm nervous about these labs and she keeps turning it on to herself. She even mocked me when I said something and said ""Well maybe you should keep things from me either."" 

In short; I'm pissed now. How do I:
A: keep my cool about my mom straight up lying to me? 
B: not be anxious as fuck about Tuesday?

241,"I needed to trim my ""man jungle"" today and my wife wanted to do it for me. We have three kids and when she lost the last of her pregnancy weight our sex skyrocketed.

She was a bit heavy when we got together ten years ago and now that she's lost all this weight, I can't stress enough how far out of my league she is!

* Chico is closer to home, and is accessible by driving. UPortland requires a flight.
