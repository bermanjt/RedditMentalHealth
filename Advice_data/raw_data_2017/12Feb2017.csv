0,"Hi reddit!
So i'm a 19yo guy who suffers from being so tall and skinny, i'm like 1.95m and 68kg. No matter how much i eat or exercise i never change a bit. My arms are so tall and skinny and my chest is really small. 
I'm a fairly charismatic and funny guy, i'm a smooth talker and i use my social abilities to avoid having people make fun of my shape. I take the piss out of myself and make fun of myself before anyone does and know how to handle things if someone tries to body-shame me.

 But there was this girl in high school whom i liked very much and she clearly liked me too, we started dating and i started falling in love for the first time in my life, the  after a very short while she told me that she couldn't do it anymore. I knew something weird was up and then i found out that her friends were making fun of her for dating such a skinny weird looking dude. I have been rejected by girls like 3 times before because of my looks and it sure hurts, but this one really broke me and i've never even tried getting close to a girl ever since. I don't really know what to do, no matter how hard i exercise or how much i eat my body stays the same and i can't handle being rejected again bcz of my looks. I could really use some advice.",12Feb2017,2

When I'm teased for my religion, I can't talk back. I just laugh along. When people tell me I'm wrong in some way, my mind grows blank and I can't defend myself so I just agree with them.

3,"So for the last few months ice been having irregular periods. I started exercising a few months ago, my period was normal every 4 weeks then it started coming every 5 weeks ( so I quit working out I'm thin anyway lol). I have a scalp condition that wakes me up during the night. Since November its every 6 weeks and even then I was due 2 days ago. Before this my cycle was perfect, once every month guaranteed, now its not and I'm terrified and crying as I'm writing this, I'm 18 I'm scared to go to the doctors. What do I do?",12Feb2017,2
4,"In particular, I am incredibly sensitive to being called loud, noisy, or anything similar. It's because I have mild to moderate hearing loss in my left ear which I've had three operations to try and correct, but it means that at times I can't hear how loud I'm talking (although I'm sure it's not THAT loud). When I was younger I would be told by my parents that I was too loud and to shut up, and because of this I have connotations in my brain that when someone tells me I'm being loud, I associate it with them calling me annoying, stupid or useless. I'm usually a very stoic person and I don't let things get to me easily at all, but this one issue, for someone to utter a few words about my volume can leave me feeling like total shit, to the point where I can't do anything but cry and feel worthless. It's worse that most of the time these comments come from friends and family, who are aware that I have hearing problems and that it's a sensitive issue for me. Even years later it still burns into my brain with the exact tone a friend told me ""You're shouting"", because it usually happens when I get excited or happy so it sort of makes me not want to get excited over anything.

I suppose I need advice on how to get over being sensitive over something so petty, and how to deal better with being confronted with sensitive issues?",12Feb2017,1

12,"I am a twenty year old male, and I'm having a really hard time not only caring about my life and commitments, but even just carrying on.

I am currently enrolled in school, and I don't really know what I want to do. I am going to school to get a degree to become more employable, and because the types of jobs I have now aren't things I want to be stuck doing my whole life. However, I don't know what I want to do WITH my degree.

Similarly, I have been talking up this girl for months, and I'm finally getting somewhere with her, but now that its happening I'm getting kind of depressed. This is because even though I really like her, I don't know if I want a relationship right now. It doesn't make any sense but I want ""to be with her,"" but I don't want another commitment or more things going on in my life. (ie. dates/drama/gifts/outings, etc.)

I feel like all my life is sort of sub-real. I also feel like after being a student for 14 years all I know is how to be a student, and an athlete, and a friend, but I've never been anything other than that. I was never taught how to be in a relationship (not a high school one) I was never taught anything about starting/carrying on a career. Or even picking a career.

14,"Hi!

So, I just got an internship at a company and I'm not sure what my responsibilities will be.  I asked my SO what I should do and he said not to email them because it'll look weird that they gave me a job and I don't even know what I'll be doing.  He said just to google the common job description and use that.

Also, I changed my availability at my current job, but I haven't made sure that it'll be ok with my internship, SO again said not to worry about it until I actually start working.  But my current job's schedule goes 3 weeks out and I don't really know what to do.

21,"Beautiful girl. Amazing girl. Loved her and she loved me. Unfortunately her mother seems to be a controlling psychopath. She doesnt dislike me, or hold any personal grudge seemingly. But when I played their game and met then at their house, to be sized up or whatever, my ex still wasnt allowed to see me. 

Theres no reason why. We were happy and having fun together. The mother emotionally blackmails her saying she wont pay for her education if she continues seeing me. And also says some pretty toxic things about me being insane. Maybe i am. But i never forced my ex to do anything she didnt want to.  One day the ex sneaks out to see me. Narcissistic mother gets FURIOUS when she found out.  This was the turning point. She takes her bank card, phone and laptop and forces her to break up with me.


The worst part is my ex girlfriend doesnt think shes being abused.
But its a textbook case of a controlling narcissistic mother who wont stop coddling her children.

I dont know what to do. Its not my place to interfere and this is her fight, but this is a legitimate form of domestic abuse. She is 19 and is emotionally and physically trapped in a toxic environment.

26,"I started a new job in a new city. After a couple of weeks a girl also started working there. We instantly clicked. 


We would go out to lunch 1 on 1 several times a week. She made it a game to try and get me to try different types of foods that I had never had before. This also included her buying me candy/food and leaving them on my desk for me to try. She even had a candy drawer that was stocked with candies I liked (I don't think she ever ate from it). 


Because of these kind gestures I helped her a lot at work and part of me thought I may be taken for a ride, but I really was split. Part of the reason I didn't think that is because we would talk all the time. 


At work we would use the instant message system and talk back and forth all day not about work. We would talk about anything and everything. I would mention my favorite movies/tv shows/songs and she would go and watch/listen to them to talk about it. She would also send flirty things like ""Sorry I'm not pretty enough for you"" or ""Have to head to the gym to get in shape like (insert some actress I said was hot)"".


And then it went to out of work talking. She added me on facebook and snapchat. We talked every single day through snapchat after work for long periods of time. It never failed by 5:05 pm I was getting a message from her (always her first). Except on the weekends, it was radio silence for the most part. Then she asked for my number and she would call and talk to me for extended periods of time at night.


We would go to work happy hours together and even sometimes break away and go to our own bars or whatever. 



The problem is during these several months of all this going on, she had a BF of 5 years. I remember the first time we went to lunch she had to text him to let him know that she was with a coworker incase someone told him she was out with a guy. I brought it up once later and she told me she doesn't feel the need to do that anymore. But she also said ""You know when I first started here, I was seeing if someone could treat me better than (Her BF).""


And then it all came to an end. A coworker opened a bar far away and she begged me to go with her and would even drive. We went had a great time and then left our coworkers for a bit to get some food. I saw her phone that night and her BF was asking when she'd be home and she said midnight. Well we didn't even get to my car at work until 1am. 


The next few days she went quiet. Never opened the instant messaging app, no snaps, texts, calls. We went to a lunch and apparently some guy who knows her BF's dad saw us and told the BF's dad who I assume told the BF. We never went to lunch ever again. 


She went distant and I called her about it once and she said ""I was putting her in a difficult spot between choosing a friend and her BF and I should put myself in her shoes"" and basically how wrong I was for doing that.


We never talked again through instant messaging, phone, text, snap. 


The next couple of months she was cold. She would still ask me for help, but would give me the cold shoulder if I tried to talk to her about anything non work. In fact she would even get nasty about it. Accusing me of being nosey if I asked what her plans were this weekend in a snippy tone for example.


Over time she came back to normal at work. We would laugh and joke in person, but never talked outside of work. In fact even at work events outside of work she keeps her distance from me. I don't think she has even said a word to me at them in months. 


Some days though she is back to her nasty self. I'll be talking to her and she will turn her chair back to me and pretend to work. I called her out on this once and why don't we talk anymore and she snapped. 

Basically said we never talked daily and if we did it was just because she was new here. How her relationship with her BF is perfect and I was never a threat to it (when I asked is he the reason you stopped talking to me?). That she never said she was looking for someone to treat her better. How dare I make stuff up,  I should shut up etc... 


I brought it one more time a couple months back and got told she doesn't talk to me because she keeps work and her friends separate and doesn't talk to work people outside of work, despite that weekend ironically going to a near by city with a female coworker. 



So since then I learned to kinda accept it. Someday's its great and she is really cool to me (most of the time), others not so much, but still never talks to me once we leave those 4 walls.


And this bugs me to no end. We use to tell eachother everything (super personal stuff) and still sorta do at work (she cut way back on how personal). Just today she ran over to tell me exciting news. I just get sad after talking to her because its fun, buts its like work only fun and never will be outside of a cubical again. I just wonder why all the time. Like we always said we never bonded so quickly with a person before and it felt like we had been best friends for years.


Even today if I were to text her I'd get the shortest answer humanly possible and pretty much the hint that she doesn't want to talk.

30,"I'm not 100% sure that I'm posting in the right area, so please direct me if I'm wrong. But my (f/22) mom will not let me grow up. I haven't been taught how to drive (I have other family members and whatnot that I could have possibly asked, but they've all got pretty busy schedules and my best friend at the time didn't drive either) and she will not teach me. I've brought it up multiple times to her, and she just blows me off saying that she ""will teach me"" and that ""I'd better get rid of my attitude."" I have finally gotten one of my aunts who has volunteered to help me out, so that takes care of that problem. She won't let me make my own personal decisions in life, won't let me take care of problems by myself like an adult (I had a falling out with an ex, told her to leave it alone, that I had handled the situation myself. Come to find out, she messaged him anyway saying some rather rude things to him.) I still live at home, because at 22 with only a part time job and attending school, there's just no way that I could make it on my own, so I do understand there being rules set in place. But she's rarely ever let me have friends over, or let me go out with friends, which has led to me losing a bunch of them. And when I'm out with my boyfriend, she'll text me 20+ times saying that I ""had better answer her"" and ""don't make her come find me."" She's very controlling of me and my life, and it just feels like she may be trying to prevent me from growing up and being able to leave home. And I also don't mean to sound rude about it or anything. I'm glad I have a mom who does care and everything, but she's taken it to a very extreme degree, and I can feel it putting a huge strain on our relationship. I've tried talking to her about this in a serious manner and her only response is ""don't talk to me about this right now"" or ""you need to drop this little attitude you've got.""

35,"I had such a shitty day, and right now i'm not sure if it had bothered both of us or just me. This feeling, this thought, it's toxic and fatal. It creeps its own way in my mind and makes me question my relationship. 

Clearly my patience for him is chipping out like cheap old paint and the pillar built up by our mutual understanding is shaking vigorously. I am scared. Of myself and him, of losing, of holding on, of accidentaluly hurting both of us. I have become someone else? I dont know, but i do acknowledge the stain that is contaminating the purity of my passion for him. I used to love with all i had and never looked for a reciprocation. I gave without the expectation of receiving. This is not an indication of my generosity, more like a narration of the past. However, i have changed. I let myself go with the flow, and that's the point when all hell broke loose. We talked less, we saw each other less. I got irritated by his timetable, got jealous with everyone around him for getting more attention (what irony is i told him to do that, set his priority in an order which favoured me least) and now i'm sick of his immune system (if what he said was true, he had had fever few times already, in one month, and the next one is coming). I have less stage time, only speak to him when he gets back (late, around 1 to 1.30 am) or when he's in his car, on his way to office. 

Now that's another problem. I got hidden. No one has ever seen me (an actual seeing) and no one has ever talked to me (again, an actual talking). I'm quite sure he hasnt introduced me to his family, definitely they've got some hints, but my role as his girlfriend, his fiancé (as he claimed) has never come under the light. I've got explanations already, however, the gap between understanding and being pleased is quite significant i must say. Like, which girl wants to live in the dark and doesnt own a proper position? I got hurt........he played some tricks and then i pretended like thing was not an issue anymore. I'm not a child. It's hard so solve the problem without removing its root, but how can we reach to the depth with him thinking it's all settled and me not saying a word? 

The very foundation of our relationship has been violated. It is being poisoned from inside out, and his time for me is just half of the problem. Money. I know, the moment when i admitted the connection between money and my attitudes, i knew i was being rotten, far beyond healing, and i did not deserve to be loved fully anymore. I have been teared apart by my own guilt and my anger. I desperately need money. My parents are paying a huge amount for my study and nothing i can do, i'm useless, watching them spend every dime on me, the one they will use for their old age, to prepare for their retirements. But the need is endless......have the whole lists of what to buy, what to do. I cannot stop blaming myself......Finally i came to the final solution, i asked him since he has a steady job and i'm still a college student. Just a small number, for a pair of shoes, or some cosmetics, maybe a lipstick or an eyeliner, nothing more. I just want to lessen the burden on my ma and pa's shoulder, i swear to god that's all i wanna do. Repay is my intention. I will give him back the money, and will be deeply indebted to his kindness after that. To be honest, i never asked anything from him before, because i know the right to do so has been stripped off when the ability to give is so fragile. I did my best to show my dedication to the bonding between us. When he was with me, i tried to cover most of the fees, paid whatever i could. He came to me, spent on flight and hotel so i thought that was the least i could do. I always try to satisfy him and never complain about it. But now, now i call for his support, not directly, i dont have the courage, but not too subtle. He is so intelligent, i know he gets what i try to convey. He remains silent, though. Nothing has been transferred into my account. Sometimes i wonder if he wants me to say that i desire his money desperately, to totally destroy my self esteem and crash my ego. I once had the thought that even hookers got paid for their job, i got nothing, but then i realised how wrong i had been......Anyway, his silence keeps me insecure. Questions pop up more often. How my future with him will be? We planned for marriage, but what marriage can survive under the harsh pressure of money, and what will happen if i have to rely on him, financially? My birthday has passed, also his as well, we didnt give each other anything. I'm broke af, and he, i dont know. Valentines is coming and few days ago he told me it was just a normal day to him, nothing special. I dont care about stupid celebration, but as a girl, i have secret desires for presents and caring. Does it make me a gold digger, a money-thirsty bitch? I hate myself for my mundane need, for my greed, but also i'm angry at him for not giving a hand. Words cannot provide me what i want, but words are the only thing he can give. I have tried not to think about it, not to want what's not mine. It didnt work very well. I love him, and i'm losing my passions. I dont want to fight. I risk everything to love him, my relationship with my dad, my image in my friend's view, and also my future. Most of the people i know are pressurising me to break up with him, while i want to stay so bad. Pls help me",12Feb2017,2

38,"I'm a natural people pleaser. Most of that probably stems from not want to lose anybody or anything (ex. job) in my life by making people angry at me. So I pretty much agree to any request someone is making, especially if the person making it is my boss or someone I care about (SO, parents). My natural response to a request is to figure out how to do what they're asking by rearranging my plans and my wants. 

In the process I think I've somewhat lost me. I don't know what I like to do and I don't know what I want in life. When a friend asks me what I want to do, my default is to always ask them what they want to do and do that instead. 

At the same time, I've been taught (as a Christian) to put other's needs above mine. Relationship advice also says to focus on the other persons needs before your own. Making them happy is supposed to make me happy. So if they need/want something from me, I should do everything within my power to help them, even if it means sacrificing my comfort. And I think I do believe that if everyone in the world was a little less self-centered we'd all be happier.

44,"Buckle Up:


First off, I want to say that I've never been in a relationship of any kind. That being said I've given out good relationship advice to my friends nonetheless. Now, I don't know what to do, because I can't turn to my friends about it. The reason for that being that one of my best friends is dating someone that I think I have feelings for. Let me give a brief summary. Lets give my lady friend the name Sara, and my guy friend the name John. 

I've been friends with Sara for 3 years now and it wasn't until recently that she told me that she used to have a crush on me. I thought it was amusing, but kind of shrugged it off, because hadn't seen her for about 2 years; I had switched schools. 

I met John through another friend and have known him now for a few months, but he's an insanely cool guy and despite not getting to hang with him very often, I really enjoy it when we do. 

I host a discord server, and I invited Sara to join, and invited John to join. They actually met on that server, and John invited everyone to come hang out at his place. Since John knew Sara was a friend of mine he trusted that it would be ok. I went to his house and saw Sara there for the first time in 2 years. I was shocked for a second because she was a lot prettier than I remembered. We had always had good chemistry personality wise, and I feel really comfortable around her. I actually dug my own grave because I set them up together before I saw Sara in person! But now that I've seen her, all the memories of when we used to see each other all the time came flooding back, and I may have feelings for her. She is the first and only girl that cares about me as a person deeply, and while she doesn't have supermodel looks, her personality is what attracts me so much. She sees me as a close friend, and so does John. She sees me as so close a friend in fact, that she asks me for relationship advice, which is really hard for me. Despite the fact that I might have feelings, I give her my best advice because I just want her to be happy. These feelings of potential attraction are just really confusing and I'm just not sure what to make of them. ",12Feb2017,1

47,"Hi everyone. A few days ago I got involved a scam where someone tricked me into allowing them to deposit a counterfeit check into my bank account (Details are in another post I made if any of you are curious) and long story short I am now concerned that these people may try to hurt me due to fear of me ratting them out. This happened on my college campus and today I tried to contact the police and they asked for information on the dude and they told me that I would have to contact the campus police about this but they still asked me about his appearance and his phone number (which I gave). A few hours ago around 9pm this dude messages me and asks me what am i doing tonight which I found very odd as he never once asked me this (He was my weed plug prior to this scam) and honestly i'm very scared for my safety as he knows the area I live in with my parents and the dorm building I stay at. I'm in a position where idk if I should get campus police involved as this would most likely lead to him getting caught as I know more than enough info on him but I'm afraid of retaliation from people he might possibly know. At the same time I'm really scared he might suspect me as being likely to get him caught so he might try to get to me. I have no desire to drop out of college and leave the area but I don't want to end up getting hurt or possibly even killed over this fucking scam. Someone please give me some ideas on what to do, I feel completely trapped right now.",12Feb2017,2
48,"I've been accepted into my dream school, Colorado State University, but I'm having trouble deciding whether or not I want to (or can) go. I'm from Georgia so out of state tuition is a bit of a doozy, in total it'll be somewhere around 45k a year for school, books, housing, etc. Versus my backup school that's about 20 miles away and will cost me around 10k a year. 

I really want to go to CSU for all four years instead of two at my backup and then transferring but there's no way I can afford it without a loan. So are student loans worth it? It's one of the only schools in the nation offering my intended major, and it's in one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. But it costs so much to go that it feels like if I borrow it I'll be paying it off for the rest of my life. 

I really need some advice on this, my mom wants me to stay in state because she really doesn't want me to be in debt right out of college and my dad wants me to follow my dreams and I'm stuck in the middle. There's nothing I'd rather do, and no place I'd rather be, but the weight of the debt just seems so large that I'm really hesitant to decide.

51,"So okay I should probably preface this by saying yes it does kinda sound like made up story and thats partly why I'm afraid of telling my landlord. I'm a very shy person and I struggle with social anxiety on the daily, a lot of the time if I even need to talk to my landlord ill text him or just complain to mum about it until she feels sorry for me and does it herself. He's a pretty understanding guy and one time he even told my mum that he used to be the shy when he was younger so he doesn't mind. Now onto how it happened, I don't 100% know the details but essentially I was sleeping with my head at the foot of my bed because it is closer to the fan (its hot af in Aus right now) and the next thing I know I'm wide awake and theres a crunch at my feet and a 10 inch crack/indentation in the wall. Luckily none if it is broken off but its not looking great and I'm not sure what to do. My room mate's dad is coming down this weekend and he seems to think he can fix it with a bit of plaster and some paint, I'm a little hesitant towards this idea because obviously he's not a professional and I don't want to make it worse. My uncle is a builder so alternatively I could ask him to come down and have a look at it but I would probably have to pay for him to travel here and fix it, likely cheaper than contracting someone but still could cost around $400 according to my mum who had a similar thing fixed last year (note: that was also my fault I am a tyrant destroyer of drywall). The other option and probably the one I feel least guilty about but certainly most anxious about and that's just telling my landlord and sorting it out from there.

53,"I'm 16, and are constantly surrounded by friends who have already had their first kiss, some even lost their virginity. I've never even held hands with a girl. My last real girlfriend was in 6th grade, I was too nervous to do anything but hug. And now that I'm in high school and want to become more romantic with someone, I've run into a problem. No one wants me.

Even with self confidence issues, I don't think I'm a bad looking guy. I've been told plenty that I'm cute and at least ""above average."" I have an outgoing personality, always cracking jokes and looking to make friends. Most of my friends are girls, so I thought it would be easy for me to find a girlfriend. But I guess not. Anytime I've become close enough to feel comfortable to ask someone on a date, it's always a no. Usually the same excuse of ""I don't want to ruin our friendship,"" which is something I'll never understand. 

I do have the idea that my depression and anxiety could be driving people away, but it hasn't done anything to drive friends away. So why would it drive potential dates away? Then I started thinking it was because of my straight edge lifestyle and decision to not have sex until marriage, but again, I didn't think it would have enough impact to drive girls away. I've asked a few girls on why I wouldn't be dateable, and they couldn't give me a solid reason. They always tell me I'm perfect boyfriend material, and girls should be lining up to see me. So I don't understand what's wrong with me. I'm confident enough in myself, my depression only affects me in brief times of relapse, I'm not secluded and my personality is fun. What's the reason for constant rejection? I just don't understand",12Feb2017,1
54,"Some years ago, I lost a large amount of weight.

Nothing happened.

A lot of people, even on reddit, swear that the world starts treating you entirely differently.  I didn't find that happened, and for better or worse I feel I need to directly try to fix different things wrong with my life.  Dating is a big one, but I probably need to get a lot of other things right first.

(I think one of my current bosses might have had issues with me if I had been hired previously.  So five years after the fact, there is that.)

I bring this up a bunch when weight loss comes up.  I sometimes think I lost defective pounds or something - the shower of attention never really came, my personality pretty much stayed as it was...but I might be the freak here.

I wonder if I'm hurting other people's motivation.  But I feel as though I put in the effort mostly for nothing.

64,"Disclaimer: I suck at writing out my thoughts so sorry if this is hard to follow

I'm currently 14 Years old living with both of my parents. For the past few years my relationship with my mom has been getting worse and worse and today it has gotten really bad. It mostly all started out with my grandmother dying of ALS. My mom was really close with her and when she died my mom changed. She always seemed more irritable and angry and had mood swings. A few years later it started to get worse. Me getting more moody and disrespectful (because of puberty and stuff) made me instead of just agreeing and doing what she told me, I would say some smart-ass remark trying to prove my point better. As time passed this would happen more often, with me arguing more and just honestly being a douche and eventually I stopped ""doing things with her"" (meaning if she asked me to watch a movie id just stay in my room instead of gladly watching the movie and things like that) These things made her more irritable and angry.

Over time we've spent less and less time around each other and now I barely see her. I normally just go into my room and try to avoid getting into an argument. We always get into arguments, whether it's over my attitude or me not doing my chores we always end up yelling at each other. The frequency of our arguments is through the roof right now, at least once a day. It normally goes back and forth about how i think shes being unreasonable and that she needs to stop yelling at me. And then eventually she goes into the other room and either cries to my dad or just sits and watches TV. Part of me feels bad that I make her sad like this but another part of me doesn't feel anything. She makes me feel the same way. I never feel like i do anything the right way. If i'm told to clean the litter boxes, I don't sweep up all the litter. If i'm told to do the dishes, one dish isn't cleaned right. I feel like i'm never doing anything properly and that i'm a disappointment to her. It doesn't help that my dad recently lost his job and our family is struggling financially. Everyone in my house is very stressed and irritable. This causes me and her to be at each other more and more.

Eventually my friends started to take notice. She would come into my room and start yelling at me not realizing that i was in a skype call. I told her that 3 of my friends said that what she did was scary (because she asked if they heard) and she punished me for not turning off my mic. I lost my shit and got into a huge argument about how unreasonable that was and how i shouldn't be in trouble for what she did. I feel like she does that a lot. When i argue with her and win she just takes something away. I feel she craves control over me and when she loses an argument that's the only way to stand her ground.

Don't get me wrong i understand that arguing is wrong but I just feel I shouldn't be pushed around all the time

But today it hit rock bottom. it started off like any other argument. I didn't vacuum my floor right. (I did only the carpet and not the hard wool part) ( I have ADD so i forget to do that part a lot) and we start yelling. My dad gets involved and she takes away my 3ds. My mom tells me to make a list and to vacuum. I ask her which one to do first and she doesn't answer. (I ask because if i start cleaning she might yell at me for not making the list, and if she comes in and i'm sitting down making a list and not cleaning she might yell at me)  and she gives me some vague answer not telling me what to do so i ask again and we start arguing again. I'm saying that she just needs to tell me what to do and shes saying that she doesn't want to tell me what to do. (The point is we argue over the dumbest shit all because either i don't understand or i didn't do something right.) She starts crying and we leave each other alone. This happens multiple times today and my day concludes with shouting at my mom and going to my room. I overhear her crying and saying to my dad that she just wants the work to get done right. This is why i'm so torn over if i feel bad or not. I try to do what she wants but i never end up doing it right. I sometimes stop trying because its never good enough anyway and i don't feel like wasting my time if its not going to be good enough. (I know that is a horrible idea but i do it anyway. Its just the only way I feel i can control anything in those situations.) So now i'm writing this with my crying mother in the other room. I don't know what to do anymore. Please help. I want us to get along but it just feels impossible anymore...",12Feb2017,1

80,"To start off I am a female in my late 20's and I've recently been having issues with someone I had previously considered to be a close friend who is also female and in her late 20's. We've known each other for a few years now and I thought we had become close friends, but recently I have been questioning the authenticity of said friendship.

We have both recently had seperate dramas in our lives and, for my part, I thought as such close friends we would be supportive and be there for each other. I had done my best to be supportive and there for her during her difficulties, but when mine cropped up she began acting differently. She started to distance herself from me and started hanging out more with another friend of hers (F early 30's who I might add magically vanishes when the S hits the fan in her ""friends"" lives) who I believe to be at least partially responsible for my difficult time. I spoke to her about my thoughts and feelings on the matter and she seemed to understand where I was coming from, but she continued to skip out on spending time with me in favor of getting stoned with said other friend (they are the only two in this situation that smoke weed so I get it to an extent, but i really wish she'd at least call or something if she'd rather do that and not just call the next day with some ""I'm sorry I didn't know if you still wanted to hang out so I just went to hers.""). 

Meanwhile, another girl in our former group (F mid 30's), the one mostly responsible for a majority of the drama in my life at present (she's very vocal about her dislike of me and how horrible of a person she thinks I am, going so far as to call my land lord in an attempt to get me kicked out, even though I have never done or said anything against her) is also spending more time with her. Making things worse is while she won't actually talk to me about things half of my friends tell me she's just using me and not really my friend at all and the other half say that she just doesn't know how to handle the situation leaving me confused and frustrated.

Her room mate, who I've known for about 6 months at this point, has been far more supportive and interested in how I'm doing than she seems to be. She recently forbid both of us from being around her while we are together, stating that we are too dramatic for her and she doesn't want to deal with it. (He has had a crush on me and he and I try to be adults about it and talk things out as I don't return those feelings and only see him as a good friend. As such we don't really have much in the way of drama around her and I know she's not into him so I'm confused about her reaction to us hanging out.) She seems to hate when I hang out with him at their place and it has gotten so bad that on a few occasions we've slept in his car down the street because she made it so uncomfortable to be there (she's gone so far as to lecture me for over an hour at one point that I need to be more ""aware"" of when it might come off like I'm flirting with others, she's mentioned herself her room mate and another friend of mine that she doesn't get on with as examples, even though I don't think that I am and have asked other people including the other people she used as examples and they all agree with me). Her other room mate has felt the need to voice that he wants no part in this and he is basically switzerland...or canada.

I don't want to bad mouth her other friends and I really don't care if she remains friends with them, but her disregarding what is happening in my life and basically acting either like nothing is wrong or she's only ""playing nice"" out of some obligation or something is getting on my nerves. Her treating her room mate poorly just because we are friends is kind of a double standard in my opinion as she wants me to still be okay with her other friend when she's around (vocal girl and I absolutely cannot be in the same place so that's not an issue). 

Most recently she has started kind of hanging out with her room mate and myself but just for small talk and to bum cigs. Today she actually sat down with us on the porch for a while and made us each a mixed drink and bummed a few cigs which confused both of us greatly. I have asked to speak to her about it and she just nodded and said ""uh-huh"", so I'm not sure if I'm even going to get that far. 

Any advice for a confused girl who doesn't want to lose a friend but doesn't know what the F is going on?",12Feb2017,3
81,"Some background information: I've been friends with all of these people for multiple years and I'm very close to all of them. I've been through so much with them and I'd hate to lose them, but life is life I guess.

So earlier tonight 2 of my best and closest friends (or so I thought (I'm a 15 year old guy and they're both 14 year old girls)) pulled a ""prank"" on me. They were both hanging out with some other people (like 7 people total) and they played beerpong but instead of beer they used powerade. 

My friend, let's call her Kathryn, snapchatted me and said, ""it isn't powerade..."" and I asked what it was, which she then got mad at me for. My other friend who was there, let's call her Ansley, texted me and goes, ""Andrew,"" (not my real name btw, just using it for the sake of the story), ""I'm so sorry. I know I told you I wouldn't drink but it just happened."" At this point Kathryn was texting me too, mad at me just for trying to get more information about the situation.

 I went to my friend, let's call her Rachael, for help. I was asking Rachael for help because I didn't know what to do since Kathryn was mad at me for nothing. Kathryn and Ansley were both extremely mad at me at this point, again, just for trying to figure out more about the situation. Kathryn's boyfriend texted me asking what all was going on and he was trying to make the situation better, which worked to some degree. I made a group convo with me, Kathryn, Ansley, and Rachael in it, but Ansley kept kicking Rachael out because it had ""nothing to do with her."" 

I went through a similar situation with Rachael a few months ago when she drank one time at a party, which Kathryn and Ansley completely freaked out about and told Rachael that she was making a huge mistake. So now that Kathryn and Ansley were doing it makes them hypocrites. 

Then later after I had stopped answering Kathryn and Ansley, Ansley texted me and said that it was all a prank and that they were kidding about drinking, which is not something I take lightly, especially since both Kathryn and Ansley swore they would never drink.

 I immediately told Rachael and she got very, very mad as well. I was, and still am, pissed off to no end. Rachael told me to drop them and to not forgive them, which I am really considering at this point. 

I made another gm with just me, Kathryn, and Ansley to try and explain to them why I was mad and to ask what made them think that would be a good idea. They got even more mad at me, so I stopped answering. They texted in the gm again and told me to make a decision of whether or not I wanted to continue being friends with them. They both were treating Rachael and I very poorly and shitty. A real friend wouldn't be mad at me and pressuring me to make a decision. I told them I needed time to decide, but they then got even more mad at me for saying I needed time. I feel like they don't want to actually continue being friends with me since they just tried to end the argument by forcing me to make a decision  and that's where you come in, Reddit. If anyone could please respond and tell me what they would do in my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",12Feb2017,2

83,"A year and a half ago, I was extremely depressed.  I looked to everyone for advice.  From this, I thought it would be best to break up with my boyfriend.  I feel like I can't remember why I did this.  It's driving me crazy.  I can't get over him, although its been a year and a half AND I've dated since.  We were friends for a bit until his new girlfriend made him cut all ties with me.  I need help, I need to move on.  During the time we were friends, I thought we would eventually end up back together but obviously that will never happen.  How can I move on? I feel like he'll be the ""one who got away"" and its all my fault.  I blame myself for everything and I really don't want to drive myself crazy over being the whole reason I feel like such shit.

I obviously thought it was for the best at the time but I cannot for the life of me get my current self to just accept that and move on.  I never should have been his friend after the break up, but I did.  Another thing to blame myself for.

I'll describe his personality in dot points.

- Self centered and self absorbed. 
-Energetic
- Healthy 
- Happy and nice.
- Very loud when he speaks and he talks all the time.
- Very Oblivious. 
- Immature at times
- Below average IQ
- Rudely interrupts a conversation either but tapping or touching you or over talking over you.Sometimes if you are having a conversation and he just comes into the room he will HAVE to know what we are talking about.So he is a bit nosey as well. 
- He comes right up into your face when he talks to you.
-In the cinema's he will try to talk to you and if you ignore him (which I now do) he will whip as his phone and begin to text in the cinema. 
- He gets very clingy to people as he hates staying home and alone.He will always phone call people and talk for a long time.He falls in love very very easy and gets clingy.
- He cant maintain a friendship or relationship for a long time as he tends to find an issue with them or they get sick of him.
- He gets bored easy.
- He laughs a lot and all the time and cant tell the difference between a joke and something serious. 

- He has never taken drugs in his life so dont even suggest its just drugs.
-When we are out in public people always stare at us because they must think that he is special or something. 

I know it sounds as though I can just complaining but I am just concerned and just want some input.

87,"I live in a sharehouse with three other girls. 

Today I had my first tiff with my housemate (she's lived with me for a couple of years, so it was bound to happen). I found out she dismantled my bird aviary and put it out on hard rubbish (no birds living in there at the moment). I was particularly annoyed because she didn't ask first. I only messaged her three or four days earlier saying I had found a good place for storage, because I have some items around the house she has been hassling me to get rid of (a tent, some fishing rods, four half-filled boxes of stuff and a few sleeping bags). I just needed to wait till I got paid after the weekend. 

When I confronted her about throwing out my aviary without asking me first, she held up a box of my shoes and said ""can we throw these out"" and I lost it. It turned out she decided that today would be the day she threw out a bunch of my stuff, and wouldn't wait for me to put it in storage. Which annoys me, because I had made it clear on multiple occasions that some of the items were of use and worth being sold second-hand or given to charity. And I'd found a storage company for the rest. 

So after telling her I was very peeved off, I have a bad case of PMS right now, best to avoid me so I don't end up saying something dumb, she tries calling my phone to talk and I ignored her. She kept trying to talk to me in person at home, but when I realised it wasn't going to be a productive conversation I asked for my space, and said we can talk about it tomorrow because today I can't even think straight. 

Twenty minutes later she knocks on my bedroom door and is in tears and asks me if I still love her. I said yes, tomorrow we will talk and sort it out and kiss and makeup, but today I just need to be left alone. 

Then she looks at me in the eyes and says ""I HAVE CANCER!"". I was a bit thrown. Was she trying to make me feel guilty for getting angry at her? I asked her where, and then she says ""They don't know"".

Okay, alarm bells start ringing then. I've never known anyone to be told they have cancer but ""they [the doctors] don't know"" where it is (even vaguely). She could have told me she ""didn't know, but it was related to symptoms x, y &amp; z that she has been having"". After saying ""they don't know"" so dismissively to my question, I just kinda froze up on the spot, gave her a hug and said we'll sit down tomorrow and have a proper chat about it.

But something seemed really off about her choice of timing for telling me. She knew I wanted to be left alone and kept hassling me to talk to her. There are two other girls home and a male friend who she has been hanging out with all day, so it can't be because she is lonely. I just can't work out why she would actively seek me out when I'm feeling in a crap mood and give me more crap news? Was it to make me feel bad for telling her off for throwing out my stuff onto the street without checking if I was okay with that?

The whole thing seemed strange. So when I had a quiet moment with one of the other housemates (who I will call housemate #2), I asked if housemate #2 knew anything about X having cancer. Housemate #2 said ""Apparently she had breast cancer when she was 21 (she's 34 now and its the first I've heard about her having cancer when she was younger), and she's having some preliminary tests on Tuesday to find out if there is cancer, because something isn't right and she doesn't know what it is yet"". Housemate #2 then said it was probably all down to stress.

So if she is having preliminary, investigative tests on Tuesday, why did my housemate seek me out to tell me she HAS cancer?! Why worry someone about that if you're not sure you have it??!

This housemate has always been a bit odd, and that's okay. For example, last week I was talking about death (an old friend had taken his life and I guess death was on my mind) and she just blurted out ""My friend died a couple of days ago"" and ran out of the room and refused to talk to us about it again. She does this a lot - dropping an H-bomb and running away to her room before we have time to react to what she just said. If I'm trying to get ready for work she tells me to sit down so she can drunkenly complain about how she was raped by her babysitter and how her parents are cruel for subjecting her to that. Nowadays I have learned to be blunt and tell her I can't sit and chat. 

There are some crazy stories she's told me that I hear about once and never again. Another time, when I disclosed to her I worked in the adult entertainment industry, she told me she had done the same in another city near where we live. Then a year later she was telling me she was nervous because she had never done this sort of thing and didn't know what to expect (she was insistent was trying it out, total disaster). 

She told me her best friend died when she was 18, and her best friend left a baby daughter behind, and that she was financially responsible for the kid because of a promise she made. Then this year child died in a car crash at the age of 16. I've never seen a photo of the daughter or her old best friend. I believed it all until she mentioned before her parents came to visit that they have no idea about her old best friend dying or the promise she made to financially support this daughter. It seemed like she was telling me because she didn't want me to mention the funeral or anything like that to them?

When I told her how my house had been broken into when I was a teenager and I was assaulted (and thats why I'd like to keep the back door locked), a month later she casually mentioned how someone had broken into her house and raped her. I never heard that story again. 

Then there are the little lies, saying she was a few years younger than she really was when she moved into the house. Telling me she needs some valium from me because she is uber stressed and then giving it straight to her friend when they were leaving to go to a party. These things don't bother me because there is no real emotional manipulation involved.

I understand that there is no one right way to handle a traumatic diagnosis. I understand that there is no ""correct"" way to process a traumatic life event. I should probably mention too that I did have another housemate years ago, and when we had to ask him to leave (he didn't have rent and was doing a lot of drugs and generally being a nightmare housemate) he told me he had cancer. Which he didn't (I've been in contact with him since, and it seems he forgot he ever told me he had cancer).

Am I being fair here? Am I being too skeptical? Is there something I can ask her, to catch her out, to see if she is lying or actually telling the truth? I was thinking of asking her more about the time she had breast cancer when she was 21 (like what type, what stage, what kind of treatment did they give her, etc.). I'm a graduate nursing student, I've worked on cancer wards and I understand that cancer presentations vary widely. 

It's just that if she has lied about having cancer, I'm feeling like she's purposefully tried to manipulate me into feeling bad for something I think I have every right to be upset by (i.e. throwing my belongings into hard rubbish).

I appreciate any advice I can get from a level head!",12Feb2017,10

90,"So my family has always been great. I'm 25 and have a daughter of my own and another baby on the way. I've been with fiancé for 8 years. I have a different father than my siblings, but for all 25 years have lived with step father (call him dad, raised me, close with my daughter etc.) I have three siblings (20m,16m, &amp; 8f) and we all live in the city. Always have. About 8 years ago when my sister was born, my mother and grandmother (step fathers mom) stopped getting along. Things got nasty. My mom mostly tried keeping me and sibs away from grandmother. Oldest brother and I were very close with her and grandfather. This was devastating to the whole family. Prior to this argument my moms parents and fathers parents always got along and we ate dinner every Sunday for years. My mom stopped speaking to/about grandmother and grandfather. There was so much drama. My father and his parents work together so it strained their marriage. My mom hates her mother in law. All this arguing made my moms parents resent dads parents very much. My moms father also worked with my dad and his parents so this further strained things. Countless things have been said to/about each other. No regard for feelings. 

Life moves on and my oldest brother and I continue relationship with our grandparents (we were closer with grandparents on my dads side). This made things worse. My younger sister was kept completely away from my dads parents and at 8 years old barely knows them. I could see this was painful for my dad. My mom was never very close with any of us. If anything she was closest with my sister. It has since been 8 years, and my mother has come to terms with my dad keeping his relationship with his parents, as well as me and my brother as well. This bothers her immensely. 

She has always been the type to hold a real grudge. She has expressed multiple times while we grew up that she does not care so much for my dads family. She was once best friends in her younger years with my dads cousin. When we were younger we called her our aunt (that's how close they were). Very abruptly and suddenly words were exchanged between my mom and dads cousin and my mom has never spoken to her since. My ""aunt"" had tried to reconcile shortly after by sending us kids some gifts. My mom declined and returned the gifts back to her. She has not spoken to her once best friend in about 17 years. She doesn't budge. There have been many people my mom has simply cut from her life, without looking back. I don't know why, but this has always bothered me. WHY??

During my later childhood my mom seemed to really have it out for me. Not sure if it was resentment for my biological father coming though or simply I was an annoying/irritating kid. She always got along fine with my biological father, as did my (step)dad. I've always lived with my mom and step-dad. Always visited my biological father, and his family, but never became close or established any sort of father-daughter bond. Never spent the night at his house, never at my grandparents on that side either. Not sure why, it just felt very odd and forced when I was younger. Didn't see that he cared for a close bond. He seemed to always be happy to see me but annoyed after a short time spent with me. Regardless, my step father who I call dad to this day, always seemed to care for me the most. Maybe he just felt bad? Not sure but always felt genuine care from him. Like a real concern for not just my whereabouts and attitude but also my feelings on matters. My mom always wanted to punish me, or so it felt. I was always punished more extremely than any other siblings. My step dad (while I was growing up) would defend me against my mom and it made me feel as if she picked on me. 

Fast forward a bit. I'm 25, and my moms parents decide to retire. This incites more drama as my moms father retires from working with dad and his parents. He doesn't get the retirement ""deal"" he feels he was entitled to. They negotiate he will work (somewhat) from his new home location. Drama re-opens. They decide to retire anyways and move 1,800 miles southwest and begin their new life. They left 3 weeks before Christmas. Sold their house, drove their car down, and moved into a retirement subdivision. They are very happy with this decision. All is well. They decide to open a small restaurant/fast food place in their new town (doesn't open for about 2 years). They have no other family there under age 70. Their move makes my mom a bit upset. She talks about moving there to help them with their food place. We all go about thinking this is just an idea.

They are there for the 2 years and gears are in motion for this food place to open. My mom talks of moving more. We all shrug it off. My mom visits her parents, and looks for houses. She finds one, and tells my dad she would like to buy it and move. He agrees and is somewhat unsure (it seems??) as to what this will mean for them. She buys the house (a 5 bedroom, 4 bathroom HUGE house for just her and my sister) and is elated and sets a date to move. Me and my siblings are all unsure about how this makes us feel. The youngest, my sister moves with her. My mom and sister pack up and move across the country in a matter of days. 

It has been 4 months since they have moved and I somewhat am angry. I feel like my mom cares more about her parents (btw they are 65y/o) than she does about me and my siblings and my dad and honestly her granddaughter. My daughter is about 2 and has never spent too much time with my mom. My grandparents seem to hardly care about us either. They are just so pleased that my mother has moved to be with them. 

My mom and dad are not divorced, but this is a complicated living arrangement. My dad travels back and forth and is trying to help them out (since my mom is not working for real money, she's working at the food place to really help the grandparents out)... she calls me maybe 1 time a week, sometimes less. She will FaceTime when she calls. She looks so happy. It really makes me sad. I always wanted to have a relationship with her it just never felt real. I have such a close and beautiful relationship with my 2y/o. She is my LIFE! I don't know why they don't really care about seeing my daughter, or helping me, or being around for her. 

I call and they forget to call back. I visited and they treated me strangely while I was there. I've never felt this out of place. My oldest brother acts as if he cares less, says he doesn't want them to come back, and doesn't seem so hurt. Younger brother doesn't look phased but my dad assures me that his grades are not as sharp and that the boys do care in their own ways. My dad himself is just so confused. He looks lost. He knows the need to be here for my brothers (and me, my daughter &amp; fiancé). He misses my mom but it has changed their relationship obviously. I find myself constantly going back and forth between angry, sad, depressed, and feeling unworthy. Not sure if that's how I should feel?? To top it off I've expressed this to my mom. She tells me she is doing what she needs to do, and that it is hard for her to, but there is no chance she is moving back at all. She will visit she says. How can she look so happy? 

Should I go see a therapist? There are so many details I've omitted and this is already long as ever. I could just skip therapy and write a fucking novel. Or series. I think about this DAILY. Almost hourly. Not obsessively just thought wise. Not sure how to feel, or move on. People of Reddit, any replies. If you have made it this far thank you.

Long story short: mom moved across the country 4months ago with little sister. She is happy. No intentions of moving back. She is helping grandparents live their dream? Dad is here with two teenage brothers. I am 25 with a toddler and baby on the way (with fiancé). Were all lost. I am angry, confused, hurt, depressed, emotional, happy! Not even sure! Help!

94,"So I started working at this place a few months ago and, initially, everything was fine. After a few weeks my boss (female, and I'm a male) started doing things that would make me uncomfortable (things she considered completely platonic) and I started to feel anxious every time I came to work. After the behavior escalated to physical touching and multiple occurrences of that, I made up my mind to finally speak up about it. I let her know why I'm feeling the way I do at work, and she completely goes off on me. She was saying she couldn't understand why I would feel this way and that it's my fault that I feel the way I do. I then followed up by saying I don't want to work in a place where I can't voice my thoughts and feelings about the work environment (and in general). This obviously made her even more mad. It's really bothering me because she's middle-aged and married and I'm still in high school.
 Any advice would be very appreciated.

96,"I dont really know if this belongs here but I have no one else to give my thoughts to, and I know this is a totally cliche problem but I just need to vent.

I, only about an hour ago, found out that my crush (I'll call him Jimmy) has feelings for one of my best friends (I'll call her Sarah). Sarah also has a crush on Jimmy and both of them dont even know it. I can't tell either of them because that will be breaking both of their trusts.

Jimmy can't tell Sarah because she has a firm belief in not having a boyfriend in highschool, but Jimmy is pretty keen. I would consider both of them my some of my best friends, I care for both of them and they are great people, and I am happy for them, but I cant help feeling really jealous. I really wish I didn't feel this way.

I think it would be better if they were actually dating because then I would know for sure that Jimmy is off limits. I know he already is but because it is not official I still have hope in my heart. I have not told anyone because I know that it will just cause massive tension in the group and I dont want any broken friendships. I have had a crush on him for 4 years now but I never told anyone and now I regret it. I have never met anyone like Jimmy, and I have never met anyone like Sarah, I couldn't live without any of them, but it just hurts.

When Jimmy told me that he had a crush on her I felt a huge drop in my stomach but I think I hid it pretty well, I smiled and acted normally... He called her beautiful. That really hurt because then I knew his feeling were real. It hurts even more because only a few days ago he gave me a card for my 16th birthday with a message that well and truly made me believe I had a chance.
They both have so much trust in me and I don't know what to do. I have known both of them for nearly 5 years now and been friends with them for that entire time. Any advice for what I could do or how I can get over him will be very appreciated because I hate the way this feels and bros before hoes right?

105,"Throwaway because potential embarrassment, and there's a crackteam of weaponized autists watching my other account constantly.

I'm not even sure how to start this...

I ended up helping out at this programming class the other day. Basically a three hour-long class where we taught some basic programming stuff to kids. Anyway, while I was there, I met one of the new mentors. A girl who had just joined up about a week ago.

Since we were hanging around here for three hours, I had plenty of time to talk with her, and now, I'm kinda (trying to find whatever word doesn't sound cringy) interested in her, in that way.

A few details here. I'm 18, going 19 soon enough. Before this, any time I had even been remotely interested in a girl I always kinda shut myself down, finding any reason not to try to speak to her. This time, there's plenty of reasons.

She's twenty-something, for a start. I'm not experienced on all this, but that gap just seems weird. She's also studying physics and astrophysics in only the most prestigious college in Ireland. Just by googling her name, I can find loads of things she's been involved in. Lots of programming and science events. Basically, she's really been working hard, and here I am, having just scraped over the line into a regular college, without doing anything even slightly remarkable.

Hell, she lives halfway across the country and I've never even met her before this. I feel like she's wayyy more out of my league than usual.

Usually I'm always trying to find excuses for why a girl's out of my league, but this time, the excuse kinda presents itself. But for the first time ever, I don't want to actually acknowledge it. I want to actually try this time, even though I'm more outmatched than usual.

Hell, I had about 10 minutes of small talk with her and I already like her more than any other girl I've ever met. I don't think she stopped smiling even once during the class, and she's fun to talk to, cracking jokes and dancing round the place mid-conversation. She's a lot like me, from what I've seen.

And I keep telling myself that I should just drop this, and that there's no way this is going to end without embarrassment, but I've done that with every girl I've ever been interested in. This time is different, and I actually want to at least try, this time. The age and all the achievements seems like a big disadvantage for me...

I'm gonna be honest, she's not that good-lookin', but it's not even about looks now. I actually just think she's a really fun person to be with.

I'm not even sure if I'm going about this the right way. Hell, I don't even know if she already has a boyfriend or anything. I'm worried that if I even try to say anything I'll come across as some weird kid that's trying to play in the adult pool.

I'm not even sure what I'm looking for from reddit, now. Just comment on the situation and make me feel a little less weird about this, please.

108,"Hi so I've just graduated university with a degree in a very niche industry in Australia. I interviewed for this company approximately 1 month ago and just got a phone call a couple days ago saying I landed a casual position. I was super stoked that I got it. Only thing is that, just last week I interviewed for the same position, but at a hospital. I felt that I aced the interview and got on well with the senior engineers interviewing me. 
But here's the problem I really want to work at the hospital but don't know if I got the job, but on the other hand I do still want to work with the other company which I landed a causal position with but not as much as the hospital one. 
My employer at the company said he would call sometime this week if I was still interested in accepting the offer.
So this is what I need some of reddit's sage advice:
1) Is 1 week too early to call up the hospital asking if I got the job?
2) If not, how do I go about calling them? what should I say?

I have a prestigious degree from one of the best universities in the world and a glamorous job in finance: last year I made well over US $100k.

However, I feel as though I make men feel intimidated. I am not good at flattery and flirting if I don't genuinely find a guy impressive. Indeed, if I like a guy, my style tends to be more geared toward negging them. If you get into a political argument with me you had better know your facts. 

Weirdly, despite all this I am only attracted to guys who are super confident and arrogant - I don't like to wear the pants in a relationship.

As we had a holiday booked, we decided to go together and it felt really good. We talked about our problems more and it seemed like our relationship has definitely improved through this openness.
When we got back, she told me that having some distance was still something she wants to do, so I obliged. First I moved out to a friends house in order to let her gather her things and have some space. I got home 4 days later and we had agreed, that she would move to her parents by then.
Originally we talked about one week, which would end on tuesday.
We met for a walk today (we have been talking once a day) and discussed our situation. What I was told is that while she has feelings for me, she feels detached right now. She also mentioned the easy thing would have been for her to break up with me and just flee from the situation, but she doesn't want to hurt me and is also afraid of making a huge mistake by losing me.
Talking about our current situation, she said we are on a break but still mutually exclusive.
But she also told me, that she is afraid of moving back in with me, as she doesn't want to drift into all the old behaviours.

I am still madly in love with her (it seems like now more than ever) and know that there is still a deep connection. On the one hand I want to show her how much i care at every opportunity, but on the other hand I don't want to suffocate her. So I am constantly torn. 
Since these troubles I started working out, got my place tidied up and drowned myself in all sorts of work. I also make a point of seeing friends, but it seems that my thoughts drift more and more towards her, the later the evening gets.
 

My question therefore is, dear reddit, has anyone ever found her/himself in a similar situation and what did you do? Also, did it work out eventually? Is there any advice you can give? 
Anyway thanks for reading!

126,"I'm an IT Executive, age 50, with two kids.  My company shifted strategic directions which screwed my job and I resigned last week- because I resigned I only have 2 weeks of severance pay.  I have a signed offer for a new job but it's waiting on customer funding, so I may be able to start on Feb 20, Feb 27 or March 6.  If disaster strikes I may not be able to start until mid-March.  I will get paid on 2/15 and 2/28 but then that's it.  New company has promised me a $5k signing bonus, so I will have money coming in, but only after Day 1, not during this gap.

My kids are in school and my wife has to be out of town for work.  I can't travel and I have to be up at 5:45 to get my older son to the bus and then drive my younger son at 8:00am.  I have to pick up the kids no later than 5pm.  Those are the restrictions.

I spun around like crazy last week, taking my car to be repaired, and doing lots of minor chores- and I feel like I wasted my time.

What should I do with the remaining time I have off when:
1.  I don't know how long it will be?
2.  I don't want to spend lots of money because I don't know how long it will be until I get paid at my new job?

Here are my options:

1.  Close out my late father's estate w/ his lawyer and my mother, which involves 20 or so mind-numbing accounts

2.  Painting my kitchen and other rooms in the house either myself or with a painter

3.  Signing up for online graduate school classes in hopes of earning another Mini-Masters certificate.

4.  Earning one or more IT certifications.  On a whim I took practice tests in A+ and Security+ last night and passed both.  I could also do ITIL.  I don't feel like doing SAFe but that's probably the one I need to do.

5.  Go to the gym for hours every day to get in shape

6.  Catch up on the movies and books I've missed

7.  Sell massive amounts of things on ebay / clean the house- I have a very large collection of items (books on cd, older designer clothes) which I could sell.

I keep spinning from one idea to the next until my day is filled with cleaning one room, watching a movie, and filling out one estate tax form and at night I don't feel like I completed enough.  Definitely looking for some WISE advice to make this break worthwhile...",12Feb2017,5

134,"    Hello there , I need a couple of suggestions, thanks for spending your time here, I really appreciate.

    I fell in love from the first sight with a guy [17M] when I visited a school about a month ago. I saw him again as I had to assist to a lesson there, to get ready for the exams I'll have to take to move school. So we spent together 4 hours, and it was awesome. 

    He's a quiet private guy, and the signals he sent me were ambiguous, maybe his approach was only friendly.

    Anyway, I really need to see him again as I can't stop thinking about him. I'm losing my mind here.

    He doesn't even use facebook , so even if i texted him he wouldn't answer.
Any suggestions? I was thinking of going in front of the school to talk with one of his classmates that happen to be my neighbour, then ask him out or something... I really don't know how stuff work as I've never been into a relationship. [16F].

135,"My niece is 11, about to be 12 in march. And she's being going through all of this since she was about 3 years old. It wasn't all that bad to start off with, mostly emotional abuse. I was out of my nieces and sisters lives for a while, just because my sister is kind of an asshole and whenever one thing goes wrong she removes herself and her kids from mine and my moms life. 

Anyway, my sister has always had some kind of personal vendetta against my niece. Nobody knows why. Maybe it's just her face, who knows. My sister has always kept her in her room, like she's a prisoner ever since she was 3. Always looking for reasons to keep her in her room. She'd make her stay in her room with the lights off 24/7. My niece would get bored, and would start coloring on the walls with markers and that would piss my sister off so she'd get spanked daily. 

Well, I have been out of my family's lives for a while, I moved out of state with my then fiancée. I'm a woman (24 years of age), and that's another main reason why I've been out of their lives. I had a lot of hate against me because of my sexual orientation so I just stayed away and ignored everything. 

I thought things would've changed by now, but I moved back into town, and now years later, I've been hearing about my niece getting beaten. Now it's worse. She is still stuck in her room, without lights on 24/7 nearly, minus the time she's at school. She's not allowed to have a phone, a computer, watch tv or have friend. Not allowed to have fun in general. She gets hit whenever she does the dishes too early or too late even. She's stuck in her room with nothing to do and gets in trouble for just falling asleep too early. 

My niece has been more open, sharing stories about being beaten to the point where she's bruised and beaten. For the first couple of weeks I was really hush hush and didn't say anything. I didn't plan on it. But she sneaks on the computer late at night, messages me and tells me everything her mom does to her. She throws things at her, and my niece even said she beat her on the back of the head with a Tide bottle to the point where she was unconscious. 

It's so bad now, that I've impulsively called a local hotline that's designed for abused/neglected children. I don't even care that my sisters kids are going to get taken away. And yes, I haven't mentioned that my sister has 3 other kids. About to be 4 others come July. But the one girl is the main focus. 

I have the hotline all of this personal information, and everything my niece has told me. Now she's worried that her mom will find out that she's told me to call them, and she's afraid to go home and get beaten. She's also worried that they won't come to save her.

My niece is so worried and scared to go home (she stays with me on the weekends). I'm not sure how all of this works. I'm really concerned about my nieces well being. 

Edit: the ""hotline"" that I called was CPS for my area, and they should have someone out in the next 24 hours. I really wanted them to come out sooner though. ",12Feb2017,41
136,"I just can't figure out why I do this. Every year it has been the same. I move in to a new flat, meet my flatmates, and then gradually stop going to the shared kitchen and isolate myself in my room whenever I am at halls. This ends up as me being branded the ""ghost"" of the flat since I'm never there. In fact one of my flatmates jokingly calls me ""stranger"" whenever he sees me. 

It's not like I act awkward when I see them though. I am actually quite friendly to them. Outside of halls and in college I am fine, I've had mild anxiety but I've been working on it and I feel a lot better on that regard. However, I still feel anxious at halls. I do like privacy at my living space and I never liked the idea of having flatmates. 

On the other hand however I feel that this idea of me preferring to live alone is just my anxiety speaking. I am not quite sure on what to do. Sometimes I avoid them for so long that the thought of bumping into them somewhere makes me anxious cuz they'll be like ""where the hell have you been?"" and then I'd have to come up with an excuse.

Since I avoid the kitchen, I rarely cook, and I always eat at the campus for lunch and just buy a sandwich and lots of fruits for dinner. It would be cheaper if I actually started cooking, but then again, I don't want to deal with my flatmates. They are good people, but I just find it so... draining. On the other hand I want to soldier through this anxiety and force myself to be in there, however I spend tremendous amounts of energy just to act normal and be talkative that it can be really hard on me sometimes.

137,"I'll preface this with some information. Dog is currently 9, a border collie, I'm a 20 year old male living with a single parent and one other dog. 


When I was 12, we got my dog, Jelly, when she was a year an a half old. We got her from a farm, who had taken her in from a neighboring farm. The neighboring farm had abused her and used her as nothing more than a breeding bitch. She was kicked, beaten, starved, left out in thunderstorms, attacked by other dogs and generally treated like shit. When she couldn't have puppies anymore, they got rid of her, offering her to the neighbors. My mum was a friend of theirs, they had no need of a border collie who couldn't do anything and I, being an 11 year old boy with only a small little white yappy dog was ecstatic to have a dog of my own. I asked if we could have her and Mum said yes.


When we first met Jelly, she wouldn't come out of the kennel she was in. She was scared, fur was missing, and she smelt horrible, but it didn't matter. We eventually got her into the car and took her home. 


To make a long(er) story short, after months of rehabilitation, much love and lots of treats, we had gotten Jelly to a place where she was comfortable with us and the other dog in the house. When we first brought her home she snapped at and disliked our other dog, but now she was accepting, playing with her and sleeping on the couch with her, it was better.


But Jelly hated 3 things. Moving things, dogs, and birds. Anything moving on the path when I took her for a walk she would bite at. I had to give an old man chocolates and flowers as an apology once because she drew blood as he rode by on his bicycle. She would always try and snap at other dogs and never let them near her. Walking her was a pain but I endured it because it's what you do. And birds, she always wanted to chase them. She chased them as far as she could, only letting water and fences stop her. She once ran into busy traffic to get one once. 


None of this behavior ever improved. I tried positive reinforcement, exposure, holding her and finally repremanding. None of it ever worked. She's still like that, to this very day. I can't walk her without her attacking other dogs/bikes/birds that come near us. She's attacked my sister twice in the past week (whom she's lived with all of her life) by biting at her knees in a reaction to her walking past, which she's never done before. She has also started being the same level of aggressive towards cars as well.


In any case, in recent days, she's developed symptoms of dementia. At around 3 in the morning she will start scratching on my door, like she does during thunderstorms. She'll wander aimlessly around the house, slowly moving like she does during thunderstorms. At night, now, she's constantly scared. I lead her outside to do her business at the same times during the night, where she does what she needs to do, and still comes back and scratches at my door. When I let her in, she scratches on my door to be let out. If I leave the door open, she sits there and looks at me. Her sleep/wake cycle has dramatically changed, up all hours of the night (literally) and asleep most of the day. She's peed herself while laying down twice in the last week, and I'm worried about what's going to happen next. This is incredibly frustrating, as there's so little I can do. 


I don't have money and I don't have a job to support her medications/therapy. I walk her every day, she has clean food and water every day, and I don't know what to do. I don't want to go into debt for her, because she's such a ....broken dog. I don't want to have to manage all of this. 


Does that make me a bad person? This has kept my mind occupied all week. My love for her has dwindled in the last 6 months because of how hard it is to walk her, how hard it is to manage her. Am I a bad person for wanting to put her down? Please tell me what you think. 


Thank you.",12Feb2017,15

156,"Hello.

The thing is I searched for a job that at the time seemed pretty good for me, a saler behind counter for a technology store. And after the interviews and everything that goes on while applying for a job I've got the call that the job is mine if I wanted it. And since I haven't had a job yet and everyone asked me about how it went with the interviews, and while I did not think I would get the job, I blindly said ""Yes"" to the job offer without really thinking it hardly through. - My friends and Family is happy &amp; proud over me. But the thing is that now when I know that I'm going to work at this place I realize that it's really not my thing at all and I'm not happy at all over the job and i really regret saying yes for it. 

I'm having panic attacks over this since I'm not quite a strong person mentally and I'm also having anxiety over this. A huge part of me just wants to call the employer and tell him sorry and that I have to withdraw my ""yes"" for the job (it has not started yet and no contract has been signed)
But my family is cheering for me over this in such way as in happy over this and I really don't want to disappoint them, but I also don't want to force myself to do a job I don't want to do. 

Should i call and say that I'm sorry for thanking yes earlier and that I can't start at the work and then make up an excuse to say to my family and friends (because i really don't want to just say that I didn't like the job and neither tell the truth that I'm having panic attacks over the facts about what the service is)

I really want to continue with my internship while looking for a job that really will fit me and that I will look forward to starting. Please give me your thoughts on this.. I'm sorry, also my grammar might not be the best but I hope I made sense. Thanks.

157,"I work at a small accounting firm where status level is blurred, so bear with me.

The co-worker in question is much older than I am. Let's call him Bob. I would guess Bob could be considered a supervisor at best because he sucks terribly at his job but he doesn't know it.

Two days ago, I was walking around the firm asking for assignments and Bob had an assignment for me. Being really new to the firm, I happily accepted the assignment. As I put the information into the tax software, issues arose. I came back to Bob with questions, to which he would criticize me as if I had been in the industry for ten years. I informed him that this is one of my first tax returns and I'm still learning, to which he slightly toned down his snarky attitude. However, upon the next time I visited his office, his snarky attitude was back in full force.

Bob acts like a know-it-all (despite frequently demonstrating that he knows absolutely nothing about the tax law). Most of his recommendations are wrong. I've brought the tax issues that I felt were questionable to a tax manager in the firm, to which the tax manager agreed that this guy has no clue what he's doing. 

Bob has been at the firm much longer than me. I have no clue why they keep him. I did not question it. I simply asked the tax manager to keep this discussion between her and I, especially since I am brand new to the firm, which she agreed to do.

Bob speaks down to me on every interaction and honestly I'm sick of it. The last firm I was at, I also worked under a complete moron who did nothing but speak down to me (actually, that guy was MUCH worse than Bob) and I was let go from that previous firm.

I don't want to go through this hell of working with people that don't make me better.

I don't want to not be experienced enough.

I don't want to be let go of again.

I just want to work hard and learn from people who know what they fuck they are doing.

162,"So I guess some background is needed here: I'm a musician. Been that way since middle school, and although I didn't tell anyone until late high school, I've been certain that it's what I'm meant to do. I know, that sounds corny and possibly immature, but I can't help it. It's a passion of mine that I don't even feel like I can adequately describe. My parents were always supportive of me, and when I went off to college I pursued a degree in music composition.

Side note: I chose the college I went to because there was a girl I liked who went there. Stupidest mistake I've ever made

Anyway, year one goes fine. I start to feel the pressure, however. I start to feel feelings of inadequacy, and it begins to manifest itself as pretty severe depression. About halfway through first semester of my second year, I called my parents and told them I had thought about suicide. They immediately withdrew me from school and took me home, where I spent several months in therapy. After that, I felt reinvigorated, and I was ready to go back, this time pursuing music education.

Long story short, I was lazy. I flunked nearly every class.

My parents said that they would no longer pay for me to go there if I was acting like that. I thought that was extremely reasonable. Contrary to their wishes, instead of moving back home, I got a job and stayed in town, making enough to pay for everything I needed. I am now 21 years old and about 7 months into that pursuit. Despite not being able to save a lot, I have been learning how to work hard, something that my parents have admitted to not teaching me. It has also been a great time to reset, and think about what I want to do next.

Well, here's the problem.

I've been discussing this with my mom on a weekly basis, and although we agree that I should spend a year in community college to boost my GPA, what happens after that is still up in the air. She says that I've always been good at math (true) and that something like computer programming would be something that I'm good at and something that might satisfy my creative drive. Every time I think about it though, I get a horrible sinking feeling. I know that no matter what I choose, I won't have to give up music, but I know that if I stray away from it, even a little, I'll never feel fulfilled. It sickens me to think that this thing which I still consider a huge part of my identity (when people ask me what I do, I still say ""I'm a musician"") might fade into a side project.

Another side note here: I don't care about having a lot of money. If I can pay for lodging and food, I'm good.

It doesn't help that I recently saw La La Land, which features a working jazz pianist following his dreams. I can't help but be called to that life. I know that I don't need a degree to be a working musician, but I don't think I have the skills necessary to make it in the professional world.

So I'll cut to the chase. I want to get a music degree. One last shot. Different school this time, and actually working hard. What happens after that, I don't know. I do know, however, that my mom isn't entirely open to the idea.

So it all boils down to two questions:
1. What do you actually think I should do next? Don't hold back.
2. How can I discuss this inner conflict with my mom? I've never been good at talking about these things.

tl;dr: I want to pursue music career, mom wants computer programming, what do",12Feb2017,1

She was having an o.k. time (she really didn't like how uninformed the locals were or how the crime and drug use was rampant), but it all really ended when she was raped at a party.  She said that it lasted for less than 30 seconds before of her male friends heard her screams and beat the living shit out of that subhuman peice of shit.  The rapist was put to prison, and she moved back home(Texas) without telling anyone the real reason.  It is now 4 years later, and she says that it doesn't bother her since sex wasn't a big deal to her back then (I mostly believe her, but she was raped).  How do I move on without trying to track down her rapist and end him terribly?",12Feb2017,2
168,"Hi, 
I'm 25 and lived with my ex-GF for 5 years. She broke up with me about a month ago and already moved out. The hardest part seems to be over for me and I'm starting to feel really good. I just leveled up my career and try to figure out what i want from life now as all my plans have been thrown overboard.


The thing is.. I could pay for our current flat alone, but its too big for me and my daughter (from another woman before my ex, sleeps at my house on the weekends). I also have two cats, which means I need to get home after work every day to feed them. 
So now I decided to move back to my parents house. They've got a kind of seperate small flat inside their home. The rent would be about a third of my current flat and less then half of what a flat i needed would cost me right now in this area. 


so the benefits would be:

- I can save a lot of money

- would still have money to travel and live life

- I can help my parents financially with the rent

- We can care for each others pets (they have two cats and a dog) when either of us is on vacation

- I can stay after work to go out sometimes

- My daughter loves to be at their house and already has a bedroom there.

- I still have my own flat, it's not like i would live in my old bedroom


These are all logical reasons, why it is a good idea. The only thing that bugs me is, that it doesn't really appeal attractive for my own ego nor a potential new partner to live at my parents house.


Any advice or experiences would be nice to hear.

169,"So I (f/25) have known this guy (24/m) for about 5 years now. He has told me before when we first started hanging out that back in high school (before we really met) he saw me and thought I was attractive. He's in the same friends group.
Through the years he's slightly flirted with me but not too much because we both have dated other people. Recently last year he became single for the first time we have known each other, and i began to sort of think of him as maybe something more.
This summer we were all out at a bar, and he was drunk and sort of flirted with me and touched my face and told me I looked good, but i didn't know what to do so i acted awkward and later that night he picked up a girl(26/f) and they are now dating. Fast forward to a few months later and we were all out again at a bar, his girlfriend wasn't there, and he was drunk and flirting with me again, and i flirted back this time. He said ""I love you... as much as i can) just saying weird things, and later in the night he re brought up seeing me in high school thinking i was cute. He also drove me home that night. That has been it. the next time i saw him he was with his girlfriend at his house and i felt really awkward.
Part of me thinks he likes me but i haven't given him any signs of interest and now he's in a relationship and i lost my chance. Im just very confused, but I know theres really not much I can do now that he's with someone and probably happy. He also texted me happy birthday and that he hoped I had a great time.

172,"I just got a new Vacuum Cleaner and I Vacuumed my apartment with it. It cleaned up the bits of dirt and large dust balls well enough. I had to go over them several times, but they got sucked up there.

The problem is, when I shine a white light over the floor of my apartment, there is a thin layer of particles and dust all over it. This is not visible in normal lighting, just white light shined at an angle. Further more, some layers of dust that have coated my furniture are not sucked up by the vacuum when I over them with it. 

I don't think it's a suction problem, because it seems to have fine suction, but i've never used a Vacuum Cleaner before, so I don't know if this is normal or not.

174,"Before I say what I need help with, I need to vent. 1st, how I wish I had found this subreddit sooner and 2nd, anxiety sucks. 

Ok, now to the matter in hand. I have a crush on this guy who doesn't know me very well, and we live in different countries. Six months ago, he didn't even know who I was, and I knew about him but felt nothing special. Then I came to know more about his personality, his past and his dreams and *BAM*, I was swept off my feet.

I thought hard about how to approach him, and decided to do it through Facebook. I sent him a message saying how he seemed like an interesting guy and asking if it was OK for us to talk. I added him, but only so he'd get the notification and look into his 'hidden' inbox (where messages from non-friends go). After seeing he had had activity on Facebook and hadn't accepted nor deleted the friendship request, I removed it (while he did have foreign friends, they were few and I wasn't sure if it was OK to just add him like that). A few days later he sees my message and we start talking. We chatted for about a month, but the conversation eventually died out, our time zones were too different and while he was nice the entire time, he didn't say much (neither do I, usually, but I was trying hard with him lol). I don't blame him though. I'm sure we have similar tastes and personalities, but I just can't express myself properly over Messenger and show him that, and obviously he had no reason to be interested in someone he knew nothing about. 

So I tried to move on and 'forget' all of it until I was able to meet him in person and strike a conversation (I've had plans to move to his country way before this entire thing started anyway). But I was thinking about it today, and not being as anxious as I was back then, I realized how dumb of me it was to remove the friend request. I could at least have added him again while we were talking. That way, even after we stopped talking, he would still see some of my activity and little by little, he'd naturally get to know more about me and maybe find me interesting. He could even know about it when I move to his country and that could be an excuse to start another conversation, asking for tips and whatnot. I know that many of his Facebook friends are just acquaintances (I may have looked around a bit lol), so thinking back I believe he would have accepted the friendship request back then. 

My question is, is it too late to add him now? Will it seem creepy? Or is it better to do as I thought before, to just wait until I move to his country? 

**TL;DR:** 6 months ago, I talked to this guy on Facebook for one month (meaning we last talked 5 months ago), but I didn't add him as a friend. I have a massive crush on him. Should I add him now or is it too late? I think that maybe if he could see my posts, we could have at least an acquaintance-level relationship, and not this one-sided thing that's been going on for months. But I'm worried it would be creepy as hell, to let him know that I still think about him. 

Feel free to ask for further info.

EDIT: Or maybe I could add him on another social media, like Instagram, although I'm not sure he'd follow me back. ",12Feb2017,1
175,"I'm 17, senior in high school and never dated. I go to a huge school and moved here a couple years ago so I don't really put myself out there too much, I'm generally quiet. There's been quite a few guys in the past who have either 1, hit me up on social media that have seen me in school to talk to me on there or 2, straight up approached me or told a friend about me. The thing is, all the guys that have done so said like ""oh I'd tap her"", and I was talking to this one guy from my school that added me on snapchat who would say very disrespectful things to me like ""we'd have to have sex before dating to see if I'm good at it"" and asked for nudes-he was very cocky, or I'm just straight up not into the guy. I feel lonely for not dating any guy when there's tons to choose from, but I just haven't come across one I really like and it makes me upset- especially me being a shy girl. This one guy said he saw me in the halls and said he thinks I'm beautiful and stuff and another one came to my job and talked to me in the halls asking for my number. Me being nice, I gave it to him but just wasn't attracted to him whatsoever.Plus, since my school is big (3200 kids approximately) I hear constant stories about my guys cheating on their girlfriends, and I just don't want to go through that, feeling like I'm not good enough when I already feel that way about myself. What do I do? I'm not going away for college, I'm going to community college due to financial reasons. Will I meet guys there ? It's just annoying that all of my friends have their guys or have had and I have not. I choose this but it's only because I want something that is real and a guy to respect me but still have an attraction towards  him. I've been told by friends i seem picky when it comes to what I think is attractive in a guy, but like I said I just want something real and I don't know if I could ever date someone or do anything with a guy I'm not 100% into, that's just not who I am.

181,"Hey everyone, I've never posted here before but I am really having a crisis about where to go with my life.

My husband and daughter and I live in a medium sized city in the Southeast. We're very progressive and creative and have never felt we belonged here. However, my parents are older I'm the only child. I feel like I need to stay close. I can't decide how close.

We didn't feel we belonged here BEFORE the election. We are afraid and sickened now. We don't believe people should die or go bankrupt because they can't afford astronomical healthcare. Ideologically, we love Canada. However, I loathe the cold and am miserable here, where the average winter day is 45 degrees, about half the year. I long for the beach literally everyday and want to live a life where I see it often. 

But then, we feel like we ought to start working towards putting down roots in Canada or somewhere we respect and soon, while we are younger and employment is easier to find. But I hate the cold. My dad gets distraught if I even mention moving 6 hours away to the beach.

I'm talking in circles here because this is my train of thought. I am having a very difficult time here because I can't seem to find a clear answer. We will be getting some extra cash back from our taxes soon, and our lease is up, so I am feeling hard-pressed to make some decisions soon. 

If you've read this far I truly appreciate it and would love insight from someone maybe a little older who has made a similar decision.

TLDR: Need to decide soon whether to stay in a Southeast city near my elderly, poor parents where we do not fit in at all and I hate the winters, or move to a beach where I would be so happy and a day's drive to home, or start working on relocating to Canada where we ideologically fit in but I would be miserable in the cold and leave my parents",12Feb2017,2

On the flip side of this, one of my best friends of several years has an opening in his apartment and wanted to know if I wanted to join. I would again be moving somewhere that has his furniture and everything already there, cutting out the necessity of me having to buy my own (which is nice but also sucks in a way). 

It would be way cheaper (by almost 350 dollars), and it is significantly closer to work, but I would again be in a situation where I'm sharing space with someone.

186,"So a backstory to the relationship, and I have asked her her side as well and they seem to agree with mine. But basically we were a very very strong couple. Both of us were the happiest we had ever been. We never or rarely fought. There were very little compromises since we agreed on a lot and had very similar interests. We talked all the time and always put the other first. I know for a fact that in September she was still very very much in love with me and wanted nothing more than me in her life. And yes she thinks we were perfect and I was the best thing to ever happen to her.

Now the confusing part. She states sometime in October things just didn't feel right. I've been trying to understand what that was but she says she doesn't know just how she felt. She ended up finding someone else she never met online and moved to Florida to be with him in January. I've been still trying to understand what went wrong and why things didn't work. Like what did I do wrong or what was the reason we weren't compatible. Cause still in my mind besides those last few months where things got a bit stale everything was amazing. We were always laughing, still showing each other how much we cared all these things. It was very very strong and to anyone who ever saw our relationship they would peg us as being together for a long long time. Most people were envious of our relationship because of how strong it was.

Now that she left and yes we were living together for two years. I'm utterly confused. To me things just ending for no reason other than it didn't feel right seems off. I waited for a month to resume communication with her to get more perspective and she still gives me the same story. No problems everything was greats just the relationship was off in October and she was done.

Is that how things end? Just they end because they end? That doesn't make any sense to me. I feel like I messed up but don't understand how... I'm utterly confused.",12Feb2017,2

The difference is P seems to say it out of caring, C seems to say it out of malice. C often says things directly and indirectly to me with the purpose of putting me down (calling me a bitch, implying that I'm lazy since I often work from home, etc). P never tells C to apologize to me, defends me, or ever tells C what to do in general. P accuses me of instigating with C when I stand up against her shit. C will recall certain things I said or did and spin it to make me look like an asshole. Most recently she said that when I talk about my ex to her, I make my ex seem like a victim, but when I talk about my ex to P, I make myself seem like a victim. This is pure bullshit because I know I've told C about times when my ex wronged me, and I've told P about times when I've wronged my ex (no sugar coating here, I'm talking about I told her about when I punched my ex-girlfriend and how it was the shittiest thing I've done). But when C told P this, P had a ""dawning moment"" of realizing what a manipulator I am. P swings back and forth between viewing me as one of her best friends, and viewing me as a manipulator though I've never lied to her or desired to control her.

She told me her and her husband have an ""agreement"" as she has bisexual tendencies. I explained me and my partner are monogamous and as flattered as I was, nothing could happen. Anyway, we talked in depth and she said some really lovely things to me and things ended really nicely. We exchanged numbers. 

Thing is now, I would really like to be friends with her - we were so similar and really clicked it seems so sad not to try and be friends - but I don't know how or if it's possible after everything that got said. Can I text her and say ""I had a great time and I want to be in touch and be friends"" or is that weird? I just don't want there to be a chance of her thinking I want more... or I don't want her to feel embarrassed or awkward. Or is this one I will just have to write off as not possible? Help!!!

202,"Scenario is this. I have a work car that I can use within my 9-5 shift. I used the car in the weekend for outside of work purposes and now I've smashed the rear windscreen (nothing else though). So I can't just say I've smashed it because I was driving it when I wasn't mean to.

I was thinking of calling in tomorrow and saying that the car had been broken into and the rear windscreen was smashed. Is this a good idea?",12Feb2017,1
204,"I do not love my husband. I don't think I ever have.  

We started dating a few months after I was dumped by someone I did love. It was a tumultuous five year relationship. We had started dating when I was 18.  

I was lost and alone. I did not intend to jump into a long-term relationship, but I didn't want to be lonely either. Which is when B showed up. We hit it off pretty quickly. He had been with a lot of women for various lengths of time and wasn't looking for a romantic relationship, but he almost immediately fell for me.  

I decided to give it a chance and see where things would go. We got along fine, so it was nice having someone to do things with and feel cared for. But he was jealous, moody, and dramatic. It quickly became overwhelming and I broke up with him a few months later.  

We remained friends. He was depressed and spiraling out of control. I felt obligated to be there for him and I still cared about him.  

A few months later, he hit a rough spot and ended up moving into a spare room in my apartment, and our relationship went back to being as if we were dating. He treated me well, cared for me immensely, and I felt like I would be stupid for not giving him another chance.  

Things went well for a while. We started talking about having a kid and getting married after a year. I didn't feel like anyone else would ever love me, I really wanted a nuclear lifestyle, and so I settled.  

We got pregnant quickly. Then we immediately got engaged. I had a rough pregnancy and both the baby and I nearly died.  

Six months after she was born, we got married.  

During the time I was pregnant, he would have tantrums that lead to him yelling at me for hours and being generally emotionally abusive. I didn't want to be there, but I felt trapped. I had moved out of my apartment, we were looking for a house, and we were staying with his parents. I had nothing going for me.  

I resolved myself to trying to be happy and make the best of it.  

He quit drinking when I got pregnant, and after the traumatic pregnancy, he quit wanting to do anything fun besides travelling to a few towns over for a night or going to the same town for vacation with his family.  

Fast forward a few years, and the tantrums kept getting worse. Sometimes they were arguments and sometimes they were just fits of him yelling and me crying. They would always devolve into him threatening to divorce me and take our kid away. They never lead to real physical violence, but he has unlocked my bathroom door and pushed me into a wall while I was trying to keep it shut because he wasn't done yelling at me. He's thrown things near me, but not at me. He's hit the wall, but not my body. He's grabbed my arms, but only once was it enough to leave bruises. He'll turn the lights on and rip off my covers if he's angry and I have broken down into crying and not wanting to have to respond anymore in the bed. 

After the first few times he brought up divorce as a threat, I stopped being invested emotionally. Any love that I had tried to cultivate ceased.  

We have been living in a home that is in mine and one of my relative's names for the last five years. Our kid is almost five.  

I am not happy. He is ""protective"" which means that if I want to go anywhere, it must be someplace very boring and safe and at a ""safe"" time. Rush hour is not safe. After dark is not safe. I only have one friend at this point, and going to her house or out with her anywhere other than a retail store during the day is not safe.  

He has no interest in doing anything I want to do. I want to go camping and hiking. I want to go back to one of my favorite bars for an evening of light drinking and conversation (even if he doesn't want to drink). I want to go to an amusement park. I want to go to concerts, even if they're just our friends' local bands. I want to be able to suggest driving two hours away to my family's house for dinner and a visit. I want to go for a walk at the local park for exercise.  

If it involves alcohol (some of my family members are alcoholics), then he says, ""That's all you ever want to do. You're just like ______. You can't have fun without going to a bar."" We haven't been to a bar in over five years. If I drink at home, it is one or two drinks every few weeks.  

We can't go to local concerts because ""We will only talk to each other anyway, so why can't we just do that here?""  

I have never had many friends to begin with, but he used to be extremely popular. Very few of his friends even keep in contact with him anymore. Several who were extremely close have distanced themselves completely, almost to the point of no contact, in the last few years. Even his mother has seen his anger and general shittiness and I have even, in time of great distress, told her that I didn't think I wanted to be with him anymore and she said she could see why and would support me if I chose not to.   

Now he accuses me of cheating on him. Yesterday, our kid said in front of us, out of the blue, ""Mommy, I wish you didn't have to work on your computer all of the time."" I used to be an online student, but I haven't picked up my computer in days. That immediately set off my anxiety, because I just knew he was going to accuse me of talking to someone online. I have not cheated. And I don't think he has either. But then, he had to get up early for work this morning, fell asleep early without plugging in his phone or setting his alarm, so I was plugging in his phone for him. He woke up when I picked it up and started sleepily accusing me of going through his phone. I was standing right next to him, I was trying to find his clock app, and I gave it to him when he woke up so he could just set it. He said I didn't set the alarm, so what was I doing? I explained exactly what had happened and he didn't accept it. He probably will say that he doesn't remember that happening if we talk about it today.  

I have depression issues and have developed a lot of anxiety in the last few years. I am constantly walking on eggshells around him and feel relief when he is at work. But he finds time to call me multiple times throughout the day to see what I'm doing. If I say I'm cleaning, and then he comes home and I haven't cleaned the house enough, I have been wasting my time. If I say that I'm just being lazy, he brings it up when he starts fights and tells me that I'm a lazy pos, pathetic, and a bad parent.  

I am so unhappy. I've had insomnia all of my life, but lately, even when exhausted, I can't fall asleep because I start daydreaming about what my life would be like if I could just be alone. I could reorganize my house without getting in trouble for moving his stuff. I could get rid of the junk that's piled up everywhere because he's a lazy hoarder. I could eat healthy food and diet successfully without having someone eating candy and icecream right next to me. I could go to the grocery store at 10pm. I could go to concerts. I could have friends, even if they didn't meet his standards. I could invite my family over for the heck of it. I could get a job.  

I broke down last week and told him that *I* wanted a divorce. He flipped out and told our kid that *I* was moving out but then also that they were going to go stay with his parents. He told me he was going to make my life hell. That I would be allowed to see our kid when he deemed it was appropriate and convenient. He called me a cunt. He said I wanted out just so I could live at the bar.  

He stayed and yelled at me for an hour or so, got to work late, and eventually calmed down and called me to talk rationally. He asked why I could possibly want to leave, and every time I gave him a legitimate reason, he countered it with why I was ungrateful and stupid. Eventually, he said he wanted me to at least try going to couseling with him, because he realized that he wasn't perfect, but that I clearly needed to see a therapist for my depression because that was what he thinks is the cause for my unhappiness.  

I caved. I said okay. I was gaslighted, scared, powerless, and hopeless.  

I've been trying to pretend things are okay since then, but they aren't. I try to enjoy the few moments when we are watching a show together and can laugh at the same thing. But, in the end, I can't stand 90% of him. I'm not attracted to him physically, and certainly not emotionally. Not even just personally. He can't stand anyone who isn't like him. The show we've been watching has an interracial couple, and every time they come on, he says it's disgusting. They also just had a scene with a lesbian couple, and he said, ""Of course. They always have to include shit like this."" (But he'd be totally fine with us having my girl friend involved in our sex life.)  

We have so little in common.  

Additionally, he constantly wants to have sex, but I am not ever in the mood because of the above reasons, so he guilts me into it or pouts and starts a fight. In our time together, I think I have successfully refused him twice, but I still had to deal with him falling asleep angry.  

I have felt for years that he is just obsessed with me versus in love with me. But he is clinging on for dear life. He does nice things for me (like buying me a food item I like randomly or buying me gifts that are too expensive when we are already struggling for money on the holidays). And I appreciate those gestures so much. They are part of why I feel so guilty for being unhappy.  

And that's what this boils down to. I feel guilty. I feel guilty for ""leading him on"" years ago and letting things go so far. I feel guilty for having a baby with him. I feel guilty for the idea of putting our kid through a divorce. I feel guilty knowing that I will have to let our kid go with him, at least at first, to avoid whatever I can, including emotional damage to her. I feel guilty for being depressed. I feel guilty for not being able to just take prozac and pretend that everything is fine.  

So what I originally came here to ask the universe is this:  
Am I being selfish? Am I being stupid? Do I need to try counseling, even though I know I don't love him and I know that there are so many issues that are unresolvable? Am I right or am I wrong?  

Also, if I did get the courage and tenacity to leave, how the hell am I going to make it happen? How can I get him to let go? How am I going to know that my kid and I are safe? How am I going to take care of myself? How will I deal with the loneliness? How will I deal with the guilt?  

I know that my life would be better alone, just like I know my life would be better if I lost 50 lbs. Both of those things may be a distant memory, but I just know they felt better than *this*.  

  

I welcome any advice, support, questions, etc. I have no one to talk to about this other than people who are very biased (my family). I have no health insurance or money, so I can't really find a therapist for myself to talk this over with. More than anything, I guess I just needed to get this off my chest... Just hoping he won't find it somehow and give me hell for this too...  

TLDR I am unhappy. I think this could be considered an emotionally abusive relationship. I feel guilty for wanting to leave. Not sure how, either. We have a kid and I am the only one of the two of us whose name is on the paperwork for our house. I can't see myself living this way for the rest of my life, but I have no idea what to do with that information.

206,"The time is ticking, I have until the end of August at which time my fiance will give birth. I have been working in North Dakota oil fields since December 2012. I have been through the downturn in oil prices and been with 4 different companies doing the same thing, Crude by rail. My company just went bankrupt and is being acquired by a much larger conglomerate. Both me and my fiance work in the same town which is 70 miles each way from our home. I feel like I have put many years into these jobs to get the position I currently have. Its not really hard or dangerous but still involves being exposed to crude oil. We found out we are pregnant in November, we are excited by the way. My fiance is from an Alaska village and suggested we move to Anchorage since she has much family there. The thinking is they will be able to help with childcare and such. My fiance also speaks a native language so she said she could find work with a customer service job that deals with the villages since she is bilingual. I hear the job market is tough in Anchorage since the price of oil is down everywhere. I am all for the move because I don't like North Dakota, its really remote. Anchorage has everything I could ever want in a city. My biggest concern is I wont be able to make oilfield money in Anchorage and the rent prices are really high there. From my past few visits I feel like it is a city I could very much love and enjoy for many years. I have been trying to transition away from North Dakota but haven't had the push to. I would like to maybe get in on a apprenticeship program of some sort. I have an associates degree in liberal arts but haven't seen it get my any extra attention when applying for jobs.

219,"So I'm a pretty scrawny dude. I used to go to the gym regularly from 2014-2015 at my subdivision's club because it was never really packed.

The member of my family spoke to him and he pretty much said he'd be able to help me out. So, I go to the interview and I don't get a call back. I answered questions to the best of my ability but I was extremely nervous.

I go to the store to do some shopping a few days later and run into the GM. He asked me if I had heard back and gotten a second interview and I said no. He said if I didn't hear back by a certain day for me to go in and talk to him.

The same day, I got a generated thanks but no thanks email; I am assuming the other manager who did the interview send it but the next day I got a call for a second interview!

**A bit more background on what happened:** I got to work and clocked in on time, got my drivers bank, and took a delivery. As I returned from my delivery and was putting myself back into the system our shift manager comes over to where the drivers are congregated and proceeds to loudly announce that there is only one delivery on the screen and we need to find something to do. I walked back to the dish tank to check if there were dishes already back there, there were maybe 3 small containers basically nothing. 


So I grabbed a broom and headed to the make line area to do a quick sweep because well it was obvious it hadn't been done in a while. There was one order now on the screen and I was just causally sweeping minding my own business trying to stay busy. In the process of me grabbing the broom and walking to the front someone had taken a single stack of pans to the dish tank (approx 5 mins to do) I hadn't even seen them do it. But as I'm sweeping my shift manager turns around and codscendingly says: ""don't you think it'd be better to work on dishes than sweep while we're busy? Like doesn't that make sense?"" I just glanced at the screen, 1 pizza, 1 dessert, 1 sandwhich. So yeah pretty slammed.



 So I'm basically getting attacked verbally by this woman and decide that I should set up a meeting with my General Manager as he is the one who is really in charge of the place, I respect her position as shift manager don't get me wrong but I'm not gonna talk to her about my problem because my problem is her now! So as I am sending my general manager a text she comes storming over and says ""if you want to talk to someone you talk to me"", I said ""you're yelling at me, you told me to find something to do there were like 3 dishes so I started sweeping"". She said ""another driver brought back a stack of pans"" I said ""sorry I didn't see that and there weren't any back there when I checked""  she then told me to get my stuff from my 1 delivery and go home. I don't even think I did anything wrong but now I'm in trouble and get to lose out on hours and wages? 




I just need some advice on how to proceed because she called the general manager and said I have a bad attitude and stuff like that when really I don't at all. I even had a co worker come up to me last night and ask why she ""was being such a bitch to me"". ",12Feb2017,37

Is it strange that a game like this can cause addiction?

He is so obsessed with the game he's even had bad hygiene and sits in his boxer shorts playing the game.
