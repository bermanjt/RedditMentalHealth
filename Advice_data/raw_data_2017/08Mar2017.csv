1,Guys. I literally have no money. My parents cut me off last week and my first paycheque doesn't come for another week. I've eaten my way through my groceries. How do I make 50$ dollars within the next day?? I don't want to borrow from my friends because I won't be able to pay them back. What do I do??,08Mar2017,2
2,"I am restarting my old diet and am concerned with some issues I have been having.

To start out I will describe my weekly exercise routine. I try to exercise every day for at least an hour and half or more. When I exercise I warm up on a treadmill doing one mile at jog pace so a 10:00 minute to 11:00 warm up mile. After the warm up jog on the treadmill I move into some free weights and machines. I'm not into increasing my muscle size and more into just toning out and improving my run times and losing some weight. So when it comes to weights I just do weights that are slightly hard but not straining to cause pain to my muscles.

On off days where I feel the need to do cardio I run a two mile route at somewhat of a race pace. I enjoy pushing myself when it comes to progress and have noticed definite success by my improving running times.

The issue is I feel like I'm not balancing my exercise and my dieting correctly. I have tried to cut down unnecessary meals and unhealthy snacks, but if I do have to snack I try to limit them or have healthy snacks as an alternative.

Today I ran my normal two mile route but I throughout the whole day I felt down and gloomy. I have no reason to feel that way. I am healthy and my current status is good as well. I have people who care about me family and friends but I just can't shake the feeling of feeling down.

Going back to my diet. For breakfast today I planned on getting as much in me to keep me awake and having enough energy later in the day to workout. My breakfast was a cup of orange juice, toasted bagel with cream cheese, bowl of frosted flakes and a cup of coffee in which I only drank half and dumped the rest to not have the crash during work. I had this breakfast at 5:00 a.m. before I leave to work at 6:00 a.m.

For lunch I made a tuna sandwich, and some cheesy hash browns (homemade) and a glass of milk. This was two hours before my run. Best not to run right after eating.

For dinner I am making Spaghetti with a small chicken breast. On the spaghetti I'm having olive oil and Greek seasoning. Somewhat of an Italian pasta recipe I made up because I'm trying to save money for rent and other expenses. Also I'm single and live alone so there is that. So I'm still keeping my intake normal.

I try to leave my daily intake to 3 meals a day also including small healthy snacks.

I am asking if my diet is causing me to be depressed and if diets can cause people to feel depressed.

Should I increase my calorie intake in the mornings, at lunch or dinner? I feel like dinner would just cause me to feel more sluggish and worse off.

If there is one thing I know is I can't just stop eating all together and it will make it far worse, but I don't think what I'm doing now is causing it.

I have ran into depression before and was prescribed anti-depressants and am hoping it's not a mixture of my new diet.

For my body type: I am 5 foot 3 inches. I weight 193 pounds and a pretty muscular body tone. I have around a 32-33 inch waist line and a little cushion around my belly and waste but am currently working on it. I run my two mile at an average 19-22 minutes. I used to be able to run a 5k at a 25 minute 27 minute pace. Now I don't try to do 5k but I'd say it'd be around 30 minutes now. Maybe later I'll try a serious 5k and make it a goal to improve my time, but for now I'm just focusing on dieting and losing some fat and gaining muscle tone.

Currently I'm concerned my diet and exercise is effecting my mental health as well. I have just assumed I increase my carbohydrate intake but would like some external advice as well.

Thank you!

3,"I really don't know if I should post this on a place like this but I just don't know where to go or start. Mostly because of the fact that this stuff is personal for her but sometimes I believe we should reach out for others when they can't reach out themselves. So anyway here it goes. My fiancee is dealing with depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. I want to help her as much as I can and I sit and listen to everything she tries to tell me and trust me it's hard to keep up when you have ADHD and Aspergers. She feels like she is controlled by her family. I tell her that she is not. Well, what I meant is that they do try and control but that doesn't mean she is actually controlled and she still has free will. She desperately wants free will and to be free to choose whatever she wants but since I'm the only one trying to convince her otherwise she has trouble believing me. Both of us are Christians but sometimes she doesn't have faith. I do look at the situation in many ways. I see how her parents act and I do believe they are very controlling but I don't believe they are evil parents. She tends to believe they are. She won't accept my input and because I have different input she believes that I may be just like them and think how they do which is completely controlling and that I want everything bad to happen for her when I have proven time and again that I love her and want what is best for her. I'd rather her parents and her reconcile and have a good relationship because you never know when you or they are going to die. I know schizophrenia can cause you to believe that the entire world is against you. I think it would help to have others to agree that treating people good is right and people around the world are not under her parents influence which she believes her parents have that kind of reach which is ridiculous in my opinion but I still don't want to make her feel like her emotions aren't valid. So I would like to help but I have no idea where to go from here.",08Mar2017,1
4,"My mom grew up in a severely abusive household, raised by two violent alcoholics. Her father was a schizophrenic recidivist and her brother threatened her life.

She was fine my whole childhood. A great parent, gave us so much time and attention and love and all that. She and my dad were divorced in 2008 due to allegations of abuse, but none that I ever had any proof of. She has no family and very few friends, only one of which is really more than a friendly acquaintance.

At that time, she changed significantly almost overnight. When I say ""us"" I mean my sister and I.

* She displayed narcissistic tendencies, talked ""at us"" rather than ""to us"" never really letting anyone get a word in edgewise.

* She frequently criticizes and nags us

* She makes the same point over and over and over, talking in circles. 

* She had a boyfriend for about a year and a half shortly after the divorce, but they broke up and she has not been in a relationship since.

* She goes on dates but finds something wrong with every one. Sometimes they're just weirdos, but sometimes it seems like a Seinfeld-level of depth for ending it.

* She never drank as kids but has picked it back up. 

* She got a DUI but was let off fairly easy since she was pulled over on the way home to sober up.

* She got a second DUI, and got house arrest, license suspension, and lots of required classes and fines. After this, she swore she'd never drink again but went back to it a few weeks later.

* She has mentioned suicidal thoughts once or twice, but when my sister and I demanded she get help she said it was in the heat of the moment and that she doesn't mean it. I guess I believe her, but you can't be too careful and I worry more about it now than I did then.

* She frequently says that she is lonely, has nothing to look forward to, and that her life sucks.

The part of this situation that has me deciding that it's time to take serious action is her recent behavioral changes (last few months to a year). She will enter these states that I wouldn't call fugue, but where she seems extremely drunk (nodding off, eyes closed, frozen in whatever activity she was performing, unresponsive). This will occur minutes after she seemed fine and sober, maybe after half a mixed drink. She will snap out of it sometimes, other times she ends up falling asleep on the couch or on the stairs.

I may remember more and add it later, but this should illustrate the issue I'm stuck with here. I'm the older sibling and I won't have my sister stuck trying to solve this, so I need to know how to proceed. My tentative plan was to see campus counseling (since I'm a college student) and see what they can offer, but anything else would be immensely appreciated.

I'm worried about her but I work full time and am a full time student who lives miles away, so my ability to help is limited. Her bizarre behavior (which may or may not be attributed to drinking) is so abstract and difficult to substantiate beyond anecdotes is frustrating.",08Mar2017,3

8,"My wife and I would love to have kids. We are both 30 years old and all our friends have already had children. My wife is all for it. She has no reservations at all. I, on the other hand, do. It's not that I fear I couldn't be a good father. I actually think I would be pretty good at it.

My biggest fear is money or, more specifically, the lack thereof. We both have steady paying jobs that pay the bills, however, we have debt. Cars that need to be paid off, a credit card with a balance, and a personal loan 4 years from being paid off. We also currently rent our home. I feel like we should worry about getting a home of our own first and getting some of the other debt paid down before jumping into children. On the other hand, neither one of us are getting any younger. My main concern is if I can actually afford children. I don't like taking help from family and don't want to be that kind of guy. I want to raise my own family and be a provider. My wife won't be able to work if we have kids because we won't be able to afford childcare. I don't think I could afford to raise a family on my current salary. That's why I want to focus on getting a better job and home before jumping into having children.

When I ask my family and friends about it, a large majority say, ""Just do it. Everything else will work itself out."" or ""Once you have children everything changes and new motivations take over and get you where you need to be."". I guess part of my hesitation comes from the fact that I always envisioned my life going a certain way, having a certain order to it. Now, I see that the timeline I had in mind is shrinking faster than I can keep up.

I guess the advice I need is: Is there ever a ""right"" time to have kids? Perhaps I should just have kids and let things run their natural course.",08Mar2017,2

12,"Me and a couple of other people drive together to go to a sports center, and it started with one person driving me and another to the facility, with me providing the ride to go back. Recently, while I provided the ride, the one person in question quickly got another ride, even though it was agreed that I was providing it. With me feeling bad seeing as I made a family member drive ALL the way to pick us up. I took that personally, especially since they weren't fully respectful even when I provided the ride, lingering a bit too long, etc. Well I decided not to ride with them to the facility, but that day when it came time to go back I put it out there that they can ride with me back home, they agreed. Today, I was invited to ride with them to go to the facility, I was a bit hesitant since I already told myself that I would try to be as independent as possible to prevent any more awkward situations. Nevertheless I agreed, and when the time to leave came I overheard another person ask for something along the lines of a ride. I kept quiet, and right before leaving one of the people I usually ride with asked me about another person coming along, I gently broke it to them that I was unable to provide for that, I have to rush back as quick as possible, scheduled reasons. They explained that the person was going to be dropped off in the same place as they were, I agreed, and when we were going to the car, they...started lingering again. I guess it must have slipped my mind because they asked once more about the ride situation, I replied with the first reply I made earlier, my strict schedule, etc. They got a bit angry, replied that they were being dropped in the same area that I usually drop them off at, etc. I apologized, citing my lack of remembering, they (the person requesting a ride) held on to their anger and refused. While the normal carpool member was quick to dial and get a new ride. It hit me that this was such a trivial argument and I quickly left....

My question is.. did I do anything wrong here?
If so, how can I mend these relationships? If not, how can I slowly cut them out seeing as I'll have to see them on a regular basis?

13,"My trash service is not the usual weekly curbside pickup, instead I have a 2 yard dumpster that gets emptied twice a month. For the most part this is actually quite convenient except for I keep having animals jump in it and rip up the trash and drag it out.

Even a cinder block got thrown off by the wind. There is no way to lock, or chain the lids down with this particular dumpster. I'm completely out of ideas on how to deal with this. Any advice or ideas on how to deal with this? Thanks.

15,"This is not one of those deep, philosophical or painful issues we usually see posted here. More lighthearted. I'm just looking for people to help me think this through, people that aren't emotionally involved. Honestly, it's a great problem to have. I'm not looking for sympathy. Just logical and rational thinkers to help me find the way to an answer.

I am a single woman without kids around 40. I am currently debating between two very different job offers. I currently live in California. My hobbies are scuba diving, motorcycling, water sports like swimming and sailing, flying seaplanes, hiking, and being outdoors.

The first job is here, in the bay area. I wouldn't have to move, though I've been here 14 years and like the idea of leaving. The pay is great. Would allow me to pay off my debt in about a year, and start saving. The schedule is rough. Only six days guaranteed off per month. Gone for long periods of time (I'm a pilot, if that isn't obvious). I have cats. I like them. 

The future of said job would see great increases in income. In 6 months to a year I could see $30K more in salary if I upgrade. I could move to LA with the job, too, which isn't here. But it's LA.

The second is in Hawaii. Cost of living is higher where I am now, but it's pretty sixes. It would mean a substantial cut in pay (Around $40K). But, off at least 10 days a month, home every night (flying around the islands). 

There are a million other variables that go beyond the scope. Basically, the way I see it is the decision is between living in a fantasy land but living on ramen or living in a slightly less fantasy land (to me) but building retirement. 

One is safe. Secure. I don't have to uproot or move. Financial security. Friends. Foundation. The other is a dream come true, if I can survive.

So basically, i'm 18 right now and I am very picky when it comes to finding a part-time job. The reason why I want a part-time job is because I want to buy clothes, nothing else. Luckily my parents have been saving up my tuition since I was born.

Anyway, I had a bad experience when I was working at this restaurant that prevent me from getting out there and trying a new job. To give an idea, the customers were nice, but the employees and managers kept yelling at me and it was de-motivating especially with all the stuff I was going through, it made me quite depressed so to say. Not exaggerating either, because the things I was going through plus stress from the job it didn't add up to happiness. (The employees were in their 40's and above, only young one their)

So now, I am unemployed and I am trying to seek employment but it always scares me at the back of my mind of how it felt while working at the restaurant and I don't want to go through that feeling again.

Bad experience from a recent job makes me prevent myself from choosing a job. Thus, causing me to be picky to the point where I overthink and not choose one anyway.

25,"I am an emotional wreck lately because the guy I've been seeing for 4 months has suddenly stopped talking to me and he now has been ignoring my texts and calls for 2 weeks. I feel a bit crazy and I do have severe anxiety, but I don't understand why this is happening to me. Before he cut of communication everything was going well with us but he had shared with me that he felt a bit hazy and depressed. We have had insane chemistry since the beginning and he tells me that he'd do anything for me and that he loves everything about me, and how happy I make him. I try not to stress him out, but he has always gone above and beyond for me, and I for him. Before this event happened I was considering telling him that I was falling in love with him, and I genuinely felt that he was too from just the things he would say and how he would look and hold me. Overall he'd been a great partner but around February he got a bit freaked out and withdrawn previously because he texted me and said that everything with us was going too well and he wasn't sure that he was ready for how serious the relationship seemed to be getting, and that he was frightened because our bond to each other was strong.When I talked to him in person he said he didn't remember saying that and that he felt content and comfortable in our relationship as long as we kept going at a steady non stressful pace. I am 18 and he is 20 and we go to different colleges. The last time we hung out he was sort of in a weird state but when we were texting again he seemed back to normal. It started off with him apologizing for being busy when he would leave my texts unanswered and then one day he just never responded or read my texts at all via iMessage. I've called and texted him several times, spacing out days between reaching out but still nothing. So the other day I went to his apartment to try to talk to him in person and his car was there but his roommate knocked on his door and there was no answer. I sat in the car, and a few minutes later I saw a bunch of his guy friends come up to their building and they went inside but soon after they left after about 10 minutes. People often come to his place randomly unannounced to work on music or chill so I am still unsure of whether he was there or not. I left a note in his car seat through the crack of the window just explaining my feelings of anxiety and confusion and how this is affecting me and that I hoped that something was not seriously wrong and I still haven't heard back. Today while I was at the airport I texting him saying that it was clearly obvious that he didn't give a f*** about me and that we would have to talk eventually because we have each other stuff. And he immediately read it and then didn't reply. This is the first time he has ready my messages in 2 weeks but when I sent a follow up right after it only says delivered.

28,"Dear Reddit, I would like to ask for some advice.

Context: I have heavy bipolar disorder. Along with the attention deficits and moods pretty much exclusively being in the extremes (giddy, furious, hopeless), I also have anxiety. It's come to the point where I have become agoraphobic, becoming less and less able to leave the house:

I struggle if I throw out the trash. I run back to the door if I have to get the mail. I panic and throw a fit if I'm asked to go grocery shopping.

I am worried I won't be able to attend a close friend's wedding on the 25th of this month. A friend of 14 years. Transportation alone (a train ticket) would be more than I have in the bank (no car/license). Naturally, finding employment has been very difficult this past year. Three banks calling for overdue payments, credit always tanking. Etc. 

---------------------------------------------------------

I have been assessing ways to get out of this mess: 

To address the agoraphobia, maybe slow steps will bring me back up to leaving the house by the time of the wedding. I'm praying by the end of March I can comfortably go on a walk or get into a car. Eventually, if I can exercise again I hope I can bring my confidence/energy back up.

As for finances, I tried to find ways to make money online: Microtasks, Surveys, Transcriptioning/Captioning. This has proven unfruitful. Many were qualified only for Beermoney *at best*.
Outside of the thousands owed to BoFA and a credit card, at the very least the 24k in student loans (I dropped out with one class left...) might be significantly cut by loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment plans if I can get over the anxiety of picking up a phone. Until I am ready, I will probably continue to hide from my phone when it rings.

Last night I thought making a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/agoraphobe) would be cool, but now I don't really think it will (nor that it should) get support. On there I might see a family that's a pillar in the community with a fireman father who was in an accident get $30k. I'm not dying of AIDS or Cancer, I'm just a useless person.

I decided to bank on what little I could do: I like to write. So I've been submitting poetry to magazines that pay for submissions (no luck yet). Essays for grants (no luck yet). I've been submitting novel chapters and chapter outlines to publishing companies (expected response time 2 weeks...). I've been applying for freelance writing jobs that are Work-from-home (my CV isn't empty nor amazing, but no callbacks). I'm currently being paid 10 bucks a week (for four weeks) to write dialogue for a cell phone game. (Better than nothing, and hopefully a little fun).


Naturally, I'm still concerned that I haven't done everything I can do.
What else can I do to improve my situation?
(Don't recommend psychiatric help, I already have a therapist and meds, thanks. Don't recommend government aid; we no longer qualify for unemployment, foodstamps, welfare)

40,I am 20 years old and currently studying teaching at university in Australia. I'm now in my second year and have a practical placement coming up soon. I'm not really sure if teaching is right for me but I don't know of any other options. I've narrowed it down to a few outcomes. A) I drop out before the census date and save a ton of money. B) I finish this semester and go on placement to see if it's right for me. C) I push on and complete the degree as it is a stable job. ,08Mar2017,1
45,"I've always been a bit of a mess and never felt very close to any of my family. I'm the black sheep in terms of religion, morals, hobbies, values, etc, and its caused an obvious distance between me and them, that developed over the course of my teen years.

This could maybe be related to chronic depression, but I've always felt as though I could just leave the country and just not *miss* any of them. I've always wanted to be alone or at least pick my relationships. I lived away from home for a year and a half and I never wanted to go home. Home stresses me out. I never feel like a true version of myself around family.

I met a girl a year ago who I feel pretty deeply for. She's just someone I related to and could be myself around. That made me realize how I've been missing exactly that my whole life. Just experiencing that has made me the happiest I've been since I was a kid.

My parents seems to expect to meet her on a regular basis, meet her family, mingle, expect me to get married and they want to build a relationship with her. 

Neither of us wants that. All I want is to live privately and try and stay happy. 

Am I an asshole for wanting distance from family? I already feel guilty and selfish because of all they've given me throughout my life. But I genuinely feel like my relationships with them are superficial and contrived. Maybe everyone is that way with parents.

Is it as simple as saying ""I want distance""? I definitely can't tell them how I actually feel about them.

Or is this problem ignorable? A lot of couples have distant relationships with parents. Maybe its a gradual thing that becomes easier to manage after moving away. I still live at home so maybe I'm overreacting.

I just want to live as free from obligation as possible, does that make me a horrible person? My parents seem to think so.

///I should clarify I don't plan on severing all ties with my family. Just having a comfortable distance.

46,"This maybe a bit long. Ok, so last 2 weeks has been absolutely worst for me ever. I am facing many serious long term shits right now:
First: My gf of 4 years broke up with me 3 days ago. We were together for 3 years and had been in long distance relationship for the last 8 months or so. It was on and off for us in LDR. We are on the opposite end of the globe for each other. I can’t go back to her at least for 5 years, which was the reason for us to be skeptical about us. Still I tried my best to stay with her, gave my everything but she says she doesn’t feel anything for me now. She likes someone else but doesn’t see anything with him. Same was the case with me some months back but things bounced back. But she is adamant that nothing can improve between us. I think I am not gonna get her back ever. I am devastated and just want her back.
Second: I am in my graduate studies and looking for an internship for summer. Even though I have a strong profile, due to no work experience (fresh out of undergrad) and lack of contacts in the semiconductor industry, haven’t received a single call for interview till now. Not even a positive signs from anywhere. I have applied to 100+ positions till now easily.
Third: I dont know why this happens to me, but I am trying to study very hard but not able to get good grades this semester. I have excellent understanding of concepts and mostly solve the homeworks on my own. The guys I help to do homework, ends up getting way better marks than me. ALL OF THE TIME. Sometimes I made them write line by line, still I was the one to lose.
Fourth: I have OCD and currently on medication. Due to these things, I am not able to cope up with my treatment. 
I feel absolutely suicidal right now. I have tendency to self hurt but that’s gone long ago. I understand my life is not that lame to waste so easily, so I wont kill myself. I have amazing parents and sisters who are helping me with breakup but still I am too low to feel like living. Please help me!! You can save my life.",08Mar2017,1
49,"So I was talking to this girl, she was dating this guy who was just screwing her over and absolving all of her time. I told her that I'd take her out because the guy would only go out with her if she paid blah blah.

So we started talking about getting a house together, because we both could use the space, she has a kid, and need a recording studio. She is going to throw down $2000 for move-in as well as myself.

She said she isn't interested in a relationship right now, which I'm totally cool with. Although, I was thrown off because initially I had asked her out on a date, and it turned into strictly platonic living.

Regardless of all of that.. Has anyone ever had issues while living with someone of the opposite sex?

My girlfriend is very sexually experienced (she was promiscuous before we got together) She likes older guys and is into daddy stuff. She calls me daddy sometimes and sometimes retreats into little space (something that has confused me but I have gotten used to) My main question is: is it moral to be involved with a girl like this regarding the age difference. My friends don't seem to care. Her parents are okay with it, although they think i'm 21. What do the people of reddit think? Am I a pervert? Should I be put in jail and registered as a sex offender? I don't know what to think or do about this relationship. We both love each other very much, but I can't help but feel like a creep sometimes because she is technically a minor. She turns 18 in a few months, which makes me feel like the age of consent laws are so arbitrary. It's technically illegal for me to be with her (I think) however in a few months she could date someone who is twice or three times my age and that would be perfectly fine, under the eyes of the law. We make each laugh and have fun together, we have a healthy relationship and she always tells me I'm the best boyfriend she's ever had with full sincerity. I'm the first person that hasn't treated her like crap and respects her as a person. I try to give her life advice and steer her away from bad habits.

EDIT: Returning again, thanks for advice guys. Will go to them in the morning. Y'all are awesome.

Read all before responding. Ok so I bought a $260 North Face jacket from Sun &amp; Ski in Houston. The jacket was a heavy jacket with a smaller nice jacket that came in the inside. I returned the jacket because it didn't like it. I hadn't realized that the inside jacket (that I really like and would wear to school) was not inside. The cashier didn't notice that it wasn't in there and gave me a refund. The problems are that I was wearing my school shirt with my logo on the top left (medium sized private high school) and I also signed a receipt with my first and last name. The jacket is probably worth 60-80 dollars. I doubt they will call the police and say ""a boy stole our jacket 2 days ago, his name is ... and goes to .. school"" because that's ridiculous. They might call the school but if any of those two things happen, I could just say ""oops, i thought I returned it, I can go check my car or house to see if it fell out."" 

QUESTION: Should I return it tomorrow? Is my excuse if I keep it ok?

Now it wouldnt be so bad if u had another cashier with you  but the thing is is that we only work with other cashiers on weekends. So on weekdays you're all alone.

57,"My brother is kind of a passive-aggressive person in general. It's strained relationships with my mom and my sisters.

My mom sent an email to everyone a few days ago asking about an upcoming family event. I replied, and my brother replied to me. It's clear he meant the email for the whole group, but since he didn't reply all, I'm the only one who got it. 

I should also note my brother and his wife are the type of people to completely cut out family members. They haven't spoken with his wife's parents in a couple years now. This causes everyone to walk on eggshells around them, and frankly, to let them get away with this type of bullshit.

Here's the question:

1. Do I even tell him that he forgot to reply all? It's got info in there that my mom needs to know, but I can just call her up and summarize. I'll tell her the truth: that it's a shitty email. She'll probably appreciate not having to see it.
2. If I tell him, should I also tell him to maybe rethink it. He could say the same stuff without being a dick about it, and he should know that. BUT it's likely to mean he'll get pissed at me, which means I might not see him (which is fine) or my niece and nephew (which is not fine) for a while.

59,"So today, after being referred by a close friend, I went down to a popular jeweler and impulsively made an engagement ring purchase. I was really excited because I've heard good things about this place and believed I would get a great deal, but oh boy I was wrong. A 1.01 ct ring cost me nearly $6.3k out the door with the band. I wasn't thinking and put a $1.5k down payment and applied for financing through one of their credit card lending institutions. The only reason I regretted this purchase was the cost. A jeweler offered me the same ring for $4.5k - nearly $2k discount! The only reason I chose to go to the popular jewelry store is because it offered financing unlike the private jeweler. I literally made this purchase as the store was closing so I didn't get a chance to call them back. Do you think I'll be able to cancel this transaction if I call them early in the morning tomorrow?

My relative is a 30ish woman with 2 kids (both under 10). She plays WoW pretty heavily. She has not had a job in over a year  (she had 1 for 3 months before being fired for being late too often/working from home constantly before hitting even 3 months there). She was getting her degree from university of Phoenix but has put her last requirement off for months. The house is livable but by no means clean. All she does is game and get her kids fed and to school. She is living off of child support. No one will say anything to her to try and help because she will blow up at them and cut family members off from her kids (only reason her mom hasn't kicked her out of the house she intends to retire in within the next few years). This relative is bipolar and depressed (professionally diagnosed on both accounts, previously medicated). She admits she needs to see a therapist and to get back on medication, but cannot due to lack of insurance which she cannot afford. 

She lives in Georgia. 

What are programs I can suggest to her that will help her out of this cycle? Preferably aimed at getting her therapy and medication. I have sent job listings to her for months, but that appears to be treating the symptom rather than the cause (and didn't do much, i douby she applied for anything). She really needs therapy and medication.

I appreciate any suggestions. Thank you. ",08Mar2017,1
66,"Some relevant facts:

- Graduating undergrad in December
- Moving right after to the other side of the country
- Have always lived with my parents; they have mostly financially supported me through school, but used money against me
- They are typical conservative Asian parents
- I'm moving to NY and going to be living with my BF of over 4 years, he will be helping me financially until I find a job there, unless I am able to secure a job before moving
- I told my parents of my plans and they are not satisfied--they proposed that I go to law school while in NY and they will help pay for my living expenses but I would need to take out loans to pay for school 

Backstory: I switched majors three times. My parents wanted me to be a nurse like them but I didn't so I switched. I was unable to get into the major I wanted because I did not meet the GPA requirement, so I switched into the major I am currently in and will be receiving my Bachelor's in. It's still in healthcare but my parents are worried that I will not be making a lot of money right away because my field is not clinical. I have researched requirements for law schools and basically I do not meet any because I don't have any background in law, I have a mediocre GPA meaning I would need to score high on the LSAT, and I don't think I would get into a top tier law school. I'm not Elle Woods. Also, I am really done with school for now, and all I want is to start working and start my career. However, I tried to tell my parents in the past about not wanting to pursue law, and they dismissed it. I feel that they would only ""let me go to NY"" if I promise to go to law school there. The more I research about law school the more I don't want to pursue it. 

I know that my parents cannot do anything to stop me from going, but I still would like to have a relationship with them, and I know that they are just going to be disapproving, since I am leaving home to live with my BF in another state (even now they won't allow me to sleep over at my BF's [his parents since he also lives at home still] house, which is 10 minutes away from where we live). I am not going to ask them for any money to help me move. I guess I just need advice on how to proceed. I will obviously need to talk to them and tell them I do not want to go to law school, or at least not right after I graduate. They want to talk to my BF AND his parents (lol wth) about me moving in with him, even though his parents has no say in the matter and they are already supportive of us moving in together. I also wanted some advice on how to deal with the fallout. I basically have the rest of the year left living with my family, I don't want it to be awkward and tense. I also fear that they will try to convince me to stay with them and go to law school in our state. They keep telling me that becoming a lawyer is for me to secure my future and make a lot of money, but I know that it is basically just so that they have a lawyer whenever they need one. I try to tell them the reality that not all lawyers are going to be making lots of money, that it's difficult when you do not go to a top tier school, and I am just not suited for that profession, but they do not listen and they also do not believe me. They try to scare me into thinking I'm going to be unsuccessful if I don't listen to them. I'm really tired of it but I don't know what to do to make them listen.

67,"My boyfriend and I moved to a new city. He moved first, I followed. He started working at a new job. He likes his job a decent amount. The work load is insane. 10 hour days everyday, sometimes more. He started making friends from work. The first event I attended was at their staff Christmas party. Everyone got pretty drunk. Halfway through the night I noticed my boyfriend was snap chatting a girl he's friends with - which I'm cool with. We both have friends of the opposite sex. Except that when we've fought before, he's intentionally embellished their friendship (they used to be roommates with another girl) and told me things to hurt me and make me jealous even though they aren't true. (Never sexual acts, just ""we cuddled all the time"" ""she knows more about me than you ever will"" etc) But in anger he used that against me. I don't care if they talk, I have no say in who he's friends with, but it's a sensitive subject for me because they're close and she's quite rude to me and shows no interest in knowing me even though my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. So she's talking to him and as we we're all drunk I got upset. I tried to keep it between us at the table. Everyone around us was paying no mind but I was firmly saying please stop talking to her while we're here. We were all good. Fast forward my boyfriends boss that night (and I kid you not - every night) got hammered. And I mean he can barely walk and talk. Then he wanted to go to a bar. So we and another girl and the boss went. While there the boss got even more pissed (he could barely keep his eyes open) and he kept touching my arm, pulling me into him, etc. I told my boyfriend and because he had just started he said don't worry about it, he's my boss. Which I'm also totally fine with. It wasn't bothering me to just turn away from him and walk away. So we've also hosted poker nights where my boyfriend has acted a little offside and I've had to say okay, stop it. Not in front of anyone other than one employee. Well, lucky me this employee who was there and the boss are sleeping together. And let me say my boyfriend has specifically said many times ""sleeping with an employee is grounds for termination"" where he works. Come to find out today my boyfriend was told during a board meeting that I'm strongly advised not to attend any events at or in his workplace. Which is hard because this place hosts many events for staff, significant others, and most importantly patrons. And the reason they gave him was ""she doesn't act very good when she drinks and it makes us not feel good."" Or some childish thing like that. So after me attending the Christmas party, hosting them and 6 other people at my house for an out of work poker game, and attending one concert where I had 1 drink, they've decided to in a way threaten that I not be invited or ""else."" I think this is extremely rude considering I had them at my house until 1am (I worked at 4:30, they knew this) the other time his work friends were invited, he didn't even come.

Now these work events are frequent. They do something together every month and there's events I'd obviously want to attend in the future that are for patrons. I'm hurt and pissed off that they've judged my character after 3 meetings, when from what I can tell the boss himself isn't a very good person anyway. Should I email head office to tell them the boss is sleeping with his coworker? This is a legitamite thing that's come directly from the boss, to my boyfriend, to me. They've come to our house together, and when I was trying to sleep one night I watched them leaving holding hands. Personally I think this is stupid to threaten my boyfriend after instances that have happened between ME AND MY BOYFRIEND.

Tldr; boyfriends boss came onto me at their Christmas party, didn't like that I told them to please quiet down when I had to work at 4:30, and is sleeping with his coworker which is grounds for termination where they all work. Now after 3 outings and meeting at only 2 of them, he's advised my boyfriend that he doesn't want me to come to any functions where they work wether it's for patrons or staff.

70,"Ok, so first, a little bit of background.  

I live in Austin, Texas, but my immediate family lives in deep South Texas.  I left my hometown to move to Austin 5 years ago for college and I love it here, but as of late I've considered moving back to my hometown to be closer to my family again.  I only have one sibling and as of this past week, I now officially have a baby Nephew as well.

My family is extremely supportive of me being in Austin and pursuing my own life, but the distance is starting to wear on me, especially with a baby nephew growing up without me.  A trip to see them is a 5 hour drive one way, so visiting them every weekend isn't necessarily all that feasible.  I'm going to increase the frequency of my visits, but I fear it won't be enough to fill the void of wanting to be close to them.

The problem with me moving back isn't necessarily that I won't be happy, but I've noticed that people tend to fall into a routine in my hometown and become satisfied with who they are and don't challenge themselves to grow.  I don't want to fall into that same routine but I fear that if I move back I will.  I know that if my family was a factor I wouldn't leave Austin.  I love living here.

74,"I want to say thanks first for reading my post. Pardon the long backstory.

My mother had a tough first marriage, her first husband (my biological father) was irresponsible, a user and abusive towards my siblings and I. I once saw him called my mom a useless whore, and broke a drinking glass over her head. That's not even the most horrific example from the things he have done. My mother is a very strong willed woman, but financial and cultural pressures forced her into a corner. I remember vivid memory of her coming into our bedroom late at night, crying and apologizing to us because we have to stay with this horrible man, and because she couldn't do anything about it. 

We lived in Taiwan and the atmosphere back in the days then was generally that family stuff is hush hush and kept within the family. My mother had to work everyday from early in the morning to very late at night. She spends very little time with us, but she loved us very much, and tried her best to protect and educate us. My father was a maggot and a piece of trash, to say the least, and never worked. He was on crutches due to a birth defect, and used that as an excuse for everything, including not being a good father and not working.

My mother fought hard for us, HARD. Eventually she met the right man and with the right amount of support, she left my father and moved my siblings and I to the USA with my stepfather in 2007. I was 9, my little brother was 7, and my oldest sister was 12. My stepfather is a wonderful man. He supported us financially and emotionally, and gave my mother the comforting home she never had (my maternal and paternal grandparents were abusive and hateful toward my mother).
But the damage was done. My mother suffers numerous bodily and psychological health issues due to overworking and abuse from the past. Because of this, the things she can eat and do is greatly limited, which in turn greatly diminishes any enjoyment in her life.

My mom feels trapped at home and helpless, because she doesn't have a job and is a housewife. She can't work in the USA because she is not fluent in English, and can't communicate well with the neighbors. We tried everything possible to help her feel better, from attending therapy sessions to seeing a psychiatrist, starting up a company to making some Chinese speaking friends (they turned out to be rotten and toxic friends who put my mom down), turning to religion and going to church to attending local events, giving her a budget to completely redo and redecorate the house to adopting a dog, and gardening in the backyard. The remodeling of the house made her really happy, and she is slightly somewhat better now psychological in a comfortable space she designed. The dog that we adopted brings her a lot of joy and is just about the cutest thing ever. But she's still very much depressed and lonely. All the children in the family are all away from home, either working or attending universities. My stepdad is also working most of the day, so my mom is just stuck at home with nothing to do except watch TV, walk the dog occasionally to the park and back, and twiddle her thumb.
We (the kids) came up with the idea of introducing my mom extensively to the internet, and we created a Facebook for her and blogs and other things in hopes that she will find some sort of enrichment and fulfillment in writing. Mom created a facebook group and invited all 30 or so of her friends to join, hoping that they would add other friends into the group. Very few people joined her group, and it really broke her heart. This sounds silly and dumb, but it was really heartbreaking to see her like that. She laughs at herself and becomes very self-deprecating, and laughs it off with us to put up a strong front, but I can tell that she is really really hurt. We kids can't really promote the page for her either, because believe it or not, we are all kind of quiet kids and keep to ourselves and our very limited group of friends. Some of us can count the amount of friends we have on one hand. We just all happen to be super nerds/shut-ins.

It really hurts us and my father to see her like that, but at the same time we can't just shatter her strong front and potentially hurt her pride.

Recently, after much consideration and convincing, my mother finally started another Facebook group in a subject she is and has been very avid about: Gardening. She started it just today, and promoted it on her Facebook. So far there are only three members, my mother, a dupe facebook account she made and I. I am really afraid that it's going to turn out like it did again last time around and break her newfound confidence.

So please reddit, what should I do?? I am really at a pinch here. I have already contacted my boyfriend and my siblings to join the group, but other than that I'm all out of ideas. The only social media I have is Facebook, and most of the things I post barely get any notice from my facebook friends. Please Reddit community, I need some good solid advice. I can't bear to see my mother disappointed again.

TLDR: my mother had a past full of abusive and horrible people. Finally got the opportunity to marry a wonderful man and to move into a beautiful home in USA, but is now very limited in how she can enjoy her life. She is lonely due to severe language barrier. Now want to start a gardening group in facebook, but no one wants to join and I don't want this to break her heart again. Please help!!",08Mar2017,1

A lot of the podcasts, TV shows, and games that I usually enjoy haven't felt like much fun. I usually listen to a podcast while going to sleep, but recently I've just gone to sleep without any accompaniment. I haven't really felt like doing much with friends, either. I've stopped working on my normal activities (reading, playing games, building guitar pedals, working on a radio show) in favor of just kinda wasting time on the internet until it's time to go to bed. It's not that I don't want to do those things, it's just that I can't seem to bring myself to actually do them, I feel to tired to do them, or if I try I can't stay focused on them.

82,"Hello,

Using a throwaway because I don't want this post on my main acc. There's a TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;nbsp;

Some background info:

My family moved from the north to the south (located in the US) at the end of the summer right before my sophomore year of high school began. At first, I was extremely upset about the move, but I decided to give a new life a try and I did: I'm now in the 4th quarter of my sophomore year and I have a good amount of friends and am pretty liked throughout my school, so things have been going pretty well for me. But however, I want to graduate at my previous high school as I lived there for almost 7 years and just really miss it.

&amp;nbsp;

My goal is to spend the first semester of my junior year in the south and then to move back to the north at the beginning of the second semester of my junior year on my own while my family stays in the south. However, I'd be 17 so I wouldn't be able to live on my own so I'd have to find a place to live.

I've been throwing this idea around with my parents for the last few months and I think they would be willing to let me do it if I'm able to maintain a 4 GPA (I currently have a 4.2 and I'm taking a majority of honors and AP classes with high to low A's, so this wouldn't be a problem). But I have no idea how to move forward with putting my idea into play and struggle with figuring out how to:

-Is it appropriate to approach someone asking whether or not you could stay with them for 1/2 a year? How could I do that?

-Are there possible ways to stay on your own in a rented room on your own without a guardian in the state? (my guess for this would be no since I'm not completely familiar with the minor emancipation laws of the state, but don't want to rule it out as an option)

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: I want to leave my current high school halfway through my junior year at 17 years old to graduate from the high school I used to attend but am having issues figuring out how I could find a place to live there while I'm 17 years old.

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice I could get would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much

84,"Hello all;
To keep the story short i am retaking a math class at a community college with a new professor. Calculus to be exact. My first exam was not bad and my homework and quizzes were good. My second exam i received a 0 for my score and was given no partial credit like the first exam. I looked it over again and i have about 3 out of 6 correct final answers and all correct work shown. The other were off my a slight margin but final answer was not right. Because i have to be late about by 5 mins from work to this class i think the teacher does not like me. Wont talk to me about anything about regrading and acts like i should do everything his way even though i found mistakes in his work which he says it was because ""I must of looked at something else instead of the correct one by accident"". If i end up dropping this class ill have to take it over the summer. This teacher does not grade; just marks everything wrong if he does not see the right answer in 2 seconds. sqrt3 is apparently not 1.73 which i got the whole answer wrong for that mistake -_-... I should of known since he has lower than a 2 on Rate my Professor and ended with last of of only 3 people out of 20 that started. 

What would be a fair way of dealing with this? He has sent me numerous emails telling me to drop his class along with other things that i have never received before.

86,"the dog is half german sheperd, half rottweiler. i found him outside of a bar and took home. i was drunk, he ran up to me and loved me immediately. the guy who was sitting on a still said i could take him. so how could i not? just google them, beautiful dogs. well, soon i realized i could not afford to take care of this dog so i decided i was going to take him to an animal shelter. however, my brother insisted that he could take care of him and i trusted him being the supposed animal lover that he is. now, he walks him once about every 1 or 2 weeks and afterwards rufus (the dog, shitty name i know) always wants to play. he likes to wrestle, be chased or do the chasing. he also never fills his bowl with food or water. i always have to do it. he's gone days without food or water on many occasions. now i do it, i always have to do it. my brother will go on hunting trips for 3 days and not tell anyone to make sure he gets fed. we can't let him out in the backyard without a leash becasue he'll jump the fence and run around the neighborhood which i think he should be able to do anyway. my brother keeps him in his room with him for days without letting him out to eat piss or shit. my brother refuses to come out of his room if my me or my dad are downstairs even to make himself something to eat and he'll keep rufus with him the whole time. his whole reason for all of this keeping him indoors is so noone cuts his balls off. so overall, out of 24 hours of the day 7 days a week, besides being let out to piss and shit, this german sheperd/rottweiler gets to be outside for 1 hour at the most. it's total horsheshit. why don't i walk him? well because I DONT HAVE A FIBULA FROM HIP SURGERY (it's complicated) ONE LEG IS SHORTER THAN THE OTHER, ATROPHY, I CAN'T WALK HIM ON TOP OF DOING MY RECOVERY WORKOUTS. this dog only lays outside of the door of my room and cries because he knows im the only one that will walk him. yes, i give in sometimes and walk him anyway despite my condition. i can do it, but not for long, an hour at the most, barely, i can't run. i'll never be able to run ever again. walking with uneven hip-strength and leg-length can lead to mroe hip problems. my brother is perfectly able-bodied, has no job, and does nothing but sit in his room taking apart his guns and cleaning them.... but never goes to the gun-range... cuz he can't afford it... cuz he refuses to get a job. i'd take the dog to an entire different city myself. i once had a family set up to take him in but he refused to let him go. he's an unstable person, this past year, i asked him where the harness was to talk rufus and just got up, got in my face and said ""i don't have to say anything to you"" and proceed to put me in a choke hold, luckily i got him off me before i completely blacked out. in another instance, he said this to my dad and i, and this is a direct and exact quote, ""if this were the 1800s, i would have killed you two already."" WHAT THE FUCK CAN I DO? IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY HIP AND HIS GUNS I WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LEAD PIPE TO HIS KNEES, MOVE TO ANOTHER CITY AND TAKEN THE DOG WITH ME.

So I have a friend whom I considered as a pretty close one. I haven't known her that long, but we met through mutual friends and we got pretty close. By that, I mean we'd text a lot, joke around whenever we'd see each other, and just be cool with one another. I don't like her romantically or anything, always considered us to be platonic. One thing we used to do is pretend flirt with one another through text. I'd say some really cheesy and dramatic line about my love for her, and we'd laugh. Then suddenly, it kind of just flipped. Whenever I'd say hi or anything she would just give me the cold shoulder, or just tell me off. Another thing she does now, is go out of her way to say hi to one of our mutual friends, who I'm pretty close with. 
By that, I mean my friend and I will be walking down the hall and she'll go like ""Hey Tom!!!!"" and not even glance at me. 
Before she would do that jokingly, and it was obvious she was kidding (we'd smile and laugh after), but now it's hard for me to tell because she just shit talks me then that's it. I still laugh along and act like it doesn't bother me, mostly because I don't want to make things awkward or seem super sensitive. But it does hurt a lot when she seems serious about her shit talk

What has gotten me this far in life is a very strong work ethic. My greatest weakness is that I lack confidence in myself and as a result I have very poor critical thinking skills. I turn to others to get the answers to complex problems without thinking through them myself. Even if I attempt to think through problems myself, I feel that I do a poor job of it. My lack of confidence can be partly attributed to my anxiety (runs in the family).

I loved this job and I'm devastated I was let go. For the first time in my life having a strong work ethic wasn't enough. They needed a critical mind and I didn't have it. I want to develop my critical thinking skills, but don't know where to start. Any help? What can I do to overcome this?

What also made this job difficult was dealing with very high level executives from different organizations. I had to learn how to frame every form of communication diplomatically and concisely. I had to learn to manage my time and multitask. I also had to learn how to stay out of office politics and to keep my thoughts of others to myself (I made the grave mistake of not adhering to this and it's partly due to why I was fired).

-Them daddy issues- 
I lost my dad to suicide a couple years ago. My mom's to blame for it, but we can't just tell her that now can we. Made my grades go horribly down, my days grow horribly long, and my life pretty much miserable. I went to seek help for that, I'm mostly through but you don't just get over that.

-College-
Dad died in my first year. The 2 years that followed were me failing all the classes, the one after, me faking going to classes to make sure my mom's not pissed at me. I have no interests in any programs, and even if I did my grades wouldn't let me get in the interesting stuff.

-The mom stuff-
I don't particularly like her, she said to my dad she was leaving him just after she got through her depression, after he fought years to make her feel better and gave up all his energy to try and make her feel good. So much for helping people. Cost him his life, but oh well. I live in her house, to be more precise I live in my bedroom. I exit it only to eat or go to work because I'm stuck playing my video games, stupid addiction. I want to move from the house. Seriously, my sister is 6 years younger than me and she already has plans to move for college when she gets there. Im 21 and living with mommy. Pretty cool huh. I want an appartment, or enough money to just go on a big trip through Canada.

-Me-
I'm stuck. I need a goal, I need to learn how to save money, how to get my life together, how to stop playing games all the time, how to find something I want to do later in life, how not to be so tired of everything all the time, how to get myself my own place, how to feel motivation for more than a couple hour.

It's been over a year now and I've been working at my job and considering it's about time to move on to a different job (something closer to my field).

I've been thinking lately that I don't like who I've become since moving back home. I'm more isolated, lonely, I rarely go out anymore, and don't have a circle of friends who's willing to do things with me without serious effort.

I have the option to look for work back in the city I did school in and move back to my friends, but I don't know if I'll move back to what I left. A majority of them are still there but they would only be in school for maybe a few more years then who knows what will happen after that...

Personally I do feel moving away from home will be good for me in general but I'm not sure what to do.

Do I ...?

* Move back to a city for people I miss/care about, without the guarantee that what I come back to will be what I left.

111,"I'm really conflicted so if anyone could please give me some advice, it would really help.

I have to choose between two BMW 330i cars tomorrow.

I have a good amount of experience fixing these beautiful e46 cars. Dad's a mechanic with tools and lifts. I plan on keeping this next car till it dies. Do not plan on reselling. I plan on driving a lot (500 miles a week) in the near future with a new job. I'll prob use this car to do that. More than anything I need a car that has had good engine maintenance so that it will last me longer.

First one is a 01 330i with 135k miles. Automatic. Salvage title due to messed up hood in an accident that happened a few weeks ago. I have a hood that's the same color so that's not an issue for me. This car is in excellent condition. Engine is pristine, looks like the guy took it to the dealer for anything and everything wrong with it. Interiors is spotless as well. Owner wants $3,000.

Second car is a 04 330i ZHP with 155k miles on it. Automatic. Clean title. I haven't seen this one in person yet, but from the pics and description and BMW enthusiast owner, I assume it's in the same condition as the first one. Obviously if it isn't then that'll make my decision easier. I will check it out tomorrow. But provided that it is, is the ZHP worth that much? I honestly love the idea of having a ZHP due to the slightly more powerful tune, Louder exhaust, tighter suspension and so on. Owner wants $5,000 for it.

Does anyone have any input? Is the thrill of the ZHP worth the extra money/more mileage? Thanks!",08Mar2017,1

The babies have been clawing at the walls for a week now.

I rent a room with a family and it's not like they haven't noticed.

If I recall I heard power tools (drill I belive) being used before they gave up.

I'm concerned that the cats are going to die up there and eventually just die and rot... causing an awful smell for weeks and maybe even seeping through my side of the home.

Don't feel comfortable telling the family straight to take care of an issue they are already aware of, or giving a removal expert free roam around a home that isn't mine.

Who knows if I'll be charged for it also... which I assume so.

The clawing has gone faint for a while now, I heard a thump yesterday night, so I assume one of them fell through the gaps into the wiring section of the wall.

I hear meowing from time to time now, usually wakes me up at 2AM ...

Just don't know what to do any help would be appreciated, thank you.",08Mar2017,8
113,"I need help. I don't know where I went wrong. Im 22, stuck in a dead end job where im learning nothing or gaining experience. I also dropped out of school after getting a rare disease at the age of 20, and I spent all of 2015 depressed, and in early 2016 I realized how much of a rut I was in. Not in school, etc. 

I want to go to a fashion design school, august 2016 I got over my ""depression break"" and took some non credited classes at a special stitching lab and learned how to sew. I really enjoyed it.  I told myself I'd use the pieces I created to apply to college out of state. I feel like I have to force myself to a new city.

I also don't have any friends, any any attempt I make seems a failed effort. I made literally one friend in 2014 in college but we don't talk anymore. Im starting to get to the point where the loneliness is bothering me. 

I've never been invited to a party ever in my life, also I have never been in a relationship before. All my best friends from high school and middle school are in relationships and I don't see them anymore as they stopped caring for our relationship. I do have self esteem issues.
I gained alot of weight after my surgery for the rare disease, I went out once and someone called me the ""ugly fat friend"" at a bar when I hung out with my high school friend.

I don't know how to apply to schools. I don't know how to make friends. I don't know where to meet people. I don't know how to be positive when everything seems to be going to shit. Please help any advice is wanted! I have no one else to vent to besides my mom really....",08Mar2017,0
114,"I am a 36 year old school teacher who has struggled with depression, anxiety, food addiction, television addiction, binge eating, poor hygiene and poor housekeeping poor self-care, and just general poor life management for most of my life. 

I have taken the rest of the school year off on FMLA to try to get my life together. I will need to go back to work August 1st.

So what I have in front of me is a unique opportunity most adults would kill for. I do not need to work at all for nearly five months, except for raising a nine year old daughter who goes to school during the day through the first week of June, giving me plenty of time to take care of myself.

Here are my stats:

1) 5'10 and 290 pounds. I've gained 45 pounds since mid December. A healthy weight for my height would be 174. I would be quite content with 200, a weight I have never achieved as an adult. I have lost weight in the past on a Keto diet, but I always fall off the wagon and gain the weight back.

2) Disordered of compulsive eating - 6/7 days a week.

3) Absolutely no exercise. I'm capable of exercising, I just choose not to. I have a gym membership I do not use. I also have a torn meniscus right now, but I could probably do light exercise.

4) Daily television or other screens/tablets - 8-12 hours daily

5) Sleep - about 10 hours a day, including napping while my daughter is at school.

6) Hygiene - shower about every five days

7) House cleaning - only do the bare minimum, like clean the litter boxes when I absolutely must, or wash the dishes when I run out of silverware.

Here are my goals:

1) When I am low carb dieting, I lost weight easily and quickly. I am currently paying for Weight Watchers, but I do not use it. I would like to eat healthy meals and lose 70 pounds by August 1st. I've lost weight at that pace many times before, but only while watching my carbs. 

2) I think exercise would be good for my anxiety management and self-esteem. I would like to go to the gym six days a week while I a, not working. It is silly to think I don't have time to do so. My gym has a variety of yoga classes, water classes, and I actually enjoy cardio machines when I have music and I can zone out.

3) I would like to sleep 8.5 hours a night and eliminate napping.

4) I need to be serious about de cluttering my house and getting rid of some stuff. Part of my time off involves me selling my home and moving out of state.

5) I would like to get in the habit of showering daily, a practice I have never mastered in my life. 

6) I would like to have some time to devote to non-tv hobbies, like reading and researching genealogy. There is a great genealogy library that is open daily close to my house.

7) I would like to set up and follow some healthy guidelines for tv and internet use. I don't know what is reasonable.

I'm looking for advice on how to structure my days so that I can achieve these goals. I welcome any and all advice. PMs welcome. I very much appreciate your help.

118,"Hello, I need some advice about a new job opportunity I have.

I am currently studying at uni and I have trouble finding a job. Mainly because there is lots of competition where I live. Initially, I wanted a job in game design/development or IT.

I recently found a job ad for an EA position, where I will be assistant of the CEO directly. This is the only time I got called back for an interview in my year of job search, and the interview went really well. The job itself is great and the atmosphere (the industry) is somewhere where I want to be in the future, as an executive or around that, just not an assistant. So, this is great opportunity for me to network however I read lots of stuff like how its impossible to be promoted from an assistant job and your future job opportunities get affected like people do not give you a job because you were an assistant.

Can anyone advice me? I really have no one to talk about this.",08Mar2017,2

123,"It's a sob story.  I just don't have anywhere else to ask at this point.  

TLDR at the bottom.  

Bit of a rough childhood.  Not as bad as some. 
Single instance of sexual assault by an older kid who also suffered the same by another.  Learned to get over it.

Mum is a sweet person who had serious anger issues that manifested in regular physical abuse and continuous emotional.  

Brother was a violent psychotic.

Got out of the house, struggled balancing some school and full time work.  Finally started getting therapy for all the shit.  

I was functional and finally getting somewhere I thought meant progress.

Two years ago I did something really stupid at work.  I was working as a chef and was taking morning prep out to the garbage.  I'm a bit shorter and climbed up on the old drum discard container like I always did to throw stuff away.  Ended up with a revolving platform under my feet and fell three feet straight down on the wall of the barrel.

I'm not a man, but that doesn't mean it didn't fuck shit up down there.

Hemotoma a few inches long just to the side.  Thank god it wasn't a direct hit.  Went to the ER. Got stitched up and cleaned up.  I made all the jokes, assured the staff it wasn't sexual assault, got my pain meds and was told to rest ten days or more and to think about getting it looked at again.

Tried to move past it at work.  I used to have a good double sided essay sized piece for comic relief that I could perform.  

These days the anxiety and depression have come back so hard I can barely remember three of the jokes I used to make.

I went back to work too soon.  Gotta save that cash for college.  Can't let my boss down.  Feels bad.

Went back to work three days later.  Could barely drive the car.  

Even a month later when I tried to get back into my exercise routine it was enormously painful.  

Working up to it again I tried exercising through pain. I dealt with the jokes at work.  At one point when a coworker told the story to the new guy and was fairly inappropriate about it the issue got addressed and worked out.

Well, I coupdn't take it. Chef's are supposed to have thick skins, but more than a year of being around it it hit my anxiety pretty hard to work with people who knew my cunt took a guillotine to one side.  

I'm back up to 190 pounds.  Trying to keep on my med but can't afford to see the therapist for a bit.  I quit.  With the suicidal thoughts lingering I gave my chef knives to a friend to hold onto for me.  Got a new job with fewer hours and tried to concentrate on school.

Honestly, shit's hard right now.  I'm sinking a bit.  And I'm going to withdraw for the semester.  I don't know how to get out of this trap.  Even with working through the pain to exercise to a point to where it's not quite as bad hasn't gotten it all better.

Work paid a bit of workers comp, but to be honest the whole thing is so damn embarrassing.   They're good people, but the idea of bringing up the issue terrified me especially after everything else.

I know there's some nerve damage and some scar tissue.  It's not as bad as it could have been.  But I'm just at a point I have nothing left to give.

Left that job so no insurance at the moment.  The new one is only part time.  My parent's insurance was supposed to last through school but it withdrew.   So no point in not quitting this semester and working out my personal demons I guess.  Sometimes, I just really want to give up.

Anyone have advice on powering through the flashes of crippling genital pain when you exercise?  I just haven't been able to make myself even try once this month. 

TL:DR  My new name was barrel rider after a genital injury.  Prevents exercise. No exercise equals rampant anxiety and depression.  Fucked up.

Thanks folks,

Love Barrel Rider.",08Mar2017,8
128,"I have a friend who suffers from what I believe is clinical depression, she hasn't been diagnosed by a doctor, but she's in a horrible state where she won't leave the bed, eat, or go to class. She dropped out of college and a typical conversation consists of her worrying about me while she mentions about how she can't stop picturing herself dying.

She's been a close friend and I can't fathom to leave her alone, and I simply don't know what to do to help. It seems like this sort of thing happens to her in waves, and is not triggered by any sort of event, and she never knows why she feels the way she does. Hence, why I believe it is clinical depression. This time it's significantly worse than ever before though. Most of it comes from some deep rooted psychological problems that come from an incredibly messed up family life. Spending time with her just distracts her for the day, but she goes right back into self-loathing and being bed ridden the next day. 

She has no faith in getting better and seems to be edging towards considering suicide. I convinced her to see a specialist but I don't know anything about this. We're both college students and she doesn't have the funds to see anything expensive, but the free university therapist is a 6 week wait time. With that said, I’m completely open to paying for her, as long as I can keep the costs manageable. I don’t know the costs associated with getting her problem completely figured out (assuming this isn’t going to be an issuer that can be sorted out with just a couple sessions). I also firmly believe that nothing a therapist can say will change anything. She has a support system and none of it helps. I’m hoping she can get something prescribed to help her. 
What can I do? Where do I go? Do I see a psychologist? A therapist? A psychiatrist? How do I convince her to let me pay? I haven’t brought it up but I’m almost certain she’d outright refuse to get financial help from me. 

I feel like I can be doing more but nothing seems effective and I’m kind of lost. I appreciate any sort of advice about the situation.

- She told me she took very strong japanese pills (hormons). She cannot get pregnant.
- Her only boyfriend before me came inside her she never got pregnant.
- After I broke up with her after two day or so she wrote two times ""Im pregnant"" on her facebook and I read the comments one of her followers posted ""It wouldn't surprise me if you were to be the first transgender to get pregnant""
The comment is gone now after I message her and asked her if she's transgender.
- She said to me ""Im pregnant"" then I asked her to be honest and she said ""Im not pregnant"" then we continued to write but she didn't seem to be really focusing and asking me stuff like ""What beach you recommend on that island you living I am going there"".
- She also told me shes a ""transgender but very feminin.""  when I messaged her after I saw the posts

- When we hook up she told me she cannot have a baby either since she also wants to concentrate on her career right now.
- She also told me she has her period next week.

I just do not know what to believe anymore. What did I do that she is trying to play me? What can I do I am so pissed and stressed out. I do not want to have a baby right now nor can I afford it. I have a career.

One of my roommates told me he is moving out at the end of the month so I'm in the process of trying to find someone to replace him. 

The issue is, I don't plan on staying here for another year. I'd really like to move in with my gf by the end of the year. She wants to move in together too. One of the issues is, I am a broke college student who graduates in June. I am not able to work until maybe August as I need a temporary permit to work. So I can't afford anything higher than I pay in rent ($600 + utilities).

The other issue with moving in with my gf is she currently lives with her mom who was just diagnosed with an uncommon form of uterine cancer. She's having surgery next week. My gf has mentioned that she won't be able to move in with me if she has to take care of her mom if the surgery doesn't go well. 

The distance between us already puts a strain on our relationship. She lives about 1-2 hours away depending on traffic and she has a car and I don't. She works in the city I live in so we try to see each other once a week. Sometimes I'm able to go out there.

The other issue is, I love this apartment but don't want to sign a lease for another year. My gf can't move in here because she has a dog and pets aren't allowed. 

I don't know if the new roommate or my current one would want to take over the lease as it's a big financial commitment and I also don't want to mention it to them now because I don't want them to move out and me be stuck with the rent.

It wasn't until a couple weeks later, I decided to quit that job for reasons of conflicting schedules, not enough pay, etc.. Anyway, fast forward to now. In the last month I've been offered a job at a  very prestigious marketing company that has great opportunity for advancement. The only catch is/was that I'd have to stay in a hotel (obviously different rooms) with two gentlemen while we travel for training. I talked to my significant other and he insisted that I could find another job where I didn't have to sleep in a hotel where men would be. I am 25 years old, I'm sure I can contain myself and they could contain themselves. All things aside, he was right, I did get offered another job. This time, I was approached and asked if I wanted to be a bartender. Apparently I ""have the look"" which I didn't know if that was saying I'm pretty or maybe I just look like a slut. Lol. In any case, I happily agreed and they told me to come in for my first shift. It wasn't until that night, I found out it was a strip club and I'd just be selling juice because it's all nude.  Now, being a bartender before, I made very little money hourly because it was all about tips. But this place wanted to pay me a great hourly wage, PLUS keep the tips I made. I went in and it was literally the easiest job I've ever done. I get home that night and my boyfriend is crying. Once again saying he doesn't want me to take this job. So I didn't go in the next day. Now he's constantly complaining because we're ""broke"" or because I don't have a job. He makes it impossible. I love him with all of my heart, but he's holding me back I think. What do I do?

My issue is involving my work- I am the sole admin and button click developer for our company's Salesforce org.

My superiors have zero experience in using Salesforce in an admin/development capacity, but are responsible for the projects that come my way.

To begin with I received stellar reviews but as time went on things started to change - the workloads increased and I faced criticism on my performance.

I felt frustrated as I would advise from a point of expertise but would be ignored constantly and overuled and expected to ""just do it""

Keep my cell in my car at all times- this only applies to me ( the previous week I had informed my manager that my mum had been admitted to hospital with a serious medical condition -and therefore needed my cell on me -he agreed only to pull me up on my cell usage the following week saying that my cell phone usage was unacceptable. 

I was told not speak to anyone in the office 

I was pulled up on a post I put on my Facebook before joining the company - Long with a picture of my dog I posted before working hours. somebody at my work has been going through my Facebook.

I was told that I slurp my coffee in a way that is deliberate and purposely done to distract my follow employees and that I do it in a particular area of the office.

Recently I was informed that I need to have daily meetings with my manager and that I have to wait until they are available so if they have a meeting that overruns until 7pm I have to wait ..

I've already called the club when there open but no one ever answers, and I've tried searching for the girl and calling the number she gave to me, no luck there either. now im pretty sure she has it cause i was showing it to her on the cab ride home but its not worth much to anyone but me so if she was holding it for ransome why not get ahold of me. i really just need advise on how to either track this chick down or get ahold of the bar.

159,"I (21f) share a room with my SO (23m) in a shared house. We're currently saving to move out but have to wait for our two month notice to run out. We share with two guys who work in the emergency services (we get along well because I was in the ambulance service and often worked with the service) and they can sometimes be a bit laddish (and never freaking clean, leaving me to run the house) but are good guys. 

Yesterday they went out drinking and came back in the middle of the night (waking up me and my SO who works early) and were crashing around, shouting and laughing. We were annoyed but let them wear themselves out. We eventually fell back asleep. 

Anyway. There's now a foot wide hole in the wall where they've obviously kicked it in. My SO and I are worried because the landlord is well known for trying to make us pay for anything and everything. He's a bit of a conman tbh. The boys obviously haven't told the landlord but should my partner and I tell him? We don't want lumped with the repair bill when we haven't done anything wrong. In fact, I'm forever buying cleaning products/things to fix up the place (ie rinse aid to maintain the dishwasher, limescale remover, descaler for the kettle etc etc) even though I'm technically not a proper tenant. I had to move in as an emergency thanks to issues with university accommodation. I'm a sub tenant and have been joined on my SOs tenancy agreement and don't have one of my own. 

I can hear them talking and laughing about their drunken antics and mentioning how to repair the wall but I don't know if they'll attempt to fix it or get a professional to do it. 

Should we tell the landlord? We don't want to get in trouble and we pay an exorbitant amount of rent as it is (we could literally rent a two bed house for what we're paying right now) and really can't afford any more charges. 

What do we do??? 

I don't want to rat them out because they're good guys and we don't want to make an enemy of them but we also can't afford to pay for their cock up? My SO and I are very introverted and hate confrontation so we have no idea what is best to do. 

Please help! 

Edit: SO has spoken to one of the guys who admitted kicking the wall in and said he would sort it and asked us not to tell the landlord.

But we could all get evicted over this. What are we supposed to do?

so we share alot of interests, enjoy spending time with each other, we also have a good sexual chemistry, and a huge physical attraction for each other.
 
But it might be kinda weird, as we are kinda already living together, and if we fight, there isn't a possibility to escape. I mean we have two fully separate rooms, but share a bath and the kitchen. Also she kinda just moved in, and it would be unfair if we break up soon and dirty and she has to move again (as it's the flat of my aunt and uncle)

Growing up, we've never had much to be fair. My mom doesn't have a university degree, my father didn't even graduate high school. On top of that, I wouldn't describe the age at which they had me (44 and 49) as the best of times to have a second kid. If that wasn't enough, my dad had had alcohol problems for as far as I can remember.

So, up to the most recent past, we've been living off of the earnings of my parents and their pensions, since they're old enough to retire, but realistically couldn't. My dad worked as a taxi driver, so the pay was completely unpredictable, and my mom was a cashier in a general store - basically almost minimum wage. My life wasn't luxurious, but when it came to buying usual stuff like food, clothes or replacing things that broke down and such - we could afford it.

I'm in my second year of university, which, thank God, I get for free. I spend roughly 40 hours/week in class, add to that all the readings and homeworks and assignments, and we're coming up on 50-60 hours a week. What I'm trying to say is that a full-time job is not an option.

In a few days we will receive my dad's last monthly pension, after that we're cut off. Without going into details, this means that our monthly income will be below 50% of what it used to be.

169,"Hi /r/advice,

At the beginning of February I moved into a beautiful brand-new house with two good friends and one girl who came recommended by another friend. She seemed great, and all four of us hung out a few times before we took the plunge--all seemed well. For reference we three friends are 23, this girl (A) is 21.

This girl has been nothing but trouble since move-in. She's never lived apart from her mother before and she has a string of mental health issues that we were not aware of until a few weeks in. She made it unreasonably difficult to furnish the common spaces, saying she wanted to have a picture in her head of exactly what they should look like before we went shopping, then refusing to discuss that picture or work towards creating it in any way. She also accused me of being ""emotionally manipulative"" when I brought us all to a furniture outlet and we bought a couch after what I saw as a fair, balanced discussion ending in a decision.

Two weeks ago she let us know she was moving out. She's on a monthly sublet and gave us 30 days of notice, so that's a-ok, I'm glad to hear it. The next weekend we furnished the apartment in 5 hours flat. 

We have a property manager who lives in his trailer on the adjacent lot, this amazing quirky old black dude who has a million stories and a lesson to go with each of them. He can be tough to understand, since he has a thick ebonic accent and is missing half his teeth, but I chat with him whenever I run into him and consider him a good friend. A ""doesn't feel comfortable"" talking to him. I'm trying real hard to believe it's because of the communication barrier and not straight-up racism. (A is a white girl.)

My 2 questions:

-A couple friends and I moved all her shit for her, including her heavy-ass queen mattress. I'm pretty sure I'm not helping her move out. Does that make me an asshole?

-Our property manager bangs around at all hours, since he's fixing up the lower unit. It never bothers anyone but A, who wants one of us to ask him to limit it to business hours. I'm strongly inclined to say ""No, deal with it yourself."" Does that make me an asshole?

171,"Here's a little background info to explain the situation I'm currently in:
I am 22 years old and live with my girlfriend in Minneapolis. I grew up in Rochester, New York and still have a lot of friends back home, including my best friend. I went to college at Virginia Tech and graduated with a BS in Civil Engineering in the spring of 2016. Now I have close to $100k in student loans and I'm paying roughly $1600 a month in bills/rent/student loans/car payments..Etc. I'm currently employed as an engineering technician and make about $45k a year and have been working for a little over 6 months. I moved to Minneapolis with my girlfriend because she got accepted to a 5 year PhD program at the U of M, which she just started in the fall of 2016. 

This is where I need some advice. I don't like my job. It's boring, I'm over qualified, and I feel like I'm wasting my potential. I have been applying for Civil engineering jobs and had a few interviews with companies that I was genuinely interested in but have been turned down every time after leaving the interview feeling pretty confident. I accepted my current job knowing it would be temporary. I simply needed an income immediately after moving here because we were both broke and I was offered the position a few days before we moved. Now I am starting to get discouraged and feel like I will be stuck with this job that I dread having to go to every morning. Also, I've gone to having a lot of friends at college and back home to pretty much zero. Everyone I work with is 40 or older and it's hard to make friends in a new city that I don't know anyone in. I want to go back to school to get a master's degree but I can't afford all of my bills without a steady income. I am not attached to this city at all. The only thing keeping me here is my girlfriend and I still love her so I can't really leave without her. Especially because I don't think she would be able to support her lifestyle on her own. Now I feel like I'm wasting potentially 5 years of my 20's at a job I hate and a place I don't have any friends except my girlfriend.

Here's a brief TL;DR for you.

To skip it you could just scroll down to this line doodle thing (------) that's an example of what it looks like.

Okay here it is.

It's probably a minor issue and it doesn't mean much, but I'm LOOKING to date this peer of mine from class that I've been seeing for a couple of months, I'm 20, she's 20.  y'know the usual stuff.

I've asked her out to see a film with me, she declined because she was busy etc (She was busy no jk) 

I'm meeting her over the weekend to see this thing of hers, she really cares about me, but I cba'd to list down every detail, but I know she cares.

I'm not experienced with women, I recently finished and graduated from a single sex'ed school, if that makes sense.



Lately she's been showing signs of interest, as in she sits with me now, her acquaintances (who are female) notice me now and as a result I have never felt as attractive as an individual in my entire life.
Use of cute petnames and all that adorable icky stuff

I'm convinced I'm her only guy friend, she's done so many good things for me, e.g help etc



I don't fit the virgin bill (Or so I thought) until she outright asked if I was a virgin when we were talking about a mutual friend's relationship, I stuttered and said ""yes"" and we continued with our banter through and through.


-----------------------
TL;DR why would she ask if I was a virgin and am I playing it too safe?

I want to take the risk but I don't exactly want to be friends with her, but I like what I have. I just don't understand.

Thanks for checking this out.

My parents will keep these in the meantime and will undoubtedly check through them all to see where my money has been going.

So here's where things get confusing. A few weeks before she visited, she made me promise that we'd get matching tattoos before she came to town. I was on the fence about it but I've always wanted the tattoo we were gonna get, so I decided to pull the trigger and the first night she was here we went and did it. She wanted to keep the tattoo secret from the rest of our friends, which I thought was kind of weird.

At first, the chef joined a particular restaurant specializing in Chinese dishes because she wanted to learn and enhance her skills in cooking Chinese dishes. However, after one month, the restaurant owner asked the chef to cook dessert for the restaurant because he wanted to improve his restaurant's reputation. The chef did not like making desserts but she agreed anyway because she had better skills compared to the other chefs.

So the chef started making desserts all on her own. She made the menu, researched on the ingredients, bought the ingredients, and practised and practised. She did not receive any support from other chefs nor the restaurant owner who asked her to do it. There was only one chef who did help her with buying the ingredients and other minor things.

The chef felt very sad, angry and disappointed because:
1) To produce a new menu on desserts is not easy for her alone.
2) She has no passion in doing desserts for the restaurant (She only enjoyed making desserts to be eaten on her own).
3) Her initial aim in entering the restaurant was to learn Chinese cuisine, but now she felt heavily burdened by the work load of making desserts for the restaurant.
4) The other chefs had their own social circle and many times she was excluded in their conversation about Chinese cuisine.
5) The restaurant owner did not know how to make desserts at all, and only gave feedback to the other chefs making Chinese cuisine and hence leaving the chef to do everything on her own.
6) The chef agreed to make desserts for the restaurant because she too, wanted to use her skills to help improve the restaurant's reputation although she did not like making desserts. But now she did not understand why she bothered with helping the restaurant when everyone in the restaurant did not even care.

Obviously you can tell that the chef is me. I have so much negative emotions pent up in me each time I go to them. Many times I thought that I want to stop making these desserts for them because I am unhappy doing these things and since I don't see them showing some appreciation to what I did, I do not see the reason to stick to making these desserts. But I cannot quit  now because they have spread the news of a new desserts menu coming out. I can only feel regret to why I agreed to make desserts for them at the first place.

But, these feelings aside, I do realize that they mean no harm and they are also busy with their own things. They may also not know how to help me with the things I am doing, as I have to do most of the procedures on my own.

205,"I received my b.s. In math and physics which led me to grad school which I am now receiving my masters in cosmology. I would say I went to grad school because I had no clue what to do next. My advisor as an undergrad recommended Astro direction and I took to it without much thought because I did think it was cool. 

Fast forward to me in grad school getting by with absolutely no Astro background being confused by every little thing. I did research with advisor/post docs and struggled because there wasn't really anything to do and thus I don't fee I learned much. I only did a remote observing one time and I thought it was interesting, but I am beyond confused about the it all on the tech side that I should probably know. 

I am now working as an intern working at a business solution position for a finance department which is helping me develop coding experience but I know this isn't what I want. I want to get back into the Astro field or at least something more physics like.

207,"For the last 3.5 years, I'd been working retail at a local small business. The pay was good - $10.25/hr, the hours weren't bad, and management was management. I was working on finishing up my degree in English and worked part time to make a living. I finished my degree in December and immediately hit the Internet, searching for jobs relatively in my field. 

At my retail job, I'd become their social media and content creation coordinator, so I had some pretty good skills for my resume beyond basic retail stuff as well as a portfolio. 

A month ago I did an interview with a local nonprofit for their ""Digital Media Specialist"" position. Full time job, benefits after 60 days, $11/hr. I accepted the position but became dismayed very quickly, as my job assignments were few and far between and most of them were never part of any of the job descriptions. 

For the last couple weeks, I've been sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day, nearly pulling my hair out with boredom and frustration. This week I have interviews at a couple companies for jobs that pay much better, however they are not a given. Just interviews. 

But I'm ready to quit now. I'm usually not a quitter, but I cannot spend this much time daily doing nothing. I need to feel challenged or at least occupied. 

My boss at my old retail job is willing to offer my position back at full time. I'd lose a few hours and a few cents on my paychecks, but at least there I felt busy and enjoyed my work. 

So, help me, please. What should I do? Should I continue to stick this out until I can find something else? Or should I go back to what I know and enjoy while I remain on the hunt for a job? 

Also, how do you quit a job you just started when your boss is never there?",08Mar2017,1
208,"Hey reddit, I am currently in my spring semester of my Junior year of college. I was originally a Biology B.S. major completing my pre-med requirements. I messed up very bad my freshman year of college and decided to not tell anyone and attempt to fix everything on my own. Currently my GPA sits at 2.4 and I understand this is lackluster. I know I have the capability of achieving more but I do not have a passion for medicine and simply pursued it in regards to my parent's desire. I feel as if I have been asleep and am just now opening my eyes. Currently I have a plan to attend a community college for 2 semesters and achieve a 4.0 and attempt to transfer into another 4-year university as a business or engineering major. I wanted the advice of those who faced something similar or can understand my predicament and give me advice. Is my plan solid or are there holes present that I do not see?

210,"Sorry in advance if this ends up being long...

I am a 25/f working 60-80 hours a week between my two jobs. I am an Operations Manager at a small arts non-profit and a FOH manager at a local gastropub.

I started out at my arts job in 2013, fresh out of college. It is a two-person administrative staff, and it has always been way too much work for two people. I was lucky to work with an amazing director (the other staff member) for 3 years, and we really did a good job running the place as a team. We had a good relationship, worked well together, and he has become one of my very good friends. About a year ago, I decided to start looking for jobs doing similar work around the country, as my SO was graduating with the Master's and we didn't have any real reason to stay in this community. I had a number of interviews and even a job offer, but I turned it down for a number of reasons. Before I got too deep in my job search, my co-worker dropped a huge bomb on me by telling me that he was leaving to work for the local university (a very large institution that employs a majority of professionals in the area). I was so happy for him. This place takes such a toll on your mental health, and it is in no way a long-term job option. He had been here for 6 years and it was time that he worked in a more supportive environment that paid him accordingly.

The board took nearly 3 months to get a replacement in the office (I was by myself running the place for 2 months), and it has been downhill ever since. The replacement is not fit for the job, and the organization has hurt beyond my control. It is not solely this person's fault - we also have a dysfunctional board and a decline in community support. I feel like I'm on a sinking ship.

My quality of life has plummeted. I can't even enjoy days off any more because of the stress of what dumpster fire I will walk into the next day. Or I'm always waiting for a call or text from my coworker or an artist to derail my time off. I can't escape work anymore because I don't trust the person in charge, and they are not good at fixing problems or figuring things out for themselves.

When I am in the office, I am constantly being interrupted to do things that I shouldn't have to do. My time is disrespected and I finally decided on NYE, when a work crisis ruined a fun night my SO and I had planned together, that I would be done with this job before the end of the fiscal year (June 30, 2017). Life is too short to be this miserable.

I work 30+ hours a week at a gastropub. I picked up the job because at the time I was only working 4 days a week at my arts job, making barely enough to get by if I lived in a studio apartment and ate Ramen every day. I luckily advocated for myself when my coworker left and got brought on 5 days a week (30 hours) with a raise that brought my salary to JUST BARELY above living wage for my county.

In August, I was promoted to a management position at the restaurant, bringing my average hourly including tips to more than my arts job. It's a great gig, I love my coworkers, and I love working there. Every time I have a bad day at the arts job, I come in for my night shift and end up leaving in a great mood, smiling. However, I am a very driven person, and I am always afraid of getting stuck in serving/bartending forever and never doing what I really want to do (which I am still figuring out).

I did the math, and if I work 40 hours a week at the restaurant, I can pull at least $40k annually there, which is totally reasonable for my living situation (living with SO, splitting about $1300-1400 in living expenses monthly). It's not like I'm quitting my job and risking being broke.

Of course, I am job searching here. My SO is working multiple jobs and has student loans to pay eventually, but is likely going to land a decent full-time job in an office he worked in as a grad student and currently as extra help (the hiring authority ADORES him, and he has already been basically doing the job in the previous employee's absence). I just applied for a position that I think I could do very well and would enjoy doing, and I believe that I had very strong application materials. Now it's just a waiting game. There are two more jobs that I know of that haven't been posted yet, so I hope something will work out. All of them are Academic Professional jobs at the University, full-time, pay well, and have benefits (I lose health insurance at 26, in less than 6 months). Even if it doesn't, I have the restaurant and can make it work. Everything will be okay in the end, in theory.

So, what I am having trouble with is leaving my arts job. Not to make myself sound like some godly force of nature that can never be replaced, but with what is going on here, they are going to be SOL when I leave. I am planning on giving them at least 30 days notice (stated as the expected period on my contract, but it's at-will so I don't even HAVE to do that). I plan on submitting my resignation to the board via email in the first week of April with a final day of employment being in the second week of May. I have already written the email and it is sitting in the draft folder of my personal email. I am very anxious about doing this, partly because my former coworker was put through the ringer when he quit (every inappropriate question was asked and he was unjustly criticized for how he was leaving and that he didn't tell them he was job searching - all things that I and our colleagues disagree with. The board is full of shit and he did everything by the book in the most professional manner). I know that I have to tell my new coworker in person, not just let her read the email when she gets to it that day while I sit right next to her at my desk (having a shared windowless office is a living hell, btw). I can't decide when to do it. Monday morning? Friday morning? Friday afternoon? Either way I'm going to stress about it all day before. I know she is going to freak out and ask me why and try to get me to stay and I need to prepare answers to all of those questions. As of now, I plan to keep it simple. I have learned a lot and enjoyed my time here, but that time is coming to an end. The why is not as important as the fact that I am leaving and we need to focus on what needs to be done in my time left here. I am leaving to work full time and take on more responsibilities at my other job. I'm sweating just thinking about it. After their most recent candidate search, I am not at all confident that they will be able to find a replacement before my departure, and I really do not plan on committing to training a new person after my employment has ended.

Professional is not how I would describe my work environment. I have been asked inappropriate questions, such as when I took a day off, I was asked ""Were you job searching?"" I immediately replied that it was not a yes or a no, simply that I would not answer that question as it was inappropriate. That is just one example.

The organization is in a bit of a financial crisis right now and I can tell they are terrified of losing me. 

So, this did end up being long. What I am really looking for is advice on how to make my resignation and departure as painless as possible. And reassurance that I am doing the right thing for me. I'm at the point where I'd rather be poor and happy than ""rich"" and miserable.

TL;DR: Leaving my miserable job of 4 years because I can't take it anymore. The circumstances make me nervous about resigning and I need advice on how to do it. I do have another job that can keep me financially stable (enough) until I find something more permanent. ",08Mar2017,2
212,"My sister is full of shit, she told me the other day that she asked reddit for advice about me and that they all thought I was an asshole, was crazy, and needed therapy. She even told our parents when the shit she says is all bullshit. I don't know who she is on here but let me tell you about her.

She's disgusting, no one in this house wants to see this bitch's ass and vagina. She doesn't wear any fucking panties and sits around in places like the living room is. I don't feel like seeing the drapes of my own fucking sister. And worse I can't not see that because her ass is lazy and has no job even though she's nineteen. Then she begs and begs for stuff and probably makes money hooking.

Somehow she always has a bit of cash, she claims and swears she's a virgin but my own friend has already fucked her. He even did it twice and said the third time she wanted him too was when she was skipping baths and he bailed out. And I've heard her with guys in her room at night and also bumped into them. But oh I guess they just have sleepovers with her and watch porn together. I really hate that bitch.

There's days she wears the exact same pajamas day in and day out for like 3 days straight and no baths and because she wants to be commando you can smell her. And it's just so annoying being in the same house as her. My parents let her do whatever because she bitches, whines, and complains for hours on something till she gets what she wants. Even though I have a job my parents force me to take her places she wants to go and unless they give her money, I don't know how this bitch pays for it. And she's completely rude. Not grateful at all for my time telling me to hurry up or I'm wasting her time and other shit. Just anything that makes me want to drive her off a bridge.

She's completely toxic, all she does is sit on the couch in the living room texting, playing on her laptop, or watching tv. And that's it, she doesn't do chores like I do, she doesn't cook like I do, she just lazes all day and wastes everyone's money. 

When people claim oh your sister is hot can I date her, I just facepalm. If looks made someone attractive then that bitch must be blessed. She's when you meet her very horrible and disgusting, she's a slut, and lazy. She couldn't even be a housewife because she thinks a guy is supposed to serve her. And she won't get a job so I wish she could go live in a cardboard box. I have no respect for the bitch and I really despise her if you haven't noticed.

I feel like there was a lot of shit I had to get off my chest so I made that big rant. The advcie I would need is how to live with someone like this. Not only do I see up her skirt but when I take her places I get looks just because I'm with her. She comes to my job when I'm working with her friend as asks me for money then distracts me from my job. She stays in the living room so I have to deal with her unless I shut out my family in my room and then I can't do that because she begs them to force me to take her places. She's a bitch and just really fucks up this family. Anyone anywhere give me advice on how to live with this.",08Mar2017,31

I have been searching for a new job because in addition to constantly being called/texted/emailed when I'm supposed to be off, my boss (and the company in general) just doesn't give a shit about the well-being of its employees. I decided I didn't want to continue working for a company I don't believe in, and so I have been searching for a new job on my own time for about six months. I took 3 approved vacation days this week to just relax and destress a little bit, and as luck would have it, have received an offer from a company I've been talking to for a while. It's a good offer and I intend to accept it, but now that I'm on my vacation days and my boss won't leave me the hell alone, is it a dick move if I ignore him? I plan to turn in my notice upon my return, and I will continue working at the same level I've been working at until my last day.

It just infuriates me that he can't back off while I'm on vacation!! These are the only vacation days I've taken since Christmas, and I did it specifically to get away from the stress of the office. If I hadn't received the offer, I would still be pissed but would probably cave and end up going in before my vacation is over. 

I think this is just the culmination of months of feeling underappreciated, ignored, and stomped on - now I'm prepared to move on and I just want to ignore him while I'm off. Is that okay?

231,"Using a throwaway account because I’m a bit concerned about family or friends finding this.

I’m a 29 year old female, and my older sister is 31. We’ve always been relatively close (we’re the only daughters, and my family is not super close with the extended members), we even lived together for almost 3 years in a house, along with her boyfriend/fiancé/now husband, from 2010-2013. They had a baby almost a year ago, so I’ve been seeing them a lot more lately. I live about two hours away, and visit at least once a month.

All of that said, my sister is, frankly, a bitch to me. She likes to make fun of me, not in a playful way, but in a mean way that pokes fun at my insecurities, like how I have a big butt or no boobs. I have a chronic medical condition (type one diabetes), and she makes fun of that all the time. Recently I said that I’d bring a low-carb dessert to a family dinner, and she said, in front of our family, “Ewww, well I’m going to bring something that’s FULL of carbs.”

I’ve had close friends ask me why I still spend time with her because they’ve witnessed her nasty attitude, or her belittling, embarrassing, or teasing me. People have suggested I see her less, but now that she has a baby, who I adore, I can’t not see her! Plus my family likes to spend time all together (like we’ve planned a family vacation together this summer), so I cannot cut off all contact. I’ve tried to get her to back off on the teasing over the years, but she will stop for a few weeks, and then start again. Or she puts all the blame back on me and says I'm being too sensitive. It makes no difference. I’ve accepted that we’re never going to have the relationship I’d like to have, but the teasing and nastiness has got to stop.

Any ideas on how to have a mature talk with her? I’m super non-confrontational, and I’ve had serious talks with her before, and I usually get upset and cry, which I feel makes me seem weak or belittles my argument. And as I said, I’ve tried to get her to stop, and she will for a time, but always starts again. Or says I'm too sensitive and to relax.

255,"I'm a 22 year old guy. Virgin, never had a girlfriend.

I just feel sad thinking about it. I've been doing online dating for years and nothing ever seems to work out. I fell in love once but she moved away.

I just feel really sad. Like, it just feels so hard and impossible to get a girlfriend. It seems like everyone else is getting into relationships and meeting people and I'm just stuck in a place.

I'm really terrified of being a 35 year old virgin. I really think it is going to happen.

Girls never approach me. And when I approach them it just never seems to work out. Three girls right now on social media won't get back to my messages.

I just feel really sad. I guess what triggered this sadness is I went to help a girl move into her new apartment with her boyfriend. I saw their relationship and I was so jealous and sad. I just want that so badly, you know? I just want a girlfriend, I know that sounds extremely whiny. 

How do I feel better about this? Like, just seeing that girl with her life together and a hot boyfriend made me feel so little. And she was the same age as me and has had a ton of sex. 

I don't know what my problem is. I don't know why people don't talk to me or reach out to me.",08Mar2017,1

257,"I run for a high-end Division I Track and Field program in college, and I’m utterly exhausted. 


So far, I’m a freshman in my second semester. I’m specifically a Mid-Distance runner, surrounded by other athletes who can compete at incredible speeds. Every day I wake up tired and go to sleep tired. I eat healthy, I run every single day, and I would do anything to continue getting better at this sport. On average, I’ll run about 50 Miles a week, 60-70 if it's during the Summer or Fall in preparation for Cross Country. Yet I am so incredibly tired, and I feel overworked. 

In high school, I came from a very well accomplished track and field program, which I worked my way up from the bottom to the top. I ended up as captain my senior year, and went on to help assist my team win States and Regional titles multiple times. I went into the summer before college confident I could accomplish anything. I trained very hard and diligently, (In fact, hindsight is 20/20, I likely trained too hard) and entered college in a different way than most people probably would. My first day was a ridiculous 10 mile workout day, where the incoming freshman were pitted against the upperclassmen in a tempo run. You were only allowed to race that season if you were not dropped from the pack. Needless to say, not everyone makes it. Me, being a more mid-distance runner against several of the best XC runners in the region, I dropped pretty badly: a mixture of overtraining earlier that summer and simple inexperience. Out of 8 freshman who were recruited to run for my school, 3 ended up racing that season. Another 3 became injured, and the other 2 were too exhausted.

That cross country season became the bane of my existence. I was determined to succeed, and wouldn’t falter at the horrendously difficult workouts laid aside for me. That being said, it's about time I mention my coach, who is very old-school. This coach has ran a successful program for roughly 30 years. He has a set way of doing things his way, and is the opposite of a coach who would nurture an athlete to success. If you can’t keep up, you’re cut and replaced by someone else who will be recruited just to replace the spot you would have probably taken. Every workout drained me. I didn’t have the option to do slower workouts-it was either show up and get dropped by people better than you or quit. 

At this point, I don’t want to sound like i'm whining; I very well realize I could quit and end the struggling right there. My real problem is I love the sport more than anything else. More than any girlfriend. More than any other hobby, or skill. I love being fast, getting faster, and being around other friends and rivals who are very fast. When I’m in peak shape, I feel like I can do anything. My grades are great. My spirits are up. I’m the most popular person I can be. 

My freshman year has been a steady decline. I’ve focused purely on getting faster and keeping up with people much better than me. Other freshman have quit due to injury or exhaustion, while 2 or 3 have actually improved and been able to hang on. So far this year, I’ve made substantial changes to my life in favor of running faster times. I now eat incredibly healthy, and I drink only water and an occasional protein shake if the school supplies me with one. I do my homework 3 weeks in advance, and I don’t stay up past 11. (I have a double major in Journalism and Political Science). I try to sleep 9 hours a night. Rarely I’m successful, because I’m either busy making sure I’ve done everything I need to, or because I’m just very stressed out. Occasionally, I wake up in cold sweats in the middle of the night. I stretch before I go to sleep and after I wake up, before and after I run. I went out of my way to find a doctor who could help me understand why I’ve competed so slow this year compared to high school. He advised taking Vitamins A, B, C, D, and extra calcium, as well as Iron. I gave blood, and urine to look at my systems more closely, and several months ago found I was near anemic. Since then I’ve taken supplements to correct it. At this point, my iron level is better, but I can handle less and less running every day. I don’t drink or smoke or party too often. I even got a therapist (I hate therapy) to talk about my issues on the track to see if I can sleep better at night. I lift 2-3 times a week. I run everyday, and when I need an occasional day off, I take one. I’m just not sure what I’m doing wrong.

Despite getting dropped in that initial first workout, I was still in considerable shape. Making the jump from running 5ks to 8ks has drained me since. There is no pop to my races anymore. Everyday feels sluggish. I’m depressed. I have less friends than when I started, and the team doesn’t really care about me. The only friends I had at this University were the teammates I started with. Even my roommate who has already succeeded at securing a coveted spot on the team could care less. We rarely talk. We’re too different. The coach won't race me until I average a 1:53 or a 4:15. Until I’m able to prove I can manage at least that, I’m stuck in this terrible cycle of stress, anxiety, and depression. Right now, I’m slower than I was in high school when I was a 1:54/4:25 guy. I haven’t managed anything close to that since I got to this school. From what I can deduce is that it’s a mixture of having overtrained in the summer, stress, and post-anemia. 

If there is anyone qualified to give advice, I’m willing to hear it. The one thing that will never break is my spirit. I would chop off my left hand to achieve at least what I could in high school. I dream of getting faster every day. I’d train for any amount of time just to PR again. I would transfer to another school before quitting track. Although, I don’t really want to do that because this school is already very prestigious. I’ve sunk my life and earnings into this direction, I’d absolutely hate to change course now. I want to be able to make it work. I want to get good grades, and make many new friends. I want to be fast again, at any cost. I won’t quit; God built me to last, and I will not go gently.

260,"Long backstory: My boyfriend is in his mid-thirties. He's overweight (I think technically obese), has high blood pressure, and diverticulitis. He also has a blown out knee, and several other body pains he refuses to have investigated. It takes him a long time to get out of bed in the morning because of these pains. He's also sensitive to stress, and gets grouchy a lot. He also has scary moments where he sort of dazes out (he used to have a seizure disorder, so I'm thinking it might have something to do with that).

We are both involved in sports together, but once we're done, he doesn't carry any healthy habits home with him. He eats a lot of fast food, and when it's not fast food, it's a LOT of red meat (he went through five pounds of beef by himself in the last two days). He spends hours on the couch playing video games (note that I'm not knocking his gaming... I'm knocking the sedentary lifestyle), and rarely exercises. When he's not feeling well, he won't go to the doctor because he can't afford insurance (I'm in a similar boat).

He complains about being fat, and thinks that I don't find him attractive. Which isn't the case at all. If being fat was healthy, I wouldn't care. I love his body and the way he looks. I'm just worried about his health. 

I've tried encouraging healthy habits by inviting him to go for walks with me, and we moved our stationary bike and stair stepper in front of the TV, so he can at least pedal while he games, but it hasn't helped much. I also tried to take control of the kitchen and make healthy but yummy meals (like black beans and rice with salsa or veggie stirfry), but he starts pushing to get fast food instead. I've also told him I'm scared for his health, but he kind of brushes me off. I'm so worried that I'm going to wake up next to a corpse one day. The man is a walking time bomb for heart disease and cancer. 

How can I encourage him to change his habits without making it sound like I want him to change who he is or control him? I don't want to be a nagging girlfriend, but I'm quite literally afraid for his life, and I'm not sure what else to do.

Any strategies or tips would be appreciated.",08Mar2017,2

265,"On the 06/03/17, I was in Maths class facing the Maths door. I then heard my name being called and I turned my back to see a student with her iPhone camera pointed directly at me She then move her finger, clicking the ""Take Picture"" button. 

She had just taken a photo of me on the snap-chat app. She has done this more than once, she has done this about three times this school year. This time I was not having it.

On instinct, I told the teacher ""Miss, she took a picture of me"" pointing at her. I then went to grab for her iPhone, because on snap-chat you can download the pictures onto your ""Memories"".

We struggled for 3-4 seconds, (Note: my hands were ONLY on her iPhone.) She then pushed me away from her. After I left the classroom. After that I thought she had left it and I went about my business. I was then asked to be taken somewhere with a teacher. I followed. I was put into a small room with the same girl.

She had lied. She had falsely accused me of ""strangling"" her, she accused me of gripping her neck. She had accused me of also grabbing her hair trying to snap her neck to get her phone which she had added later. NONE of these were true, AT ALL.

She keeps denying that fact she took a picture of me saying she was just moving her phone from the right pocket to her left pocket. That was EXACTLY what she had said. ""I moved my iPhone from my bottom right hand pocket to my top left hand pocket"". She kept saying I had gripped her neck. After arguing I then asked her what she truly wanted.

She wanted me to say ""Sorry, for gripping your neck"". I did not say that. And I never will. 

Here is some information:

Girl: White-English, Female, 15
Me: Black-Irish, Male, 15

Country of Incident: United Kingdom, Manchester
Place of Incident: School

TL;DR: Girl takes photo of me with no consent for third time this year, so I grab phone to delete and she pushes me away. Now is making false claims I strangled her and tried to snap her neck by pulling her hair, which I did not.

I had also notice din the statement she had written, she detailed everything, going as far as to say the exact time, and exact pocket her phone was in, while I had simply said the basic truth with little to no detail...

There were witness but, they are all her friends and I am not popular at all in the school. The teacher I knwo for a fact has not seen anything because I asked her later.

Now I need your advice, how do I handle a female who wont admit what she had done and is making lies. How do I win this argument?

266,"Anonymous internet folks, I need help and I don't know what to do.    I know my situation is outside of the norm and vastly privileged, but I am reaching out for help with that in mind. 


First I'll provide the basics of my situation - my intent is not to ""humblebrag"", but to provide information that may help in understanding where I'm at.  


I'm a 35yo college dropout who got in the ground floor of a startup company 15 years ago and have worked my way up within the organization.  My only scholastic accreditation is the GED that I got when I was 16....but I'm a pretty sharp cookie and have worked my ass off to get where I am today.  Before joining my current company, I worked at a place where I started earning $60k/year when I was 18 and each consecutive year my income has increased.  The last 3 years I've averaged ~$150k annual gross income.  



I've been with this same company for the vast majority of my adult life, starting when there were only 30 employees and now we're at ~5,000.  The first few years of my employment I looked around and noticed that many of my entry-level peers were in their 40's &amp; 50's...and decided that I would do whatever it took to not be in the same boat as them when I reached that age.    


To that end, I made the conscious choice to throw myself into my work - essentially ""trading"" the next 10-15 years of my life in order to set myself up for later in life.  The end goal was so I would ultimately have the ability to pursue the things that actually fulfill me - exploring the creation of art, music, cooking, &amp; gardening.  Building a community of chosen family and working together to enrich eachother's lives.     



So here's where I'm at now:  While I *greatly* appreciate the opportunities my company has provided me and absolutely recognize that I wouldn't be in the position that I'm in today...I've become incredibly disillusioned with the company,  the value we provide to our customers and my limited ability to contribute to an impactful change.    The Kool-Aid dispenser has run dry.  I dread going to sleep each night because that means the avalanche of issues comes that much sooner the next morning.      




Something needs to change.  I have debilitating panic attacks when a customer/direct report/supervisor reaches out.  I'm drained at the end of each and every day - and my only beacon of light is my extremely supportive spouse.    



One of my **major** failings is that because my income has been so high, I never learned the basics of budgeting or how to live small or within my means.  I always knew that more money was coming in, so if I saw something for sale that I wanted (and it wasn't an exorbitant amount), I'd just buy it.  I've made significant progress on that front...but really I have no earthly idea on how to operate as a ""normal person"".  ",08Mar2017,1
268,"We adopted our cat over 2 years ago while we lived in and small one bedroom apartment and the cat was around and year old. We have since moved twice and now live in a much larger house. Her dislike towards the cat has only grown over this time and has caused countless arguments and aggravation between us. 

In my eyes, our cat is not bad at all. What my wife hates is when the cat runs down the hallway into the room where her food is. She does this many times each day because she is young and healthy. She also meows occasionally unless she is hungry, then she meows more. My wife also hates that. Our cat is scared of my wife at this point because the only interaction between them is that of anger and lecturing her for being a cat. There is no aggression from our cat to anyone, only love and playfulness. Unfortunately we keep her shut up in a bedroom while we are both at work and once I get home I let her out. If my wife is home, she stays in her room. 

My wife has said many times that she wants to get rid of the cat, that I care more about the cat than her etc etc. She resents the cat and, to me, it seems she is stuck in this loop of hating the cat. I love our cat and do not want to her rid of her. I have tried working with the cat and have succeeded in training/preventing the cat from doing many things already but some things you can't teach a cat to do and you just have to ignore.

271,"THIS WILL BE VERY LOOOONG STORY, SO SIT BACk, GRAB YOUR POPCORN, PREPARE YOUR SEATBELTS, BECAUSE ITS ROLLERCOASTER OF EMOTIONS!

I falled in love with girl from our elementary school (back then I was in 8th grade and she was in 7th grade). So, we went out two times with her other friends, and she is really cool. I eventually fell in love with her, but after we went to different high schools (in my country, we go to high school after 9th grade, but you can leave in 8th grade if both schools allow it, and she went in 8th grade). 

So, I started studying engineering and she went to economics. We were constantly writing, but we never went out again (I´ll get to the reason why later). Only one day, I saw that she is now dating my classmate (who eventually failed 1st year and will probably drop out) through photos on their walls. At first, I couldn´t believe it, I was like: ""This is some f*cked up joke, nonono."". Then she said it was official, but that her mother didn´t approve him. He eventually evolved into a 16 y.o. alcoholic smoker jackass, and dumped her because of her friend from elementary school, and dumped her. 

So, here is a reconstruction of our chat two months before the break-up.

She:""You should go out with us sometimes, it will be fun.""
Me:""Yeah, third wheel.""
She:""Ah, c´mon, we won´t ignore you!""
Me:""Yeah, I know how these situations evolve. We go out, you two start kissing and I will have to sit there watching you stick tongues into each other´s mouth, and I will eventually say that I have to go for my bus, but I will be walking near the river, thinking where I fucked up.""
She:""I will be talking to you.""
Me:""Yeah, that won´t be strange. At all.""
She:""What? Why?""
Me:""It´s like: Hey, mom, today I will come home late, I´m going out with this girl I love and with her boyfriend! Not fucking weird at all!""
She:""W... What? You.... Love me?""
Me:""Yeah.""
She:""How long?""
Me:""Since we went out first time.""
She:""Why haven´t you told me?""
Me:""I was too fucking afraid to say anything at all. I feared that you would reject me.""
She:""I kinda knew it. He told me that you were behaving strange since we announced it publicly.""
Me:""Oh, if you knew. I was furious. But I kept inside, because I knew that you two love each other and that he makes you happy.""
She:""Ok, let´s talk this out in person. Just you and me. We will go out on Thursday.""
Me:""Will you bring him with you?""
She:""I dunno, maybe not.""

So, we went out, and she brought him. He went to WC.
""So, why haven´t you told me that you love me?""
""I dunno. I was afraid, probably. You know that I´m introvert and that I don´t go out that much.""
""Why are you so passive? Why don´t you say anything?""
""I just... Don´t know what to say. It so easy over the chat, but in reality? It´s hard.""
""Ok, so how do we solve this out?""
""I dunno. For first few minutes I hoped that you two would broke up, but I see that he makes you happy and that breaking up would hurt you both.""
""So we should probably stay friends.""
""Yeah.""

I asked her on chat later:
Me:""WTF was that? You said he won´t be coming with you!""
She:""I´m sorry. I thought that things would play out differently.""
Me:""Look, I love you but...""
She:""Don´t say that. You know we should be just friends, and nothing more.""
Me:""Ok. Look, I can´t contain my love for you. I can try, but I don´t promise anything.""
She:""And how do you want to do that?""
Me:""We should stop writing. If you love him, you should hold him tight. I can´t love you when you don´t love me.""
She:""No! I want you in my life! You are my best friend!""
Me:""I´m sorry, but I got to forget you if I want to move on without you. Goodbye.""

That was month before last year´s summer break. Two months later, they broke up. Eventually, I found out from one of her friends that I was still in contact with that they broke up during summer, because of reasons mentioned above. So, I prepared myself and wrote:

Me:""Hi.""
She:""Hi.""
Me:""So, tell me, how was your summer?""
She:""Awful. He broke up with me because of that bitch. I have a lot of family problems and I attempted suicide.""
Me:""Oh, God, if I´d have known, I´d be there for you. Sorry for what happened.""

So, we started writing again, and she wrote two days ago that we should go out sometime. I asked her if she would really like me sometimes and that if I got even the smallest chance with her, but she said no, that I´m only her friend, but that she loves me.

So, my questions are:
How deep in friendzone am I?
So, does she love me or not?
If we will really go out on that date, what should we do? I never got any girlfriend, so I don´t know what to do on a date.

287,"Let me start off by saying that I believe that hatred is a bad thing. Nothing worthwhile comes from it in the grand scheme of things. Also you should know that I am a massive hypocrite for condemning hatred in any way.

I can honestly say that I have never loved my father. The actual thought of loving one’s father is something that I still find to be rather confusing even now (I’m 23) because I grew up thinking that all fathers were just like mine. I first met him when I was 3 years old. That moment is so vividly burned into my memory I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forget it. To put it simply, things didn’t go very well and it’s been a downhill “relationship” since that day.

I could talk for hours about what I don’t like about him. He’s a narcissist that believes he’s always right and anything he does, no matter how horrible, is always justified. He has a habit of subconsciously “re-writing” his memories or how events took place so that he’s always right or to make himself look like a victim (e.g. there was a time where he was alone at home and he fell and hurt himself, but then the story became that he hurt himself and was calling for me to help him but I ignored him and let him suffer, despite the fact that I wasn’t even around when it happened). He believes he’s a genius and that everyone around him is vastly inferior to him. He has this mindset where if he believes something, then it is a 100% absolute fact even if there is concrete evidence that contradicts his beliefs. (We actually have a saying that if he believed the sky was green, going outside and looking up to see a blue sky wouldn’t convince him that he was wrong.) He tells lies about people in order to make himself look better or to make others sympathize with him. He sees people as objects and has always treated my family members and me as though we were his possessions that solely exist for his own selfish purposes. He once took a set of hair clippers when I was 8 and ran the powered blades across my face to shave my “beard”, despite the fact that I obviously had no facial hair, because he thought it was funny to hurt me. I had several cuts on my face afterwards, but he didn’t care in the slightest. His worst trait, however, is his abusive nature.

 My father has been both verbally and physically abusive to not only myself, but my siblings and my mother for as long as I’ve known him. There was one time when, when I was 7, where we were all in the car together on the road. My father was driving, my mother was in the passenger seat, and my siblings and I were in the backseat. My parents got into an argument (nothing out of the ordinary for them) that eventually lead to my father pulling the car over to the side of the road so he could start hitting my mother while my siblings and I just watched in the back. There are a lot of moments like that. He has a fuse as long as a grain of rice and believes that he’s justified no matter how violent he gets. He often says things like, “You made me mad” to excuse his behavior. I used to be absolutely terrified of him when I was a child. I’d have nightmares where he would be chasing after me, hunting me down, and the only way I could get away from him in the dream would be to kill myself so I could wake up. My life was filled with that fear. I’d watch him lose his temper and attack my sisters or I’d say or do something wrong and he’d come for me. Sometimes I deserved it because I was a shitty kid, but growing up I had very little interaction with my father outside of him hitting me. I’d thought of running away several times, but I was always afraid that the police would be able to find me then I’d be brought back home and my father would beat me even more. Living with that daily fear eventually pushed me to the point when I was 10 where I tried to kill myself. I didn’t go through with it, but I feel like that was a turning point in my life.

 I can’t really pick a point in my life and say “This right here is the moment when I started to hate him”, but I think that my hatred was mainly born out of my fear of him. As a kid I’d thought of killing him several times, but as I got older (starting to become a teenager) I really tried to make a conscious effort to forgive him for everything and learn to love him. Because, as I said before, hate is a very bad thing. I tried for years to get rid of the hate I had for him, but I couldn’t do it. No matter what method I tried I just couldn’t let go of all the hatred. I couldn’t forgive him. I couldn’t stop thinking about wanting to kill him, even if I meant ruining my life by doing so. I became obsessed with him. My hate for my father was (and still is) the strongest feeling I had within myself. It was greater than how much I cared for my friends or my siblings or even my own life/future. I couldn’t stop thinking about just utterly destroying him. It’s a feeling that’s very difficult to put into perfectly accurate words. But simply the thought of waking up in the morning or going to sleep at night and knowing that he was alive was enough to enrage me. And time and time again I tried to confront myself and let go of my negative emotions, but I just could not do it. It’s something that I struggle with everyday. I can’t even look at a picture of him without becoming angry. There was a time, just two or three years ago, where he was asleep on the couch. I was the only one at home with him. And I stood in front of his unconscious body with an 8” kitchen knife in my hand while I had an internal dilemma as to whether I should just do it once and for all or put the knife down and walk away from him. After about 15 minutes I decided to not do it, but I didn’t feel like I made the right choice. I felt angry at myself for not having the strength to do what I needed to be done.

Part of me wants to stop hating him because I’m essentially letting my feelings for someone I don’t like control my life. Everything is about him. I can’t stop thinking about him and how much he disgusts me. But another part of me is genuinely afraid to forgive him because I feel like by doing so I’d be throwing away a huge part of who I am as a person. I can’t even imagine who or what I’d be if I didn’t hate my father and that terrifies me. I honestly don’t think there is really anything more to me than my hatred. I see so many people online and in real life talking about how toxic hatred is and how you shouldn’t live with it. They say things like how hatred is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to die. But I feel like it’s impossible to get rid of that poison. It’s already inside my body and coursing through my veins.

So does anyone have any advice about how to overcome something like this? I’d really appreciate any insight at all.",08Mar2017,1

291,"I am a graduate student in the NE region. The impetus for all of this is that I accidentally helped another student with a project in a way that I shouldn't have. Faculty members decided that this constituted unprofessional behavior and that I needed to do something to prove I understood the concept of professionalism. I had to write an essay to talk about professionalism, what professionalism means and why what I did was unprofessional. 

I had to submit it by January 23, but I submitted it on 2/2. I initially had an email from my faculty member asking me why it was late on 1/27, and I said I'd get it to them in 3-4 days, which is a deadline I didn't meet. When I did submit it on 2/2, in my email that I used to send the assignment, I said that I'd been dealing with previously unmentioned family issues (my mother had been away in another country and hadn't contacted anybody in over 2 weeks) and that's why I didn't submit it on time.

The essay itself was fine according to faculty. They said the essay met the requirements of what I needed to do. However, by me submitting it late I demonstrated another unprofessional behavior.

They said that I had had previous contact with the faculty on 1/27 and that I should have contacted them at that point to let them know of the reason I was unable to do the assignment on time. They also mentioned that I had been to class in the entire timespan that the assignment was due and also took an exam (on 1/31) with no problems, so that brought up an issue of why I couldn't complete the assignment but still take an exam and also go to class. They asked me, ""Why didn't you tell us about the family issue earlier""

The thing is, I was just on auto pilot and so I would go to class like usual and then just head back home and call family members and try to figure out what was happening with my mom. When I got the email from the faculty member asking me why it was late on 1/27, I thought that I could get it together and that I would be able to submit it in the time frame I provided. However I couldn't because I just couldn't handle the stress of the family situation. 

As to why I couldn't let the faculty know of the issue earlier, the real issue was this: My mother went to another country and cheated on my father. When she got there, she had told someone her plan to do such a thing and I found out the day of 1/23 so it literally made it so that I just wasn't able to finish the assignment even though I had previously planned to finish it that day. 

I didn't share the info that I was dealing with a family issue because 

1: I wasn't thinking straight 

2: I didn't want to share such info with other people since it's so personal and intimate and I thought I was better off submitting it late

3: I eventually told my father of the issue about me submitting the assignment and he advised me to just let them know that I hadn't heard from my mother in a few weeks, which wasn't a lie.

I have a meeting to discuss the intricate details about this with faculty to provide my perspective. They don't know the stuff about my mom having an affair, only that I wasn't able to contact her for more than 2 weeks. However I'm worried that they will think I'm lying or that even if they believe me that I am unprofessional for not handling the issue correctly and if it goes that way, the faculty informed me that I WILL be expelled.

I am so incredibly stressed out right now. I know that this is partially my fault, and even though I have a reason for my behavior I can't help but think I'll get expelled. Please help me find some sanity and provide some advice to get my mind straight.",08Mar2017,1

295,"So when my Flatmate and I, a good friend from university, moved into our flat in London together he asked if he could get his girlfriend a key cut. We'd already signed the lease at this point so I called him in a panic to clarify 'I'm not moving in with you *and* your girlfriend am I?' There has been historical friction between me and his girlfriend but that's largely behind us. Forgiven but not forgotten.

He reassured me that she wouldn't be around much, and we've just gone one year living together and it's been fine.

This evening I've got a text from his girlfriend explaining how she's quitting her job and wants to spend more time in London before she leaves for her post-grad in September -six months away- and basically would I mind if she moved in.

My gut reaction was 'oh why not' because I'm a spineless pushover. However after about 3 seconds my brain started screaming 'nononononononononononononononono'. I don't enjoy her company, but I've never complained about her coming over; mainly because her visits are infrequent and because her boyfriend is my flatmate and very good friend. It's a very small flat. I like to walk round in my pants and spread out on the sofa playing xbox on the big tv. I like to bring random guys back from the club to plough. I like that it's just my flatmate and I here. I like that it's just us guys.  It's quiet and comfy and homely and to be honest any guests disturb that for me. Even when it's guests I like, after one night I'm wondering when they'll fuck off.

I'm annoyed at my flatmate who is in his room next door probably on the phone to her eagerly awaiting my response. He couldn't even have the courage to discuss it with me himself, probably because he remembers the conversation prior to moving in and can guess how I feel about it. I'm guessing he told her that I wouldn't be keen too, judging by the tone of her text message.

I've decided not to respond to the message. I'm going to sleep on it and talk to my flatmate about it tomorrow evening.

Am I a bad person? Am I being a bad friend? Should I grit my teeth and bare it? Let her move in? Should I stick by my guns and say no? If so how do I explain to my flatmate that I'd rather live with the creature from the black lagoon than his girlfriend?",08Mar2017,2

303,"My friend has been complaining about body aches and pains for a while now. Doctors have not been able to find the reason for this. Just last week, I found out she will need an MRI. She didn't go into details and was a bit emotional about it when I asked about it, so I haven't asked or brought it up since. From what I've heard, it may potentially be tumor related.

For the most part, I have done my best to be as positive as I can around her and distracting her with other topics - mainly because I don't want her to stress or worry about the upcoming MRI and results. Is there anything more I can be doing? Anything reassuring I can say to her before her MRI? Am I doing the right thing by steering clear of talking about her health concerns?

I really want to do my best to help her out without making her stress or worry.

306,"I'm 19 years old and dating someone a year younger than me who I love very much. I'm planning on staying with them my whole life, and couldn't imagine a life without them. Problem is, occasionally I get very upset around them, because they're good at a lot of things I wish I was good at. They also had a successful childhood filled with lots of friends, happiness, and activity. They were in marching band and jazz band, and they find making music very easy as a result of all that experience. They're also very good at art of all kinds (in fact their major is art) and they're planning on becoming an animator.

I'm not really good at anything that I'm happy and excited to do. I'm good at mediating arguments and being a waiter, for example, but one of those things can't be made into a career without college (which is not an option for me due to my high school grades) and one of them is stressful and not fun in the least.

I get very mixed feelings when my significant other shows me their art or music, as I'm happy for them and really excited, but it just makes me feel bad about myself immediately. It makes me unmotivated to do anything, or to learn anything. I feel like it'll take years to learn skills that I can actually make into hobbies or careers that I'll enjoy, and to me that isn't worth the effort at all. It's led to a suicide attempt, even. I feel pretty much worthless and unmotivated to make any change. 

So my questions are: Should I resolve this with my significant other? I don't want them to stop showing off, really, I just don't want to feel bad when they do. Is there anything they can help with in that? They feel pretty bad about the situation too. What can I do to make it easier for myself? What can I do to motivate myself to pick up hobbies or try to learn new skills that doesn't involve a ton of money? Keep in mind I have someone around me constantly that is already very good and has years ahead of me on basically everything I want to do. Any general advice given this situation would be appreciated, really. Don't be afraid to give me a different answer than what you see on the thread already, because at this point I'll take anything.",08Mar2017,1
307,"So I'll make this short - I've got no idea what the fuck to do.

She left her purse at mine today and I glimpsed her driving license - she is actually 27 years old turning 28. 

I have no idea what to do from this point. Do I confront her or just leave it? No idea why a really good friend would hide this from me and to be honest I'm a bit hurt and confused. We are going on holiday in a few weeks and I am seriously reconsidering everything. This level of deceit is just mindboggling to me.

308,"Hey,

First thing to know is I'm from South Africa. Please keep that in mind when you read the following.

So I turn 30 in August, and I have a huge problem.

- I still live with my parents who are barely making ends meet.
- I don't have my driver's licence yet (soon hopefully).
- I dropped out of school at 16 and can't seem to get work; vicious circle this one is because I can't afford to finish my education because I can't get work because I don't have an education. For unskilled and semi-skilled work I have the Broad Based Black Economic Employment Empowerment Equity working against me because White males aren't covered by it.

Broad Based Black Economic Employment Empowerment Equity is basically Affirmative Action though down here in South Africa, rather than assisting minorities is actually works against them by benefiting the majority. The only country in the world where 80% of the population of the country need affirmative action to beat out an 8% minority in employment.

I don't see a way out. Even if I could get unskilled or semi-skilled work I'll be earning minimum wage, which would mean half my salary goes to petrol each month alone since I don't drive and when I do get my licence I'll be expected to fill up so on a salary of around R3000 (which is generous on minimum wage) I'll spending at least 30% of that on petrol alone. 

It's not nearly enough to live on so I don't see a point; potentially I could prove myself worth cultivating but it seems highly unlikely that any businesses looking for un/semi-skilled labor would put themselves out for a 30 year old nobody. I mean if anything, being where I am shows that I've had the most appalling luck in life or I've been horrendously and contemptibly lazy; I think it's a mixture of both to be honest.

On the other hand, I can't start a business because people down here a reluctant or outright refuse to do business with folks who aren't BEE businesses or don't have a BEE score, and since BEE doesn't cover white males, I don't have any of that.

In terms of getting my education; I can't get the loan and due to my academic history friends and family are either unwilling or unable to take the loan out on my behalf which leaves in the lurch where I'd have to finance it myself.
Tertiary education is far too expensive; to a point where friends and family are completely unable to take the loan out on my behalf even if they wanted to.

I've been looking into emigrating to countries like Norway and Denmark where there's more options for folks like myself, but my lack of an education is erecting a giant wall on that front either; the only hope being the someone from inside the country can sponsor me, and while I do know folks who could, they won't do it for nothing, and aren't quite sure what they'd tan out of my hide in payment yet, so they don't.

Honestly, I feel hopeless and stuck. I don't know where to go from here, and all I really want at this stage is to be in my own place living life on my terms, and what that requires is:

- R4000-R5000 for rent of a single bedroom place
- R2000-R5000 for car payments (R5000 = expensive car)
- R2000 maybe R3000 for petrol a month
- R2000-R3000 for groceries a month
- +/-R1000 for meat a month
- +/-R1000 for internet a month
- +/-R1000-R2000 water and electricity a month
For a total of R13000 - R20000 a month, not counting costs for appliances, furniture etc, just for me to live on my own.

Coming from where I am, I don't see how it's possible for me to earn that much regardless of what I do; job, business... it doesn't seem possible to me at the moment, but I'm still looking out for how to make the money.

Going back to getting a job; even if I got one on minimum wage, without advancement opportunities I'm never going to reach a point where I can live on my own term, and how long until advancement opportunities come? I'd really rather not be working 60 hour weeks for 20 years so I can finally leave home and start only just living my life at 50.

Don't misunderstand from that last comment; I'm not afraid to put in hard work and long hours. I worked for 3 years in a fast food place until the boss closed it down; mopping floors, cleaning grease traps, serving customers, making food, doing prep... it was hard work, long hours and getting dirty for R7.50 an hour at 57 hour weeks if I got a day off for a total of R1710 a month.

I'd really appreciate any insight and ideas that anyone might have. Regardless of how obvious your ideas are, please send them; I'll probably tell you why they can't work, but that's not of being defeatist (although I do feel very defeated), it's really out of trying to find something that's workable.

311,"Hi,

I have been thinking about a different haircut for quite some time now, but never really know what I want.

I am kind of thinking about growing my hair longer (I'm a male), I saw someone on the bus with long hair and it looked awesome. (I am also into rock/metal, it's not just because that one guy on the bus lol)

I got couple of questions, though

Does long hair fit everyone, or is it just for specific persons. (Because everyone has a different face structure etc)

How fast does it get greasy (especially the part that just hangs around your shoulders)

How much time should one spend on his hair to get it good looking (so that it looks healthy and looked after)

I got thick hair, does this affect long hair, if so, positively or negatively?

Would really appreciate some advice, I am 17 years old btw

312,"As the title says, my friend brags about everything he is good at. 

So basically what happens is that one of my friends is talented at a lot of stuff. He's good at sports, hes smart. But the thing is, he brags about all of his stuff. 

For example, one time we were doing a worksheet at our school and he was quickly getting it done. Once he got it done, he says ""done"" like he's the best. I just tried to ignore it but he keeps saying hes done and he is smarter than me at that subject. I get very salty, but I just try to ignore it and casually just try to do my work. I always just want to 1-up them, but I know that they are just trying to get attention so I just ignore it. 

Also, he tries to be popular by trying to get attention by all the popular kids. One time, one of the popular kids sat in my seat and I politely asked them to get out of my seat. They said no and said ""go back to asia"", as I am asian. My braggy friend just said I got roasted and when class started and I sat in my seat, he keeps on saying that I got exposed etc. It makes me sooooo salty and I feel like I just want to punch him in the stomach. He is always mean to me but nice to all the popular kids because he wants to be friends with them. 

I don't know, it's kindof a stupid subject to post about. But the thing is, it effects with my school too. When my teacher is teaching us about an lecture, my friend keeps on bragging in my face and I just try to ignore it but I can't so I can't listen to my teacher at all.
