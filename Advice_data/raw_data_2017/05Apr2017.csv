Doesnt effect eyesight, but people think I'm high when I don't even do drugs. Also they start to water in any situation requiring interaction with others. This has been going on since high school.

1,"Sorry if this is immature/juvenile. I'm just awkward when it comes to these things.

I'm almost 17. I just got a job working at a movie theater. I've only worked twice so far, but I really like this guy I work with. He's probably 18 or 19, so a bit older than me. He's funny, witty, and seems pretty smart. He's also nice and helped me out a lot on my first day, and laughs at my jokes. I want to ask for his number. Would it be weird since I don't know him very well and because he's older?",05Apr2017,2
2,"Okay, so the title sets this up nicely. To put things simple, I've applied to a four-year university in my home state of Alabama to study graphic design. I have secured a quite sizable scholarship that covers a majority of my tuition, and I supposed that my choice was perfect for me.

Skip to three days ago. My mom asked me about what I *really* wanted to do as a career. She assumed that graphic design was not actually my ideal career of my choice.

I've always wanted to have a job that promoted creativity, and I always had a few thoughts on how cool it would be to be an 3D animator. I even had been messing around with free 3D modeling software, showing myself the ropes. So I told her about wanting to be a 3D animator for so long, but I felt that a graphic design would be a ""safer bet"" considering it as being a less competitive career.

Now she's all about this animated future of mine, saying I should go to an art school down in Florida, saying I could go to my nearby university for the first year, and then transfer to the art school on my second year. To put it simply, I'm stumped.

I could stay at the nearby university, get a graphic design job, and probably have a flat, simple career OR I could go far away to Florida, where I would be greatly challenged to learn all that is needed to get a career in the field and potentially get my dream job or have a degree that gets me absolutely nowhere.

For the first time in my life, I am really scared. There is so many things I have thought about that can go wrong for me, and this is lining up to be the most important decision in my life.",05Apr2017,1
3,"Yesterday was the worst day of my life, but also a day that was likely long in coming for me.


I have a heroin addiction, and in supporting this habit I spend a lot of time finding ways to make money (don't worry unlike many ""junkies"" I try to keep things clean cut). I was doing well in most of my courses, but one course I just couldn't keep up with. I ended up paying someone to do an assignment for one of my classes. Bad move.


The prof of the course sent me an email yesterday saying they saw this assignment and it was like 90% direct quotes from spark notes, what a stupid move. I feel like an idiot for trusting them, and now ruining my academic life like this. The prof wants to sit down with a neutral third party to discuss things going forward, alternatively if I don't agree with this the matter will be forwarded to the usual academic offense committee. Now, I am looking in advice as to what my approach with the professor should be. I see two possible options:


1) I claim I plagiarized from spark notes because I didn't have enough time and now realize what a stupid mistake it was and promise it won't be repeated.


2) I tell the entire truth. I am a heroin addict that was in treatment and because of this fell behind in a course. As a result I panicked and paid someone to do the assignment for me and they plagiarized from spark notes taking advantage of me.


3) Are there more options?




I know I deserve this, I have made some terrible choices and am trying to turn my life around. I'm just in a really bad position right now and any advice you guys can provide would be appreciated so much.


Thank you!",05Apr2017,1
4,"I am required to move overseas by my current employer and am taking my family.

We have a 15 year old black lab mix that is blind, deaf and most likely has Cushing's disease. The dog is starting to have mobility issues as well. We went to the vet the other day and the vet informed us that the dog is not healthy enough to fly. I was pretty certain of the outcome of the visit prior to going, but my wife was dead set that the dog was coming with us.

My wife is very attached to the dog and did not take the news well. The dog predates our marriage by 8 years. She refuses to consider putting the dog down and stated she might stay behind regardless of the impact on our daughter and relationship.

No one I've talked to is willing to take the dog for us.

I have about 6 months to come up with an amicable solution and am located in upstate NY.

What options do I have to either give the dog up or convince my wife that the ethical choice is to put the dog down?

5,"I have few good friends. One is a sort of a lifetime friend, and he has very different interests and views from mine. I felt that he may have been influencing me negatively, and I moved to a new city around a year and a half ago (not because of him but coincidentally), and things were great for me. I started getting tons of work done and felt great. 

Long story short, I moved back to my prior city, however I didn't return to the same level of contact with my lifetime friend. I still care the same, so we haven't distanced ourselves, but we've both been busy. I don't think he's influencing me much.

Now, I have developed another really good friend over the past 9 months or so. We're pretty tight. I've again found my motivational levels to be down, and I'm struggling to stay on the right path with everything.

It's possible that I'm trying to do so much at once that my emotional life seemingly doesn't have room for close friends. However, of course, that wouldn't make me happy after too long a time because I like people and being around them. I was happy in that new city for much of my time, despite not having good friends there, however. I was 'around people', just not really hanging out with them in my private time.

I get really enthusiastic around other people, in that I like to have fun, joke around, etc. I'm also a really good friend, in that I take on their problems with them. I'm not exactly sure what's going on, but I feel that either or both of these things could be clashing with my motivated mindset, and ultimately my relationships gain priority over my personal goals. 

I stop thinking about my personal projects, and I stop even caring about them. Then, I tend to seek short-term pleasure in my alone time (such as playing video games, watching movies, reading about sports (one of my comfort activities, going back to my childhood), going out to eat) instead of using that time to work on long-term stuff. By the time that's done, there's another event/situation for me to see my friends again or I have to work at my job, and I never got around to centering myself introvertedly on my goals.

Is this simply an introverted/extroverted thing, where you can only be one thing at a time, and it can take several days to switch into a different mode?",05Apr2017,3

9,"This has been going for about 5-6 months or so. Myself &amp; a friend are being harassed (normally every day) online. Started on Twitter, then he joined my friends Twitch streams, now joins our Discord servers and it just does not stop.

Obviously, the first thing we thought of was ""block him &amp; ban him (Twitch, Discord)"" which, of course, we did.

Unfortunately, he uses a service called Yandex and also a VPN (I'm not sure if they are the same thing) and can make new accounts pretty much instantly, and just join Twitch and Discord straight away.

The purpose of the VPN is because Twitch &amp; Discord ban the IP address, rather than just banning the account, so for him to keep coming back, he has to change his IP.

We're at a struggle for what to do at this point. 

He threatens us daily (luckily, these are empty threats as he can't really do anything). I run a small YouTube channel, and he has mass-disliked my videos in the past. He consistently comes to my friends Twitch streams and (at first) tries to act like a completely new person, but after a while it becomes obvious it's him and he's spouts abuse at the streamer &amp; mods.

We're not sure if we have any legal advantage, as I live in the UK, my friend lives in the US and the harasser lives in Haiti.

If anyone could suggest something, I'd be very grateful.",05Apr2017,1

15,"He's from the USA and I'm from Brazil. He's also broke and need to find a job here. I've been looking for places where he could work without any knowledge of Portuguese, like hotels and such, but I'm not sure if he'll manage to get anything since he only has high school.
He knows programming and computer stuff in general, but he doesn't have any courses to make his resumé look at least decent, I suppose. He's also having a hard time to find jobs in the USA because of his unimpressive resumé.

I'm already planning a trip to go there, but I have things that keep me here, like family and my job. I could definitely support him financially for a few months, but he can't really leave right now if we have no clue on what's next (and because I think it should be easier for him to find a job in his native country).

17,"I (34f) have been married to ""Jon"" (32m) for almost 2 years.  We met, fell in love and took a huge chance and married 2 months later. (( I know, I know, that was crazy dumb)).  

I have discovered that he is extremely introvert and hates or is annoyed by almost everyone and everything.  He never compliments me, never tells me he's proud of me and when I am very anxious or depressed, he doesn't help most of the time.  

I do a ton of cooking, cleaning, repair, take care of the kids (I would estimate i do 90% of It) and it feels like I am completely unappreciated.  I have tried talking to him about it but either he gets really defensive and angry and turns it around on me, or he has excuses.  

After almost 2 years, I feel dried out like beef jerky. I don't feel loved at all, don't feel respected or appreciated and I am SO depressed because of it. Every day I want to cry.  My dreams are my only reprieve.  I am beginning to recent him terribly, and I didn't want it to be like this.

I wanted to spend my life with him but I can't take living like this much longer.  I have no idea what to do or how to talk to him anymore. 

He also takes a lot of meds for his Bi Polar that flatten his emotions, so it's almost as if he has none. That alone makes communicating with him very hard because he mostly only sees the logic to things and not emotion, which is what i need.",05Apr2017,1

20,"He has previously confided in me about being hospitalized on 3 separate occasions for psychotic/manic episodes. All of these instances occurred after bouts of using hallucinogenic drugs (mostly LSD). He had been avoiding these types of substances since the last episode and, from what I could tell, seemed to be doing fairly okay. He has been diagnosed as schizoaffective and (I believe) as bi-polar but ""doesn't like labels"" and doesn't take medication because of the side-effects that he experienced (he was suicidal from dopamine blockers and basically devoid of feelings/deep thoughts). He is currently in school studying neuroscience and, as such, has a pretty obsessive interest in the human mind, both from a scientific and philosophical standpoint. One night while we were talking, he held back tears telling me how scared he is that his mind could slip away again and some delusion take hold…… I was so sad to hear this. I'd previously been naive enough to think that all of this was in the past. 

Anyway….when I saw him at work this past weekend, it was immediately clear that something was not right. We went outside to smoke a cigarette and he told me he'd done mushrooms the day before and had an ""existential crisis"". I tried to get more information out of him as to what that meant but, honestly, I'm not sure if I understood. He laughed a lot while telling me the story and after our initial conversation, I thought..""Alright, he came out of this thing okay"". 

After work, we hung out with another coworker for a while and he told us that it'd been a really difficult day and that other people's emotions had been tripping him up pretty badly. We started to talk about smoking weed (which all three of us do but he had recently taken a break from). I talked about how I was thinking of stopping too for a while, about how weed had kind of screwed up my life and stolen good things from me. This sent him into a spiral……….. I don't know how else to describe it..

He walked away from us and started kind of bending over and holding his head in his hands…he was shaking.. We didn't know what to do. He came back and smoked a cigarette and seemed better. A few minutes later though, he basically lost it.. He started talking to himself, asking himself questions. ""Okay, so what do you need to survive? Food? Water? What else?"" ""How do you know this is really happening?"" ""Are you crazy? Are you talking to yourself?"" Then he would look at me…. ""Am I talking to myself?"" And I said, ""You are…but it's okay..""  I felt so bad. I wanted to hug him or hold his hand but I thought that would freak him out so I didn't… Neither of us had any idea how to help and we basically just sat there in silence while he had this conversation with himself (about 45 minutes). 

Eventually, he just kept repeating that he was okay…and then he kind of was ""okay"". He said he was sorry and didn't mean to scare us, and we told him that it was fine totally fine. That we were there for him, whatever he needs.. We talked a little while longer, I offered him a ride home but he wouldn't accept, and then we all hugged and said goodbye.

I'm going to text him tomorrow to see if maybe he wants to get together but I don't really see him responding (not a great texter). Anyway, I'm desperate for some kind of advice. I realize maybe there's nothing I can do besides ""be there""…but I'm worried about him. He is such a special and unique person and I would be devastated if something happened to him.

Thank you for reading this.

22,"Every couple of months or so, I develop an interest in a new hobby or area of entertainment and like to follow up on learning about and enjoying it. My friends and family treat my ADD hobbying as an endearing trait and chalk it up to me being just generally interested in everything, which is true and what I believed too for a long time.

But I think it's actually unhealthy now, because for my brain it goes beyond interest. Whenever I find something new and interesting - be it magic tricks or computers or painting or a new sport - I become quietly obsessive, to the point where life and my thoughts begin to warp. For example, right now it's building PCs. I think about it every hour I'm awake, not every second but so constantly that it's always in my mind and I'm always looking at tutorials or my bank account or daydreaming builds. When it was magic tricks I couldn't go a day without messing with a deck of cards for two months. I think I need help on training myself to stop obsessing over every new interest until I completely overdose on it and discard it like a bare apple core, does anyone have any advice about not obsessing over new things all the time?

35,"So...I'm on Spring Break and, what I really want to do is hang out with my friends. Tomorrow would be a good day to do it, I feel like. Here's the thing...I'm autistic. Asperger's. I'm on the spectrum, basically. My main issue is not knowing what to say to people, so, sometimes, interacting with me and just me can be boring, because, I'll just sit and kinda awkwardly starring at the person, unsure of what to say. So, I do have trouble making friends and interacting with other people...but, I do have a total of seven friends. Thing is...while most of my friends hang out and about going off doing their own thing, I spend most of my time by myself in my room. So, what I really wanna do is hang out with my friends over break. Most of the seven, at least. So, tomorrow, I'm going to hang out with one of my friends that, I text a lot, but, haven't actually seen in person for 3 years for certain reasons. I'm pretty excited, and, it would be cool if I could bring a couple of my other friends to show him I've grown socially. And since I haven't actually seen him in 3 years, I am a bit nervous. If I had another one of my friends with me, I feel like I'd be more...comfortable, I guess. You might be thinking, ""Yeah, go ahead, do it. It'll be fun!"" Well...I'm afraid there's an issue.

He's bringing his mom, and, his mom wants my mom to come, so, she is too. We're going to go see the new Power Rangers and then go out to a restaurant or something. I don't really want either of our moms to come. I have nothing against my mom, she's awesome, his mom...I'll get to. But, it's like, come on, we're 18, can't we just...go off on our own? We're ""big enough"". And, thing is...His mom is pretty nutty. I might as well say that, I used to be a Christian, but, within February 2014 to April 2017, now, I've become an atheist. And thing is...his mom is EXTREMELY religious. Like, even though I'm an atheist, I don't necessarily mind people being religious. Like, hey, I disagree, but, do what you want. That's how I am with it. However, his mom is religious in a scary way. Like, wearing Jesus shirts, listening to church music in the car, and, when I used to try and eat dinner with him via at his house or at a restaurant, when we were younger obviously she came...she made me pray. And I don't mean, just, do the sign of the cross thing and that's it, like, friggin hold hands and all that stuff. To be fair, I was a Christian before so I was mostly ok with it, but now... And, maybe this is mean, but...

His mom is just a really, weird, person. I don't like her at all, and, while I have to be honest missed my friend, hanging out with him and stuff...I haven't missed her at all. And thing is, I really want to hang out with all my friends. We're all seniors, and, we all know what happens to some (but not all) high school friends once they graduate. And since this is break, this is one of our last chances to do something like this. Sure, weekend and summer is coming, but, I really wanna do it now. If it doesn't happen now, sure, I can plan it out later, but... I'd really like to do it now. Also...I might as well say that, I've already seen the new Power Rangers, and I liked it, but...I don't really want to see it again. Not that I have anything against it, I did like it, and, to be fair, I'll probably rewatch it via renting it on Digital or something by the end of the year anyway, since I like to see every movie I like at least twice, but...not right now. I feel like I'd really rather do something else. Even just him coming over and like, playing video games with me and my room (to be fair, my room is a fucking mess right now and I wouldn't have a lot of time to clean it) 

So, what should I do? Just go with my friend, my mom, his mom and just deal with it, or maybe, try and communicate to his mom, ""Look, I haven't seen him in 3 years. Is it ok if I hang out with JUST him?"" Or, is that mean? I feel like if my friend found that out, he might get offended too, so...I'm in a tight spot.       ",05Apr2017,3

I hate sitting in class and having to do busy work, and after 4 years of college I would have around 25 thousand dollars of student loan debt.

43,"So it's my senior year. I have been class president 3 years and just recently this year I was not. Here's the quick story. Freshman year I ran for president against this girl that nobody likes. I won in a landslide. So next year's elections came around and she said she would be my vice president so I agreed. We beat the opponents that year as well. Finally, no one ran against us junior year. The end of junior year comes and it is time for elections right before summer. No one ran against us and we had it in the bag. I had one meeting to go to for me to secure the position. Here was my dilemma. I'm not making excuses but this, I think, was an understandable mistake. The week before elections, I got my wisdom teeth out. The meeting was on tuesday of the next week and I got my wisdom teeth out Wednesday. I stayed home and returned to school on monday, not knowing there was a mandatory meeting this year. Monday I got to school and went to first hour where your teacher is supposed to read the announcements to you, but we had a substitute, and the announcements were not read. Anyway, I was viciously teased by my vice president for the remainder of the school year. I brushed it off knowing that 3 years of class president and leadership roles will still look A1 on a resume. So, senior year is coming to a close. We have no 4.0 students in the class so the president is giving the graduation speech. Literally, no one likes her. She gave the speech in printed essay form to the principle. My mom, a secretary at the school, watches him read it and notices the disgust on his face about mid way while reading it. She comes home and tells me about this. She also has a printed speech and let me read it. I started reading it. The speech name is ""Make Your Dreams Real"" and the whole first page is about how making dreams come true is what we need to do. She then goes forth on the second page completely explaining her position in running for class president. She didn't achieve her goals normally, she reached her ""goal"" because I missed the meeting. She called us a ""tag team"" and this is a quote from the speech. ""We'll then my tag team partner didn't show up to the meeting that was mandatory to run for office...you know who you are."" She is planning on calling me out in front of a little less than 1000 people, in front of the entire school and their families. I need some advice that doesn't make me look bad at graduation.

She wanted to become a realtor but needed certification to do so, which requires going to real-estate school and taking the state exam. She argued that although she'd love to work in the field, she'd have to support me and my brother at home until I graduated highschool, so that I could pick my brother up from school and watch him while both parents were gone. 

My dad was alright with this, for the most part? They fought about other things in between this time (my going through highschool), mostly money related, as my dad wanted to buy things he couldn't afford and it was causing a lot of overall financial stress. He'd always bring up her lack of a job as the reason why he couldn't get the things he wanted out of life (a boat, landscapers for the yard, stuff for fishing, stuff for his motorcycle, etc). He'd constantly complain that she didn't do enough, and that she was a bad wife. He did this for the next 3 years, complaining but biding his time until something could actually be done about it.

Time went on, and I was able to get through highschool. Now, the spotlight was on my mom to pursuit her career. My dad paid for her to take real-estate classes, and my grandmother gave her a laptop to study online. She obliged, of course, but the coursework was intimidating (the math in particular), and concurrently, their marital problems were gradually getting worse (they'd fight about the tiniest things, my dad's temper was growing insatiable. he'd find anything to get mad over.). She became aloof and insecure between the difficulty of the classes and my dads insults thrown her way (about how bad of a wife she was for not doing more for him and how stupid she was for having trouble with the coursework.), so she studied less for the exam and desired some sort of break. 

Predictably, they fought more...and more and more and more. She became more insecure and more depressed (as their fights are only comprised of bringing up the past and throwing insults at one another), and he became more and more angry and frustrated with life. One day he snapped and got physical with her. Her shoulder and thigh were bruised for a few weeks, but she kept it hidden. I know all this because they weren't shy about their fight this time around, my dad (or mom, I don't remember) called me and my brother down to mediate, and then things escalated. 

He felt terrible that he let his temper get the better of him, but it didn't last long. The physical altercation did not inspire her to do work harder, and she still remained depressed, not sure where to proceed. They tried to mend prior issues they had brought up among all their fighting, as per my counsel, but they were stuck, they never got better and always eventually fought again. They kept calling me down to mediate, to get them to understand one another, but they also requested me to choose a side. I often understood my dad's perspective best, he was hurting physically and mentally, it seemed, but I also understood my mom, and refused to pick one parent over the other. My dad would be furious/feel betrayed if I didn't support him, and my mom would feel helpless and betrayed if I didn't support her. This made me feel awful, like I was making things worse, so i stopped coming down when called if I knew they were fighting. 

He got physical and hit her again, so I had to come down. My brother insisted on coming with me, and I had to shield him from my dad, because my brother kept trying to pry my mom away from him and my dad wasn't having any of it. I separated the two of them, and my mom tried riding her bike in the middle of the night to escape from my dad for a bit. I wouldn't let her because my dad took my mom's gun away (as the result of another fight), and she had no way of defending herself if something bad happened. She went to the guest bedroom and cried, and I calmed my dad down. This exact scenario repeated itself really, really often in our household, the neighbors called the cops once because of it, although nothing came of it.

I digress. She eventually cheated on my dad when he was away at work. She didn't have a fling with someone, rather, she went out and had drinks with a man she met online for about 2 months. My dad was always the suspicious sort, and my mom was terrible at hiding her cheating (always on her phone, smiling), so one night he found out after snatching the phone from her and snooping through her messages. She lied and said it was a friend from school, but he wasn't falling for it. That night was a game changer, it was the most mad I've ever seen him. He smashed her phone on the floor, threw her on the ground, nearly pulled a gun on her. I had to lock my brother in the bathroom with me because my mom came upstairs with us to hide from my dad, and he was chasing her, and my brother wanted to help. My mom moves out of the house with us for a few weeks, and my dad has time with his thoughts.

When we get back he's completely different, apathetic but still short fused. They want to make things better, but it's 2 years later and nothing has improved...things are still bad. He's always suspicious, she is NOT allowed to leave the house, he blows up on her and me constantly (he has expressed his hate for women as the result of his past and present) over the tiniest things, and everyone in the house is afraid of him, even my brother, who my dad has been trying to brainwash into being an asshole like he is. They fight tri-monthly now. My mom has become a recluse, she seldom speaks in fear he'll get violent (he wakes up upset everyday, and he has no spectrum of rage. 0-100). I am not as timid as her, if he were to hit me, I wouldn't be afraid to call the cops, and I don't have love for him, so I don't care if he faces charges. Therefore, my dad and I often fight, even if he wasn't involved in the problem to begin with (he'll see I'm upset over something and get mad at me for being upset). If ANYONE in the household were to defend me, they would get screamed at. My mom has said she supports me when I'm in the right, but ""not to poke the bear"", even when it's something as simple as accidentally waking him up when I get ready in the morning. 

I'm tired of everyone compromising for a man that hates his life, and everyone in it, and refuses to get therapy or help for himself because he thinks he doesn't need it. Divorce is his ""only"" answer, as he says in fights, but he refuses, and my mom refuses to divorce him. I can leave, but I also can't...I can't leave my brother alone with my parents, he's not safe there, but I can't take him away either...I wish I could though, it may show them that they only have eachother in the end, and if they can't resolve their problems, one of them will be driven to suicide or insanity.

I guess that's all I can say off of the top of my head, please, I need advice. I've suggested therapy for 4 years, they will never take it, and my dad loathes me and no progress has been made in improving relations with him (I've tried, I have the same exact interests as him and everything, but even after bonding, if something goes awry, he will INSTANTLY turn on you FOREVER. Look at my mom for example, or my dads family, who he's ostracized. he has severe mental problems) 

Ask me any questions if you need further context, I'm scatterbrained right now. There's SO much more that has happened that I could inscribe, but am neglecting to mention/remember at this very moment. Thank you to anyone who can help.",05Apr2017,30

My roommate got a dog from a friend several months ago. It is a large dog and we're not sure of the breed. My issue is that the dog seems miserable and I think it's because she's not being exercised enough. My roommate does not exercise her whatsoever. She takes her out on a leash to go potty and then brings her right back in. 5 minutes a day tops. I usually take her out ten minutes a day bc I feel bad...even though it's not my responsibility. It's sad because she is a large dog in a tiny apartment. I can't take her to dog parks because she was allowed to fight with other dogs at her previous home and now she can't be around them (which I found out the hard way). She loves people though. I hate confrontation and I feel awkward telling my roommate what to do with her dog but I just feel so bad for her. All she does is lie around 24/7. She used to be somewhat playful like a big puppy but not anymore.

58,"I'm 16, 5'6, transmale (not on hormones yet), ~200 pounds (I know, I know, I'm overweight), taking Sertraline in 100 mg doses daily for anxiety and depression. These are important because they might be relevant.

On to the problem. Every time I do any sort of aerobic exercise that requires me straining my body above the limits of walking (running, dancing, etc), it seems like my throat gets harder to breathe through, and like I can't get a full breath. This gets worse the harder I exercise until I'm practically whistling when I breathe. (I also sweat excessively, like, soaking through shirts excessively, but that's not really relevant and I've already talked to my doctor about it). This can escalate until I'm getting chest pains, which is why I mentioned my anxiety. I have crippling anxiety which sometimes gives me chest pains, so I was thinking that that could be it, but I'm not usually in the midst of a crippling episode when I'm trying to get out of the house more.

As well as this, *any* exercise (*including* the easy stuff like walking, yoga, etc) makes me sweaty beyond reasonable levels and I get red in the face, practically emitting heat.

Now, this could just be me being out of shape, overweight, etc etc, I've heard that shit from my mom and brother enough times because they both think I'm faking/exaggerating. To be honest, I'm not comfortable with this explanation, because I don't feel like other kids my age get chest pains while running short distances.

Is this something I should try talking to my doctor about? I'm hesitant to because my mom has waved it off when I tried in the past (when I was thirteen), and I usually like to have her there because I can't remember all of my medical record stuff and it's nice to have an outside observation for my visible anxiety and depression symptoms (because I'm not very self aware on that front).

TL;DR: Slightly chubby kid has some trouble breathing during exercise including chest pains, but also has anxiety so those symptoms could be caused by anxiety and not the exercise. Should I still tell my physician about it, even though my mom and brother think I'm faking?",05Apr2017,1

I'm currently a 16 year old male in my second year of high school and so far, the experience has been pretty bad. I do fine in class for the most part, but due to medical problems, I may have to take a semester off of school. I have no real friends, I don't go out, I've been to two parties and I got kicked out of one of them. I'm bored, lonely, depressed, socially akward, and I'm beginning to seriously hate my life. I am attending therapy though, which is helping.

My dad talks about his High school days sometimes, and it makes me feel absolutely awful. He talks about how they were some of they best days of his life, and it seriously makes me feel like I'm throwing a part of my life away. I've never had a girlfriend either, which probably isn't too uncommon at 16, but I would still really like to have one. I'm a pretty decent looking guy, it's just that I'm very inept socially.

I am taking steps to fix all of this, mainly by signing up for a bunch of volunteer programs in hopes of meeting new people. It's pretty much impossible for me to make friends at school though, mainly because of how insanely unpopular I am. 

Anyone have any tips? I only have around 2 and a half years of high school left, and I'd really like to make the most of it.

69,"Taking extreme caution and posting this on my throwaway because you never know. I have the final interview this week with the CFO (my potential future boss) of a well known subsidiary company of a Fortune 500. I would be their Director of IT and I'd be paid about $150k a year plus other perks. At my last job, I was making $85k but I literally never worked over 40 hours per week, lived in Lake Tahoe and had a TON of flexibility. 

For personal reasons, (I do not want to put any personal details that are not relevant to the situation into this post), I had to move out of the area of my old job. Where I live now is very remote, new job would be about 3 hours away one way on a good day. 

Since I've moved to an area with no direct job prospects, I took the plunge on something I've always wanted to do and I went full boar into starting my own company. I am only 2 weeks into executing but I brought in $1,000 last week and spent $400. Nowhere close to where I need to be but I have validated my model and I have initial success.

If I take the job, it puts me away from my young kids. I am a family man, I work to give them a good life and they are my world. I would need to be away from them 4 to 5 days per week and just the thought of that breaks my heart. 

I have always been careful to check lifestyle inflation but I still have things like; mortgage, one car payment, private school, lessons, etc. If I turn down the job, I can sustain myself and my family 6 months.

70,"First off, I'm 17 years old. I like my friends right now, but a lot of them I believe kind of dropped off. Many are now into drugs, and never want to hang out without smoking weed or something harder. This is fine every once in a while, but I feel like it's all they want to do, so I either choose to be lonely or I end up drugging up (which just feels unproductive and boring in retrospect). Personally, I love getting into trouble, adventuring to unknown places, adrenaline rushes and so on-At least with regards to hanging out with other people for fun. When we're not out and about, all they want to do is play video games, which I used to enjoy (and do every once in a while if I have time), but now don't as much. When it does come to talking and such, they always just get so negative with the way I respond (not to sound like and elitist prick, but I'm always a very intellectual person and I like to talk about complex things in a 'smart' way because it makes it enjoyable for me). They don't like to talk about that shit or anything in that manner, and even when it is interesting stuff we talk about, I feel like it is rare and doesn't lead anywhere great. Maybe this is just an illogical defensive thought, but sometimes I feel like I've outgrown them and I'm more mature in these certain ways.

I enjoy the kind of stuff they like, like classic rock and self-discovery (my parents are semi-hippies who were in college in the 70s), etc.. I have other friends, but not super close.

3) A large mobile games company which made a game that I played for a few months a few years back. I generally don't like that game anymore but it does have some merits that I liked about it.

I recently lent someone money, since he was in a tight spot and assured me the money would be returned by the end of two weeks. I know this man to be reliable and hardly asks for money, so I more than gladly said yes. I was happy to help him out. 

Issue is, I was surprised to see he was dodging my attempts to retrieve the money from him after the two weeks. It was not usual behavior of his, and I know he's struggling right now, so this is where the issue lies.

Because of that, i really had nobody to talk to and i didnt want any of my friends to worry about me.

There was this girl i really liked. She was from another class and i had no other way to know her in person without being awkward. I really wanted to know her but i was too shy.  

Being young and introverted i started chatting with her through social media. And that is when i made a mistake. I told her after a few weeks of chatting with her that i had a crush on her and asked for her number. She did give me her number but i was too much of a coward to talk to her in person whenever i saw her in school.

I left her hanging after confessing that i had a crush on her. ( which i really regret )
I really had no idea what i was thinking back then. 

I never said anything to her in person even until the end of high school.

My mom keeps talking about no kill shelters but I'm fairly certain we don't have any in our area that are actually no kill, and even so I can't see him ever being adopted with his anxiety and aggression issues, even though he's a super sweet puppy, I just wish other people could get to see that side of him. I'm at my wits end, and I usually don't cry at anything but the thought of him sitting in a cage waiting for us to come back for the rest of his life and constantly being afraid and confused, or being put down because he's ""undesireable"" is just too much for me, and I'm sorry if this post is a little jumbled but I think this is as much of an off my chest post as a plea for advice, because my whole family seems to have just forgotten him in all their excitement to move forward with their lives, but Rascal has been there for me through so many tough times I can't just abandon him. 

Any advice at all is greatly appreciated

85,"So here's something that's been bugging me for a while.  There's a specific customer that my restaurant delivers to, I won't name names, but he works for a company that apparently loves logistics.

So -- there is a particular individual who works at this facility who likes to order about 10 minutes before we close down shop -- that's fine.  I don't have a problem with you doing this.  I get hungry late at night as well, and I'll call in a delivery a few minutes before closing.  It sucks, but in the restaurant biz, you are open until you're closed.  As management, this is something that has been beaten into me day in -- day out.

Now, on to tonight -- a repeat of many nights before, but with a different ending:  Said customer calls once again, about 15 minutes before closing, requesting a delivery.  I take his order, inform the cooks and the driver that there is one last delivery going out, so don't shut anything down / leave.  I inform said customer that my driver will call upon leaving the restaurant, to inform him that she is on her way, and upon arriving, she will wait another 10 minutes for them to arrive (this totals ~20 minutes in time for the customer to get to the designated delivery spot.)  He agrees and understands what I've said.

So the food is ready, the driver calls the customer, and the driver leaves the restaurant.  The driver arrives and texts me saying ""No one is here yet, so I'm going to wait the 10 minutes.""  Ten minutes go by, and the person doesn't show up, and the driver texts me, ""Do you really want me to leave?  I feel kind of bad.""

I respond with, ""You can leave if you want, no blame will be placed on you.""

Driver's response: ""The guy came out, but he only has $xx.xx, and says that he needs to go to his car to get change (our drivers are instructed to carry only a certain amount of change as a liability issue, and this is always made clear to the customer.)  In this case, the customer was unwilling to give the driver a 5 dollar tip, and wanted to get change so that he could give less.  I'm never one to judge a good/bad tipper, anything you get is more than you had -- keeping that in mind, when the customer walked off (supposedly to his car), I told the driver to head back to the restaurant as it was already 30 minutes past closing, and this was a ridiculous game to be playing.

I called the customer and explained that I would wait another 15 minutes past closing if he wanted to come pick his food up, but that my driver had already been there for 20 minutes after a 10 minute drive, minding that she had called before starting the drive.

The customer responds a bit shocked, but responds in a manner that seems to understand and agree that he would come pick up his food.

I waited 20 minutes and the customer never showed, so I voided the order, tossed the food, and closed my business day.

I'd love to know what anyone else would've done, or whether or not you think that I was in the wrong.  It's one thing to do this now and again -- but this specific customer does this every time, and at some point I feel like it's simply disrespectful.

87,"I have issues getting physically close to people. Whenever some one gets too close to me for more than a lingering moment (within about a foot or so) I feel physically uneasy. For the most part this doesn't cause me any issues in my normal day to day life but i don't know how to move past it and get into a healthy relationship. 

Hand shakes and fist bumps don't cause me problems but prolonged touching or when someone is close to me for an extended period I become uncomfortable. I'm beginning to wonder if I'll ever move past this problem. My mother once told me that as a baby I didn't like to be held when I was falling asleep. Is it possible to be born with an aversion to touching? I don't want to be this way. 

I'm almost 29 and unsurprisingly I haven't really had been in many relationships. Due to some strange personal circumstances (homeschool from elementary school till graduation), I didn't really get to have any kind of sexual contact with any women until 19 or 20. I've had a few sexual relationships with women but they've all been very short lived. Being emotionally and physically distant makes for a difficult relationship. I don't want to be this way but I just am. 

Late 2015 early 2016 I was in my longest lasting relationship which lasted for 4 months. We got to the point of her moving in with me. The relationship was fraught  with issues which were all my fault. Cuddling made me uncomfortable and around 65% of the time I'd have erection issues during sex. I eventually came up with a BS excuse for us to break up. It crushed her but the emotional and physical requirements of being in a relationship were pretty much impossible for me to keep up with. 

In case anyone is wondering, no I wasn't sexually abused as a child and I'm not attracted to men either. I almost wish that the answers to either of those questions was yes. It certainly would make coming up with a solution to the problems much easier. 

Why is it so difficult for me to be close to people? I want physical closeness and intimacy but the only way I can reliably do it that is with alcohol. Obviously alcohol is not a permanent solution that I can rely on frequently. I'm not happy about but I've given up on looking for a girlfriend. How could someone like me be in a relationship anyway.

So my girlfriend bought me a gift for my birthday but wasn't sure what colour etc to go for and offered to exchange it if I would like to. I love the present but wanted to change the colour and get the larger size by paying an extra £50 myself.

We went to the store and really enjoyed the experience (quite a posh shop so was really a treat), paid the extra, they even gave me a free gift worth £40 (which I was thinking of buying anyway!), so the exchange cost me very little and had a great day out.

Fast forward to today and my girlfriend was checking her bank account. Instead of exchanging, they had refunded the version she bought completely, all £150.. yet I only paid the extra rather than the new amount.

*we only paid £50 for something worth over £200, plus the free gift!!!*

Normally I would say YEAH! Got one up on a huge commercial company, and it probably is (turns over £10m with decent profit) but!...

1) I wonder if the shop assistant is being punished for this, now we see the mistake we feel bad for her!

2) we had no idea this had happened until a couple of weeks later, we didn't encourage it in any way, it was simply a staff mistake. Do we own up in light of good Karma, or take the fruits that life gives us through luck?!

103,"This is gonna be a long post so I will break it down. P.S. this is a throw away account to protect mine and her anonymity.
**Background Info:**
So I am a freshman college and through my whole life I have been under weight. (6'1 and 115 lbs) so I am extremely self conscious. I have never had a relationship in my life unfortunately. A big weakness of mine is I get emotionally attached to people extremely fast. During my senior year I had a few flirt-ships but no real relationships.  During my childhood I had a best friend, we will call him Dan. Well Dan had a sister we will call her Bailey. I didn't pay much attention to Bailey when I was a kid. Unfortunately, Dan and I grew apart when their parents held them back a year so they could go to private school. A year later (7th grade) I moved to Kansas for 2 years then moved back. I finished high school in my hometown and went to college in our cities university which is about 20 mins from where she and my family lived, remember she is still a senior right now. She is super into ballet (practices 5 days a week for 6 hours at a time)

**Situation:**
About 1 month ago I was scrolling through Instagram and I saw Bailey's name on my recommended page, keep in mind I haven't talked to her in 7 years. I requested to follow her, she accepted and followed me back. About a week later I added her on Snapchat but didn't talk to her because I am a bitch. A couple days later I get a notification that she snapped me. I replied and we started talking and catching up. We talked for about 2 weeks and really hit off. She then asked if I wanted to meet up with her to help her on her comp sci homework. We met up and talked for 5 hours laughing and hitting it off. When we left the restaurant we  made plans to hang out for the next week. During the time between we kept talking a ton and on Friday of that week we hung out again. We went to dinner, I paid, we went to my dorm room, snuggled, watched movies, and lastly turned some music and she taught how to swing dance. I walked her to her car, hugged and said goodbye. When she got home she thanked me for a great night and we made plans for this upcoming Friday. Saturday and Sunday afternoon were normal days with us just talking normally. Sunday night she snapped me saying she had to study for a couple tests, so I responded I was going to bed and that she is gonna kill it tomorrow. Monday morning rolled around and she had yet to open the snap and it was ~11 am. I texted her asking how her tests went and we started talking about scheduling. I asked if Friday was the only day she could hang out (I am really into her and I wanted to see her more, remember I get attached quickly). She said yes but on Saturday she is going to a ballet performance and that I could go with her. I said sure and that when summer rolls around it will get better. Then she told me that she will be gone for 2 months out of the 3 and during the month she is in town she will have ballet everyday until 3. I said we can make it work and she said we can try but she wont have a lot of time. We started talking about the plans on Friday and then she stopped responding at around 4pm on Monday. I didn't text her till Tuesday at 9pm cause I was swamped that day asking if everything was ok since it was around 36 hours since we talked last, which hadn't happened. She then responded with ***Hey. Didn't realize we hadn't talked that much-- I have a whole lot going on right now and sometimes I don't even talk to my parents for a day. I'm super overwhelmed because of crazy school stuff and deciding where I am going for the next 4 years. I just don't think I am able to give you the time and attention that you want and I don't even know if I have the once a week you were asking for.*** Naturally I was taken aback because this was unexpected I responded by saying that I really like her but I understand and that maybe we can try this again when everything calms down because I really like hanging with her even though it was short. She responded with ***Thanks for understanding! I really enjoy hanging out with you but this is a majorly stressful time and I'm going to need to dedicate all my focus to it***

**Question/Advice Needed:**
What do I do? Do I just forget about her. I have a hard time getting over things. Do I wait till summer and try again? Do I stop all communication? Is this just a excuse to let me down softly, even though we really enjoyed each others company. I need advice because now is not the time to be stressed and sad, with the end of the school year coming up. Please help!",05Apr2017,2

112,"**TL;DR: Never feel rested despite getting sufficient hours of sleep. Dietary and lifestyle habits are all solid, blood test results show no anomalies.**

This has been going on for at least eight years now (since I was 15-16) and I'm completely stumped. No major changes in diet or lifestyle happened whatsoever at that time, I just suddenly stopped feeling rested in the mornings for no explicable reason. No matter how much I sleep (I've tried everything between 7-10 hours; I would only need 9 hours tops before), I never wake up feeling awake and energetic during the day. I'm constantly exhausted and always feel the need for more sleep and rest. I'm 24, weigh 65kg. My mind feels like it's in a permanent 'fog', meaning that I find it almost impossible to concentrate on things and remember them. My thoughts aren't 'clear' in the sense that I feel a lot slower than I know I am. I always used to get this feeling whenever I was sleep-deprived in the past, and it would always fix itself after a single good night's sleep. Now that I'm not sleeping as well as I used to (for some reason), I'm chronically deprived of rest and I'm lacking the energy and mental capacity to make the most of life without being exhausted. 

I recently had a blood test done, which came back perfectly normal. They tested for anemia, inflammation and my thyroid function. I eat at least 3000 calories a day as I'm trying to gain weight, and go to the gym at least 3 times per week to keep myself active and put on mass. My diet primarily consists of meat, vegetables, healthy fats (i.e. coconut oil) and fruits, nothing outlandish. I go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. I've tried both napping and avoiding napping during the day, neither of which provide any relief. I often feel depressed and really low because of the chronic fatigue, but push myself to live life as normal regardless. I have a genuinely fulfilling life, so I have no mental, emotional or otherwise 'external' reason to be depressed; I have a job, I'm in full-time education for a course that I have sincere interest in and has great job opportunities, I have an amazing family and friends. There is absolutely nothing bothering me to make me feel down aside from this sleep issue. All of my symptoms feel 100% physical in nature, but I'm completely lost as to why.

My sleep itself 'feels' fine. I've always been a deep sleeper with no history of insomnia or frequent awakenings. I give myself a solid one or two hours of downtime before bed to wind-down from the day. During this time, I wear [this pair of orange glasses](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Uvex-S1933X-Eyewear-Sct-Orange-Anti-Fog/dp/B000USRG90/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1491385151&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=uvex) to prevent my melatonin levels from being disrupted by light. I read before bed so that I'm not doing anything too stimulating to keep myself awake, and find myself falling asleep easily. I only wake up once or twice a night to use the toilet. Even on nights where I stop drinking water for an hour or so before bed to avoid interrupting my sleep, I still feel exhausted despite being unconscious throughout the night.

The doctors I've seen have been practically useless. After the blood tests (which have always come back normal), they just say it must be something do with my lifestyle. When I question them regarding what exactly about my lifestyle is so strenuous, they have nothing. I have to give them ideas to test for because once they see that I'm physically fine, they often give up entirely and basically imply that I need to just get over it and nothing's wrong with me.

Any ideas as to what I can do to fix my sleep?",05Apr2017,10

114,"So, throwaway acct. here. 

I am typing frantically because I am upset. I am trying to wrap my head around this woman. I adore her... but she seems volatile. Everything is my fault. Even if my responses are what she asked for. She consistently uses the relationship as a bargaining chip. ""I'll find someone I deserve, someone that treats me right."" Granted we've had a few fights here and there, shouting and cursing. But as of lately I personally said I am done communicating like that because it was ruining us. But its still all my fault. I may be able to keep my cool as she berates me for an hour, but all I need to do is calmly tell her she said something out of line... and its over. Then I have to chase her(I know, I don't HAVE to...), try to get her to calm down, then she'll say she didn't mean what she said.

Biggest issue lately... the kinder I get and harder I try to keep civil. The more she lays into me. I used to be able to shrug half this crap off because I had some confidence... but I am stripped guys. I have no confidence left. I know I am a male and all, but I feel like crying. I am having some borderline stupid thoughts. Emotionally I gave in all the way with this one. I was absent in a few relationships in the past. But I met this one and was like, yeah... there she is. We wanted the same things and we were(still are) ridiculously passionate... Now she says things like ""I knew from the beginning that you weren't going to give me what I deserve."" or ""I have had other men that treat me way better than you."" - etc...
A lot of the treatment comments seem to come from a sense of entitlement... as well as when she asks for help... what she really means is ""Do this for me, while I go do something fun."" For instance... She needs a certification and she will have to study and take a 4hr exam. She asked if i could help he and take the exam for her... I explained that it isn't my field of study, and that the information she needed to learn is required by law for a reason. her response was ""Other people help me and don't ask so much of me, they care."" I told her I would help her study but not take the exam for her as I don't think it is ethical. She flipped and says this is how it would always be with me because I am just not helpful and ""never"" do anything for her. Anytime I have ""helped her"" in the past, I end up doing all the work, while she goes and jumps on facebook or takes a nap. Mind you these favors aren't like doing the dishes or something. They are usually things that need to be done by the person asking.

Whenever I am feeling down she says ""why can't you just be happy to be with me?"". Whenever I need support she shuns me. When I have a life struggle a.k.a. get laid off, or need to study for something, there is no understanding or long term thinking there. We've been together 2.5 years off and on once a week... or 24 hrs.(little funny joke... it's a true joke though.) Sorry for the wall of text... 

I am feeling so weak and helpless, and I could use some help. I would like to add that I know my heart want's nothing more than a solution to stay, but I would be okay with reinforcement in the other direction. Thank you for anything at all.",05Apr2017,2

127,"So a few weeks ago me and my roommate went out and got pretty wasted, we ended up talking to this guy and going with him to an after party. At the party my roommate kept saying that I should kiss him and when I did she got really jealous and went outside. I followed her to talk to her and then the guy came out to us as well. It was pretty obvious he was into both of us. We all three sat down and talked and kissed (we weren't exactly in our most sober state) and he ended up coming with us home.
We all three shared our bed but nothing happened and in the morning my roommate had to go to work leaving me and the guy alone. During the day we had a really nice time and he ended up staying til the evening. When he had to leave I followed him to the nearest station and he kissed me good-bye. 

My roommate was pretty jealous and said that she also wanted to spend a full day with him and last weekend when we were out again she drunk texted him A LOT, which was really embarrassing. He never replied to her texts, and she was like: well at least we can get over him now. But it's so obvious she still likes him and I really do too.

I have recently moved in with her and previously I've always had someone else at home, had a dog or was in a relationship so I never had to worry about being 100% alone. Now I can't stop thinking about all of the possibilities (intruders/paranormal activity/natural disasters occurring - the whole nine yards) that could happen overnight.

132,"Hi there!
As the title suggests, I need advice on a situation involving insurance.
I have an insured motorbike with one month left on the policy, and just purchased a second bike.

Unfortunately, without the first policy ending, I have 0 years no claims bonus which makes the insurance for the second bike too high (an oversight when purchasing the bike...)

Theoretically, could I lie and say I have one year no claims bonus presently, and give 'proof' of such when my first policy ends in a few weeks time without major incident?

136,"Tl;dr at bottom. Please read the whole thing if you have the chance though. 

A little background about my dog: 

10 year old Mixed Retriever Female

She is normally a very healthy dog and has had very little health problems all her life, with the occasional vet visit because of some minor problem. Within the last year, she started to have some issues that would come up infrequently and have only happened about 5 or 6 times. She becomes hunched over, with her head low to the ground that she has difficulty raising up. If I touch very lightly underneath her neck or stomach, she'll wince and sometimes whine. She pants heavily throughout the time this occurring (usually a day) and has her tail between her legs. She paces around and does not want to lay down or even sit, and will often stand in place for a long time. She doesn't have any problems with eating or drinking. This always goes away after a day and by the next day, she is completely find and back to normal. 

The first time this occurred last year, I had her checked out by a vet and I was told that it was probably indigestion or an upset stomach. The vet had nothing to go off of because by the time she had her appointment, a couple days after her episode, she was completely fine and back to her usual energetic and loving self. This happened a few more times last year, and these episodes always went away the next day. Asked around again, and same thing was told to me. 

Well, she has had her first episode again last week when I noticed that she was acting off. By the next day again, she was all better and running around and her tail was wagging and she looked completely fine. 

Then yesterday happened and I'm completely upset by everything that has occurred. She had another episode and this was especially concerning because of the proximity to her last one. I made an appointment with a vet for Friday, but considering her situation, I called around to see if I could get her in earlier someplace else. One place was completely booked and they recommended me to a vet clinic that doubled as an emergency clinic as well. I called that vet clinic and they could see me immediately. I booked the appointment with them, because I couldn't handle seeing my dog in so much pain and discomfort. Plus, at the advice of the vet clinic I call that recommended me to go to this emergency clinic, the receptionist told me that it would be good to take her in when she's in an episode, especially if it goes away the next day. 

So I loaded my dog into my car and headed off to the clinic and had the worst experience possible. I got to my appointment 10 minutes early and checked in. At my scheduled time, I waited for 40 minutes to be seen. This clinic was not busy and had a couple people waiting for their animals, so I thought that my dog would be taken in pretty quickly. After waiting all that time, I finally was called in. The vet technician was extremely timid and was very awkward with me and my dog. She led us to an exam room and asked a few questions, took my dog's temperature, and went to get the vet. The vet came in and while I already had a very bad feeling about the place, his presence just increased that feeling. The vet was in the room for a maximum of 5 minutes to 8 minutes. He quickly checked my dog without really examining her. He aggressively moved her head up and down, side to side, which I felt completely uncomfortable with, because I had told him she had trouble raising her head and whined when I barely touched her underneath her neck. When he did that to her, she looked so frightened and uncomfortable, but didn't whine. He came to the conclusion that it has something to do with a herniated disk in her neck, yet still was aggressive with that area of her body. Then he told me to come back in the morning to do xrays, blood work, and to also do a biopsy on her fat deposit lumps, despite saying that he believed they were benign (had them checked before and they are benign fatty lumps that came with her old age). He also quickly gave her a pain medication without explaining any possible side effects or really asking my approval to do such a thing. By the time he even told me, he made a movement to give it to her and it happened all so quickly, that I just said okay. And then he left. It was so quick and still nothing was really done to help her and I still don't know what's wrong.

 The vet tech told me that she'd get her form ready and I could wait in the lounge to check out. My boyfriend joined me last minute after getting off work and we both were there when the tech came to discuss the possible morning procedures. The cost would be $650. We were both shocked and she had made a motion to get us to sign the paper agreeing to the procedures and cost. We didn't. Then after the fact, she also informed us that it would probably cost more due to medications and other things. When I was called up to pay for her appointment, the total cost came out to $189. I was so confused. How did a 5-8 minute appointment, where nothing was solved, come out to be that much?? I was so upset and furious. My dog is still in pain, and the pain medication injection that he gave her did nothing, and I think it made things worse. She is still whining and I'm so worried. 

So here are some things I need help with: 

Should I still keep the appointment on Friday? How should I address my concerns about her, considering this horrible vet experience? I just want to get her the help she needs. I also am worried about having to pay another large amount of money without any result. 

Could someone explain this line that I was billed for? 

- Total Health with UA 4DX O&amp;P G  (124.31)

Also there is a line underneath that says: 

- In-patient injection (15.93) 

Should I ask for a refund or address my concerns with her treatment with the vet clinic I went to? 

tl;dr: My 10 year old female mixed retriever is having some health issues. Took her to a full service/emergency get clinic, had an absolutely horrible experience where nothing was solved, and my dog is still in pain. Was charged a ridiculous amount and they wanted to get more tests done and charge another $650. ",05Apr2017,1

141,"Hi Reddit! Im in a situation right now that im struggling with internally and emotionally and im hoping you may be able to talk me through it all and offer some advice. 

My Fiancé and I got together a little over 2 years ago. When we met he was honest about having a 2 yr old and being split from the childs mother (his wife). After about a year they finally went through the divorce- which was brutal but ultimately a good thing cause it set everything in black and white. 

Hes paid his child support since day one and even pays an extra $150 a week in babysitter fees so that his ex can go to nursing school. The ex and I Initially HATED each other but have actually come a long way. She texts me pictures of the daughter through the week and we discuss the daughters progress in speech therapy and other parent things. 

Finally it felt like we were in a good place with boundaries and rules established and a happy 4 yr old who loves us all and doesn't quite notice that she's from a broken home. We bought a house in my hometown to offer a more stable home (we were in a small apartment in the city previously). Everything was great. 

Our schedule is as follows: 
Wednesdays the mom drops her off to us at 330 and we bring her home at 8. 

every other weekend we pick her up Friday at 330 the mom picks her up sunday at 730. 

although it never felt like enough time we respected that we were the non-custodial parents and that the daughter was better off being with her mother and brother (by someone else) the majority of her time. 

This past sunday his ex drops a bomb on us that they are moving an hour away, she bought a house. Which is great, except she wants us to get rid of our Wednesday visitation cause its a 2 hour round trip just to drop her off. 

In a way I see it....It does suck for only 4.5 hours of visitation. But on the other hand we already go without seeing her for a week at a time twice a month and multiple days in between. It already hurts to miss out on her life and my fiancé cries when she leaves cause he feels like he's not in her life enough. 

So my question is....do we give up Wednesdays and do just the every other weekend? Do we enforce the visitation schedule and risk our relationship with the mom since she will ultimately take us back to family court? Or what other options do we have? We suggested meeting halfway for pickup/drop off but it just doesn't work with her work schedule...

I know im 'just' the step-parent, but my fiancé is at a loss too. Any advice at all would be extremely helpful. Thank you in advance. 

also-I know im not technically her step mom yet but were getting married in June so its just easier to say it that way.

TLDR; EX moves an hour away and wants us to give up some visitation time to avoid the long drives. ",05Apr2017,0

147,"I'm a naturally shy/anxious person so I'm pretty quiet however I'm pushing myself out of my shell a lot more (and getting over my social anxiety!) and it's been paying off. I've made some incredible friends over the past three months by pushing myself out of my comfort zone and reaching out to acquaintances instead of being too shy to talk to them out of fear of rejection.


But I still have a huge problem with some of my boyfriends friends in being included with what they're talking about when we're with them. Most of his friends are super inclusive and it's easy for me to ask them things/have a conversation with them although I don't know them, but others, especially when it's a group of people (4+) it just feels impossible and I feel left out.


Last week we went out to dinner with eight of his colleagues and they all were talking about things that had happened at their workplace over the course of a year or so. I asked a few questions about who/what the context was, but felt shut down when the answers were blunt. I kind of just sat there for three hours smiling at jokes and resisting the urge of pulling out my phone to block it out. Then my boyfriend apologised to me a lot on the way home because he could tell I was uncomfortable and kept asking if I liked his friends, I felt so horrible because I knew he felt bad.


How can I avoid this and seemingly make more of an effort to be included in conversations that I have no idea of the context/who these people are? Or is it just a thing that I have to put up with so I'm not annoying people by asking tonnes of questions?


TLDR how can I feel included in a group of people I don't know",05Apr2017,2
148,"I'll try to keep it as brief as possible with extra details if needed. This is on my throwaway account.

We've been dating for a little over a year, and living together for just about as long. We met a long time ago at work, and it never seemed like it was a problem. She was in management at her well-known pizza place, had her own car, paid insurance and phone bills for her and sometimes her mother, too.

Since we started living together, she quit her job at the pizza place because of the stress of delivering downtown (understable. I've done it and it really sucks). I was okay with this, as she promised to find other work. She dragged her feet, and I've been paying ALL the bills for pretty much the entirety of our relationship, save a few sporadic contributions. I was about to get fed up and make the difficult decision to end things when she got a job at a huge event center downtown.

All seemed well, but her anxiety has gotten so much worse. She's had seizures for the last few years, but nothing too extreme. Some scans have been inconclusive in the past (few years ago), but her seizures are getting significantly worse. She's scheduled to be monitored at a hospital at the end of the month, but that's a ways away.

She gets so worried about going to work that it makes her have seizures, makes her physically sick and makes her cry. She's already missed about a week of work due to seizures and ER visits. I was gonna take her to work today, but we sat in the parking lot for about 15 minutes because she was getting chest pains and just decided that she can't do it.

Granted, working at a large event center and herding thousands of people (hockey, basketball games, concerts, etc) probably wasn't the best job choice for someone with anxiety, but you gotta take what you can get sometimes. It's still difficult, however, because now she is faced with having to find ANOTHER job, putting another gap in her income and putting all the pressure back on me. This, in and of itself gives her more anxiety. It's been quite a vicious cycle.

Leaving her really isn't an option for me. There's a lot of love between us and it kills me to picture hurting her and forcing her to move back to her mom's where I know it would be even harder for her to get back up.

Is disability an option? Or at least some kind of career that doesn't involve customer service or large crowds of people.

My girlfriend usually gets her period around the 7th of the month. In February it was about a week late. March 7th came around and no period. Then the 14th came around and no period. She took a test a couple days later and it was negative. She took another test around the 23rd, and it was also negative.

She's had cramps on and off between then and now, and they were pretty bad about a week ago. Then, a few days ago, she started spotting. It was red, not light brown or pink. She said that the start of her period is usually heavier, so she was surprised at the light flow.

I know she was sick recently and took some medication (nothing prescription, just over the counter syrups), and I know she's been stressing out over auditions and rehearsals for a show she's doing. Our diet isn't too terrible, but it isn't exactly healthy either. She also said that her period is pretty irregular.

We've had unprotected sex within the last month, but it was only for a few seconds before I got up and put a condom on, so I didn't finish in her. I'm not sure if some pre-ejaculate could've gotten in there.

She has an appointment with the OB near the end of this month, but should I get another test for her to take? Do you think she might have just skipped a period or should we start to worry?

157,"So, I'm an attorney and I have a trial coming up and I thought I'd try running the facts by a mock jury here and see what you all think. 



Defendant is charged with Fencing stolen property. Important elements are the property is stolen, he knew it was stolen, and he sold it. The law allows a jury to presume that a person in recent possession of stolen property knew it was stolen. 



Burglary occurs at a business, lots of tools are stolen - power tools and some fancy testing equipment. Next day defendant pawns 5+ items for around $250, two of which are stolen from the burglary. The following day, defendant pawns more items for about $275, again a couple are linked back to the burglary. And then a couple days later pawns 2 items from the burglary for around $60. Items are linked by serial numbers back to the burglary and defendant has a thumbprint matched to him on the pawn forms which are all in his name. No question there that he pawned the stolen items.



Defendant speaks to the detective. Tells the detective that he owns several properties and gets squatters who leave stuff behind, and all of the items he pawned were just found in this house he owns and was cleaning out on the day of the first pawn sale. He says he didn't know any of it was stolen. 



Story then evolves, says a friend who we'll call Joe, gives him some stuff, sometimes broken tools or whatever and since he's handy he can fix them and then he'll pawn the stuff and split the money with Joe. He says the items pawned, that Joe gave him this stuff. Detective talks to Joe who says he had nothing to do with it. 



Detective talks to defendant a few days later and now has and shows the surveillance video from the burglary. Video shows neither defendant or Joe commited the burglary. Defendant tells detective that he knows who the guy in the video is and knows him by a street name. The stolen property came from that person.

The problem is, it's my delivery and not my intention and it's very stressful to me.

I don't see myself as those things. I know I'm loyal and loving and I am a ride or die with my friends. I'm nice to everyone unless they give me a reason to be a bitch and even then, I try to give them a pass assuming they're just having a bad day.

I sometimes feel the tone in my delivery as too dry and deep but also scattered which is weird. 

I have patrician features (bitch face) and a sarcastic voice (my sister has the same voice and when we talk on the phone, she sounds like such a bitch... ironic that people think we sound alike).

I talk to my friends about it, apologize and they say they either don't notice or know where my heart is coming from so they overlook the delivery.

I feel as though I'm an instrument and my voice box is warped because I just sound snarky when I'm trying to just have a normal conversation. I'm actually always one to find a silver lining but my delivery packages it in such a weird way, it just isn't positively received.

How do you keep a conversation positive, what questions or breathing technique or body language do you like to hear or like to say? What's a great way to teach myself how to speak eloquently. Both my parents were curt and blunt but very loving, so it's like a way of communicating that's been drilled in me and I want to not alienate so many people. 

The fact is no one in my circles ever tells me I sound that way, just random strangers which say things like ""you're probably a horrible teacher"" or something so hurtful out of the blue.

170,"My younger sister by 2 years is bipolar I'm pretty sure, and I don't know what to do about her anymore.

During her middle school years I had to file 2 assault charges on her because she would constantly throw stuff like frying pans and shoes at me and throw punches.  I'm personally not exactly built and it's hard for me to defend myself against her.  

I'm posting here because she's starting to become abusive towards me again for no apparent reason.  I was talking to her in the car on the way to school saying how we should start leaving earlier and she smacked me across the face, then sent that to her friends on Snapchat.

171,"So last Friday I got laid off. Pretty big bummer, but I'm actually doing well. Doing some odd jobs, not really worried too much. I have health insurance for the month of April.

Monday Morning I found a couple odd flaky moles. After doing some research it looks like it may be cancer.

I should probably add that I have a wife and kids that all rely on me for insurance. Another little tid bit is that before I got laid off I smoked weed almost every night. Not a ton, usually just a onie or two with the wife after the kids were sleeping. From my weight and the amount I smoke I'm guessing it's going to be 2-4 weeks at least before I would be able to pass a drug test. My previous employer did not drug test.

Yes I know I should take advantage of my health insurance while I still have it but should I try and get life insurance before finding out if I have cancer? How about health insurance? Health insurance is very very expensive without an employer and the deductibles are insane. I'm guessing both life and health insurance won't have anything to do with me if I know I have cancer.

Do I try and get a job in a month or more when I have clean piss before going to the doctor? I don't want people to not hire me if I am dying.

Please reddit, any advice would be great. At this point I am more worried about my wife and kids than myself.

Now here's my dilemma, I abso-freaking-lutely **LOVE** short hair. Always have, always will. Except my face is definitely not thin and gaunt like it's supposed to be for short hair. I am overweight so yeah, my face is fairly on the round/heart shaped side. However, if my hair is always (like, I'm seriously not exaggerating. It's way too thick and heavy to wear down everyday) up in a ponytail then why does everyone tell me not to cut my hair because I would look bigger. Is it just some psychological bullshit thing like ""Her hair is up and does not look long, but I still know her hair is there so it's ok.""  I know none of this makes sense but I'm currently watching Goodfellas while typing and I can't multitask hahaha.

182,"I am 20 and deal with depression and anxiety. It has caused me to not tell my new bosses exactly what I want which I'm aware is my fault but I need to fix this. 

So the first week of March, I started working for Home Depot in the flooring department where I am still technically training as there is much to learn. I go to school for 20 hours out of the week and because I'm a yes man, I agreed to 25 hours a week of work after being asked.
The previous week, I went through 20/20 of both and did leave me a bit breathless since this was the first time I worked while in school. I thought I could handle it since my brother does it. After the week of 25 hours of work, I can remember how much my anxiety and depressive thoughts kicked me. Granted, it was an 8 hour weekend shift but it hurt regardless. 

After that week of work on the following Monday, I talked to my manager about my hours and availability changing (both for my own personal reasons and family/transportation reason) and couldn't find the courage to correct him when he was only lowering it to 20. He talked as if he thought I was weaseling my way out of working and with my supervisor over my shoulder, I just could not. He approved of the three days of work (Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday) a week which was progress but I wasn't able to tell him about a vacation my mother scheduled with my family on May 13th until June 2. That is three weeks to a country on the other side of the world. I haven't seen my family since I was in middle school and my grandparents are aging so I don't think I should tell my mother no. I do want to go for those reasons alone. The following day after school, I decide to apply for the deli one of my friends works at which pays one dollar less an hour but should be easier for me because I use to work a different deli during the summer. School comes first, this is my first year back and I have been finally making progress. I can not slip now.

So here is what I need help on: 

How do I tell my manager about my vacation and what should I expect? (this answer is probably obvious but I need opinions)

Should I only stick with this stressful job if they lessen my hours?

My boss (the owner) took me and the whole office staff (about 10 people) out for a nice lunch at a great restaurant in town to celebrate my five year work anniversary. She made a great speech about how much the company has grown with me steering my department and they couldn't have seen their successes without me.

It was really nice, and then she showed everyone a beautiful placard they'd had made for me to recognize my 5 years of service, and then waved a sealed envelope in front of the rest of the staff saying I was also receiving a check to recognize my loyalty.

I was pretty excited, thinking it would be a lot like my holiday bonuses but when I got home and opened it my husband was shocked with me that it was for $50. I double checked, just to make sure, and it wasn't a mistake.

All I remember in that moment was a deflation in the pit of my stomach. Suddenly I felt embarrassed that I had made a big deal out of it to my SO.

185,"Hey everyone, I'm coming here because I honestly have no idea what to do, so here is the story:

My friend lost keys to a junk van and it would cost way too much to have new keys made. While trying to figure out what to do with the van, it was towed and brought to a towing company that charges $25 per day of storing the vehicle. I call the company up and the person on the phone tells me the abandoned vehicle process; they hold the van until the end of the month in which an auction takes place to sell the vehicle. The auction price is then deducted from the storage fees. He says by the end of this, I'll probably have about an $800 - $1000 bill. This sucks, but it is the only option since I don't have keys to move the van. 

Two months roll by and I'm starting to wonder why I haven't gotten a bill yet. I call the company and they now say that since the van didn't have license plates (something they knew the first time I called) they had to register it in the state of Washington. I'm not ok with this, so I ask if I can speak to someone with the authority to talk about this. He transfers me to his supervisor where it goes to voicemail. I leave one asking for him to call me back.

Over the course of the next month, I called a few more times with the same results, transfers, voicemail's, and no returned calls. (I have been recording all of my attempts in a google doc.)

Now we are in the present and the final bill has been sent. They held the van for 106 days racking up a bill of $2700 that is due at the end of this week. I have called multiple times every day and am still getting the same results; transfers, voicemail's, and no returned calls. 

I don't know what to do now. I know I owe money, but I feel like they are borderline extorting me with this business practice. I don't have the funds to pay the bill, nor do I believe I should right now. If I don't, they will probably give my debt to a collections agency, ruining my credit. Is there any legal actions I should be taking or other actions I haven't thought of yet?

tldr: Towing company is holding my van, tells me they hold it for one month and sell it in an auction. Ends up holding it for 3.5 months racking up an astronomical bill of $2700 and won't answer or return my calls. Bill is due at the end of this week.",05Apr2017,1

I currently work for a small company in the UK and live at my parents' home. I've been offered a job in Amsterdam with a comprehensive benefits package and almost double the salary I'm on - but I can't seem to make the decision.

Fact is, it's WAY too far out my comfort zone, and in my mid 20's I've only ever moved away for university. I can't envisage myself working and living in a culture which is so different from my own - and more importantly not knowing anybody at all. 

The thought terrifies me, but at the same time I feel foolish for turning down such a great offer. I currently work for a small company, where I know almost everyone really well and I think is pretty unique. I'd be trading that in for a very (very) large corporate company (with a slightly shorter lunch break).

Fact is, I was headhunted for the job and never sought it out. But I imagine for most people the decision would be a no-brainer. Does anyone have some wisdom to share?

As I type this my mum is shouting at my dad, they're splitting up and to be honest I'm glad because the sooner the better. 
She's bitter, cold hearted, two faced and petty. 

she finds reasons to complain and points fingers at anyone but herself, she drinks and she smokes, she doesn't do anything that would be considered nice to herself. She repeatedly mentions that she has the right to drink because ""if you had my problems you'd drink too"" 

When I was younger it was my dad who cooked, took me to school, to my concerts, paid for tutors etc etc. 
She didn't do any of that, and if she did she complained. 

Today she was really yelling at my dad and I just couldn't sit there, I told them I'm taking the dog for a walk and she snatched the lead off me and said that I couldn't, I got angry and said that all she does is yell and that I don't want to be here and she told me to never stand up to her again. 

This is happening everyday, I can't escape it. She's making it hellish. 

I feel guilty because I want to love her, I want that relationship that a daughter should have with their mother and I can't ever have it, when I try she pushes me away, says she's too busy, ignores me, etc 

I don't know, and I didn't know where to turn to so I hope the Reddit community could advise me a little, am I wrong for disliking her? Because I really feel horrible about it

1. My roomies and good friends want met to go with them to a european city with the group of friends of one of them. It's in the beginning of June and only for a few days but quite expensive and some of the people in the group I hate. But my friends tell me: this is the last time you can go on a vacation with us. + I can imagine that once I'm there it could be a lot of fun + I never went on a grad trip. 

2. I love travelling and my bf wants to go to an African country with me. I've never been to any African country and it would be a lot of fun. He wants to go in the month of June as well. However, I've been on two trips with him to other continents in the past year (now I sound like a spoilt brat but they were for my internships) and our relationship has been on and off. + my parents think it's ridiculous because they are just working all the time and I'm just travelling all the time (although I pay for it myself so.. ). On the other hand I feel like I wanna travel as much as possible as I never did that when I was younger and when am I gonna get a month off when I'm working!?

It's really expensive though and I could do this in June or July or August (depending on when my work starts next year).

Basically, I was just barely starting to overcome my social anxiety and depression around the time a cute guy on campus asked me out for coffee. This was my first time ever getting romantically involved with someone of the opposite sex. Before then, I had no experience. The date went fine and we proceeded to go on a few more. Then we started sleeping with each other weekly. We didn't really communicate about what we were doing all that much. We also didn't really talk about our personal lives either. He was into bdsm and introduced me to it. I wasn't all that into it but due to my social anxiety, I didn't make it known. Since he wasn't trying to talk to me for anything other than sex, I decided to end it to prevent getting my feelings hurt. Then a few months later we ran into eachother by coincidence. We started it up again but this time I was introduced to his friends on one occasion. I always felt like he'd try at times to take the next step but everything was unsaid. Once, he also asked me what I liked to do for fun and I gave him the most basic one worded answer ever because I didn't have hobbies. I was still so new to social experiences. I could also just be trying to make myself feel better because he'd still try to sleep with me on every occasion we hung out. 

In the end, I started hearing from him less and confronted him about it. He said he was sleeping with someone else but wanted to keep seeing me to ""keep eachother company."" I ended it (again) because I was planning on moving 5 hours away the following semester. Well, here's the part I'm confused about. I didn't think about him at all for about 5 months after that until I found his social media by accident. There I saw dozens of pictures of him traveling the world with a girl I'm assuming he's committed to. I immediately felt a knot in my stomach and since then, it's almost all I think about. I don't know if I just miss the affection or if I want to be with him. I don't know if I'm jealous of the fact that I'm not traveling the world with him or with the idea of him. All I know is that I feel like absolute shit and need some advice on how to get over this considering it's been almost a year.

205,"I feel like I've gone from relatively normal to completely insane. I'm obsessed with my ex. We dated for about a year and a half and broke up maybe six months ago. I have a drinking problem which lead to weight gain and just all around shittiness. I don't blame him for leaving, but I can't come to terms with it. No other relationship has affected me this way. I actually ended up in a mental facility. I lost my job. I dropped out of school. The drinking escalated, but I've been trying to quit with AA, therapy, online resources, etc. I had to move back in with my parents, which is my worst nightmare come true. They can be wonderful people, but my mother is also an alcoholic and addict, and she does unspeakable things to my dad and I and has my whole life. She calls the police regularly for no reason. She screams all night, does insane things with money, picks fights constantly, steals, etc. Her new favorite insult is ""no wonder he left you."" 



I loved my ex more than I thought possible. I believe we had a great relationship before my drinking got out of hand. I became close with his friends and family, and life felt so perfect. This break up (and my actions leading up to it) ruined my life. I used to be great at saving and building my credit, and now I have insane medical bills, student loans, and no job for the first time since high school. I was making progress in my major and even looking into research opportunities, but now I doubt I'll ever be able to afford school again, and my obvious alcoholism probably ruined my reputation at that school and maybe even in that city. 



Now I'm in a town I don't know well, with no friends (also thanks to drinking) and unable to let go of these regrets. I'm currently on my sixth day sober, which is the longest I've made it in months. I have officially drained my bank account, so I probably couldn't drink anytime soon if I wanted to. 



I just want my life back. I wish we had at least had a normal break up. I miss him so much and can't get him out of my head. I have to fight the urge to call him just to hear him say ""hello."" 



If I had known I would end up like this, I truly believe I would have killed myself before it could happen. I don't feel like I have any chance at a normal life now. I'm trying everything I can think of to keep him off my mind, but it's impossible. We got along so well. We had so much fun (sober or not). I cry about him every day and I can't imagine having a normal relationship with anyone else. This might be easier if I thought he just hated me, but the way he would talk about me and us made me believe this was a once in a lifetime kind of thing. I guess I know how insane I sound.



I know this is the kind of thing that's kind of too pathetic to listen to. Thank you if you've read it. It's been months since I've talked to anyone really. Any advice would be appreciated. 



TL;DR: I ruined an amazing relationship by drinking, then kind of ruined everything else. Do I have any hope?



Edit: I can't believe I got any replies at all let alone such kind ones. This post is disorganized and sad like most of my life right now, but your words mean so much. I've been pretty isolated for a while, so hearing anything encouraging is absolutely amazing. I definitely need to pay this forward. Thank you.",05Apr2017,7

For some time, I just observed him and saw him hiding I'm the shade and panting. So after a while, I grabbed him and he was fine with it and I took him inside my apartment to give him food and water. I didn't want to go back to get it and see him gone, so that's why I took him. After he ate and drank water, I opened my door and let him leave but he came back within seconds.

I'm tempted to leave him outside but I'm worried after hearing stories of strays being beaten or injured. Also, there's been sightings of a coyote around my apartment from time to time so that's also a safety concern. Since he looks clean and healthy, should I just let him go and hope that the owner is in the complex and that this cat is an outdoor cat and will return to his owner? Or should I keep him for a few days, post fliers and contact shelters? 

Thank you. I apologize if I offended anyone with my method of taking him in the first place but the panting concerned me so I wanted to get him water and A/C.",05Apr2017,1

214,"Alrighty this is going to be loong and unorganized, so bear with me.

[I'm a 17 year old guy who's a junior at an all boy's high school]

Welp, I think I'm finally realizing how completely miserable I am. I think it basically boils down to how bored I am in general. High school is supposed to be fun, at least I'd like it to be, but I never do anything fun or interesting or just anything high schoolers usually do. I've never had a sip of alcohol, never been in the same room as any drugs, never snuck out somewhere, never run from cops, never done anything particularly bad. My best friend is a girl, but other than her I haven't said a word to any girls in the past three years. I've never even been invited to a party with more than 6 people. Now, obviously you're gonna say ""hey, that's a good thing, you're staying out of trouble!"" but hear me out for a bit. I'm not saying I wanna go get drunk and high and vandalize and have sex, but at the same time, I have absolutely zero stories to tell. For example, I had a few friends over, and we were sitting around a campfire talking, and I'm sitting there thinking ""wow, I have nothing interesting to talk about compared to everyone else"". I have zero exposure to any of this stuff. None of my friends are stoners or drunks or particularly good with the ladies, but at least they can talk about it and kind of relate to it, because they've experimented and tried stuff. I feel so left out when people talk about any of it. The most interesting thing I've experienced was going 40mph in reverse in the school parking lot. I was just a passenger. I mean, that's the kind of stuff I'd love to be able to talk about when I'm older, but at this point high school has been the most boring thing ever. I'm left out of so many conversations (as in, I'm sitting there listening not really able to relate) because of this. I have been a part of no shenanigans, pranks, jokes, oh shit moments, regrets, or learning experiences. I feel like I'm not taking advantage of this time to learn and do dumb stuff. It's SO STRANGE to say that I want to do the things I know are wrong and are against my morals, just because I feel left out so often. I feel like I'm going to have HUGE ground to make up in college.

TL;DR:
I'm pretty sheltered and haven't been doing any ""high schooler"" stuff. I have no stories to tell and I haven't done anything memorable, and I have zero exposure to anything 

So, I'm not really sure if any of this made any sense at all, but any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!",05Apr2017,1
215,I am currently in 9th grade and my parents are thinking about putting me in public school. I went to a private Christian school from kindergarten to 7th grade but my parents ended up pulling me out because of money problems. The private school used abeka curriculum and I'm also currently using the abeka curriculum. It is a very Christian based curriculum (which sucks since I'm an atheist) and I'm scared of being behind in what I should know. What do you think will be the most difficult thing about public school? I don't act weird socially but I am introverted and have a pretty severe anxiety problem.

218,"Hey Reddit, I've reached the point in life where I honestly have no idea what to do. If I could best describe myself right now, I'd say I'm a cluster-fuck of terrified, extremely unlucky (like being ginger wasn't enough), entirely consumed by stress and school work, and overall pissed at both life and myself. I am currently enrolled in a BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) program at one of Canada's most prestigious business schools. My situation, in all its glory, is that I am very likely to be forced to drop out of university. The worst part of this reality is that I'm actually in school for what (I'm quite sure) I want to do, at a school that I love. I came into university with a 90%+ academic average from high school, where I was part of many student groups and athletics, however I was not at all prepared for the work load that came with university. Because of this, my academic performance throughout the year has been much worse than ever before. Now, nearing the end of second semester and exams, I feel incapable of meeting the requirements to continue in my program. There are plenty of factors leading me to my assumption that I will have to drop out, but to save time, let's just say the deed is already done. What should I do next? I am confident that if I had the chance to do it all over again, I would be very successful (throughout the year I've gained many good study habits and learned from my mistakes). So here's where you guys can hopefully help me by answering a few questions: 

Should I re-apply to the same program next year? If so, are the marks I received this year included in the application process? Should I take some time off school and the stress that comes with it? Should I work for a year and decide if this is really what I want to do with my life? 

Everything in my life right now seems completely out of control, and any input you may have is greatly appreciated. ",05Apr2017,2
220,"Please unterstand that English isn't my mother tongue. So there might be some mistakes here and there...

I never wanted to be one of these so called ""rich kids"" that receive everything and don't have to do anything for it- of course I can say that because I never really was one of them. 
But anyway if I would have children and enough money I would definitely try to give them the best education possible. Especially nowadays in our modern society where it's a real competition. 

My father left my mom when I was  about 2. At this point my parents have been married for just 3 years. He left her because of an other woman who was much older than my mother but had more money. After their divorce he had to pay child support but due to the fact that he was self-employed in the import/export industry he could conceal certain income. So in fact we never received the right amount of money from him in all those years... yes he paid regularly but for him- the person who used to go out for dinner in fancy restaurants 3 times a day, this money was kind of a joke. Even my catholic boarding school was paid by my mother and she actually had to take money out of her pension fund...My father always lived a high live with lots of traveling, sports, cars, luxury items like watches etc. We on the other side had a really rough live. I still remember it from time to time how hard it was to understand as a child why my Dad was so rich and my mother had a really hard time.
I was at my Dads house every 2 weeks. But he always pressured me to be the best of the sports team or at school and he constantly jelled at me when I was doing something wrong in his eyes. In his outbursts he often told me how stupid I was and if I want to end as an cashier and that my mother was a bit** and that's it was her fault if I fail in life. (please note that I have no disrespect for the job of an cashier- he did) 

After some time he broke up with his girlfriend- again for an other woman. I didn't have a good relation to the new girlfriend as she always tried to degrade me in a way. But after 10 years this new girlfriend- I was 20 at the time- died of cancer and I really helped him through these dark and rough days. I was always there for him and helped him plan the funeral and even held a speech in front of 250 people who attended the funeral because it was his wish. 
After her funeral he went to Spain as he has a holiday house there and I didn't see him for about 8 weeks. When I visited him he already had a new girlfriend (Spanish) which used to be their personal trainer! (Yes, I truly think that they were having an affair for some time...) 
I was slightly confused but I couldn't change it anyway. And of course she is just 11 years older than me so basically it could be his daughter. 
I also helped him clear the house with his girlfriend and 3 other people. As his girlfriend who died used to have many luxury things (30-40 brand bags) he told me that I would have the privilege (!) to choose 3 bags first. I did it (I sold them all) but found it so strange that I had a limited number only. The others could take as many things as they wanted. (Including fur coats) I told my father in the face that I was disgusted by these people to fight over things that belonged to a person who's funeral wasn't long ago. 
It was in the same year when he told my grandfather in a confidential conversation that he has been a sex addict for the last 18 years and that he has been regularly paying for sex in this time. He even told my grandfather that this cost him more that half a million. My grandfather was shocked of course. 

Ever since this summer he is not the same... He is even more money greedy towards me. His new girlfriend got all the jewelry of the old one (200k value in total) and even wears her clothes. He bought an helicopter and she could take some private helicopter courses in the U.K. to learn how to fly an helicopter and obtain the private pilot license. Everything cost about 150000$ without any hotel costs etc. He also travels around the world with her once a year- but only in Business or first class of course. But when he once booked a flight for me he asked my mother if Economy would be ok... 
As he has several apartments I asked him if I could live in one of these. He told me yes but that I needed to pay for it. So I declined...In Spain he even bought a flat in his girlfriends name so she has an apartment already.
I'm 25 now and I worked for the last 6 years in different positions and jobs. In my last job I worked as an real estate agent where I regularly saw rich parents buy their kids some apartments so that they can easily get to Uni. It broke my heart in a way. Please don't get me wrong-I don't want their lifestyle, I don't want their luxury, their cars, their apartments. The only thing I want is education.
I must admit that I also plan to go back to Uni and I'm selling everything I have just to get the money for it. I'm afraid of the future as it all costs money. In the Country I'm living in they don't have such thing as student loans. And I can't get any financial help as my Dad is financially well off...I told him that he still owed us a big amount of money but he just laughed in my face and he told me that I am the one who owes him money as he payed more than was written in the contract!!!
After that I went to a therapist as I couldn't cope with the whole situation. 

My question is how can I accept this whole situation better?
Why do you think does he act like this? I'm his only child. Apart from me he has no family as everyone is dead or estranged . (Uncle) 
Shall I just cut him out of my life? 
How shall I communicate with him?
What do you think is the reason why he doesn't want that I benefit from his connections or why he is not willing to give me a good education? 
Why does he treat his own blood so badly and is so generous with others? 

Thank you so much for reading this!

221,"Culturally the younger generation of Swedes has some very messed up traditions. In this case, my sister's classmate had a birthday party (17-19 age group) that the ""popular kids"" went to. They poured a ton of hard liquor in their aquarium killing all the fish, peed in all her toiletries (perfume, shampoo etc) and lit her entire garage on fire with gasoline. They had a competition on whom could burn the most expensive stuff in her house, and essentially ended up setting the entire garage on fire. They then proceeded to make a song about her, posted it on instagram and the lyrics go ""She was trying to be cool by having a party but now your fish are dead and your garage is gone, stupid girl."" Some kid commented on the video saying how they were fucking assholes and literally the entire party was in on it, so everybody commented telling the guy to stop trying to do the ""right thing"" and other things like ""she got what she deserved.""

232,"I'm 29, and I've been working at my job for about 9-months now. It's the first ""office job"" I've ever had, and I recognize it as being a very good job.

Problem is, I don't seem to be adapting very well.

I feel like it has devoured my life, I pretty much stay stressed-out as my default state of being anymore, and you're constantly walking a tightrope.

Now, the job is amazing in many ways; they're incredibly flexible if you need to take time off, or if you want to work from home. In these 9-months or so, I've taken off a total of three weeks, and managers are cool with that, even with other employees.

But then, yesterday I screwed up -- in a *BIG* way -- and now I'm freaking out, wondering if I'm going to get fired (which several people have assured me won't happen, but will probably get yelled at pretty good).

I decided to work from home yesterday and today, partly because I've been dealing with a cold, but truth be known, it's mostly been because the stress has been eating away at me, and I just wanted a chance to ""chill"". But that's pretty much backfired.

Here's the thing, though; I know a lot of redditors are probably ready to chime in with ""You should quit your job and do something you love!"". But the thing is, I don't really ""love"" doing much of anything (except playing video-games), and as someone who is only *just* climbing out of massive debt from being unemployed for about 2 years, the last thing I want to do is throw away an incredible opportunity, when it may be the only *real* opportunity I've ever really had.

I'm just worried that I don't know how to cope with this job, and that I'm either going to continue to screw up, or that I'm just going to ""snap"" one day.

What advice could you guys offer for trying to, I dunno, ""find peace"" when you're not working? Binge-watching TV just feels like a waste of time anymore, and as much as I love video-games, after a long day at work, I can't seem to snap out of ""work-mode"". I'm always on-edge, and can never seem to focus on anything anymore.",05Apr2017,2
234,"Hi,
I am 16 and female, and my bestfriend is 17 and male.

For some context and background our relationship as a whole, we'll call this guy Branson:

Branson and I have been friends for almost 6 years as we started Comprehensive school together. We were not extremely close until Year 10. Feb 2015: He had a girlfriend, and I was single, and we began to become closer, until one day he started making a move on me by flirting, and I reciprocated. This escalated into him cheating on his girlfriend with me, as we met up and kissed. We exchanged nude photos during this time period of a month, and have not done this since breaking it off. He broke it off, citing he felt guilty. Understandable, and we didn't talk for a few months.

We started talking again a few months later, around July / August 2015, and this was completely platonic.

I was with an abusive boyfriend from September 2015, to October 2016 and Branson would help me through this and was always there when I needed him to be. Purely platonic.

When my abusive boyfriend and I broke up, Branson and I grew closer again and we walked up to a mountain and sat there for a while, where Branson enquirer on whether I still loved him or not. I told him I didn't, (but I was lying, I still felt something for him) he knew I was lying, as he said 'if I kissed you right now then, you wouldn't feel anything for me?' And I said that would be the case, and kept egging him on to find out, but he did not kiss me, saying he felt guilty as he liked another girl at the time (not together, and the other girl wasn't even talking to him romantically, just platonically). After this, he picked me up and swung me around while I had my arms wrapped around his neck, and I said 'you so still love me' and he said he didn't.

My feelings were managed to be subsided at this point, until Feb / March, and I began to want him again, but he had a girlfriend. I wasn't trying to get with him again, but I was imitating conversations, being there when he needed me when things in his relationship were sour, etc. I would also do his homework, buy him food if he didn't have anything that day, and give him money for travel from school if he didn't have it.

Main issue at hand is - Branson and his girlfriend broke up a week ago. Yesterday, Branson and a few friends including me attended a house party hosted by one of our friends, and we stayed overnight too (this is important). We all started to get drunk, and this ended up in me and Branson in the bathroom, and me asking him to kiss me so I could just confirm how I felt about him and the idea of it wouldn't be so tempting and it would just be gone. He didn't do this, and went back downstairs to the party. I went to the spare room and went to bed.

Branson then came up to me after a while, seemingly drunk, touching my knee, touching my thighs saying how they are 'squishy', saying how I am 'petite' and so 'small', and he wrapped his arms around me cuddling me. After a while, this escalated into him teasing me by going to kiss me and then pulling away, but then it turned into makeout sessions, and then both of us undressing so I was in my bra and underwear, and him in his boxers. We touched each other through the materials briefly, and he was kissing my neck etc. After a while, he revealed he wasn't actually drunk, and he knew what he was doing and he was testing me. We fell asleep, cuddled up.

We talked about it this morning, and he told me he doesn't love me and he doesn't want me like that and it doesn't mean anything to him - he was saying this when it was going on. He had previously told me that we cannot be together, as his parents found out he was cheating on his girlfriend with me, and they don't like me and would never approve. He told me he doesn't love me and doesn't want me, and that I shouldn't love him, however, when I left after talking it through, he messaged me asking if I'd got home safe? Although, I did tell him that I wanted him to make more effort initiating conversation with me and replying to me etc. He refers to me as his best friend, and says I matter to him, and he loves me like a friend

I can't stop thinking about him and where to go from here. Why would he make out with me and touch intimate areas, and be willing to cuddle with me if he didn't love me or want me in some way? What do I do now? I really love him and want to be with him, but I've asked him to be with me in the past and he's said no, and he has told me he doesn't love me, but I'm confused on why he would do the sexual things to me if he didn't want something with me.

I try initiating conversations with him through messenger but he ignores me a lot, or is extremely slow at replying. When he does reply, he's sorta blunt and makes it difficult to continue conversation, but I try anyway. I think he is messaging lots of other girls, and he does have a lot of online girl friends he's met over games, which makes me jealous and wonder if he's ever tried to make a move on them..
Tl;dr: got tipsy and fooled around with my guy best friend who cheated on his girlfriend with me. He was more sober than he led me to believe, and revealed this halfway through the fooling around, but has also said he doesn't want or love me. Why did he do it?

238,"Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

Here is a little backstory
I was married for about 7 years, I got married when I was 20.  Before I got married I met my EX wife online, she lived on the west coast and I lived in Chicago.   After a few visits she ended up moving in with me at my moms house but that didn't work out so after I suggested we move out to where she is from we decided to take the plunge.  We moved out to the west coast and got married 4 months after the move.  It was a lame ceremony and my family wasn't there so it didn't feel ""real"".  Well after 7 years that ended.

I moved to Minnesota with work, mainly to get away from the west coast. I met a girl online before I moved to MN, I even flew out to meet her before I moved.  I didn't move for her! I moved to be closer to home.  So I moved and then things didn't work out, she kind of broke my heart a little. I lived in MN for 3 months and after my heart was broken I dated another girl for maybe 2-3 weeks before I ended it.  I then made plans to move back home to Chicago.  

Before moving to Chicago I met a girl online, and we chatted for a month.  I then moved, we met, and dated for 4 months.  I ended the relationship for a few reasons but I told myself I needed to work on ME and try to get healthy and active and try to spend more time with my dogs.  Well that lasted a few weeks before I went back to online dating.  Met a few girls but ended up dating one, we are two months in and I want to end it.  It's not anything she did, I mean she is talking about marriage and a family and all that jazz.  We did both say I love you, but I honestly don't know what love is.  I know what unconditional love is, but I don't know what it's like to get butterflies, to want to spend every minute with that special person.

I guess I just need some advice on whether or not I should just stop for a while? Maybe take some time off, work on myself, focus on work and saving money?  And if something happens along the way so be it.  I feel like I keep forcing myself into a relationship using a dating website when I should be focusing on other things.  Part of the reason why I think I shouldn't be in a relationship is because I live at home and have two dogs and work 45+ hours a week.  So there is no privacy and we can't hang out during the week ever, she also lives at home and lives 40 minutes away which makes things even more difficult.  I try to make things work but I just don't have the energy and I feel like a relationship right now is just suffocating me.

I guess I am just looking for any advice.  I personally think I should be single for a while, get my own place, and then start thinking about a relationship.  I have barely been single for a straight month since I was 20, I mean I think I need to live a little and just let things happen naturally and I am hoping that's what you guys think as well.

I'm considering getting one of those sound emitters that sends out a negative sound, but I am skeptical of it working. Another thing I've seen is vibration collars that don't hurt them, but send out a beep or vibrate when they do something bad.

248,"I am part of a big group of friends and the two people that let me into this group are who I am most closest with. One was a girl and one was a boy, he was someone I found myself thinking I liked when in reality I've come to realise I just care for him and I don't actually like him. 

Being his friend though he's told me he likes another girl in this group of friends and he never stops talking about her to me, he's been getting in to strops about her and is constantly making me be a messenger for him and so I have. 

Problem is though is that I have said to her about this and she said she knows he likes her but she doesn't feel the same way. I dont have the heart to tell him that because he really likes her but now shes also asking me to help her try and get him to somehow make him get over her... (confusing i know) 

I dont know how to help with this and I dont know what to do? How do i get out of the drama? How do I try and get him to stop liking her? ",05Apr2017,1
249,"So this was a very small classroom test with a huge punishment for being falsely accused. Anyways it was Just to test some knowledge and after it we are suppose to hand it to someone different for marking. So I handed mine to the guy in front of me. But the guy who actually cheated was 2 rows behind me and he didn't give his test to anyone (so he was gonna re change his answers) and was talking throughout the test. Teacher pulled me out and asked me what was going on and if I didn't admit he would ""burn me"" so I was very confused and literally didn't know what happened. He said the entire row was cheating and it was obvious because we did better then we usually do. I took this as an insult of course haha. So now I get that full unit as an F which is bad for me because I don't have the space in my grades for that to bring it down.

So what can I do/tell him to get this fixed. Please.",05Apr2017,1

253,"Posted this one on r/career_advice but with  no comments so trying here. 

I interviewed for an internal position at another location and got the job offer. The problem? It was only $5,000 more in salary (after negotiations were done, no budging room). This job transfer had no relocation assistance and required me to move myself plus travel an hour and 20 minutes each way per day before I can move down there since I don't have enough money to break my lease right now. I did some calculations based on toll costs, gas, and moving costs... I would be out $4,000 this year if I did the transfer. I just couldn't swing it so I had to decline the offer. Yes it was a promotion but I am getting promoted at my current situation anyhow. I went for the job because I thought that it would have been at least a $10K advancement. Anyway, the problem now is, an old boss/friend of mine asked me to apply for the job since she was the hiring manager. After I declined the offer officially, she went off on me calling me a ""Disappointment, waste of time"" and that her and I are officially ""done"" now. I'm not sure how to react, I've apologized to her many times and said that I thought that it would have been a higher salary and that I just couldn't swing the extra cost. She isn't being understanding and now I just feel bad. They promised me a lot at the job saying it was going to be so great with promotions and everything... but I couldn't gamble on that but now I just don't know. 

Question is, should I have taken the job offer? Did I make the right decision? I have now pissed off the hiring manager so I am scared for the future opportunities within the company... 

Thank you!

UPDATE:Thank you everyone for your support! Everyone has reiterated in my mind that I did the right thing for myself. It's true, I'll get some other opportunity later, this isn't the end all be all (obviously). I'm getting a lot of advice on going to HR about this. I think I might just speak with the HR person and just have this be on file. Is there a way to have this on file without it notifying the hiring manager? I'm just afraid that she'll get wind of me going to HR about this and retaliate even further or have this situation get worse. These messages are via text so I have everything saved.",05Apr2017,47
254,"And I need someone to hear me. To acknowledge what I say. I'm ready to talk, I think because I'm ready to move on. I've been disassociated from everything for the past year. I'm becoming more cold, and more bitter and I've been trying to change that so I can process these events and move on. The trouble is, I've isolated myself. I have a few close friends who I don't want to open up to. And one that I chose to completely ignored me, another just spoke over me about some bullies they had over 20 years ago in high school. I wanted to scream in her face that this is not childhood bullying. This is trauma after trauma after trauma and it isn't even anything remotely close to schoolyard bullying because I've experienced that. And it is one of the last things on my mind because it is completely incomparable. Others, I just can't seem to do it. I see their face, when I was a kid and I'd talk to someone. They look at you with that sad face, and put a hand out to you and it just makes me shut down completely. I don't know why but the look makes me wish I never said anything in the first place and I take ten steps backwards.  I've spent a year working out, following a strict diet, forming habits, enforcing a routine, and magnifying my ego to impossible proportions just to feel like I was okay and that I would never have to think about how ugly I am on the inside because I looked perfect on the outside. Now i feel like I'm choking. I can barely eat anymore. I come home, I turn off the lights and I work out in the dark. I watch the muscles in my body work as my eyes adjust to the light and I focus on everything else, anything else. Now I'm at work, in the middle of a task and I'll start crying. Or I'll get so mad, I bang my fist against the wall or kick the desk a few times, and hope no one heard so no one asks me a question about it because I don't even know what I'm upset about. I have a lot to process. And I just need to talk. And I have no one to talk to. ",05Apr2017,5

260,"I finally made it. I graduated from college and got a great job. It pays decently for entry level, and will look great on a resume. I'm living in a new city( which I always wanted to do ) and I should be loving life. This is what I worked so hard through high school and college for.

Only thing is: I hate the job. I wake up every day dreading that I have to go. I hate the office talk and gossip. I hate the staff meetings. I hate looking at excel all day. I hate composing emails trying to sound like I'm excited about what I'm doing.

Summer is approaching, and instead of feeling better, I'm feeling worse because I'm going to be inside all summer. All through high school and college I worked fun outside jobs in the summer.

261,"My mother, in particular, is terrible. Many of my siblings are lazy, entitled, and frankly, kind of assholes. Messes are made but not cleaned, chores are not done, dishes and soda cans are left out, rooms are not cleaned--and there are no punishments for any of this. It oftentimes feels like I'm the only one getting chewed out for things, and it more often than not is because I've insisted (read: refused to stop bothering someone) until they cleaned that dish or threw away that trash or did x chore. This is a house where everyone knows better. I'm 18, I have 2 older brothers; I have a 14 year old sister and almost-11 year old twin siblings. There is nobody that doesn't know they should be picking up after themselves and keeping on top of their responsibilities.

Some examples of general fuckery include:

* One of my older brothers is tasked with scooping the litterbox daily and changing it twice a week. He does not do this. As a result, the cat has taken to shitting behind the piano in my bedroom. Before that, she was shitting in seldom-used kitchen cabinets, which she was somehow batting open with her paws, until we installed those little child guards on all of them. The litter box remains unscooped.

* I had a cat that passed in August. Being that he had long fur, shed a lot, and was generally considered to be *my* cat despite being a family pet, I vacuumed the carpeted bedroom I share with my 14 year old sister. I did this about once a week, maybe a week and a half. Almost immediately after my cat passed (maybe a weekend later?) my sister got a guinea pig. And he lived in our room, which meant there was constantly hay and guinea pig shit everywhere, because somehow for some reason my parents put another life into the hands of a girl who gets pissed off when told to clean her very own messes. I digress. I think it's only fair that after spending years picking up after my own messy pet, she do the same. As of today, I don't know how long it has been since she vacuumed. She has never done it without my asking--nay, demanding. The floor is still filthy, including under the beds and behind all her clutter she has refused to move. Despite mentioning this to my mother multiple times, instead of being told to go finish cleaning up for once, my sister is permitted to go play in the pool after promising to finish later (which here means a slight nod when my mother said ""you'll do it later, right?""). Conveniently, later never comes in this household. When I expressed to my mother this needed to be done and I didn't think it was an unreasonable expectation, she barely acknowledged or even looked at me, because she was too busy pulling up and watching a video on facebook.

* On that note, my mother seems more inclined to brag about her """"""great"""""" children on social media (mostly facebook) while not actually being a competent parent, or even, really, a decent adult. She frequently enjoys bragging about my good grades and exaggerating all my hobbies and aspirations. I'm wondering if my career goals are such because I decided them or she did.

* My mother likes to poke and prod and demand to know everything about my friends and lovelife, but won't listen when I have anything slightly more important to say. She likes to think we don't have the ""typical strained mother-daughter relationship,"" as she puts it. She only thinks that because when she decides she's right, her mind won't be changed.

* My mother very frequently complains about people not cleaning dishes used to cook, but does exactly the same. I once asked her every day for a week when she planned to clean the pot she left sitting on the stove after boiling eggs. She didn't clean it until she needed it for something else, and every inquiry as to the status of the pot was met with increasing annoyance.

* My mother scolds me for doing the ""parenting"" when I occasionally get so frustrated I snap at a sibling to do whatever thing it is they should be doing but are pretending they don't know they should be doing. Maybe she should be the goddamn parent, then, instead of spending 80% of her time in her room.

* She uses the fact that she's going to college now to not do anything around the house, not that she ever did before. She's the only one with no assigned chores, very infrequently appears on the lineup of people to cook for the week, and expects other people to do the washing up for her on the rare occasion she does cook, despite our policy being that the person that cooks gets to put away leftovers and scrub their pans--bear in mind, said person is only expected to do this all once a week.

Those are just the examples I can think of off the top of my head. When it comes to it, a lot of the issues I have with my family stems from my mother. She takes on a very ""do as I say, not as I do"" attitude, and it drives me crazy. When I speak up and demand, to her, that things get done, suddenly I'm the asshole.

It feels like I can't win. If I don't speak up, the house is disgusting. If I do, I get yelled at and the house remains disgusting. It feels like my mother--and most of my siblings--don't respect me, let alone give enough of a fuck to actually listen when I try to say something. I frequently feel miserable and frustrated to the point of tears, but short of doing it myself it doesn't feel like there's anything I can do to even try and improve the situation. What do I do?",05Apr2017,6
265,"Okay, I'm gonna get straight to it:

Is it wrong to just want to live my life hooking up with people? All of my friends are getting married and popping out kids these days and I'm thinking like George Michael: ""My friends got their ladies, they're all havin' babies, but I just wanna have some fun""

I have a good career in academia going for me: already taught before, I'm a published author with an academic press, could have another monograph in the works next year if I play my cards right. Have been a speaker at academic conferences. Done other academic endeavors in multiple European and Asian countries. I'm going places.

Meanwhile in my personal life I have casual sex with people I meet on Tinder or with friends (relatively) regularly. I just don't see why I should be in a relationship like, ever again. Then again I've only been in abusive relationships before so I might have a skewed understanding of them. How many people are in my boat?

266,"Ok so I've wrote a lot of posts about dropping out etc.. and I can't make sense of it/come to a decision, so now I'm questioning whether it is a genuine issue or am I the issue.

I'm failing my degree, I failed 2 exams at christmas and I have my second semester exams coming up in may (different system here in Ireland, just pick a degree and pass, 2 semesters, a set of exams for each, do the core subjects and then chose between the given options) I dislike/am bad at 2 sections. Maths/Stats and Accounting. This semester (which is technically over, as I am on my study break), I haven't been going to lectures or completing my online continuous assessment. Some areas I've managed, but one in particular I haven't (stats) and as a result I'm expecting to fail, and as a result have to repeat at the end of summer before next year along with the 2 I failed first semester.

I spent a lot of my time going out, having fun, seeing friends, meeting girls and less time focused on my degree. I find some sections OK but I only really enjoy Business Information Systems and Information Management, basically the IT side of my course.

If I progress to next year, I have to do the same thing again, but in my third and final year I get to specialise. I will probably choose the IT stream. Is it worth continuing in my degree or am I just fooling myself? I have essentially 3 weeks and then time between exams to study for my tests.

I'm starting to think I should just knuckle down and try to pass, or at least pass my repeats and then take it seriously next year (everyone will, my friends are saying the same thing, everyone says the same thing, second year is a lot less going out, and a lot more work.) Lucky for me first year does not count towards my end result/gpa. I'm just worried about my future, I could not afford to go back and change my degree..
I guess I do like it with the exception of the maths, I don't particularly like the accounting but I'd find a way to manage. Am I the problem here?

TLDR: Not sure if i should drop out or just put in more effort.

268,"I'll try ot make this short. As a lonely 18 years old dude I met a girl through work which became my best friend very fast. We started talking about everything and she told me about all of her problems in life, things she barely tells anyone, and so did I. Well at one point I fell in love, but being stupid I rejected those feelings until I couldn't anymore, so I told her, but she didn't feel the same way towards me.


Ever since I realized I'm in love with her, our relationship sucked. We don't have anything to talk about. I feel the need to impress her all the time so our conversations are short, forced, and awkward. Whenever I see her with other male friends she has I want to punch someone in the face out of jealousy. It drives me nuts.


Now, for personal reasons, I'm only going to be seeing her once in 2 weeks. But even then, I still think about her daily , and the fact we're not together still tortures me. I love her as a friend but I just don't know if I can lose my feelings for her and turn the relationship to what it was before. I've seen people say that cutting contact is the only option, but it honestly scares me. I mean, we have common friends, so that would be very weird, and also without her and our friends I'll be lonely again... And I don't want that. I also love our other friends.

I don't know what's wrong with me or why I keep doing this weird thing avoiding texts. I'm even doing it as I type this, because for some reason I decided the best time to respond to her message would be at 7:30.

However, today another piece of a broken tooth came off(it broke again) causing severe pain. I can't chew food anymore, it is the worst tooth pain I have ever felt. The problem is that I don't think my dentist is going to work on both of my teeth on this Friday's appointment. I NEED to have my front tooth fixed(for personal reasons, but it HAS to be taken out this week), but this pain is horrible and as I said, I can't chew food. I'll probably have to choose between getting my front tooth fixed, which leaves my newly broken tooth to cause me severe pain. Or I can fix the tooth that I have pain in, and leave my awful looking broken front tooth still there. I don't know what to do, I'll either have to look like shit or feel the worst tooth pain I've ever felt in my life.
