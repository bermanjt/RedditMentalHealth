2,"I really like this guy. He cracks me up, he's very sweet and I'm attracted to him. I've known him for about a year now; he is the truck driver that makes deliveries to the store where I am the cashier. He always seemed to have an air of quiet confidence with him which speaks volumes to me. He would drop off his delivery and he always came to flirt with me for a few moments before he had to leave.

So, he asked me out about a week ago. He actually asks stuff about me and wants to get to know me. He actually wants to go out and do stuff, and spend time with me and all that. I was extremely nervous around him after he asked me out at first, but I've since gotten over it. I asked him if he gets nervous around me and he said yes. In fact, he said ""I'm nervous all the time."" I asked a little more and he in fact has anxiety like I do. I confided in him I have the same disorder and felt closer to him.

Skip ahead to now, and his anxiety is already a strain.

For example, we went to see a movie. I had a great time and we were in the parking lot for a little bit afterward, just chatting. He said he felt I was drifting - and I have no idea why. Especially considering we've only been dating for a few days at that point. And he wouldn't tell me why he felt that way. Red flag for me but I dropped it so he could tell me later if he wanted to.

After we parted ways that night and were texting, he asks me what I thought of the movie and I said it was a bad movie. It was. The actors weren't that great and the dialogue was cheesy. For some reason he thought that meant the whole date was terrible? I pointed out the flaw in that logic but became more concerned about the ""situation.""

Skip ahead to today, my first day going back to therapy (only told him it's the doctor). I told him multiple times I wanted to spend today alone. He wanted me to let him know how the appointment went afterward, so I did and mentioned I was going shopping. He suggested meeting up somewhere (half an hour away) but I was just going to a small place down the street on my way home and didn't feel like driving half an hour in my hot, no AC car on my day off. I declined and he says ""I understand."" Then not even ten minutes later he's asking me to be honest with him if I really do want to date him or not. So then I got frustrated.

Skip ahead to just now. Talked about some other things and worked it all out. I mentioned it would be nice to cuddle and watch some tv, because ""I'm exhausted, today was very hard..."" He completely ignored the fact that I said I had a hard day, and wouldn't stop excitedly talking about cuddling. I asked if he was just going to ignore what I said about having a hard day; and only then he says he didn't mean to and asks me to tell him about it. Now I'm just mad. So I told him no and that I would talk to him tomorrow or something. Now he's called me 5 times so far. And it's stressing me out.

I really like this guy. I don't like drinking but I want to try being with him even though he drinks. I'm an atheist, and he's a Jehovah's Witness, but I still want to try being with him. I never saw myself being attracted to a guy like that. But this frantic insecurity of his is already hard.

I always keep in mind that his dating experience is very limited, and he's only been in two relationships (and they both cheated on him, so a big ""fuck you"" to those girls) but I'm worried I will end up carrying the whole relationship, coddling him because of this frantic insecurity. I don't know if this is just how it is right now because he's so inexperienced, this is a new relationship, and he really likes me too - or if it's always going to be like this.

I will talk to my therapist about this more, but I was hoping for some advice in the mean time. Or maybe hearing some success stories - that would be great too.",26Jul2017,1
4,"Background

I am 30 year old woman, I left the house back in April (family home). My parents are middle eastern (note: this is not a reflection of middle eastern culture, this is a reflection of my family). My parents took me leaving very well. My mom took it worse, she called me everyday swearing and calling me names (wh*re etc). I left because I was fed up, I'm the only girl of 5 boys, whom are given much more freedom. I havent been allowed to go abroad for school, i'm not allowed to travel. The breaking point that made me leave was when my mom was pressuring me to speak to this man whom i was not interested in, she then wanted to me speak to another one, i told her no, i'm not interested then she completely lost it and began to harass me, swearing and become very verbally abusive. She said that I""m an embarassment and a shame and girls dont just leave their families (she's very conservative but also has mental health issues i'm sure). My family has lived in the US for 30 years, so she shouldve at least adapted by now and all girls i know who are of the same background travel and are independent, so this is just my mom)

 I got into med school into the carribean and my dad, who intially said he'd pay, said no, he'll pay after i'm married. then he said the school wasn't good enough. Either way, I was fed up and left. My dad has been on and off the past few months, some days he'd nice and once in awhile he'd become aggressive and last week he disowned me, now he's calling me and being nice again. I'm exhausted and even tho my dad's improved, his abrupt switches in behavior throw me off and leave me guarded. I don't know what to do. I havent spoken to anyone in my family since april except my dad, but even with him, i get anxious and sometimes i feel guilty cuz at least he's trying but other times i just cringe speaking to him",26Jul2017,2
5,"Hey redditors,

The reason why I keep coming back to Reddit is because I feel extremely safe, not because I'm behind a monitor but because everyone can ask for unbiased opinions relating to personal situations in their life. I had a personal account where I would seek advice regarding questionable things my friends were doing and other personal stuff.

One day, one of the girls actually googled a certain situation in my life and my reddit post came up and she posted it in our Whatsapp group chat, and everyone laughed about it and made fun of me for being a nerd. It was about my sister being a complete ass and this friend found my sister's facebook page and offered to link it on my Reddit post to get people to harass her, which I was quite horrified with. Yes, my sister and I hardly say a word to each other but I would never want anything bad to happen to her. Another girl then started lurking my posting history and started posting them all in our whatsapp group.  In the group of girlfriends, I'm probably the most lowkey girlfriend in that group l as I could possibly be and I was panicking and hated that they found my account so easily. Needless to say, I deleted my account but I had made some good friends on there that I've lost because I didn't think of saving their account name before I deleted my own account.

What would you have done if you were in my shoes? Would you have panicked and deleted it like I did?",26Jul2017,1
7,"I am in college and I have lived in a house with 3 other people for the last year. Recently, two of those three moved out and were replaced by some mutual friends. Roomate three stayed, lets call him X.

The new roomates are pretty cool, generally no problems. However, they both smoke weed. This is where the problem starts. Over the past year, X, who is a recreational weed smoker, had a compromise with myself and the guys who previously lived there. We would let him smoke in the garage and wouldn't give him any flack for it. Just keep it out of the house. I don't smoke weed myself, and I didn't want to smell it and have that going on just down the hall.

He was fine with that for the past year and we had no problems. Now, the two new roomates who moved in want to smoke INSIDE the house, not just the garage. I told them I didn't think that was fair to me, who lived here and already had a room here, for them to move in and try to force weed into the house.  Then we got into a huge argument.

The jist of their argument was that they would keep it in their bedrooms, and if I smelled it in the shared area they would spray some febreeze. They also argued that since there are now 3 weed smokers in the house who are all paying the same rent as me, they should have a vote and I shouldn't be able to dictate something like that.

My argument was that it wasn't fair to me, they're forcing this on me in a place where I already had a room and a setup, that I thought using the garage was a fair compromise, and I don't understand why that needs to change. X is siding with them because he likes to smoke too.

Extra info: This is in a state where recreational weed is illegal, but I don't want to get the law involved unless I absolutely have to. These people are decent friends of mine, I'm willing to cut ties with them but I don't want to get them into shit with the law.

I now have 4 options:

1) Cave and let them smoke in the house, keep my room and just deal with it. I don't want to do this, but if someone can convince me that this is the right idea then I'll consider it.

2) Leave the house altogether, leave the room that I've already had for the past year and get out. Essentially surrendering my place to them.

3) Go scorched earth and make it so nobody has the house. We haven't signed an official lease yet, so I could theoretically call up the leasing company and say hey I want out, put the house back on the market, and there's nothing they could do about it.

4) Try to convince them to stick with the garage. They don't seem to be budging on this, though, and if anyone has an argument or advice I could use to try to convince them of this then I would appreciate it. This is my desired result.

Not sure how to handle this, and I'm welcoming any advice or outside opinions from people who have dealt with roomates/been outnumbered in a situation like this before.",26Jul2017,1
14,"Hey everybody on red, for starters, I'm a woman. I'm 20, and I've never had sex or a boyfriend or anything, but I don't really want these things normally. However, once every now and again I get really...ugh, horny, I guess? And I feel like I *need* to have sex like right now. So I get on a dating app and go on a few dates but I always end up hating the guy. But at the same time, like I *really* feel like someone needs to stick their bits in my port, you know? Like, I rub one out over and over again but it just doesn't help until the feeling goes away in a few days. But this is happening CONSTANTLY now. What the hell is wrong with me, and would it be bad if I just went ahead and did it anyway? I so want to have sex right now, but my brain is telling me no and making me hate myself.

15,"I believe I have a fearful/avoidant attachment style. 

I'm scared of close attachment or emotional intimacy due to past rejections, emotional insecurity in the home and maybe fear of rejection.

I think the perception that investing my emotions in another will be too dangerous and cause me undue emotional harm is what often prevents me from getting close to anyone.

Simultaneously because I'm desperate for a relationship I try to get close, often too quickly. 

When I don't scare my love interests away by trying to get too close too quickly things succeed- for a time. Yet when others try to get close to me ""I love you"", ""I want to be more like you"" I push them away because I'm concerned about being overly reliant and then hurt.

The questions are:
How do I overcome this?
How do I learn to trust others and stop fearing the danger of dependency?
How do I become more patient with others and take time to develop relationships?",26Jul2017,1
16,"•So by now most people know about what happened to Chester from Linkin Park. His death took me by complete surprise, and I was hit way harder by it than any other celebrity death I've ever heard about. For the first few days I was simply in shock and couldn't get up off the couch, couldn't think, couldn't function.


•Now my reaction may seem extreme, but you have to understand that I've struggled with depression off and on for a lot of my life, and their music has gotten me through *everything* life has thrown at me since highschool. I was one of their early fans, and their music was an enormous comfort to my 16 year old self at the time when I was at my lowest. I've seen them live about 6 times, met them three times, and went to a LPU summit fairly recently.


•They were indescribably special to me, and while I didn't really know Chester on a personal level, you form a deep attachment to people who you feel you can relate to, and whose music and lyrics comfort you in times of distress. I remember there were times when I was just dragging myself through the day because I knew it was only X amount of time until I saw them live again.


•Part of what shocked me so much was because I've struggled with my own depression, there's always the worry of ""What if I do the same thing?"". You know? If he couldn't keep his shit together, how am I supposed to? 
It's easy to feel like your heroes are immortal as well, which I know is an unhealthy viewpoint but it makes this even more difficult to accept. They were ***huge*** for me.


•My grief has been gradually lessening and improving over the last few days, and I am slowly resuming ordinary life. I took some time off of work to deal with this, and am planning to go back in a couple more days. 
When the news first hit I had extreme anxiety, hopelessness and sadness. More overwhelming than I have ever felt before. But the feelings have been getting more bearable, although I think it's going to be a gradual process. I'm still bursting into tears off and on and feeling like my head is full of cotton, unmotivated and stressed out, lack of appetite, extreme exhaustion, mostly just the usual symptoms of grieving.



•The problem is, my family doesn't understand at all why I'm so upset. They don't think it's right for a 30something year old to be **this** upset about a person they didn't personally know, and are being very unsupportive.
They keep telling me to ""just get over it"" and move on, and I feel that they are rushing me through the grieving process. And I worry that it might make my depression worse if I don't just allow myself to feel this and work my way through it.


•I told them straight up that I just need some time and space to deal with all my feelings, but they still don't understand why I'm grieving because he wasn't somebody I knew, even though he was such a big part of my life, and it feels like I've lost a close family member. 
They told me that my reaction was unhealthy and that I am emotionally unbalanced, and that none of this is normal.

•I'm not just grieving for the person, but all of his future work that never will be, as well as for the possibility that Linkin Park may never continue together as a band again. It's as if I'm losing a part of the last 15 years of my life, not just my favorite singer.

29,"So my question is about transcripts and admissions.  My situations pretty unique, I am going to school to play football and and trying to come in as a new student.  But my issue is when I was 18 I attended 1 semester at a different college in the same state. My grades weren't great but the real issue is that I still owe that school money and it's too much for me to pay all at once and so they won't release my transcips.  Now I haven't told my coach this and don't if I should just try to come in as a fresh student.  Or potentially if I told my coach, is it possible for a school to accept a student knowing that they don't have a college transcript.  As I am coming into this school as a walk on I don't have a scholarship as on now and would need finiacial aid to go to school, but if I didn't bring up my old school I couldn't use financial aid cause it would tell the new school about the old.  And as this is just a d2 school I am unsure of the sway the coach may have, and I don't wish to lie on my admission but I'm not sure if I have a choice.

It's a bank job, would look decent on the resume.

Also I'm not keen on having to network with random people on the street. BUT the boss is a really sweet guy and I would appreciate the professional environment.

But the thing is I have an interview scheduled at a hardware store. NOT my first choice. But their pay is really good. It's only 10 minutes from my house. More flexibility with hours, although sucky hours of shifts (they're open 5am to 11 pm). I'm a girly girl, it's not my thing, but pay might be worth it.

What would you do in this situation? I'm going to call the 1st place back after the interview with the 2nd.

43,"This is a throw away account as I would rather not have this post on my main account. I'm a 20 year old male who's having a hard time finding anything fun anymore that I used to enjoy. Let me explain. I used to love playing video games. I would play them for hours upon hours a day. I would always watch Youtube videos and find entertainment in them without fail. I used to be extremely passionate about computers and cars but over the course of the past couple months, I've lost all interest in all of the above. Games for some reason aren't fun for me anymore. I can't watch Youtube videos anymore without getting incredibly bored. Cars and computers are just something of my past now and I don't know why. I guess what I'm trying to say is how can I re-kindle my interests and passions like I once used to have? This decline has happened within the last 6 months or so and it's getting worse and worse each day. I don't want to say I'm depressed because I'm not sad. I look forward to living each day. I go to work without hating my life and have extremely close friends and a loving family. I have no reason to be sad, hence why I'm not. I just can't seem to find the things I once found fun to be fun anymore. It's growing tiring as I just spend my days bored now until I'm with my friends. I know a common question for things like this is ""do you do drugs?"". The answer is yes. I've been smoking marijuana daily for almost 2 years now but even that doesn't really bring me any joy or fun anymore. It's just become something I do. My interests and hobbies that I once loved span back much longer than 2 years so I don't want to say it's the marijuana messing with my head either. It hasn't made me lazy or lacking motivation. I have noticed though that my concerns about myself, life, feelings of self doubt, sadness etc have been coming on strong recently when I smoke though (recently as in the past month or so). I also do LSD fairly frequently as it's the only thing that can really put me in a mindset where things are interesting to me anymore. Has anyone dealt with situations like this before? How did some of you fix it if you were in this position? I just want to enjoy the things I once did. Also, NSFW warning, I noticed my sex drive has absolutely plummeted recently as well.

46,"I need to pull the trigger this week. Friday is my deadline to accept the new job and put in my two weeks notice at my current Job.

I am a helicopter pilot. Currently a Lead Pilot with the company I have been with for two years. I sometimes train new hires on our procedures, but the company wants to invest time and money on making my a primary training pilot. This means I would train all of our new hires to fly our aircraft. This might come with a tiny pay raise, but probably not. 

On the other hand, I have an offer for an air ambulance position close to my home town on the other side of the country. This position is a one week on, one week off schedule. My wife would not be able to leave her current job for nearly two years meaning I would have to commute via airline every week. 

The pay with this job is on par with what I am already paid, slightly more. It is also more stable pay-wise than my current job.

I made about 75k last year. This year I might make 50-55k....
The new job would be about 70k consistently, but I will be traveling a lot. Though, I feel like the week on/week off would actually give me more time with the wife and kids, as my current schedule can be a bit of a hassle, and I have a lot of long days.

The washout rate is about 20% at this new company, meaning that 20% of new hires fail out of the two week training class. So there is a chance of failure. The job is more prestigious, exciting, and rewarding though.

53,"my best friend and i are both 16, we met freshman year of high school and have been super close ever since. in freshman year we both hit a rough patch and ended up in a psych ward for a week (at separate times) i have depression and anxiety and she has depression. one day she mentioned that her doctors had talked to her about the possibility of her being a sociopath or something along those lines i can't exactly remember, however, no further treatment was set out for that. she's very smart and knows it. we're both in a ""gifted"" type program at our school and she has very high ambitions. let's move on to the characteristics i dislike: her lack of empathy/guilt and how she changes personalities based on her surroundings. for lack of better word she's fake. she hangs out w ppl she doesn't like just to do something. i'm the opposite and my anxiety doesn't help that. i hate seeing her be true and honest w me and then going to a party w her and watching her change to someone i can't relate w at all. now to the biggest problem. she feels little to no remorse for her mistakes, she shows no empathy and it pisses me off to no extent. we have a close friend group and one of the boys we're close w has feelings for my best friend. even though she was well aware of his feelings she slept with his older brother and our friend group is in shambles. she only felt slightly bad when he found out and then got mad when the rest of the group felt betrayed by her bc she says ""she owed him nothing so it shouldn't of been a problem"". that is only the most recent example i can think of. another is when our close friend was suffering badly from her bipolar depression. we both pushed her to get help after watching her struggle for a while, which our other friend responded negatively to and got angry at us. i gave her space while my best friend dropped her as a friend completely and talks shit on her constantly for her lack of mental stability which doesn't seem fair. it's not always big things, small things in her actions show that she doesn't really care about others problems and feelings. i love her to death and we get along so well but the way she handles situations and carries herself makes me want to scream. i really don't want to lose her as a friend but i don't know if she'll ever change. should i just talk to her or should i get out of the friendship? i have no clue.

In a short summary, I have been raised very conservatively and for the most part have not even really had much interaction with people outside very close friends and family, and especially not with males. Only within the past few months has this sort of started to change, but I have a very hard time talking to strangers. I always feel like I have nothing to say. Others I know easily make conversation but I just feel too stupid to do it, or like I have nothing in common with the people I'm talking to. And when it comes to men, forget about it, I look to someone else to speak for me usually, or if I do have to respond when directly addressed, I almost never make eye contact, I look anywhere but at them.

I dont really know how to word it properly so ill just start with an example.

My first relationship ever was so toxic that I always had to apologize and think for 10 minutes about saying something before I said it, in fear or angering her. She also tore away at my mind because she told me she had feelings for me but still kept me at a friend level, and let me act like her boyfriend.   


Now that that is over- Im with my second girlfriend just recently. I asked her if she wanted ""to get serious"" and she said yes; great right? I thought so but then my mind decided to fuck it up and say, ""but does she know what you meant? Does she know you mean girlfriend/boyfriend serious? "".

64,"So I work at a real estate that has a sister company, a newsagency. We're both in the same building. 

I have one coworker at the newsagency side who is really good friends with me. We're both weird as fuck so it works out great, however when we're together she tends to forget that other people exist.

We recently got a new worker at the newsagency side. He's quiet and reserved, I think I've said hi to him like twice? 

Anyway, we have a back room that my friend/coworker (CW1) used to take naps in during our lunch breaks. It has a lounge chair and a table in it. 

Lately our air con hasn't been working properly, and CW1 and I were told that the back room is really cool compared to the rest of the store, so we went in to check it out. This is how the exchange went down. 

*I walk into the back room, realise new worker (CW2) is sitting on a desk chair in there, probably on break*

Me: Oh, sorry, we're just in here to check the room temperature.""

CW2: Oh, you're all good.

CW1: Oh I love that sofa!

*CW1 then slams herself down on the sofa and sighs*

CW1: Ahh, I used to sleep in here!

65,"So, me and this boy (both your stereotypical school ""losers"") were close but not close enough to be friends through middle school, until 9th grade. I was in an abusive relationship and completely broken, and he helped me, became my best friend and all. I started to have a crush on him, and he seemed to have it too, but when I told him I liked him, he told me that we were too young to date and that ""love was friendship on fire"". Surprisingly, it didn't ruin our friendship at all, even though we stopped flirting, but all changed in a party, when a girl forced him to kiss her (he never kissed anyone before and I always wanted to be the first to kiss him). He tried apologizing but I was childish and angry, and I was a COMPLETE ASSHOLE with him. He was the bigger person and never hated me for that.
The years went by, and we were teared apart because of different schools and all. We are fine with each other, I guess, but... I want our friendship back. Whenever I find him somewhere, we only talk for like, 1 minute, and then we leave. I always get nervous around him, because I feel that something is unfinished. What I feel is not romantic at all, because I have a boyfriend that I love with all my heart and soul.

What should I do to become friends again with that old pal? He is a very shy guy and just got his first REAL girlfriend, and even though she's a sweetie, I know how jealous people can be in the first months of a relatioship.

67,"So I'm going on vacation this weekend and visiting some of my college friends, not all at the same time, in their home country.  Some of them live in the country I am visiting, others are just studying abroad.  All we're doing is meeting up and presumably getting a meal outside somewhere, and I'm not explicitly traveling with them or visiting their homes/parents (at least I wasn't planning to).  My parents keep telling me that I need to bring gifts for them, like small snacks and stuff like that.  However, to my understanding, I thought that gifts weren't really a thing unless it was talked about beforehand or it's a special occasion like a housewarming/birthday/wedding?  (If it makes a difference, I'm a Chinese-American guy, my family is Chinese, and my friends are non-Chinese Asian-American.)  When I ate out with them in school I didn't feel an obligation to buy anything, and I'm not sure if this would classify as the same.  In the past when I went to friends' places for house parties, the only gift I brought was a six-pack of beer or a bottle of wine.  Should I buy gifts before I fly over or not?

tl;dr: Should I buy gifts for my friends if I'm just visiting and hanging out with them overseas, since people don't really do it when they hang out in their hometown/in college?  Is this a thing people do?",26Jul2017,1

75,"Hello everyone, so a bit of background here.  I have 1 1/2 years of college education right now through a 4 year University, about 36 credits accrued so far.  I left because I realized I wasn't really doing that well in school and needed to focus on what I really wanted to do.  I jumped between CompSci and Business, but I picked business as an easy major and found that it wasn't worth it if I didn't care.  Now a year and a half later, I would be facing my senior year of school, but here I am working a part time retail job at a grocery store.  It's a nice place, but I don't want to be here forever.  I want to continue my education and make something of myself.

I live with my parents right now so I don't have any major responsibilities besides a couple bills and student loans.  They are moving soon due to work and I have a few decisions to make.  I'm not a huge fan of moving, especially when it's another state.  I'm not very independent and do have a lot to learn about the real world. 
 After working as a cashier in a grocery store and hearing about the other people that have been working there for the past 10-15 years, I can safely say I want my education and the chance to escape and live life.  These are the decisions I have gathered on what I can do.
1) Move with my parents to another state and work for a year, finish school when I can.
2) Find a full time job, move out and go to school part time.
3)Go right back into a 4 year school and try my damn hardest to finish and get a degree/find a job.  I would be able to move with my parents after.

If you have another idea on what I could do, let me know.  I'm afraid of what the future holds for me, especially if that means moving out.   Thanks.",26Jul2017,1

Does anyone have advice about my #2 concern (see below)? Thanks for your help on the first one :).

In HS I cut. There, said it. Whatever, move on. 

So.. now I'm a young professional, mom (young mom, whoops) and I work with kids in non profit on the side...  I do it all with scars on my arm. I know people pretend they don't see them. 

I don't care to hide my past and depression triumph but I do care to be the best role model I can.

1.) I have a gov. Job and am unsure where exactly I want to progress to. 
2.) I'm scared to call a sudden mass of attention to my scars from the people who have seen them and not maybe not said anything (coworkers, parents) 


Help?! Do I still still do it? 

1.)On one hand I have to hide my scars from future employers in interviews what's the difference with hiding a smallish tattoo instead? Might be better even?     On the other, a tatt could be included in a employee policy- scars can't. 

2.)On one hand I shouldn't give others opinions so much weight and on the other... what if I'm not concealing them- im drawing attention to them (initially anyways because of people who know I have them)

79,"Hello everybody, 22 year old university student here. The problem of mine, beside being not able to reflect my true personality and instead of it, reflecting a fake personality, is that I am all alone.

It's as if there is a lot of barriers ahead of me and blocking me from revealing my core personality which I believe everybody will like a lot. My girlfriend didn't leave me and she supports me into fixing such personality-related problems of mine. Thanks to her. There is also one more thing. I am in a delusion that staying quiet and looking thoughtful in a social group was a cool thing. It is not a cool thing, I guess. Within so many years, I thought this was true so I built my personality in such a way but now I realize it is wrong. You gotta express opinion and from your voice tone to your gesture, you gotta show your determination to everybody. Being honest is so important.

81,"Ok, a couple things first off. I'm not suicidal. I fantasize about it a lot and my conclusion is that I'm just too gutless to go through with it. I've even tried on multiple occasions to whip myself into a suicidal angry frenzy by verbally tormenting myself about every thing I'm unhappy with about myself. All that happens is after a while I start feeling ridiculous, like I'm trying to impress someone who isn't there. I do not want to live, I have absolutely zero faith that things will get better or that I will ever be happy. I don't relate to most people, the world around me feels like it's purely for the benefit for everyone but me and I feel like I don't belong. It's like speaking the same language as millions of people and then one day waking up and everyone on earth speaks a diff language to you and all the signs are in this language. I feel like I don't relate and have nothing in common. Little trivial things anger me way more than they should and I seem to go from 0-10 real quick and have even had little mini tantrums where I just wanna do something stupid like break things around me.

I've tried Anti Depressants. Lots of them. None of them worked, or even hinted that they could possibly work, but all of them had side effects to various degrees which just made my mood worse. Often they were sexual side effects, sometimes they were pain related, other times they were just annoying but without exception every single one of them made my mood and my life worse while providing no benefit.

Right now I should be happier than I have been in a long time. I'm healthier than I have been for other 10 decades. I have lost a tremendous amount of weight (over 100kg) and I went from being in danger of needing a wheelchair to capable of walking/riding distances in excess of 10km without trouble. Physically I haven't been this healthy since I was a young teenager. I've also completely reversed a number of physical ailments that were brought on by my weight and now I am completely off all medication. So I should be happy but I'm not.

In fact I feel like I don't even remember how to be happy. Like every little thing is setting me off and I'm snappy and angry. My phone doesn't do what I want or I can't figure something out and I'm ready to throw it on the ground. Nothing I do makes me happy and things that should like TV shows and games etc just make me miserable cause some trivial nonsense happens and I go all the way to 10 on the anger scale. Then I feel like an immature idiot for being so angry at nonsense which just makes me feel miserable.

Now I'm not a bad person. I'm just shy 40 and In my entire life the worst crimes I've committed was shoplifting as a kid. I don't do drugs or drink or cheat or deceive people and I pride myself on being helpful and generous. I'm not Mr Rogers but I am a pretty unexciting person and have always liked who i am towards and around other people. I've always dwelled on my failings though. 
Lately however being angry all the time is making me feel like I'm losing all that.

I feel like if I can't reign it in and get my mind together than I'm just gonna get worse and worse and I'm worried that I might hurt someone or lash out at the wrong person or even just become an angry miserable person with no friends than nobody can stand to be around and who's incapable of experiencing joy. I worry so much that this is where I'm heading and want so desperately to die before that happens.

Now it's not like I'm completely devoid of reasons for being miserable. I mean right off the bat the biggest reasons are that I am in constant moderate to severe pain, I have chronic untreatable insomnia, and lately and my weight loss plan feels like it's completely unsustainable, like every fiber of my being wants to just eat normal food or at least something I like but when I do I turn into an idiot who doesnt know when to stop and end up putting on weight super quick (like 2-3kg in one week) and then I'm back to eating nothing but weight loss shakes for a month just to undo that single week cause I have no self control. I feel like I cannot possibly go through this for the rest of my life. Just the thought that I cannot ever, ever let myself have 1-2 days of happiness without forcing myself to have a month of misery and that this is going to be a never ending struggle requring constant vigilance for the rest of my life... Yeah I'm ready to die. So, so ready.

In fact, when I think of the rest of my life I'm miserable cause all I can think of is that if it's any more than a couple months than It's just gonna be drawn out and miserable the whole time. I cannot even fantasize that my life is gonna get better or I will feel happy at some point cause every source suggests that it's just gonna get worse.

There's no suggestion that any of my health problems are going to get better. My doctor (who is fantastic) is completely unable to help me. I feel like I'm barely maintaining the bare minimum level of strength to not fall to bits and just eat myself into oblivion. And honestly, if it wasn't for the fact that it would take way too long and cause too much personal suffering along the way I would just embrace it and eat rubbish till I eventually died. But there's no way that's any less than a 3-5 year slow drawn out misery, plus I would be losing the only things about the last couple years I've been happy with in the process.

83,"I live in Northern California and am looking to relocate and transfer schools to the Los Angeles area. Currently, I'm working part time as an administrative/office assistant at my college. I've been working/attending there almost two years and have about 70 college credits. I've gained a ton of skill and work experience; my previous supervisor said I was the best administrative assistant she'd had in her 30 years of work experience, and she entrusted me to train my new supervisor when she retired. I work closely with a dean who practically begged to give me my supervisor's position at higher than entry level pay (they were dissatisfied with applicants but needed someone to fill the position) but I declined because I wanted to relocate. Of course, this was pretty flattering as I'm only 19 and this is my very first job...but I'm having trouble getting a new admin assistant position for those exact same reasons. 

I can understand a company reading my resume, seeing I only have 2 years of part time experience, and immediately ruling me out; but I feel like if I got an interview I could better demonstrate my skills and make a great impression in person. I also think that companies are seeing that I live an 8 hour drive away and ruling me out, but I can't afford to move until I find a job. I have a letter of recommendation from the dean. I've also called to follow up on a couple applications and was told that the company was interested in interviewing me, but only after I move. 

What else can I do to help secure an interview? Has anyone had any experience specific to applying for administrative assistant jobs, applying for jobs long distance, or both? ",26Jul2017,1
84,"Hey guys, 

This is going to be quite a long post but please bear with me. My friend and I have been best friends for about 7 years. I'd say for about the first 6 years it was great. We didn't argue about anything nor did we have any major setbacks. But the last year of our friendship I started noticing a lot of things. First, she was always trying to compete with me, whether it was wanting what I had or something as simple as grades in school. Second, she didn't like me talking to other people nor having anybody else close to me. She'd get really irritated, moody and just flip a switch. She'd always shit talk the people I'd make a simple conversation with. It was starting to really suffocate me. Thirdly, when it came time for college applications she gave up on her dream college and applied to same ones I did in fear of me moving away from her and making new friends (something she directly told me). Lastly, she was always depending on me so excessively and it really drained me. I don't mean it In a bad way at all, best friends depend on each other. But i mean it got so excessive that she'd say things like, ""I wouldn't be able to live without you in my life, or I'd go crazy without us being bffs""All in all, I just felt like she wasn't being genuine anymore and it was basically her trying to one up me all the time for stupid silly reasons. This caused me to just distance myself and drift apart from her. The summer before college I remember having a long conversation with her about us growing apart, telling her that I'd hoped for her to make new friends and enjoy her college life etc and she agreed with me. So recently I found out she been talking shit about me on social media on a different account that she doesn't know I remember about. Basically she's playing the victim and making me seem like this horrible bitch. When in reality our friendship didn't end on bad terms, i believe that we really drifted apart and she agreed in our last conversation. This contradicts what she's been saying behind my back. It's been going on for a few months and I'm not sure if I should confront her or keeping my mouth shut :/",26Jul2017,1

My gut feeling is that this is not good. I know her father very well and I have had suspicions (as I'm pretty sure many others have) about his sexuality. This very well could be happening. 

I told her basically to try not to worry because there is hardly any evidence but consider confronting him (calmly) at some point, at least to get some closure and hear him out. She's about to go to college out of town and basically said she wanted to just forget about it and try not to cause trouble before she leaves. I think having a discussion would at least be worth her peace of mind but it could also be a catalyst for a major problem in her family. 

Basically, I'm asking for advice for giving advice. What should I say? What should she do? ",26Jul2017,2
87,"It all started when I was kicked out as soon as I turned 18 in a new town. For awhile, nobody believed my parents would do that without good reason. I've thought long and hard about it for a year and it breaks my heart because I had nobody to turn to, and they knew it. I could never really develop a real relationship with my mother because of what she put me and my sisters through. I couldn't get my drivers license as I was epileptic. I am now cleared to drive!

So here I am walking on the side at of the road at 4 am, when my girlfriend took it upon herself to ask her parents if I could stay. I was shocked, grateful, and relieved already. Little did I know her parents were heavy drug addicts, and if you've ever lived with this breed, you can understand. 

So we go through the motions of living with your typical drug addicts until it got so bad we decided to just run one night, together. A good friend of hers offered her and I a room for rent, and this is where things really took a turn for the worst. We moved in and day one, two, and three were terrific. Until I learned the people we were staying with were drug users, one of them being a heroin addict (Who was head of the household). Bad news. This is a drug house. 

My girlfriend (17 at the time) had trouble finding work because her parents lost all her documentation and would not make the effort to help her get them back. We even tried having a social worker help us. So I'm stuck supporting us two with a minimum wage job. Finally she turns 18, we get her documentation and she has a job. All was going well, we felt like we were on track. Until her dead beat parents showed up wanting to stay.

Here's the thing, addicts love being with other addicts. So when my girlfriend's parents showed up and ended up staying  (against our wishes) things got even worse. Crack heads by the dozens were knocking at the door, having three day long meth parties, stealing every single little item.

Stealing is so bad, my room door has a hasp, deadbolt, knob and a reinforced frame. The door gets locked even if I go to the bathroom. All food is kept in my room along with a mini fridge. Same goes for toiletries. I can't even keep a roll of toilet paper in there.

My girlfriend and I hate it so much we stay holed up in our room for hours. We can't leave the house for to long to much because we know all our belongings will get swiped right from under our feet.

Another concern of ours is being associated with these people and the law. We don't want to go down for somebody else's drug abuse/deals/whatever.. 

We've been physically attacked on multiple occasions, seen horrible things, met horrible people, robbed, cheated, etc. Everytime we hear a car door shut we dart to the front door to check who it is and if the door is locked. 9 times out of ten it is a false alarm. I carry mace and a knife on me at all times. As well as my girlfriend. 

I'm to the point where my mind is giving into the constant anxiety. I cannot eat without forcing myself. I have what I am assuming are mild panic attacks. My sleep cycle is always off. My memory is horrible, and my mind is foggy. I refuse to become depressed.

The thing is, I lost a newly acquired job that I fell in love with and it paid better money as well as good experience. The reason was for being too inconsistent. I was attacked twice in one week, robbed two weeks before, and occasionally being to scared to leave home. Her parents have a lot of crack head enemies, and you guessed it they go after her as well. Putting us both in alot of danger.

Her parents are out now, but the situation is still only 
worse. We have talked with police multiple times of course, they aren't really much help as they hate this crack head road just as much as I do. I could go on for ages about how bad this place is and all the horrible things I've experienced. My eyes are truly opened, that's for sure. I cannot bring myself to trust another human being other than my girlfriend.

I am now jobless with no car. Oh, and the house is on probate and we all have to be out by August 22nd. This is not fair to my girlfriend. What can I do? Where can I go? I always have been good at finding enough work (sidejobs) to eat and pay rent. But something bad always happens when I'm gone. It's like the wild west around here.

I have a new, more fexible job tomorrow morning. But it's only temporary. I'll have enough money for the car itself before we have to move out. But not registration, insurance, etc..

105,"So I'm 19 and currently a Sophomore taking a BS Computer Science. Last 3 months (April-June) was a long summer break after my Freshmen year taking this course. During my freshmen year I was so motivated in programming and algorithms and stuff that even at home, I'm still self studying and trying out new things about my course. It was like I was just playing and having fun.

But after this 3 months of detox from my course (no programming etc.) I can't seem to  get back to where I was. I feel unmotivated to try new programming languages, read books, watch tutorials about programming and stuff. If I try doing it, I feel like I'm forcing myself to do so, which makes it very difficult (and annoying) sometimes. I really like to pursue this path, but there's just some part of me that tells me this is not, like a voice in my head. What do you think I should do? ",26Jul2017,7
106,"I already posted this in /r/askmen and they mutually agreed that I was retarded. I was never entirely sold on the idea anyway, but I'd like to see what you guys think as well. Ultimately I'll probably finish HS. Here it is:

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I thought you guys might have some good perspective on this. 

Basically, I've always hated school. Im an incoming Junior, and I've hated the last two years of HS. I have had good times there and developed some decent relationships, but generally it just makes me anxious/stressed or depressed. I get good grades, but it seems like I'm always being screwed in some way. I've really disliked all the electives I've had so far and I don't like the normal classes much better. 

I also feel like I cant relate to the majority of people my age. Not in a ""le wrong generation"" type way, but most people I know or my friends just annoy me or are just completely different from me. Like I said, I have developed some good relationships at school, I just don't really think it's overall worth it when I'm miserable at school half the time.

If I did drop out, I know I'd be getting a GED, but I don't know what I'd do after that. I wouldn't know what I'd do if I do graduate anyway though.

Edit: I do plan on going to community college for 2 years, and then to a university(probably). If not that I think I may try to do a trade job or maybe something in the military. It's likely I'll go to CC though. For the people who're against this, what do you think could help me get through the next two years? ( I am halfway done, which makes me more hesitant about this whole thing.) Also, I disagree with the whole ""Things will get better next year/in college,"" thing, people have been telling me that for years. Thanks for your responses.

 /r/advice Edit:Thanks you guys. The responses here are quite a bit better than in the other sub. At the very least I'll give this next school year a shot and sort of test the waters. Is there anyway I could make this year a bit easier for myself? What would you recommend I do to be less anxious or stressed?",26Jul2017,13

108," so basically I have a best friend who is called sam, I have been his best friend for about 4/5 years now and then whilst I was at college and he was too we barely spent time together as both of us where so busy with that and the new friends we had found. 

I became friends with a large group of people and I was scared whilst entering as i know thats a lot more people to fall out with if any little thing came about. 

But either way I tried my best with them and just two days ago I fell out with the two that are the 'bosses' of the group (yanno the people that think they're incharge of everyone) I basically put my point across when I disagreed with what they said and they didn't like me being out spoken which I am....

So anyway Its come to the summer time and me and Sam have rekindled our friendship, with that he was also friends with someone he was friends with since a very young age and I was happy to just have fun with them. Like said in my other post I was kinda feeling bad about myself already with hanging around with them and Sam is very fashion forward and looks amazing and his friend Amelia is absolutely gorgeous so beside them I felt so out of place because Im not pretty like her and I don't have money to buy nice new clothes.. 

With those not helping my selfish insecurities, now they sort have been going out with a larger group and having fun with them and they keep on doing it... I've hung out with all of them once and then now they just haven't bothered with thinking of me and bringing me out ",26Jul2017,1

110,"It's odd, cause this was never really a problem for me before. Then again, I could just be adjusting since I used to pour out all my time and energy into school, sports, and extracurriculars that I never really prioritized friendships much (even went as far as thinking that I didn't really need them). But now, I do have friends (though sometimes, I'm not really sure if we are friends either? The concept of connecting with someone is weird), and I do love them and I'm thankful for them and all that, but now I'm kind of getting tired of being kind all the time. They always ask me for advice, and while I love helping people solve their problems (one of my friendships a few years ago was based on solely this, and I didn't mind) it's getting draining. We never really talk about other things to lighten the mood either. I hate to say it, but I guess I started to feel like their emotional dump yard? Not really sure if it make sense, or if I had the correct word choice for that, but yeah. 

I know you should act without wanting something in return, but for some reason I'm starting to feel like they just don't reciprocate/feel the same way towards our friendship. For some reason, I want them to, even though I know they shouldn't have to. It's uncommon for them to ask if there's anything up with me, though admittedly, I'm at a fault for that too - my emotions are messy and complicated, I barely understand them myself, and a lot of them seem so petty, so unless they're clear to me &amp; it's clear what I'm asking from the person when I tell them about it, I never really speak of things that greatly affect me emotionally.

Rare time one of them asked how I was doing, she just gave me emotional support and I guess that never really worked for me - I'd rather find practical solutions to me not feeling like shit; emotional support never really does much. 

But yeah, how do I fix this? Also, does feeling like this make me a bad person? I've been feeling pretty guilty about it. I know what it feels like for someone to make me feel like a burden for bothering them with my problems, and I never wanna give that same vibe to anyone when they ask me for advice. 

Also, another note: man, not really sure if my shitty mental health has anything to do with it (I get stuck in bad places sometimes, I'm seeing a therapist soon though, so it's fine), but I've reached the point where I deactivated a bunch of my personal social media accounts.

113,"First off, my boyfriend and I live together. We allowed a friend (lets call him George) to come stay on our couch for a couple of days while he was visiting from an hour away. I started noticing very weird things such as, waking up to find that I'm missing a $100 from my wallet and the creepiest part about this is I had slept with my wallet in my room.  I noticed our weed going missing as well, we also couldn't find our smoking bowl or our driver's licenses. 
Within the time that he was visiting, my sister came over one Sunday afternoon to have a picnic. She left her bluetooth speaker in my house by accident. 
The next day, it was gone. 
Another thing, I like to make cakes a lot and I actually have a whip it canister to make whipped cream. I had a 50 pack in our pantry ($25 worth) and while our friend was visiting they all went missing. There were more items but I won't bore you with those details.
We planned to confront him and have him apologize/give back our belongings. 
He claimed that he didn't take any of it. So my boyfriend got angry and went into the guest room, pulled out the friend's suitcase and opened it up. In there, was almost everything that had gone missing. The only thing not found was the money. So I ran to his car outside with a brick and held it up to the windshield and said, ""open the car"". He did and I didn't find my cash so I asked him to hand it over. He said that he used the $100 to fill his gas tank.
He then ran into our apartment and grabbed everything and drove away in his car as we were calling the police on him.
I'm completely shocked that he would steal from us when we so graciously opened our doors to him. 
After calling the cops, they looked for him but he had driven off. I found out that night via a screenshot from a conversation he was having with his girlfriend that he had driven into another state and was hiding out in a ""buggout house""... I told his girlfriend what had happened to us and she opened up to me saying ""he's been stealing cash from me and my roommate for months, I just never wanted to believe it"". He also lied about his location, turns out she had no idea he was visiting us and that he had been telling her for days that he was in his hometown taking care of his sick mother. She completely sided with us and apologized for everything that he had put us through. 
The next day I contacted her to see if she would file a police report. But by then, she had completely changed her mind and called me screaming to tell me that George didn't steal and that my boyfriend was actually the one who stole/was using George as a scapegoat. Guess she's decided to go the oblivious route. She's a weak person and I feel very sorry for her stupidity. 
So, three of us have decided to file police reports for our stuff anyways.
I'm asking for any and all advice you have for me to speed up the process of justice for us. I'm not sure that we have a case without his girlfriend also filing a police report. I'm hoping that us three is enough but I am not so sure.

117,"I am a 3rd year graduate student who is currently doing an internship. I spent some time in industry over the years, and in my past jobs you always knew that IT kept some data on your behavior on the computer, and could probably get pretty detailed if they cared, but since they dealt with such a large population of people, you could, say, check your gmail and not feel like you had to be super careful about what you wrote in an email to your girlfriend or w/e.


And during my time as a graduate student, while I would work I would have gmail open and chat with my girlfriend or friends on gchat and didn't think anything of it.


Perhaps I'm naive and have gotten the wrong idea about how under the radar I am at work, but i'm convinced the level of surveillance at my internship is significantly higher and it has gotten me into trouble.


Graduate school has also taken a toll on my mental health, and I find myself in a dark place sometimes with racing (and not 100% rational thoughts). I never act out on them or talk to anyone about them except with my girlfriend if I'm particularly upset.


During work I was feeling as though other interns were getting special treatment and I was disappointed with my project and I was in a particularly dark mood, and was venting about it to my girlfriend on gchat. It wasn't angry or anything, but if I knew other people were reading I would have put things more diplomatically. After that my coworkers' demeanor towards me changed. People stopped saying hi to me, my boss stopped checking in and instead only meets during our regular meetings. Some just stare at me in the hall instead of saying anything. It took me a while to put it all together, but when i think about other comments my boss has made at odd times it finally clicked.


First: am I justified in feeling upset about this? I felt like the conversation between my girlfriend and I would be at most seen by IT, not by my boss (and his boss as well). Additionally, I feel like even if they did read them, if there is something that needs to be addressed it should be with me in private, not with that information disseminated to everyone without my knowledge.


Second: What do I do now? I took off yesterday because I was too mortified to go into work. I'm taking the rest of the week off as well, but I have another 5 weeks in my internship. Should I stick it out? Should I leave early? What?",26Jul2017,3

Here's the catch, he is Caucasian and I'm Indian. I'm sure my parents wouldn't mind that I had a boyfriend, but at the same time, I know that introducing them to someone (unless they are 100% marriage material) could potentially cause a lot of stress and tension. My parents, whilst open minded and accepting, have recently expressed concern at the whole ""casual dating"" concept, and while this is not that - without promise for marriage or long-long-term commitment  (which we both aren't thinking of at this stage!!) finding out about this could be upsetting. In the family, I'm more of the level-headed child, big on being rational etc. and this could possibly come as a surprise (but also not). I don't want to tell my parents that we have been dating for so long, as it is bound to hurt their feelings that I kept it from them, however, the reason we decided not to tell them sooner, was purely to see if this was a proper relationship (aka - not breaking huge news to them for no reason - risk:benefit ratio). I've always felt guilty about not telling them, and lately certain circumstances have made me a little uncomfortable and sad that they are missing out on a part of my life, and not meeting someone special to me, but I'm not sure on the best way to go about this.

Anyways, this problem started around maybe March of last year, i'm really not too sure anymore. I felt disgusted with myself almost every time I ate, especially if other people saw me eating or if the food wasn't very healthy. I kept track of what I ate. I would feel nauseous or feel like throwing up after eating, so I avoided food in general. I would try to skip breakfast or if my mom told me to eat I would just have some bread or something else like that. I wouldn't eat anything again until around 8pm when my family has dinner. I'd try to take as little food as I could during dinner or I'd try to avoid eating dinner altogether. I ended up fainting at school a few times. 

It got a bit worse during this school year. I can't even look at most foods without feeling nauseous, or even other people eating. I stopped eating to the point I ended up giving myself a few illnesses that I probably shouldn't name here since I would identify myself. I felt horribly dizzy all the time and I honestly just felt like a ghost at school sometimes since I didn't have the energy to move around very much. I can't stand looking at myself sometimes because I look disgusting.

I am aware that I have a problem, I just don't know what it is or how to get help before it gets worse.

133,"(Skipping a lot of information):
I am a student and since last year I have probably applied to about 200+ jobs since then. Had about 4 interviews for retail positions. I am absolutely trying my best here. I make money on the side and pay for all my things. I don't 'need' a job just yet but I've been looking anyways. So...I've been hunting for work up to 30 hours a week, as that's the maximum I can do before it interrupts with college/study. My work coach sent me to a place of work as they had vacancies. She either lied to me or misinformed me and told me they offer part-time positions to get me to go. I found out later that the MINIMUM hours of work are 48 hours. So I politely tell her that I'm sorry I wasted her time but the position just isn't right for me (it's over an hour drive too, so the hours would be closer to 60 a week- double than what I'm looking for!). The hours mean I'd have to wake at 4:30AM and I've had trouble sleeping/waking for the past few years yet she'd still tell me I'm being unreasonable. I know others work those hours, but we both agreed previously to stick to day-shifts. She then barks at me how I always make excuses. For some reason, I turn into a bitch and can't tell her that if she would have been straight with me then no time would have been wasted. Let me give you some examples: We communicate mostly via email and face-to-face. One day she told me. She. Told. Me her office closed at 5PM. She booked me in for an appointment at 5:30PM a few months later. So I emailed her just to ask if the times were right and get a reply akin to ""No. Don't ever assume that. That is ridiculous, we are open until x. If you are trying to cancel an appointment, you phone up. I'm not going to help you if you can't even bother to show here."" 

Another time, she called me lazy and unwilling (straight after completing a 2 month unpaid placement).

I live next to old neighbors. I have a loud motorbike that, if I use to commute at 4AM, it would startle everyone around me. So I don't use it. She tells me ""Why don't you move out?"" (idiotic response, I have no job woman- no s.t.a.b.i.l.i.t.y). 

She doesn't take my restrictions into account. I can't work there if I can't get there. 

Sometimes, I am speechless as to proceed. As repeated I don't need a job and I feel I take crap like this all too often from her.

Luckily, I may have landed a job in the next few weeks and can tally-ho out of there. She'll probably tell me ""Few weeks? What about now!?""

Look, there are more convincing examples but I'm just too annoyed now. This post had no meaning at all.


So I ask for advice on this, as it's what led me to come here:

How do I 'call-out' someone politely? I knew she told me x and x, yet when she made it out as if it was me who got it wrong when I knew it was her, I run inside my shell.

I could have said ""Ah okay, it's just that you told me x time so I assumed x, because that's what you told me.""

Instead, I say

(Exaggeration) ""Oh my bad! I'm sorry, I made a mistake"" and always take responsibility for minor (anecdotally and generally) mishaps that weren't the making of me.


With people, I sometimes feel that in order to maintain relations I will wash over who is responsible and take part of the blame, even though I know out-rightly that it had nothing to do with me. Me taking the blame manifests as apathy and passiveness. I don't actively say ""it was me"", but I usually just let the blame wash through me without fighting it.",26Jul2017,3

I have a girlfriend and she has also just graduated, she graduated studying fashion design and has already got a job in London, about to move to an apartment in London, has already interned for major fashion brands and has won the awards in her field allowing her to also travel around the world. 

She has so many options of where to go in life with every major company hoping to employ her. However, I've finished university and have no idea what to do with myself. There is no major companies that are looking for photographers and I have no path of where I go with my life. I've only come to realise the lack of pay and work Photographer receive. 

I feel like if only I had chosen to do economics or something like that I would be able to work for firms etc and have a good life and enjoy getting paid well. I feel like I've wasted my time in a degree that'll only take me to worrying about finances and potentially unemployment.

146,"So, me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 months now. But we've known eachother for quite a while before that. All's fine and dandy except how much alone time we get. And she likes her friends very much. See, she hangs out with her friends every night. And I'm always invited. But I HATE groups. I tried going for a while, and I hated every single second of it. I just can't do it anymore.

And we get some alone time. And we both love it. But whenever it happens there's usually a big fight with her friends. Because they think she's abandoning them. And those friends of hers keep hurting her whenever we go out alone. Her best friend threatened to air all of her dirty laundry if she goes out with me again alone.

So... I haven't seen her in 10 days... and my grandpa died 5 days ago... And I'm just so lost",26Jul2017,1

167,"To preface all of this, I am currently seeing a professional about this.  I know it's a continuing issue and I am seeking help for it, but it is something that bothers me each day and I am always seeking help and additional opinions about it.

For around a year now, I've been suffering through a lot of anxiety when it comes to social interaction.  One issue is that I'm a combination of both an introverted and extroverted person.  When I'm in a situation in which I feel unfamiliar, I am extremely introverted and extremely quiet.  When I'm in a comfortable environment or with close friends, I am extremely extroverted and open about anything.  This causes me to be extremely close to a close circle of friends, and makes it really difficult to be able to reach out or connect with anyone else.

That closeness with that close knit circle has caused issues in the past months.  I've had anxiety attacks that force completely illogical thoughts into my head, making me thing that my close circle will abandon me or forget about me.  As part of a self-destructive chain reaction, I'll find that I keep reaching out to them on social media and such just wanted to talk, which may make them tire of me, or perhaps I'm imagining that, I don't know.

That struggle with whether or not it's appropriate to talk to my friends and not knowing the level to which I may be becoming annoying them is causing even more anxiety.  I feel so isolated and lonesome so much of the time and I am just dying for someone to talk to, but I am afraid that I might become a burden to my friends.  Meanwhile, it's nearly impossible for me to make any real connection with anyone else.

I really don't know what to do about this.  It's a cycle that's causing me a lot of anxiety and makes it hard to focus on much of anything.  What can I do?",26Jul2017,1

171,"I am a 27 years old mechanical engineer, I have been working in a job that I hate to the degree of depression for 3.5 years. I had a very rough beginning after graduation, I had two very unstable jobs with extremely low salaries, until I got hired by my current employer. Although, my title is an Engineer, but my job isn't quite related to my area of study or interests, I don't see myself working as an engineer, I have no passion for this job at all and it does NOT add to my experience as mechanical engineer. So why did I stay that long? My current employer is a very prestigious company in my country (Egypt) , the job is very stable comparing to my previous horrible jobs, the salary is VERY good, I get to travel and see the world, I get to stay with my family and finally, I get to have many free times (which I used to get a master of science degree and published a research paper). So, to summarize, I don't know if staying in this job is the right decision or not, I am scared of getting old and my engineering skills and knowledge get rusty, I am also scared that if I leave I will be in an unstable job again and lose all this. I am constantly depressed, I miss working on design and simulations, I miss being an engineer. My questions: 1) Am I too old for a career change? 2) Did I make a bad choice in staying that long?

180,"I'm looking for any input for my current situation honestly. Sorry but this may be long.

I am currently 24 and I've got a girlfriend who I've been with for 9 years. For careers I'm generally indifferent with what I get honestly, if necessary I could apply myself and I'm pretty sure I could get a degree in what any field. 

My original plan was to have a stable career in a somewhat respectable field, the police department. My city has a long process for hire so I applied about 3 years ago clearing every part of the processing except the psychological review. When I was younger I had two problems, I was generally a bad kid in almost every aspect. I would stole some stuff, anger problems, trouble in school and the list goes on. The second problem was I have/had ADD. This legally gave me access to resource rooms, extended testing on test and Ritalin. While I was prescribed Ritalin I did not take it regularly as it was to keep me paying attention in class. The psych review I was placed on notes I did not use extended testing, or resource rooms and during the senior year of high school I was no longer taking Ritalin. During all of my schooling I had good grades and was placed in advanced classes, basically a grade ahead of what I was in. These grades were obtained while I was taking and not taking medication. When I hit college I stopped caring and generally either had good grades (A's or B's) when the professor didn't care about attendance, or I would withdraw from the classes when I knew I would fail due to attendance. The person who reviewed my psych felt I had a shoddy college record due to my lack of medication and he felt that I wouldn't be able to commit.

Now that you have a background my situation is as follows, I can try to contest my psych review with a lawyer and private psychologist which would cost about $5000-10000. This would take months possibly over a year and it's not a 100% chance of getting a job. Besides my psych review I have a totally clean record of never getting in trouble legally not even a single parking ticket. My school and job records are clean as well, always on time and generally a good worker. A private psychologist would have to say that my past records are not a reflection of who I currently am since the records they based this off of were almost 10 years old at this point.

My second option is to start fresh and pursue another career. My previous credits were basically all useless for any real job since they focused on art which was a hobby and I have no intention in obtaining a job in that field. My girlfriend is currently a nurse so she would love if I entered the medical field. I am confident I would be able to obtain a job doing something like that but it would take a while and I'm sure she would love to get married soon. She understands my situation and is being patient but I know she doesn't want to wait. 

So now that that's all been said which would you recommend? Take the risk and continue trying to get into the police department or start fresh and pursue another career? Like I said I generally don't mind what job I end up, I just want to be able to support a family comfortably without worry so now that I've matured I'm thinking long term. ",26Jul2017,1

186,"I know that the obvious answer is to keep loving life while I'm young and not worry about this, but some days I just get even terrified.

Never being able to run, jump, wear nice clothes, go on roller coasters, feel like an attractive human being, the fear of taking all these medications, loved ones around me dying, no one seeing me as a person anymore. 

It just all makes me scared and depressed. I love my body, and I wish I could always be in it. Getting old to me just sounds so boring. And I wonder if I'll ever feel the thrill in life or have adventures. I want to always feel good about myself appearance wise and just always have the bustling energy I do. 

Again, I know it's as simple as ""just worry about it later, you're young so enjoy it"" but sometimes it just really eats at me. I love myself and I never take my youth for granted.

This is an issues I've dealt with my whole life and now that I've got a job requiring me to work 60+ hours a week, I don't really have time for a boyfriend, or even friends really, not that I had much of a social life before I began working so much.

ATM my mother has put me out of the house yet again, this time mad because I said I'd already paid for a 6.00 movie that I rented off of the television. (I've been giving her $100 a week) The fact that I said it so badly it required her to put her fingers in my face, threaten to punch me, and while I was sitting there crying because of how she treats me I just told her the truth and said ""I hate you"" because she always goes off the deep end over something so petty.

She got madder, took my house key again, and threw my cup on the floor while telling me if I didn't like it to leave. This is the same woman who made me be home by midnight (I'm 23) or she would lock me out via the screen door.

My grandfather told me it was my fault and I should have just apologized and said I'd pay for the movie. At 23, I have no kids, no boyfriend, a college degree, it just feels like she has to look for reasons to be mad and put me down still despite being the rare 'good girl' and having listened to her all these years.

I never wanted to end up like my cousins who all have babies and struggle daily to feed them, its why I went to school, kept to myself, and tried not to let worthless men end up doing to me what they did to them.

Apparently that doesn't matter however. I have issues now focusing on work because part of my job involves calling people who end up being rude and hurtful, saying hang on a second and then hanging up the phone or not trusting me to do what my job description says. I try not to take it personally but its hard when my whole life people have manipulated me and told me I was wrong to do or say something.

I need help, but I don't have time for therapy anymore. I see people able to be rude and laugh at the ones they fucked over (i.e. me) and they seem so happy and joyful in their lives, while me who's tried to do the right thing, tried to honestly care about other people, and tried to meet guys and be positive and think only the best gets screwed over time and again.

197," *Binge Drinking...



dont know if i would be considered an alcoholic by definition, but alcohol turns me into someone i never knew i could be, in the worst way possible.
a little background: i have been suffering from heavy anxiety and depression fro as long as I can remember. I am 31 now. In my early 20s I had to drink to maintain not getting the dts, this lasted until about 27 when I just slowed down, I did 11 months sober, felt I could handle drinking again and since then I have about 6 times, every time a disaster. Every time I hurt relationships with my family and friends.
Current day:
Last friday I go out of town to visit my best friend in high school, we proceed to get wasted and meet up with my family and some other people. I dont remember what happens after the bar (which was about 8m) but I guess i feel like playing choose my own adventure and tell my friend I am going to the bathroom and leave and go on a walk down the feeder road talking to random people going to a bar i used to go to and somehow keep drinking. I only remember sploches of my friend and my dad calling me and all I could tell them when they ask me where I am is that I am right here but not where right here is. So they call my mom who is 3 hours away where I live and get involved, thus getting my boyrfiend involved, i get found i get emotional, i cuss out my dads girlfriend. i wake up feeling shameful on saturday. This time I do not feel like the shame is going away. I have a lot of things I blame myself for on a daily basis andsober I cannot deal with my thoughts, I take zoloft and trazadone and sometimes anxiety medicine but nothing can make me forget my pain like alcohol, but after thats over I feel like a worse person then ever.
Right now I feel so shitty. Im trying to repair relationships, I am ashamed and never want to visit my family and freinds again.
I again feel more undeserving of love from my partner. I feel like I am a terrible person and I scare myself and I cannot get over the shame this time. I have made an appointment with a psycologist and apologized to everyone I saw that night every day since then but I dont feel like its enough.

199,"So I've been thinking about writing this for a while now. Finally plucked up the courage to do it as I honestly don't know where else to turn and Reddit has always been good to me... Throwaway because some friends know my account... This may be a little long but here it goes...

Not really sure where to start but I'll give some background for perspective. I've always had a shitty relationship with my parents, always. Finished school, moved out at 18 and done my own thing working shitty jobs, living in rented rooms that kind of gig. Fast forward to being 21, repaired things with my parents somewhat, we speak, I'm allowed over for dinner, to see my brothers, that kind of thing. I'd been trying to get my life on track as I knew these warehouse/retail/cleaning jobs weren't sufficient for the rest of my life so I apply to college as a mature student. I get in! Whoo! My parents tell me I can move back in as long as I go to college and do well, they're happy for me, everything's looking up for the first time in *years*. 

I begin getting my stuff together, telling my roommates I'd be moving out once my parents get back from their 3 week holiday at the end of the summer. Except things didn't work out like that.. My mother and my brothers came home....alone. It's a long story but basically my dad had been dealing with depression all his life, and during those 3 weeks away it got the better of him and he took his own life. I wont dwell on this as it's not exactly what I'm looking for advice with but it's important to the story.

Shits really rough, my family get along as best we can. I start college in September trying to act as if I can manage and it's no big deal. I fuck it up. I fail. I drop out. Back to working shitty cleaning jobs/warehouse work. Things don't work out at home, my mam kicks me out. Months go by, I try college again applying for a different degree I feel I'm interested in. Long story short, I don't have the money to go every day, mam doesn't have the money to give me and I cant get another job in the city. So guess what? I fail...again.

Fast forward to present day. After I'd failed the 2nd time I get another job on a building site. That's fine for a while until the work dries up and I get laid off. Not enough work for an unskilled laborer. I genuinely feel college is my only option so I speak with my mam. She tells me I can move back in providing I either hold down a job or stay in college. I apply for a large university in my area and I get in! Yup you guessed it, my laziness, video games and weed fucked it and I fail again. 

Present day, I'm sitting on my bed typing this and I honestly don't know what the fuck to do with myself. My friends and family don't know yet. I'm so embarrassed as they all thought I was doing so well this time. I've fucked college up 3 times, I haven't had a job in ages, I'm damn near unemployable at this stage. I just don't know what the fuck to do. I was a pretty heavy weed smoker for a good few year until recently (stopped last month) and it's helped somewhat but I just wake up every day defeated. My two younger brothers are supposed to look up to me for inspiration since my dad is gone and I'm just this fucking shell walking around the house rising at mid day lost. 

TL;DR: I've progressively fucked up my life over the years to the point I fear it's irreparable. Can't get a job, cant go back to college. As melodramatic as it sounds death seems like a pleasant option at this stage. Any advice? Please?",26Jul2017,3

201,"So... I started talking to this boy a few weeks ago. I met him through my step brother &amp; the boy was the one who said we should start talking.(he is 14 &amp; so am I) , but the conversations were going ok. The first thing is when I asked him what he liked to do besides play basketball he said he didn't know, but what teenager doesn't hang out with friends and stuff. Anyway when i FaceTime him he also doesn't really say much and we just kinda sit in silence.. or sometimes we'll text then I'll respond to one of his messages and then he'll read it hours later and not respond. Take last night for instance, my brothers were over and we were in my room and I facetimed him.. before my brothers came up we were having somewhat of a conversation, the typical ""what'd you do today"", ""how was your day"" , etc. but once they came up and I got into a conversation with them he just stopped talking. Then when I tried to talk to him he just sat in silence and didn't say anything back. And then all of a sudden he just hung up on me, after that I text him and he read it hours later and didn't respond. (He's a Pisces I'm a Aquarius... just adding that in) but anyways he's been watching my Snapchat story and everything but he hasn't text me back or text me period.

My fiancé and I have been together for two years. We have a baby together and he has filled the daddy role in my 5 years olds life. Both of us have been through relationship hell whether it be through our own doing or otherwise. Got together and all was well. A few months ago I found a girl trying to talk to him from his work. Turns out it was a girlfriend from a long time past. It was annoying but didn't become and issue til I spoke with her on the phone and I told her who I was and she hung up. Yea that's not okay. He and I talked and I thought it was worked out. About a month ago I go with my girls to visit my mom for a week. It's about 4 hours from where we live. He calls one night just blathering about being a shitty person and he is going to kill himself blah blah. So I leave early to go home to console him. I thought it was because he doesn't have the best job here and we are struggling. 

Fast forward to this week. I bring up this girl to his family when he isn't around. They start acting strange. I pry the story out of my brother in laws girlfriend. This same female came over while I  was gone. I'm pissed obviously so I go to him and we discuss it. He swears she just hang out and whatever. I'm still mad so I press the girlfriend for more information. Turns out....She spent the night in my house. Oh and she did meth at my house. I don't know what they did in the house but I highly doubt they were playing scrabble.  So I'm sitting here waiting for him to get home from work. Trying to figure out how to discuss this. I just want the truth. 

Any advice on how to approach this without him shutting down is much appreciated. ",26Jul2017,1
208,"Hey all! I'm kind of in a weird predicament at the moment and I figured I'd ask you all for some advice since googling has gotten me nowhere.
Today, a college friend reached out to me and wants to reconnect. We had a few classes together and both attended a Catholic College Ministry at our university where we had grown close. I transferred to a different school after my second year because I wanted to be closer to home. As convenient friendships go, we tried to stay in touch but it was mostly in vain. Long story short: today she sent me a long message wanting to reconnect and catch up. I truly valued her friendship at that time in my life, and am welcome to reconnecting with someone who genuinely only ever brought goodness into my life. That being said, I have since left the Church and consider myself an agnostic. There's a long back story to this change, but let's just leave it at ""this is not a phase"". Maybe I'm just having anxiety for no reason, but I'm almost positive she's going to try to talk to me about my faith and coming back if it comes up. I'm not militantly against religion, and I feel that anyone has a right to feel however they want about God, gods, Oprah, whatever, without my judgement. However, I've never dealt gracefully with judgment from others when it comes to this topic, and I tend to respond with unease and usually distance myself from people who think they know what I need. (Because of this unease, I have grown extremely distant from my family and many childhood friends that are still in the Catholic community) Ultimately, my question is two-fold: should I respond back that I'd love to reconnect; and if I do, how should I handle the faith/coming back conversation if it comes up?
Any suggestions/personal stories are welcome. Please don't use this is a venue to trash the Catholic Church, because that's not why I'm here--I've made my peace with that portion.
Thanks!",26Jul2017,3
209,"I'm socially awkward.

That has pretty much been the cataclyst of most of my pain and lonelyness for so many years now (yes im that overdramatic teen).

I'm not however the ""qiuet"" type associated with social awkwardness (not trying to stereotype) i tired to talk about this somewhere else but none knew what i meant so ill try examples.

 i want to do things I want to do stupid and dangerous shit like the people in the avarge fail video, or brainiac or thoose people who decide to play a musical number in puplic, or thoose drunk idiots that cut the head of a statue and returned itwith a sorry note, or building a raft out of junk and sailing over a lake.


Now this is of course not my entire personality but something I feel like I cant explore and a very real part of me thats always been there and always been regonized by the people around me (so not a case of me wanting to do what the ""cool kids"" do) . Because of social awkwarkdness I can only ever make friends with the ""nerds"" or the introverts and all that and while i do have my simmilarities to them because they /thinks its too risky or just dont care about it THEY NEVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING and it slowly drives me insane.

I know some people would go ""just be the person you want to be"" but certain things are just wastly different alone, the person who hangs out at a festival with friends trying cool shit with everyone and the person who went alone and tries to showe themselves into strangers situtations/drinks and signs alone are two completly different people.

ive just come from some video of a study on happiness that said social relations were the most important thing for us in life happiness wise and I honestly feel like social awkwardness has been the major wall in my life.


I know this sounds cliche and overdramtic, especially comming from a late teenager, but I honestly feel like a flightless fucking bird, not ^^just for the potential parts but from what it must feel like to be so despertaly and instictivly for something but having some handicap preventing it. this is not who I am, but theres something out my my control preventing me from being it.

Now today she added me on snapchat and told me sorry I added you but I lost your number because my phone reset. We just exchanged numbers a week ago.

215,"Hey guys

A few months ago I left a very toxic company after working for them for over a year, which is probably the best decision I had ever made in a long time. 

That place exacerbated by depression and I was going home everyday either angry, depressed or just too exhausted to function. My ex-boss was a real sociopath who constantly liked to gaslight me, mock me, micromanage the most stupid things and even threatened to withhold my salary when he was reviewing my code. But it wasn't just him. That place was riddled with manipulation, nepotism and victimization from all of the senior staff towards people who aren't friends of theirs. It's gotten so bad recently (from what I hear) that two more people have resigned and another two are currenly looking for new work. I heard via the grapevine that they hired some psychologist to analyse the company and the feedback was scathing and the guy said that management was completely useless.

At the moment I do have a new job and they treat me very well. Going in I was expecting hostility but I received very little of it. Most of my senior colleagues are very patient and always willing to help me with whatever I'm struggling with. They even consider my thoughts and opinions, which is something that didn't happen at all in the previous place.

However, for some reason, I have trouble letting go of my previous experience. I wake up angry every morning and during the train ride to work I imagine scenarios in my head on what I would say to my ex-boss or the idiot of a HR manager (who actually is a software developer but for some reason they gave him HR responsibilities as well). Even though I am in a better place I can't seem to let it go. It's this viscious cycle where I make myself angry and I constantly seek information to validate my anger.

My therapist suggests that the reason for this is because I still keep in contact with some ex-colleagues who I became friends with. I see how they're still treated and I get furious. But the thing is I insist on hearing these issues. I want to know. I want to validate my anger.

Has anyone ever experienced something like this before? How would you guys suggest I learn to let this go?",26Jul2017,3
216,"I (25f) still live with my parents and I do work full time and I enjoy the work, however I have no real desire to move up in my job (despite the pay raise). I do want to but I don't WANT it want it. Like it would be nice and I'd like it as well but it's just so hard to CARE. 

I also want to be a physical therapy assistant (a much fancier and higher paying field than retail). But I don't want to go through all the pointless school work and tests and the horrible amount of debt I'd have to get into... Ugh... Just doesn't seem worth it. 

If I could have it my way, I'd just take my time moving up in the company and live with my parents until I inherent the house (they are in their 60s and 70s, I was adopted and they like having me live with them I talked to them directly about it so no issue there). 

But, just because I'm ok with it doesn't mean everyone else is. Even though I'd have friends, they think I'm a loser and are glad they're not me. Forget about ever finding a date, nobody (for me guy or girl) who's worth anything would want to be with what society deems is a ""loser"" like me. 

Still, none of these facts are very motivating. I don't know why I turned out to be such an unmotivated person or why nothing (except non job things like travel and festivals and concerts and shit) sounds fun or exciting or worth it.

217,"Ok I can't just change majors as that's not how it works in Ireland.

I don't know what I want, this has plagued my life for the past year.

I started college, realised I do not enjoy my course, I subsequently have 3 exams to repeat because I did not do my continuous assessment. 

There are no other courses that interest me, including the one I am in, none. 
I do have ambitions, dreams all of that..
I want to be self employed, I want to make a lot of money.
I enjoy music, songwriting, mens fashion, design among other things.

There are a lot of things I would like to do, design and create jewellery, start a band, start a youtube channel/blog, start a company..

I have no interest in my business degree, I enjoy one area, Business Information Systems. I like it because it can not be rote learnt, it's got the highest failure rate but that is the area I enjoy because its essentially a study on the systems in place that make some businesses hugely successful and some failures. Competitive advantage.
I try to learn so I can use, not just to get a degree but something that will be useful later in life.
I can not just transfer to a straight bis course, you need to do other aspects of business.

I do intend on specialising in my final (3rd) year (if I continue with it), but I need to pass my repeats, and do exceptionally well in 2nd year, how am I going to do well when I have so little interest?

I spent my first year drunk, going out meeting girls. 
I had a very different few of college before I started.

I don't know if I do want to go back. 
I don't know what to do, I don't particularly want go back but I don't want to be 20 years old sitting at home listening to my nagging parents about how I amounted to nothing, wasting time, wasting money, wasting talent, while my friends who did worse than I did on exams get on and succeed.
Even at that I don't really have any friends, I have not met anyone from college since it finished up (and Irelands a small place) I have grown a part from my friends at home, we're just so different now..

I keep trying to convince myself that I'm just being lazy and that I can do it, but that has not worked so far.

I know damn well I sound like I am just whining, in part I am but I'm also looking for advice, what do I do?

I could not wait to get out of school and have some control over my  life but now I hate it.. I don't want to get out of bed and face the world.
I almost feel like I'm not actually living my life that it's just going on without me and that I'm falling behind, that I went the wrong way at some point despite doing everything I was told 'get good results, get into a good college'.. 
I feel like I am just wasting my parents money.

I actually went to college more for the social aspect, find someone willing to start something, a business, a band, anything but all I found was an extension to school were everyone just wants to drink and go out.

I am as lost as I have ever been and as I hope I ever will be.

Any advice?",26Jul2017,1
218,"So, a little over 2 months ago, I broke up with my first girlfriend of about a year. I'm 24, she is 26. The reason for the breakup was that, due to extenuating life circumstances, she had to move to the other side of the country, **indefinitely**. Due to reasons that are beyond the scope of this thread, I felt that it would not be wise for me to move with her, and that it would be best for me to stay in my current area. She agreed.

Moving day was a very hard day for both of us, and driving her to the airport for the final goodbye was one of the most painful things I have ever had to do.  

That was over 2 months ago, and we still talk on the phone almost every day. Life is much different for her now than it was before she moved. Even if I did move out to her, the relationship could never be like it was. Furthermore, I don't know if the relationship would survive if I did move.


The relationship had its challenges like every one does, but we made a pretty good couple and handled them OK. All in all it was a pretty happy relationship the whole way through. We both still love each other very much even though we are only friends now. 

Even though its been a full 2 months, sometimes I think about her without getting sad and I think I am getting over her; while Other times when I think about her I get extremely sad and might even cry for awhile, because I get hit with a very intense wave of sadness and longing to be with her again. Right now it seems like its going to be a very long time before I am over her and ready for someone else. I don't know know if I will ever get truly *100%* over her; she had a big impact on my life. And honestly, I don't know if I ever want to be 100% over her to begin with. I still care about her deeply.

223,"Hi Reddit,

I'm a 23 year old male organic chemistry grad student, and September will mark 2 years in my M.Sc. program. I am diagnosed gifted and I graduated at the top of my class, finishing with over 100% in a fair bit of my organic class (from average shifting and bonus questions on exams) and graduated with numerous awards, including being the top gpa in the program. This was done without too much sustained effort; I was able to cram most things and still do well, as well as figure things out on the exam if I didn't remember them completely. 

Unfortunately grad school research is 100% about sustained effort, and while the classes I've done have been A or A+, my research project has been significantly slow moving due to me barely running reactions. I often know what I need to do and am unable to force myself to do it.

I grew more and more depressed as I continued through and eventually reached a breaking point where I took 4 months off starting this January. During this point I worked at a restaurant I used to work at and felt much more engaged in work. I made much more money and was able to pay off my debt and able to buy a motorcycle which I was very keen on. 

Now that I've been back since May, things started pretty well, but have deteriorated. My boss is in Australia, and it's been 8 work days since I've even gone into the lab, let alone be productive there. I don't even think about completing my project as some sort of accomplishment I'd care about. 

My parents (and me for the most part) have been pretty convinced I'm ADHD. I was very energetic as a child (my uncle called me the human pinball), impossible to get to do things, and my dad has been diagnosed. I always think of ADHD as something that you can easily convince yourself you are, and so I have some serious self doubts if I'm just being a hypochondriac and trying to find excuses for self perceived failures. 

I don't know what to do right now, I feel very unengaged in life, I only play video games and I can't seem to ever organize anything. My apt is a mess and I often order junk food. I can never make myself go to bed, and even less so get out of bed. I feel like I have no control over my life and I simply act purely on impulse and immediate pleasures. I binge drink and blackout and regret it but it doesn't stop it from happening again.

I'm not sure what I should do at this point, should I give up on school? Should I try to power through, because how could I know if any other career is going to be different for me. Work is work and it's not always fun, but you need to push through because you need to make money, pay your bills, etc. I understand that and I'd love to subscribe to the philosophy of the satisfaction of a job well done, but I can't seem to actually do that.

238,"I work for a company that occasionally does improvement projects. They have a model they follow, but none of them have an analytical background except for me. Whenever they do these projects, they rarely consult me until it is time to analyze their data. At this point, their data is usually useless, biased, or sometimes even downright incorrect. I struggle to analyze the data and then interpret it in a correct way because they didn't collect or obtain their data in a way that would support what they are wanting to know. I don't know how to explain to my supervisor and managers that designing a project with any statistical validity begins at the beginning before data is ever collected. I don't want to come across as rude or like I know everything and they know nothing. They all are very intelligent, and I am not an expert in my field, but sometimes I feel like I am a resource that they do not utilize to the best of their abilities. I am struggling with this particularly because they present their ""findings"" at national conferences. One example is the most recent project in which they utilized surveys to get a before and after response to an intervention they implemented. Their project started based on a ""gut feeling"" and then verbally asked both parties if they felt there was an issue. The answers leaned toward yes. So they gave surveys that were designed by someone who has never been trained in designing surveys before. Since this was an anonymous survey, they didn't keep track of who took the initial survey. Some intervention was implemented and two months later they gave the same survey out again, not taking into account if someone had previously taken it or not. The assumption was that most had taken it previously, but there may be some new responses. This matters! For this to be a statistically valid study, they needed to keep track of who took it and who took it again. You cannot analyze a pre-post survey if someone took the post who didn't take the pre or if someone took the pre, but didn't take the post. You actually can but only if you know who was who. Because their true initial survey was verbal, there is nothing to support their ""gut feeling."" I also found out that they actually began implementing their intervention prior to and during the time they gave out the initial surveys. Lo and behold, there was no difference between the pre and post. I, as a statistician, can't even call this a true pre-post or say that any of their results were valid. Yet, this is going to be presented nationally. They don't teach you in college how to change the methods and attitudes of an entire organization. Does anyone have any advice?

When I asked about cancellation fees, he told me I was going to have to pay a $15 fee + $20/month for each month left in the contract. That's another 15 months left. I'm not completely leaving the company, and I've been with them for a long time so I'm pretty irritated. Are there any tips or tricks I should know to get around this?

They're a pretty small company (&lt;100 people), but I figured I'd want to try to find employment with them. The first time I called, I asked for the hiring manager and was told he was in a meeting. So I called a few days after, and then a week after that, and a week after that. All these times the hiring manager wasn't available, so I've left my phone number and emailed the sales department. Haven't received a call back. Am I being ignored or could I have called at inconvenient times? Should I go to their store and ask for the hiring manager directly? I'm at a loss.

Usually I'm not so persistent at job hunting but this is really a company I'd love to work for.

253,"So, here's the deal. I'm one of those people who lost their v-card pretty late. I was 20, and it was a huge mistake. I just kind of did it because I was scared that if I didn't, it would never happen. Shortly after, I stopped talking to that other dude and I started dating my bf, who I've been with for almost a year. I love this man so much. It's my first relationship, and he is a lot more experienced than me, which obviously makes me feel self-conscious, but he's never said I was bad or anything.

The problem is that we're now in a LDR and I can't shake the feeling of not being experienced enough, or like we need to break up just so I can 'catch up' with my peers. I'm also worried that dating this dude who I only get to see occasionally is impacting negatively on my last year of college (stopping me from going out , etc). 

We're planning to move in together after I graduate which I really want to do, but I also feel like maybe I'm being stupid/ naive. 

I guess my question is: is 21 too young to get into a serious relationship? Is moving in with your first boyfriend a bad idea?

I mean, I feel like I love him, but I also worry that maybe I'm sticking with him because I'm subconsciously worried that I'll never be able to find someone else, especially when I spent so long single... or maybe this is just a case of the grass always being greener, and if I dumped him, I'd really regret it. I just don't know what to do, and I have no idea how to figure it out. ",26Jul2017,2
255,"So I am currently in summer about to go to 10th grade. I have gone to the local high school I am zoned for and I absolutely hate it in every aspect. It's a terrible school within itself with terrible ratings and it's known to be filled with gang activity and shit like that. And I've been there for a year and I absolutely hate this school. It's also worth mentioning that I have no friends here. After a full year of school here I made about 1 or 2 friends that I still talk to, but overall I like no one at this school and I hate the teacher. There's another school about 1 mile farther away than the one I'm attending. All of my friends go to this school and it gets amazing ratings. I would love to attend this school, and probably any other school than the one I'm currently attending, but I'd like to attend this specific ones, with all my childhood friends. Last year I tried to submit a zone variance but that got denied, and this year I was going to say I part-time live with a friend of mine due to economical issues, but they said it only lasts for 6 months and then the  parents of my friend would have to obtain legal custody of me. Which obviously probably won't happen. I just want advice on what to do and if there's a way I could transfer to this school, ways I maybe haven't heard of. Plus, please don't tell me to just find a way to deal with the current school, I've been there one year and I just can't do it again, it will be my downfall 100% this is really really upsetting me to the point of not eating and ignoring everyone, I just really need help and serious advice, this matters more to me than you think.

261,"Hi guys. I think I fucked up everything.
So the title says everything. But let's start from the beginning.
I NEVER felt those kind of feelings for her. Never. She's the closest friend I have, aside from her boyfriend. Two days ago me and my group of friend went to a birthday party of one of them. It was really nice, with music and etc, you know. During the party, she asked me to dance with her, and when she did I was literally melting. I was stunned. I mean, I danced whit her so many times, but this time was strange. Why did I felt like that? 
At this point my mind went blank. It was me and her. 
And then... I realised what was happening.
I submitted this post here not for getting advices about how to fall in love with her, but the opposite. 
I think this is just my brain fucking with me. This can't be happening. Not to me. Do you guys think it's just an illusion? Am I confused? 
I'm saying so because I never thought of her as my girlfriend or something. Never. She's just my friend. 

...right?",26Jul2017,2
262,"So I have a good relationship with my mother most of the time, however there is a certain subject that causes a lot of tension in the house and always ends in arguments. 

My sister and I are twins, and my mother is the a classic Asian stereotype. For a little background, when we were young we spent a lot of time playing and writing music together. It started out just for fun, and my parents were very supportive, got us singing lessons, bought us all kinds of musical equipment that enabled us to produce our own music, and were generally great about it. However, my sister and I have never been particularly outgoing, and performing our music was always a nightmare. 

We both get quite anxious in many social situations and performing was no different, but I was assured that the more I do it the easier it would become.. but it never did. Instead, I learned that it's probably better in life to play to your strengths, instead of trying to hammer out your weaknesses. And every time we had a performance of some kind, there would be arguments. My sister and I still really enjoyed making music and playing together, but with an audience it was unbearable. However, my mother would always get involved whenever we started playing and tell us how we should be better, and how we always needed to practice, not disappoint our fans etc.. when for us it was never about the performative aspect, it was just something we did together for fun. 

We sold (and are still selling) some of our songs on iTunes and so on, and we did quite a few shows that were somewhat successful, but after a while it became more about being good for the sake of our mother, rather than the fun creative experience it was for us. It's difficult because I appreciate that my mother was trying to help in her way, and because of her initial support we were able to do as much as we did, but she ended up getting too involved and making us resent our music more than enjoy it, and ultimately we ""gave up"" and focused on other, less stressful things.


Now it's been a few years since we stopped doing music, we're both adults, though we still live at home with our parents. My sister and I both have the desire to start writing songs again, but while we're under the same roof, our mother will always be there telling us how we should be performing our music and selling it to the world blah blah. We don't want to move out at all, our Dad is very ill at the moment and we want to be at home to help him, plus aside from the whole music thing, our relationship with our mother is very good. It's just whenever I discuss my feelings about this with her, she thinks I'm trying to blame her and make it seem like she's the one to blame for me giving up my music.. which she kind of is, but I can't get her to accept that. She's a very black-and-white thinker, if I say that I appreciate the time and money she put in to helping us, but I don't want her to be so overbearing, she'll feel like I'm making her out to be a monster. 

I don't know if she's trying to live through us or what, she's never showed any interest in playing any music herself. I think she feels that, in a way, after spending so much time and money on us, we owe her to take our music as far as possible, but I could be wrong about that too. It's hard to talk to her about it in a serious fashion. And even though my mind tells me I'm right, that music can just be a hobby and I don't owe anyone anything, there's a part of me that thinks that I'm letting myself down by setting my sights too low/not having faith in my own abilities/not trying hard enough.

The thing that triggered this post in particular, was that I want to go to see a show with another band that we used to play shows with. And my mother is like ""why didn't they ask you to play with them? Why don't you ask them, what if they ask you to perform with them? You need to practice, don't want to let your fans down blahblah..."" ugh. I don't even want to go anymore if she's like this. 


So basically, how do I get my mother to understand that music is a thing that I do for fun, and not something I want to sell to the world and be the best at? How do I make her understand that my sister and I don't want her to be so involved, in a way that doesn't hurt her/make her feel unappreciated? How in God's name do other people deal with parents like this? And while we're at it, I know there are fans out there who still like our music because it still sells online, but should I feel any pressure at all to continue writing and performing on their behalf? 

TL;DR, sorry for the wall of text. It's just all your basic overbearing parent nonsense. Help me.",26Jul2017,1
263,"Alright. There's a girl that I spent a lot of time with during my 1 year stay in a different country. She's 3 years younger than me and is a little immature (in my opinion at least). She did not have many friends but I liked hanging out with her so we did that a lot. 

After my year is over I go back home and apparently she got feelings for me, which she told me after I left. I don't have any feelings for her at all, and actually got really tired of her the last time we hung out before I left. I've just tried to let our contact run out in the sand and fade, but she writes to me every now and then and says she miss me a lot. 
So down to my question: 

I do not miss her at all, what so ever, and I will not lie and tell her I miss her too when she writes to me, because I don't. If I ever go back to that place to visit other friends I won't be able to without seeing her too (or she would be extremely hurt, which I don't want). 
How should I deal with her telling me she miss me a lot and all that? I've been able to write around it so far, but I barley dare to open her messages because idk what to answer.

264,"Okay so what happened is... I'm going to a certain community college in Texas and I'm taking summer classes. Usually after class I like to workout because there's a gym at the school. There's also a locker room, in which you can get your own locker for the semester. They take your student ID info and give you the locker combo. So basically I've been using the same locker since Spring semester and I've kept my stuff in there all through spring, and Summer.

However... a couple weeks ago all my shit disappeared. I go to ask the Fitness area coordinator what was up and they didn't know... It turns out that without any indication, someone went through and got rid of everything in the lockers and gave it away to donation. The guy told me this to my face and didn't even say sorry... Wtf! I spent at least $65 on those clothes. I had a pair of shoes and joggers in there. Is there anything I can do to get the school to reimburse me or buy me some new clothes??? I feel like I should be reimbursed.

P.S. The main reasons I'm pissed is not just that I lost my shit... I feel like they were STOLEN by the school. They knew whose lockers belonged to whom... AND there was no warning that they were going to wipe out the lockers... This was in the middle of my Summer I class calendar.",26Jul2017,1

269,"Back story: I'm at University. 21. And I like this girl who doesn't even know I exist.
I met this girl at a club, spoke a bit, but i'm pretty sure it was drunken, slurring words on my part. I mean it wasn't that bad, but i remember it being me gathering the courage to talk her. Just asked her name etc. The next day i just typed her name into Facebook and clicked the first name that appeared on the list. It somehow was her: I remember the face.

Today: Am I a stalker? This was a year ago, i am in my 2nd year of University, going into my final year. I have non stop been thinking about this girl for a year. I keep looking her up on Facebook to see if she is till single. I don't get it. I have not felt this way about a girl before. I feel like a stalker, I feel wrong, but infatuated.

 I am not looking her up everyday, but once in a while i look to see i she is still single. I keep coming back to this girl. I have had other girlfriends. But I keep finding myself looking this girl up on Facebook to see if she is still single. I want to talk to her, to meet her. And just get to know her. My intentions are to just get talking, I really want to get to know her, see what shes like and see if we can be friends.

Reddit: 1) Should I message her on facebook?= this is the worry, i cant message a girl randomly saying hey we are in the same class, lets be friends. She doesn't even know I exist, I don't want to come across as weird, stalker, scare her off etc.
2) But I have honestly not felt this way about a girl before, and i'm not trying to sound dreamy or Disney or whimsical, but I keep thinking about this girl. If she gets into a relationship it would give me closure that I can find someone new to pursue.

Maybe that's it, I feel lonely and this girl is me telling myself she is my outlet? a way of telling myself I will not be alone?

I sound sad and stalkery, but honestly i;m not, i had a few drinks, perhaps obviously and just though to share some ideas, thoughts with you.

'Quick share: we meet at clubs regularly, we are in the same class, the same field of ""Research"", My drunk mind cant think of the word; school ""Literature"". And i keep finding myself looking for her to approach her and say hi.

Goals: to meet her in class, if we ever get to meet in person again, just to talk sober, say hi, just get to know her, but my worry is this wont happen within my time at University.

Sorry for the wall of text, i have been drinking as it is the summer holidays, and thought to share a nagging thought. Also I keep re reading this over and over, so I hope there are not grammar or spelling mistakes.  Thanks for the read and have a good day/evening!!

So a little about myself, I'm a 19 yo dude and I want to experience with guys, to see what it is like. I've downloaded Grindr and I've been chatting with some guy for a bit. He told me that he wanted to be sucked off and I always wanted to experience what it's like to give someone a blow job. He didn't live that far away from me, so I went to his place and we went to business two days ago. 

After a couple of minutes he asked me if he could film it, and I was so into it that I agreed. I told him that I didn't want him to share it with anyone though, he said he wouldn't. We finish business, he thanked me and I went home.

I thought nothing of it, until an hour ago when some random dude hit me up. He asked me if I gave someone a blow job  and if he recorded it. My heart immediately started to sink. The first thing after that what he said to me was that I was dumb as fuck for trusting him, since he's apparently known in the community as an asshole. 

It turns out that he has shared the video with multiple people, and was also quite rude. He sent me a screenshot of his conversation with the dude on kik. He said something like ""hey dude, I got drunk a couple of nights ago and I got this ugly boy from Grindr to suck me off. "" and then sent the video. The guy who informed me about this has sent me the video and you can kinda tell it's me. Apparently the asshole has sent it to at least two other people, and I'm afraid he'll send it to a lot more people. I want to tell him not to share it with more people, but I think that the damage is already done, and since he's such a dick he'll probably share it even more.

Today, she accepted a job in Columbus (her home city) doing what she believes is her dream job, event planning. I'm very happy and proud of her, she's been looking for his for a while and she's found something she is happy with. 

Also today, took a test at the company I'm interning with that will most likely land me a job offer working and an engineer full time starting June 2018. I'll get the offer letter in October if I get it, and will have 2 weeks to reply. This job is obviously in Chicago, but also will have great benefits, 70k+ starting salary, and I could live at home for a year to save some extra money. 

So I'm scared and don't know what to do, and have 2 months to figure this out. I have a lot less time to figure this out than I thought. My girlfriend seems to be dead set on staying in Columbus, and is basically saying if I take the job in Chicago, she will stay there and we will visit until she can't take it and we are over. I'm seeing 0 thoughts of her leaving, even though she suggested it could happen when we had small discussions about it before. 

I'm going to try looking in the Columbus area for a job, but it has to be damn good for me to turn down a 70k plus benefits starting job and living at home for a year or else I'll feel like I turning down a fantastic opportunity.

280,"My little brother is 10 years old.

His general attitude is playful, he never takes anything seriously. He never seems to know when to stop. Especially with school.

From 1st grade till now, he has constantly gotten straight C's (occasionally B's).

Despite being 10 years old, he tries to act more childish than he should, like a cute, innocent 6-year-old.

He spends most of his time in front of his computer, playing Minecraft, Roblox or watching vulgar Youtubers with the attitudes of trolls or bullies playing them and griefing kids.

He always tries to put in the least amount of effort he can with his homework, usually either zooming through it or calling me or my mom down to walk him through it.

I don't even know how he does in class.

Whenever it comes time for testing, he fails horribly.

He refuses to spend more than 5 minutes studying before going back to watching Youtubers.

He despises reading or anything academic that takes him away from his computer.

He is horribly addicted and attached to his computer.

If we take it away, he gets violent and depressed, sobbing loudly and getting into verbal and physical fights (I never hit back).

Whenever we ask him to read a book or do an extra assignment or redo an assignment, he jokes his way out of it (generally with my mom) or violently refuses it (usually scratching or hitting me)


However, on the rare occasion he actually TRIES, he can get an A. This is sometimes on homework or some classwork, but never on a test.

We've tried everything. 

-Punishment: Mostly lead by me. My mom usually just yells at him to get off his computer, but always gives in to him and allows him to goof off eventually. She's a busy woman trying to get her master's in Nursing, so I can kinda get it.

But even when I try to punish him by ACTUALLY taking away his computer, he cries to her and she forces me to give it back to him.

-Rewards: My mom always buys him fast food or other junk items to reward him with. This leads to ANOTHER problem with his diet that I might go into in another post.

-Tutoring: Currently in the process of that.


At this point, I just don't know what to do, Reddit. I don't know how I can save him from being a failure.

My sister and I are straight A+ Honors-AP students, while he's struggling to get anything above a B.

What do I do? What other options can I explore? 

I don't want him to get held back in the 5th grade and fall behind him peers while they move on to middle school.

Please help me.",26Jul2017,1
281,"Hello. First time posting here and I'm sorry if it is the wrong place- if there is a more appropriate place to post this please let me know.

My Girlfriend and I have lived in our current flat for nearly 4 months. And our flatmate has had a dog for nearly a year (I believe? Not 100% certain)
We knew there was a dog in the flat. Both of us love dogs and get on really well with the dog. We said we were happy to take the dog on walks. Make sure he was fed and had water. We wanted to help with the dog in cases where our flatmate / their partner was unavailable. And for a while this worked out in everyone's interests- flatmate was appreciative, dog was happy, we didn't feel as if we were being taken advantage of.

The flatmate then begun making up strange excuses for why we couldn't take the dog on a walk, ""he hurt his paw"" (true, he did have a paw injury- but it didn't occur solely on a walk that we took the dog on) but the narrative then shifted to ""I don't want him to hurt his paw again""
""This breed of dog gets back problems if they go on too many walks""
""The weather isn't good""
We begun to feel a bit weird about these excuses. In our minds dogs need constant walks. And between all 4 of us we were making sure the dog was having a walk a day.
The walking started to become less consistent, to the point where it had been about 2-3 weeks where the dog hadn't been on a walk.

However during this time. We were still asked to maintain the feeding schedule and make sure the water bowl was filled. But we couldn't take the dog on walks- we were happy to do this because we obviously don't want the dog to starve / dehydrate but it started to feel a bit like we were being taken advantage of, both my girlfriend and I have quite challenging schedules (I work a mixture of day shifts and night shifts. She works variable hours) and we found ourselves being there for the dog more than the flatmate.

Recently. Our flatmate went on holiday and the accommodation for the dog fell through, so they had to return the dog. We took the dog and told the flatmate what had happened. Took the dog on walks. Filled food/water etc for the rest of their holiday. Flatmate thanked us and it was never talked about again... Until recently.

Our flatmate's partner was at work from morning till midnight. And our flatmate was visiting their parents. We thought we'd do the partner a favour and take the dog on a walk.

When the flatmate found out. It wasn't the response we were expecting? We didn't expect a whole song and dance. To us it was nothing. We were going for a walk anyway. But our flatmate started demanding that we ask before taking the dog on a walk (which has never been the case). That we are incompetent with dogs. That the dog is injured after our walks, we never refill the water, she is angry at the person who was supposed to look after the dog because they returned the dog to us without saying anything, and claimed that we didn't say anything about the dog until they had returned back home.
(This last point is easy to prove wrong, we got the dog late on the 24th of June. And we let them know on the 25th that we had the dog. We assumed the sitter would have said something.  They returned from their holiday on the 28th)

This has resulted in a minor argument over messenger, with the partner of our flatmate taking our side (to our faces at least) and with my girlfriend and I feeling a bit annoyed. The flatmate has forgotten to feed the dog at his usual time, doesn't clean the back garden after the dog does a poop. So there are currently about 10 poops in the garden (which we have been told not to clean), which do get cleaned eventually but they definitely accumulate to a large number before this is done. 

**Super mega tl;dr**
4 people in a flat looking after a dog, everything is going well. Flatmate that owns the dog starts to not allow us to walk the dog (but not directly saying we can't)
2 months later we take the dog on a walk and the owner loses their mind. 

Obviously it works better with more detail, but that is the gist.

Moving on from that situation. My girlfriend and I want to speak to the flatmate and say that we are stepping back from our responsibilities with the dog. We have already been banned from walks and are a bit annoyed at the whole situation. We have been making sure the dog has food and water consistently since we moved in, and we love the dog. For our flatmate to turn around and say we can't take the dog on walks anymore but she is happy for us to feed / water the dog is not a situation we are happy with. We know that both the flatmate and their partner's schedules cannot maintain the dog's routine. 

Does Reddit have any advice or perspective that we would find useful, before carrying this conversation forward?

This is a bit jumbled. But I hope the details make sense.
Please feel free to ask for clarification.

Any new challenges I would face or problems? Life/work balance would be affected much?

285,"Hi there.

I'm a young woman, single mother, humanities professor of an institute (English is not my first language, sorry if I make any mistakes here). 

Recently I've been offered a promotion by a boss who's older than me (11-13 years, not really sure). He is Head of studies, has a long time girlfriend and until recently I just saw him as my boss. If the promotion is official, I'd be working directly with him. He has asked me out on a number of occasions, and he's been really cool and supporting with me in this promotion process. He's never made a direct sexual insinuation whatsoever, but he has said one or other time that I'm pretty, she calls me ""dear"", ""honey"", and he says he's anxious to start working with me, sends me pictures of him in some landscape at inappropriate
hours, and asks me out for drinks. I'm afraid if I keep rejecting him I could be without a job, or have nasty consequences. I like him as a boss, and I think he's a cool guy, but I'm not interested in anything more than a good, maybe even a friendly professional relationship with him.

Oh and when I said he's been supportive, I mean he has gone out of his way to help me and be on my side. A coworker and a friend of both of us tried to discredit my work, and he went to the Director of the establishment showing proof of my work. Thanks to that, now I'm being considered for this promotion. By the way, if I refuse the promotion I won't have a job anymore, so I either go up in my career and accept it, or go out (i'll be unemployed because my other job there was for a limited time, and I already finished it).

So, what should I do? I want to keep being friendly with him, I'm also really grateful for everything he's done for me, but I really don't want it to be more than a professional relationship, and I also don't want him to take advantage of my gratitude. If I quit this job altogether, I got nowhere else to go, and that could be a pretty big downfall considering I have children. Could I find a third way? Go for a drink with him, just be a ""coworker pal"" with him or something?

TLDR: . Single mom afraid to lose my job. Boss who's helped me a lot professionally keeps asking me out, and I'm not interested. 

Thanks for reading :-)",26Jul2017,5
