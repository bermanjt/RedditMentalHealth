1,"(no TL;DR) As someone who’s about to enter university, and then will probably have to transfer to another country within the six months to a year after I am honestly concerned.

To be completely honest I have no idea what I want to do in university. I’m always looking to business to accounting (specifically) to management to pre-law. But I feel like I can’t afford to even explore in university. Every semester I spend not declaring a major is more money I’m adding to potential debt. 

Housing in America may be more fair than Canada. But some undergraduate degrees over there are going to make me leave with debt—this is excluding grad school. 

I’ve seen things recommended for 18-20 year olds already: 
- try not to get a car until you get a full time job
- try to make sure mortgage is your only debt
- look into property taxes and where you’d potentially like to live
- get life insurance (universal or whole life) at 18
- try to learn some real estate and banking for yourself

Is there anything else I can do to prepare myself and be smart about my finances for when I graduate?",29Apr2017,1
2,"Hi, I'm making this post because I don't really feel I have anyone else to turn to. I met my friend a while back and I immediately developed feelings for her. Unfortunately for an early time of knowing her she was still dealing with a guy she was still interested in back home. Eventually they started going out and they have been for a couple years. I don't want to be that guy that doesn't get friendships with women. I have lots of women friends and I feel I have learnt the difference between friendship and, you know, more than that. The big bummer is that I live with both of them. First her for a year and then both after. In my head they seem pretty made for each other and happy but it kills me having to deal with it. Fortunately our contract for where we live is soon over but its still hard. Any advice on how to cope? I'm aware it will probably never happen which to be quite honest does not help. Thanks in advance.",29Apr2017,1
5,"I'm 21 and have been unemployed for almost 7 months now. I've been able to keep paying my bills because I don't do anything so I just saved all of my money when I did have a job. My days consisted of waking up at 4 am, running to work, running back home and going back to bed every day for a little over a year. I left that job and haven't gotten a new one since. 

I'm just about out of money though and I'd rather not get in dept. I don't have a license so I was trying to find a place relatively close to me to work at. I spent about a week working in a warehouse about 5 months ago. I'm a pretty physically fit guy but unloading 15 trucks that are packed air tight with things of all shapes and sizes so you'd have to jam your fingers into the airtight seal and fight the suction to lift a 150 pound car undercarriage without breaking it was killer on my back. After my first week I couldn't move and was incredibly slow while working after I hurt my back. 

I thought that job would be easy and was incredibly disappointed in myself for having to quit especially when in my previous job I was always commended for being a hard worker. I'd always stay until the job was done every day and if someone called out I'd be right in there to cover for them without exception. Since I do literally nothing in my life all I had to do was work and that's all I did.  

Since then I haven't been able to find a job. I'm just about out of money and don't know what to do. ",29Apr2017,5

7,"Today, we had an in-class essay in English with four prompts. I completed my essay and went to my next period. In my next period, my teacher completely hates me and always tries her best to get me in trouble. After class, a girl who has my English teacher in a future period asked me how the essay was and what the prompts were for the essay. I told her that the essay was difficult and that I didn't remember the prompt but gave her a word or two about it. My teacher of that period overheard me talking to her and started eavesdropping. She then immediately called me out for having something I wasn't supposed to have. Apparently, she stated that I was telling this girl the prompts for the essay and thus was cheating. She reported it to my English teacher and told her that I ""was distributing resources to cheat to various students"". My English teacher is now giving me a referral and is taking the issue to the administration. I believe this referral for ""academic dishonesty"" will destroy my chances at all of my dream schools. I think I should try to repeal this referral by going to the administration. What should I do? ",29Apr2017,10
8,"throwaway for obvious reasons. sorry for the long read. 

at the beginning of the week my boyfriend of 1 year and I went out to a restaurant to celebrate. As soon as we walk in, to our surprise, his ex girlfriend is hostess. he goes in for a big hug and she looks happy to see him. obviously not an ideal situation but I was polite and we were seated. feeling insecure but i just ignore the voice in my head and plan to have a great time. 

a little bit of background concerning the ex. we all went to high school together (me, current boyfriend and his ex). they were friends and dated in high school and still remain part of a friend group that hangs out once a month. she has a boyfriend so no worries there. 

so we are at the restaurant and wrapping up a meal when we run into another one of his friends. she invited us to the bar next door since she's working and says she will make us free drinks. sounds good right? 

we head over next door after finishing our meal. just as we are drinking cocktails enjoying ourselves his ex (hostess from restaurant) comes over. great. she sits at the bar with us. WTF. 

i'm sitting there forced to make small talk while my boyfriend just sits there. then they start chatting about people and events i'm not even aware of. super awkward and i'm getting pretty annoyed that this is how we spent our 1 year and my bf seemed like this was no big deal.

we get in the car and leave. i decide to spend the night at my place alone but don't make a fuss or bring up my concerns in the car. it had been a long night. 

a few days go by and i bring it up casually. i tell him how uncomfortable i felt sitting at the bar spending time with his ex while we were out celebrating our one year. he basically laughs, tells me i'm overreacting, that i see negativity in every situation, and that i'm being a drama queen. he also defends her and says that they have been good friends for +10 years. wow. not the reaction i was expecting nor was i even trying to intervene on their friendship. 

so reddit, am i overreacting? my bf doesn't see how it was an uncomfortable situation. i didn't sense any tension between the two of them at all. it was more disappointing that i was looking toward to a night with my bf and instead a decent amount of time was spent with his ex. 

tldr; went to celebrate 1 year with my bf and a portion of it was spent with his ex girlfriend/friend, boyfriend doesn't see how it's a big deal to me ",29Apr2017,1
9,"It was a year ago today my best friend was killed. Auto-pedestrian accident, he was 26 at the time.

There was a lot of rumors going around - he was into hard drugs so there were rumors about him owing someone money, but I don't know what happened. 

The rumor is that someone pushed him into the middle of the highway, but, again, only a rumor. All I know for sure is that something happened, he was pushed onto the highway, in front of a car.

I have three things to back this up:

1. The police that arrived on the scene were searching for something. I would presume his belongings, but I have pictures that show all of his clothes, wallet, and cell phone being on the back end of the ambulance.

2. A medical worker from the ambulance told his sister that person driving the car (that struck my friend) saw a dark car speeding away from the parking lot as he was struck. They had no license plate number.

3. His sister that I referred to in the previous paragraph was arrested a few months ago. The officer that came to her house to arrest her, saw a picture of her brother (my friend) and said something about him. He said ""the case was suddenly closed, although there was a lot of speculation about the case.""

Is there anything I can do about this? I have been trying so hard this past year to get a lot of talking done, and I'm not sure how far reddit can take me.",29Apr2017,1

11,"
Just a bit of the backround story - we have been dating for over a year, both our first relationship, both christians and both have talked about wanting to marry eachother. I'm taller than him and larger, he is quite skinny and a few months younger.

Anyways the past 6 months I have developed an anxiety disorder. There is a history of mental illness in my family, including bipolar. First it started off with me just crying irrationally, but now has developed to angry outbursts and recently i got so angry i pushed him, hit his arm away and (unintentionally) scratched him. This is the 2nd or 3rd time. He never shows any physical reaction when he is upset or angry.

I feel so upset and guilty after it's done. He always says he forgives me, wants to marry me and belives God can help heal me. However, I think its unhealthy for him to be in this relationship as much as it hurts me. I do love him, but i know he doesn't have the strength to walk away. So should I? and how?

I have been getting counselling, but i really think its wise i don't inflict this on him anymore. i need some time to pray, continue counselling etc.... Should i give him hope we can get back together later? i don't want him to just wait indefinitely for me. He should be happy with someone else, if he likes.

12,"I'm really at a loss at what to do. 

I'm three years into a four year sociology university course. I hate it. I started having these feelings towards the end of year two but tried to persevere. It hasn't really worked. Uni triggers my anxiety and depression and I've tried to reach out to tutors with no success. 

I've recently been offered a full time job in a bank. This job is similar to what I'd be able to achieve post graduation. My friends with masters degrees are also interviewing for very similar jobs so I don't feel as if university is opening a lot of doors for many people. This job is good money that would allow me to move in with my boyfriend in a nice flat and live comfortably. My mum changes her mind frequently about whether she supports me or not while I decide whether to take this job and leave uni for good.

13,"I never realized how much of a life I lacked. I'm going to finish college it's just, is this all there is to it? 

My family is great. Too great I'd say. It's not an exaggeration to say I've spent my whole life locked in my room playing video games. I never really went out. I always had perfect grades so my family didn't care. Jesus Christ I don't even know how to mow a lawn lol

Don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm a total shut in either. I have really close friends that I've stayed with through the years, and still hang around with them frequently despite being in different colleges. I've gone on dates and I'm currently in somewhat of a relationship. People describe me as a pleasant person and I can have decent conversation with strangers, albeit somewhat small talk, so it's not like I have the social skills of a dead tree branch. 

Every morning I wake up and just stare at the ceiling for like an hour. I try to maintain a healthy sleep schedule but there's no point to really waking up early. I don't do anything. I'm currently trying to get a job, but I don't have references nor experiences. None the less I've applied to various fast foods and what not but I still haven't gotten a call from anywhere. I don't have the motivation to do anything. I found a wonderful guy, that I know truly loves me and I'm sure I won't find someone like him in a very long time, and I just want to break it up. I'm not worth his time. 

I don't know where I was going with this but, what should I do? How do I find myself some goals? How do I get motivated in general?

I honestly want to blame my family for giving me everything and not really letting me work hard for anything. I feel like the lack of discipline really screwed me up as a child. Not to say I'm not thankful for everything of course, but still I got it way too great.

14,"I'm having a lot of trouble at work. I was promoted a few months ago to a position with much more responsibility. I've gone from working 40 hours a week to 45-50 hours. I can't seem to catch up on the day's work when I'm at the office and the overdue work snowballs until it's overwhelming. Meanwhile, there are a handful of people who depend directly on me at work and make demands all day. It's part of my job to respond to those demands in a timely manner. This is all high-stakes financial business.

I'm now rarely hungry during the day, not that I have time for lunch anyway. I used to go to bed by 10 but now I am regularly up past midnight worrying about work. It feels like I am having a panic attack every night. Most nights I drink nyquil to be able to fall asleep. I try to prioritize working out but rarely have energy (see: not being able to eat) and I spend a lot of time outside of work crying. My husband is concerned for me but also busy with his own job.

I addressed some of my stress with my boss. She congratulated me for not quitting. She also turned down my request to lighten my workload. I work at a work-hard-play-hard mentality company where they tout our ping pong tournaments and free vending machines but I'm getting the impression the ""work/life balance"" schtick is lip service.

I have been in the professional workforce for 12 years and used to think I had a strong work ethic. Is this just what working is like now? I don't think most people cry at their desk, lose their appetites, and self-medicate with cough syrup but...?

I'm a 17 year old female in Toronto, Canada.

My mom (separated from dad) however would try to help but she isn't very financially well off and I can't expect much. 
I'm in the IB program and have decent enough grades (AVE low 80's)

22,"Okay so I'm going to try my best to explain this situation in a (somewhat) concise manner. For reference, I am also a 17 year old male.

I'll start off with saying that my mother is a very good mom to me, but is pretty much insane when it comes to her romantic relationships and being unfaithful in said relationships. I'll explain the main ones as they are important to understand her character.

She met my biological father (who didn't come into my life until about 5 years ago) and after a few years together as a couple, she cheated on him while I was a baby. Because my biological dad had been dragged back to her hometown when I was born and had to work shit jobs while she hung out and cheated on him, he left. 

Flash forward to when she met my step dad. She met my step dad when I was 3 or so and ended up having 2 kids with him. This man raised me and has been a pretty good person in mine and my siblings lives. I learned that she cheated on him THREE times during that marrige. 

This leads to a divorce which consists of my mom moving out and dating other guys until eventually she meets her current boyfriend. We'll call him Alex. 

Now Alex is a 6 foot something 215 lb bodybuilder. He is Bipolar and once one of his parents passes he begins to go off the rails. He hit my mother once and a few weeks go by in which my mother forgave him. One night he goes REALLY off the rails and threatened to kill my mother. The next day he shows up at my empty house (besides my mother) and attempts to break in. My mom escapes, he goes to jail and she gets a PFA against him. 

After this fiasco she tells me she is pregnant and decides to keep the baby. 9 months later here I am with my mom, my siblings, a newborn baby, and a newly medicated ""reforming"" bipolar boyfriend (she removed the PFA)

Now there is alot of tension between my Step Dad, Biological Dad, and Grandparents with my mom. They all think it's crazy and have different solutions to the problem. 

Step Dad solution: Obtain custody of his kids and keep us away from mom

Biological Dad solution: If you ever need me I can literally kill him (the boyfriend) 

Grandparents: We don't know what the fuck is happening with our daughter

Honestly this situation doesn't effect me as much as it does my siblings. I will be off to college in 2 months and away from this. However I wanted to see some other perspectives of the problem I might not have thought about. If any of you took the time to read all this then thank you.

Whether is be from the headaches, things not going how I want them, anxiety, or whatever, there's usually an hour or two a day where I'm stressed/unhappy/in pain. Is this just part of being an adult?

I'm sure no one cares, but I feel kind of lost, so if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing that'd be very helpful.

Freshman Year (all honors):
Spanish 2 (97)  
Latin 2 (96)  
Biology (97)  
Ancient World Literature (93)  
Ancient/Medieval World History (93)  
Algebra 2 (94)
(not honors) Health (94)  
(not honors)Band (98)  


Sophomore Year (all honors, 2 (semester long) APs) using grades from the first semester:  
Latin 3 (93)  
European Literature (95)  
Pre-Calculus (96)  
Chemistry (99)  
Modern World History (93)  
AP Macroeconomics (93)  
AP Microeconomics (95)  


Options for next year:  
Honors Latin 4 (pretty sure I'll take this one)  
AP Art History or Honors Intro to Law and Politics  
AP Physics, APES, or Honors Physics  
AP Calc either AB or BC  
AP Lang  
(Free Period)  
AP Euro *My history teacher highly urged me to take this over honors US  


If I took AP Euro, AP Lang, AP Calc BC, Honors Latin 4, and AP Physics I would probably give myself a second free period in place of art history or intro to law and politics. That's kind of what I'm leaning toward. What would colleges think of that schedule? Will it be too tough? Is there anything you would switch out?

32,"So, my mom was never organized with money. Ever since I was little, I remember her never having enough, even when things were much, much better than now. She made lots of bad decisions when I was a kid and teenager, and lost a lot of money. Even though I was young, I still feel guilty, like there was something I should've done to stop her, but didn't do. 

Anyway, ever since I began working, at 18, she counts on me financially. At first, it was just small things, something here and there on my credit card. Then, she bought a car on my name. She paid it, but keeps getting tickets (doesn't pay those), doesn't pay the necessary taxes for it and now I can't get a driver's license (it's paid where I come from, so I couldn't afford it when I was younger, and can't legally get one now, because of the tickets and taxes). 

I've already paid all the cars' debts once and promised to never do it again, but it's in my name and just getting worse. She maxed out one credit card of mine some years ago. But the worst has been these past few months. She gets paid on commission, so, not a fixed income, and each month gets worse. We live on rent, so I'm constantly terrified she won't have enough to pay it and I don't make enough to support both of us including rent.

I had to negotiate the debt on two credit cards just these past couple of months because I left them with her for EMERGENCIES, but she used them like a limitless bank account. 

I'm exhausted. I'm working two jobs, I don't get enough sleep and I'm always worried. I live paycheck to paycheck, I'm always looking for freelance work to cover any unexpected bills she shoves my way and I can't do anything to advance in my own life. I can't save up to buy a place, travel, get a master's, anything. I can barely eat out sometimes, when I need to unwind.

Thing is, I've been trying to cut her off, but I feel so guilty. Though she has been very careless with her money in the past, right now she really has very little and if I do cut her off, I don't know how she'll manage. Besides, we live together, so I see her sad, beaten down face every single day. 

I don't know what's worse, dealing with the guilt of cutting her off or the stress of supporting us both without the means to do so. I can't take it anymore. I don't wanna live like this forever, but I don't know what to do. 

Ps.: Counseling and any form of therapy is quite expensive where I live, so...That's not an option right now.

tl;dr mom has always been careless with money, has become more and more dependent over the years. I'm feel too much guilt to cut her off, but too much stress from supporting us because I don't make enough money for it. advice desperately needed. ",29Apr2017,1

We rent out an apartment near New York. My mom wants to own property -- but more importantly, US (me and my brother, to own property). My mom is forcing me to buy a house because she wants me to own property. I don't want to because I don't intend on living in New Jersey for 30 years, and I feel like buying property that I don't want to live in is a waste of money.

43,"My ex [F20] and I [M 21] were together for 3 years and during the final year, we were on and off. As of ~3 months ago, we're finally off for good. We were usually on for a month, off for 2 days during that last stretch.

It was a toxic relationship due to both of us having insecurity, abusive traits learned from our parents, and general inexperience. 

Long story short, she made me feel like I was a bad person. I ""wasn't good"" at being comforting, or making her feel like I loved her, apparently, which I've come to learn is not true and her own insecurity sabotaged our relationship. She cheated on me 3 times, but not of a sexual nature. Just like having crushes and texting them.

One time she hung out with one of them to do homework(at a library, nothing sexual) without telling me and ignoring my calls and texts.

Another time, she was just crushing on an old friend and refused to let me go through her phone. I never invaded her privacy or felt inclined to look through her phone while we were together, but after I had a bad feeling that she wasn't being honest with me, I asked to see her phone as a gesture to confirm my gut feeling(I'm not crazy I promise).

Anyone who has had their trust betrayed by a SO knows how fucking crazy it makes you.

You might want to scream at me for being so dumb and staying with her after these things, but like I said, nothing sexual or ongoing. Pebbles in the pond. I was blinded by sex and companionship.

On top of that, she was very manipulative and I don't believe it was conscious.

She has bulimia and as a result, anxiety and depression as well. An example of her manipulation: ""I'm afraid to be alone right now."" 

Any person would feel the need to go comfort her and drop whatever they're doing in order to help prevent her bulimia cycle, depression and anxiety. I started putting a lot of her needs before mine. What if I wasn't able to help? Whatever party or activity I was involved suddenly isn't enjoyable anymore because I feel guilty.

I'm seeing more clearly than ever thanks to hindsight and I'm just so pissed about all the bs she put me through, but at the same time, she never meant to be like that. It was just a combination of our flaws ruining the relationship...so I I'm not *mad* at her, just resentful. 

I'm going to try writing all the things I'd like to say to her on a piece of paper and throw it away afterwards, but in the meantime, I'd like some advice from people who have gone through similar situations! 

Thanks in advance!",29Apr2017,1
44,"Alright so I'm gay and I happened to fall really bad for my best friend/roommate.  At first this wasn't too much of an issue, I mostly just kept it to myself and it was business as usual.  Unfortunately through a series of drunken confessions I've told him how I feel about him in great detail.  Not much changed after the first confession, but over time my feelings have grown and my confessions have become more intense. 

Lately it feels like he doesn't really want to be around me alone.  We'll often hang out with other people, but if it's just me and him in a room alone together he'll often suddenly have to leave for something, or if I ask him if he wants to hang out he'll be tired, or busy.  I feel like he's gotten freaked out by my confessions, but any time I ask him if things are ok between us he'll just say ""yeah it's fine"" and act like it was a stupid question to begin with.

He's hard to talk to because he's generally not very open about what he's feeling or thinking about anything.  I know he doesn't like our other roommate much and will often blow him off or make up excuses in much the same way he's been doing to me, and so I'm worried that my confessions might have crossed a line, and screwed our friendship up completely.  

So I'm wondering how would other people approach this situation.  Should I just give him space for a while?  Should I confront him further about the way he's been acting, and try to force an actual conversation on the issue?",29Apr2017,1

52,"I have been having marriage difficulties for just over a year now. After months of negotiating and discussing what we both want, we came to the agreement that my wife is to join the military since she has no formal education beyond high school and this is what she feels is the best possible option for her to gain necessary experience needed to sustain herself and our kids should we ultimately split up. I agreed to this since she promised we would try marriage counseling since we will be able to afford it once she's in and she will help me finish the last of my BS Geosciences degree since I won't have to work as much. For her to join we had to stay married as she cut off all contact with her family and has two dependants so she needs us to stay married otherwise she does not qualify to join. 

I was working in the technical field making an ok living to support our family of four where we were living pretty much paycheck to paycheck but still had the budgeting ability to afford things like Disney passes for the family (Florida​ cost of living pretty reasonable). Before that I had been going to school but when she got pregnant I had to put that on hold and focus on our family's wellbeing. It wasn't my dream job and for the most part I hated it but I had to do what I had to do in the best interest of the family.

Flash forward to now and she finished basic training is in A school(Texas). We knew where her school was going to be and moved there before she shipped off to bootcamp so she can see the family often. Now she has gone back on her promise to go to counseling with me and it makes me feel like I can't count on her promises anymore so I am worried about my own future now since I had to quit my job and take up a part time job in retail to take care of our kids while she trains and I can have my own money without her freaking out at every dollar I spend.

Now all I can think of is her cheating on me and it's consuming my life. All I have done since she came back is be extremely supportive. She couldn't leave base so I would bring her anything she desired from home. I bring her food almost every other day since she gets tired of the food that they serve there. I bring her snacks, art supplies so she can paint (her hobby), and even got her an iPad pro 12.9"" so she can stay connected and up to date with all the shows we watch while she's in school. I'm not trying to buy her love, I'm trying to show her that I'm supportive in her career choice and will do anything and everything to make it go easier and more enjoyable for her. 

I know she's busy with her studies but I feel like if she has time to go out with her friends and talk on the phone for hours then she has time to go to counseling for an hour a week. She doesn't even see the kids for more than hour. And because she no longer wants counseling all my mind can do is wonder why? Is there someone new? Are her friends ""friends""? I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted now and need to do something to get better. I was going to counseling by myself and I feel like I've learned how to be a better partner way but I need her to go and want to save this family too, I can't do it on my own.

So now I'm at my wit's end. I want to tell her either go to counseling or I file for divorce. But I can't. I'm scared that if I do file she will be kicked out of the military and thus ruining her career choice. I know that if I do file I can count on my family for support moving back and getting back on my feet. But what about her? I don't want to screw her over but my mental health is deteriorating fast.

If anyone is a military relationship expert here I ask these two things before I make my decision:

1. Will she get kicked out of the military because she will have 2 dependants and is suddenly divorced with no other family support.(1 is not biologically mine and she stopped me from legally adopting him once our problems began and she definitely does not want to split the kids up).

2. Is there a number or someone I can talk to on base (Fort Sam Houston) to convince her or require her to attend counseling with me before something as drastic as divorce is done?",29Apr2017,1

It's been over a day and she still hasn't texted me. I've tried sending texts to her but she leaves it on open and doesn't respond. I see her posting things on snapchat so I know she has her phone.

This guy has gotten me through some of the darkest moments of my life, and I can't say I'd be here today without him, so I feel as if I have a lot to pay him back for. That and I never had a bachelor party either, so it's kind of a two birds with one stone kinda deal. My idea is to tell him we are going camping, but instead drive to the airport and fly to a random destination and just experience what that town has to offer. Right now, that random town is looking like Denver. It's off the wall for us, cheap flight in, and has all the components of a perfect bachelor party for him. We love craft beer, and there are five of the best breweries in the country within 2 hours of Denver. That, along with hiking in the mountains, and catching a Rockies game (he played in college and the goal is to watch them play the Dodgers, his favorite team, the end of September) would make for the perfect trip. 

There's one problem; money. Not only am I working to get my wife through law school, but two of the groomsmen are still in college, and the other has two kids and is also the sole provider of his household. And there's no way for us to ask the groom to chip in. For one, that's just poor etiquette. Two, keeping it a surprise is entirely out the window at that point. Three, he's got a wedding and honeymoon to cover, and probably isn't in any better spot than we are. No rich relatives to help, no airline miles, no friends or family in the area. What are some ways to save on costs, flights, hotels, etc? Are there ways to earn airline miles without taking a credit card? Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",29Apr2017,1
57,"**Condensed History:**  
- GF is dating her ex. April 2014 - Jan 2015  
- GF has a FWB (over snapchat) Jan 2015 - Aug 2015  
- I date GF Nov 2015 - Present

The first thing to note is that I don't know if between the first two guys there was any overlap.

Anyway, in December 2015 My girlfriend sent me a screenshot of her snapchat list and I recognized one of the user names as being her snapchat buddy. This scared the shit out of me because you can't see what they've been discussing or sending.

Eventually I confront her and she tells me he tried to apologize and be friends and she said ""No"" and ""fuck you"", etc. The thing is though at the same time I saw that she was liking his photos on facebook, which isn't a big deal, but it's not something you do to someone you supposedly hate.

After that she blocked him, and we moved on, but ever since then I can't trust her. And I can't see a future with her, because I don't trust her. Any time i bring it up she becomes very defensive and cries and tells me to forget it.

I used to suffer retroactive jealously and I might be a bit paranoid, but I feel like I have a reason to be.

60,"I graduated in 2016 with a BA in anthropology and modern languages. During my senior year of college, I applied to 11 grad programs for anthro and got rejected to all but one. I decided that I would teach English in China, so that's what I've been doing since September. This year I applied to 6 graduate programs and got rejected by all of them.

Grad school (preferably a PhD program in anthro) is my short-term goal, but it won't happen for 2017/18.

My contract with my Chinese employer ends in early July. I do have the option of continuing the contract for 2017/18, BUT my employer rejected my request for a higher salary increase. The salary is poor to begin with, so I'm unable to save much and I have student loan payments. My employer said that I'd receive a raise of about $43/month for the next school year should I decide to continue. My request for about $217/month more was denied. I do live in a smaller, inexpensive Chinese city, but even then I'll only be coming back the US with a few thousand bucks.

SO, I have a decision to make. I could either stay with my current employer in China and make about $913/month with free rent, OR I could go back to the US, live with my parents for a while, try to find something else, enter the scary af job market, etc. As I said I won't be leaving China until July, so I have SOME time to get my shit together, but Idk what sort of job I could get with my experience level.

My ideal job would have something to do with qualitative/social research. I have experience writing tiny research grant proposals (not professional ones or anything), conducting ethnographic interviews, analyzing qualitative data, and now teaching English at a Chinese university. My skills in anthro aren't professional, they're just what I did as an undergrad for classes.

It doesn't seem like long to other people, but I was the first friend she had when she moved cities/schools and we clicked instantly like no one I'd ever known before. We became best friends very fast as we were in the same class, and we were so inseparable, spending almost every spare moment with each other. I introduced her to my squad of friends and she got along with them too. One of them was sort of a friend of a friend who I'd never liked much, but there was a lot of us so we didn't have to interact too much. Until, M (the bf) started taking a particular liking to her. They shared many of the same interests and were generally quite similar, whereas me and her were more different, but we complemented each other that way. Then, last year I changed classes and we grew further apart while her and this other girl grew closer together. I had a big falling out with this girl and some others in the squad, so I started to hang out with people from my new class. M and I still hang out as much as possible in school breaks, after school and in the weekends but we don't take any of the same subjects.

105,"So I pretty much did the bare minimum all the way through secondary school and got away with it because I'm fairly smart, never revised a day in my life but managed to come away with 4 A grade GCSE's (Maths, English lit, Chemistry, Physics) and 5 B's (History, Geography, ICT, Biology, English Language).

When I went the sixth form college I was warned you couldn't just keep doing that, of course I didn't listen and proceeded to do fuck all but play hearthstone for the next two years, never got a job or anything productive like that. I left college with a subsidiary BTEC (D*) in business management (which I took after fucking up my AS levels instead of restarting my A levels which I was given the opportunity to do and was most certainly the smarter move) and an E in economics, so in practice may as well have been ungraded.

With these abysmal results I managed to squeeze my way into university (despite being warned it was a poor choice by everybody under the sun) and now, 8 months later, I have naturally realised that the course I am on (business management) is not only not worth tens of thousands of pounds but it isn't even something I like or can ever see myself doing, in reality I knew this a year ago but simply going to uni was the easier route.

I recently applied to an apprenticeship in engineering and was unsuccessful at the first hurdle, I suspect because my work experience is non-existent and that hardly makes for an appealing candidate. To make matters worse my only real option for a reference is no longer feasible meaning I don't have one of those going forward as of now. I know one attempt means nothing in the long run but I suspect I will continue to struggle until I take steps to address my issues.

I now need to get my life sorted out and develop myself a work ethic most people do at about 13 years old. Sorry for being long winded. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",29Apr2017,0
106,"So, after I had a shower, I went on to sit down on the sofa to browse Facebook on my phone. Then suddenly I could smell something weird, like the shitty diaper of a 3 month old baby. I looked around, nothing. Looked down, spiked my nose like fucking ice picks. The smell came from my armpits and I panicked. Now, I'd heard of armpits smelling weird or fruity is a sign of a bad diet and could lead to diabetes. Now, I didn't know how fruity armpits smelled, but I thought I was fucked. 

My armpit hair had been growing for over a year, where I hadn't bothered with shaving that shit off. So I thought maybe that was the problem. So I went upstairs, grabbed the razor and shaved it off. Now here's another problem. That shit went off like melting ice cream. I don't ever remember being able to shave it all off in under 20 seconds. But there it was. All gone. I might be paranoid, but it's just freaking me out. 

It didn't smell anymore though. It might've been my deadorant, or something. Yet maybe it's something else... I'm dreading that it might happen again.

110,"In high school everyone loved me and respected me, I was friend with basically everyone. We had parties every few week and it was always a good time. At the prom I was walking around to every social circle and they would welcome me because they loved being with me. Now all of this is just a memory. I lost touch with everyone and I have but one friend. 

He's a okay friend but I feel like a burden to him most of to time. When I talk to him he'll answer two days later with a poop emoji but we do play videogames sometimes. 

Three years after high school I'm in college and I just feel like an outsider to everyone and they treat me like it. People don't seem to like me. They dont include me in anything and don't talk to me unless I do. I think it is mostly due to the fact that I don't like to go out in clubs and get drunk everyday of the week.

I don't know what to do anymore to find friends, it's been three years that I'm alone and single now. The summer is starting and I'll spend it without much social contact but work once again for a fourth summer.

112,"Ok, so I'll explain everything to you. I'm a student in Highschool, in France, but the thing is, I'm only 15, whereas the guys in my class are 16-17 (I skipped 2 classes). Yup, I should be in 9th grade, but I'm in 11th grade. Usually, that ain't much of a problem, but another thing is: I'm shy. Like, really really shy. Of course, throughout the years I learned to face this shyness, and I'm a lot less of an introvert than what I was before, but something happened. There was this girl in English class, not really beautiful, rather discreet, the kind of whom you think ""She must be the smart kid"". And she was, she's brilliant, both in Science, literature and economics. As I didn't know her, I started to talk to her, and i kinda fell in love with her... As I told you, she's not the most beautiful girl in the world, but she's cute and smart, and that goes for me. But here comes trouble: first of all, she's 16, almost 17, and I'm 15. As I began to get along with her, I started to become increasingly shy and introvert, even more than I used to be. I know she is shy as well, but I just can't tell her how I feel. I mean, it's pretty obvious there's something between us, and lately, we've been on a school trip together, and we were like always together. But nothing more than talking, and I'm not sure about what I should do. I'm not really the muscular type, more like the nerdy guy, and I really don't know what to do.

tl:dr: I'm a shy nerd, who fell in love w/ another shy nerd, but she's 2 years older, and I really don't know what to do.

113,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years (after a few years of being best friends). We love each other very much and get along great. There is one issue though, I'm not interested in some of his biggest hobbies AT ALL and, after 5 years of being around him more often than not, I'm beginning to get tired of hearing about them. 

His main hobby is cars/motors/basically anything that you can build to ""go fast"". I love how excited he gets when he learns something new or has a big idea about something he'd like to build, so I try to sit and listen. I have tried on my own to learn about the subject, but I cannot get into it (I hate all the math and science behind it, I really have no desire to learn about the mechanics). I don't want to hurt his feelings most times, so I just sit through the torture of him going on and on about things I have no idea about and don't really care to know about.
 
He has plenty of other friends that share his hobby, so it's not like I'm the only person he can talk to about it. I know he's just trying to share something with me that he loves and enjoys, but like I said, it's getting hard to listen to. Any advice? ",29Apr2017,39

I am 17 years old and a senior and I am extremely depressed about how a socially wasted my high school years. And no I'm not just really sad, these thought have been having a toll on my mood almost forever. This always bothered me but last night when I went to this huge party everyone was at I just thought ""damn, I could of done all this stuff and know so many people if I was different"". See all my life I've been shy almost to the point of social anxiety and somewhat bullied. I had few friends and because of it my social skills lacked. But the past couple years it was my goal to completely 180 myself and be a outgoing person that can make friends. And all the hard work payed off and I'm socially confident and can easily make new friends. But I still feel regret and an overwhelming sadness because I wasn't like this when I was younger and cause of it I'm just out of the mix of my whole school. I get this every time I go to a party but just seeing how everyone just knows each other through friends, sports, cousins, etc just makes me feel like shit because I'm just out of that loop. It's like these huge friendships that extend even out of the school and I'm nowhere in that loop because I was shy and didn't participate in any activities as a kid. I have a few friends and a bunch of acquaintances but yeah still out of the loop. 


It's just depressing to think how if I was a little less shy or things went a little different I could be happier. But then there are other factors that I could talk about that would take forever so in short I'm one of those too black for the white kids and too white for the black kids and also too nerdy for the normal kids and too normal for the nerdy kids. So not just was I shy but I was also doomed to have a awful time finding the right niche. And the town I live in is INCREDIBLY diverse almost like it's tv show diverse but there's still that minor racism that every human has and that cultural expectation. So yeah, all that. And some will say well high school friends never last. No one is real friends and you'll all stop talking when you go to college. And yeah it's definitely true but just because the friendships couldn't last doesn't mean you didn't have any good times. Well that's pretty much it.

117,"He is my ""best"" friend for long years now (but i think just because i dont have else...literally i dont have friends) but i starting to feel that this relationship is not that equal. 

We always have to do what he wants and its starting to bothering me. When im at his place always have to watch or listen to those music what he wants. When we at my place its the same too. He says ""im the guest now let me choose."" When finally i can choose music or tv show or i just want to play a game while we talk, he demotes it.

We use to go to a lake shore near us. He always want to go there but me just sometimes because most of the time he gets drunk or i just dont want to go. He wants me to drink too but i dont. That lake is cool i like it but he want to be there for 4-5 or 6 hours but i dont. Im that kind who happy with an hour or two-three maximum but not the whole day. Have other stuffs to do at the weekend or i just want to be alone or do my hobbies and so on. He dont want to go home and forcing me to stay. The bad part is not just the forcing, (cant respect what i want or how long i want to stay or what i want to do with my time) but when i dont want to do what he wants, he starts WHINING! Like ""Ohh pls just one our more i dont want to go"" ""C'mon listen to this oooh Cmon pls"" ""Watch this channel im the quest "" ""Drink with me pls i buy you one, its free to you"" ""i want a little camp fire cmooon you are not going to stink by its smoke i promeeees""and so on. Sometimes i just dont want to do stuffs...

Today i had enough. We talked about we meet. Didnt talked what to do. Of course wanted to go to the shore to burn his face of or cry about the late youth or i dont know, but i just wanted to sit out on a bench and hang around, laugh around, because im not feeling good. but nooope.
He just said ""ehhh never mind, lets meet when you feel good."" 

So he ditched my idea because its not what he wants. We are in our twenties but this is ridicilous that sometimes we cant do what i want, only he matters, his problems and so on. And im the bad one...Ridicilous.

What do you think can i do anything? Sometimes i think about our friendship is not that good and i should search for new ones but i dont have any possibility..

119,"Forgive any incongruencies in how the following is portrayed or laid out. I am in an emotional state.

Woke up from a bad dream. After thinking about it's meaning, I believe that I'm being told my spouse will either continue to be emotionally and physically abusive toward me and our pets or leave us suddenly. I come to you anonymously as I honestly have no one else to discuss such a sensitive matter with. Years ago, she was diagnosed by a Psychiatrist as suffering from Bipolar schizophrenia with mood disorder. I love her dearly and want to continue to be with her, but the abuse has become too much. I know that if she would seek additional professional help, our relationship would benefit greatly. However, we've been together for 6+ years and she's shown that she's happy with where she's at. I'm not interested in being abused any longer, and I'm concerned that if I do ask her to seek treatment it will only create further difficulty in our relationship. I watch her interact with auditory hallucinations and, when I ask her about them, she finds a way to change the subject, eventually becoming angry with me for having done something wrong. It is very bizarre. Loud noises and public places are most likely to trigger her. Once when returning home from getting fast food, I watched her quickly go from calm and docile to angry and throwing her food in and around the car and at me. When I asked her about it as it happened, she went into a state of primal shouting and ran inside the house. After some time, I entered the home to find her angry at me for something that had happened weeks before. Reflecting on the incident, I can pinpoint the loud sounds of construction near the restaurant as the trigger. When I rolled down my window to place our food order, the sounds were unbearably loud. Her demeanor changed, but I was unable to figure out what was going on until we pulled in our driveway. As we exited the car, the behavior occurred. I love my sweetheart and I would like to see her get further professional help so she can be happier and find some relief from the torment she feels. However, I'm not willing to continue to be the focus of her aggression and physical and emotional abuse. I've realized only over the last year since her most recent and traumatic/bloody suicide attempt, how very sick she is. This makes six total suicide attempts that I've found her in the act of committing. For my own mental health, I need some freedom from her behaviors. However, I'm not sure how to get that freedom without causing her to feel left alone and unsafe. The source of her trauma was an abusive childhood. I have met her parents, and I can undoubtedly see that they were capable of the abuses that she describes to me of her childhood. Two years ago, her brother committed suicide because of the torment from the same abuse, which devastated her. As I write this, I'm feeling prompted to offer myself some advice. First, I would benefit from spending more time working on myself, particularly, my personal social life that doesn't include her. Getting out of the house more often on my own will allow her more space to consider how she's feeling and why she's feeling it. Doing so will hopefully encourage a desire for her to seek treatment as she realizes that I am not the source of her pain nor am I her punching bag as a release from it. As I make more of my own friends and establish a more secure network, my own mental health will improve offering me the strength I need to support her while we are still together or to part from her, whichever occurs. On another note, I have found success recently through walking away from her when she becomes abusive. I do it somewhat abruptly, but tactfully so she can sense that her abuse won't be tolerated, and so she can sense that I'm not upset. I simply refuse to be abused. More often than not, after some time to calm herself, I'm later greeted with affection in a somewhat apologetic form. However, I have yet to hear an apology for these abusive acts. This is a new leaf for her and it has given me confidence in that if I set firm boundaries for her, she will respect them. I'm concerned though, because I can sense her abuse degrading my character. My confidence wanes without reason and I struggle with doubt, when before I was sure. I will continue to ponder these things, their effects, and what I should do. The fact is that the abuse has lessened recently because I refuse to be present when it happens. Another issue that remains is that she is very inconsistent with taking her medications. When she does take them, she appears to have the wherewithal to counter her auditory hallucinations with reality based judgements. When she doesn't take them, she is easily triggered, paranoid, angry, and I quickly become the target of release from her internal torment. For example, when off of her meds, she will frequently find fault with something that I have done, usually weeks previous, and confront me about it in an abusive manner. She will also ignore me for days at a time. She will also withold affection, physically and emotionally for weeks at a time. She will also make seriously discouraging remarks about our life together like, she's unhappy with where we live or that she would like to get rid of her cats. In those instances, I have offered to go house hunting with her to find a new place or offer my help in adopting out the cats. However, when she returns to taking her medications, her feelings regarding these things becomes somewhat opposite. She is happy with where we live, and is able to articulate smaller things about our living circumstances that are causing her frustration. For example, she's not interested in dealing with our rude property management company, in which case I am able to offer to be the one who solely works with them. Regarding the cats, she is able to express feelings of being disgusted with the amount of hair that they shed, in which case I offer to get their haircut. The benefit that comes with her regularly taking her medications is very real. However, her difficulty in taking them, and the consequences that follow are also difficult to bear. On the rare occasion that I do find her in a peaceful place and am able to bring up the topic of her mental health, she has expressed fear that I am making up these things in an effort to control her. However, she will admit to the inability to remember some of the events, and even to regular lapses in her memory. I am concerned that this paranoia coupled with her fear will be the cause of her abuse continuing or her leaving. We have been through a lot together, and I love her deeply. I feel a strong loyalty to her and a desire to stay with her through this. However, I am concerned that I may be in too deep or have developed stockholm syndrome to the degree that I am not able to discern what to do.

What are your thoughts?

120,"This great girl is a good friend of mine, and has been for almost a year now. We are currently in our final year of school and she came to my school at the start of last year.

For a few months I never really interacted with her, but then we ended up in the play together. She's quite talkative and she ended up talking to me one time (I'm a bit of a shy outcast), and I found it easy to talk to her which is rare for me.

I started developing minor feelings towards her (but I was chasing another girl so I mostly ignored them) and we got into deeper and deeper topics which it turns out we were both interested in. She confessed to me one day that she left her previous school because she became depressed hated it to the point where she became suicidal, and she needed a change. This hit me hard as she always seemed so happy and talkative, but it appeared that it was just a cover to mask how she really felt. I swore last New Years Eve that this year that I'd help her in any way I possibly can.

Jumping back a bit (early December last year) she got a boyfriend who is nice and I approve of, but from that moment on it felt like something had changed. She became a bit more distant and serious about things. I almost never see her at school because our friend circles are different and we have none of the same classes, so occasionally I'd try to organise a meet-up at lunches just to chat about everything but she wouldn't always turn up or she'd turn up with only a few minutes left. When she did turn up, my nerves took over and I'd lock up and not talk about anything I truely wanted to because it seemed like she was a completely stranger.

She asked me over the Easter break if we wanted to organise a specific time each week to talk about everything. I went along with it because seeing her once a week was better than nothing, but I told her that it didn't really seem like a friendship and she agreed.

She told me that she didn't want to make her boyfriend jealous by seeing me all the time (which I understand completely), and of course she has other friends to see as well. She said it could happen more often if other people were there and it wasn't just us, but that isn't the same and I often get outspoken in a group and never get a chance to say anything. I'm worried that if we don't patch it up now, by the end of the year when we're out of school I'll never see her again and that just isn't something I want to happen.

I just want to have the talks with her that we used to, so what iI came here for was a suggestion of some way that we could chat about things, without her boyfriend being jealous, that doesn't involve other people. Text messages could work, but with the topics of religion or philosophy it's difficult to get the point across.

Now I don't know how this will seem to most of you but all I am is a young guy trying to get myself started in life with proper education, and I'm willing to provide any necessary documents to prove it.

Over half of our income comes into his savings for a new car which is the reason they get in fights frequently but she ends up forgiving him and letting the situation continue each time. 

Due to our financial situation I've been unable to move out, and as I'm still a student I have little to no opportunity to get a job and I've been suffering from depression for years. Mother constantly uses that as a reason to threaten to kick me out and/or send me back to my father so I would ""realize that things could be worse"" (he has terrible anger management issues and is extremely controlling. I guess poor mental health is genetic in our family) and lately it's been getting worse as the fights get physical and her husband insults and attacks me as well. I know that it would be better for all of us to cut each other off and begin new lives for the sake of individual wellbeing. But I have absolutely no idea where to start and how to handle this emotionally. I graduate in a year but I cannot imagine having to spend another year in this rapidly deteriorating family situation. I'm desperate to find a job but it's near impossible to find a place that would pay enough for me to afford living by myself right now (at least where I live). I can't rely on help from my parents since in their eyes I'm the one who owes them for supporting me for so long. I feel awful for being a parasite for twenty years and I'm at a loss, all my life I've been financially dependent and I need advice on how to begin a new life, although I understand it might not be easy.

135,"This is a neighborr of mine, I met him like 2 days ago and he started texting me. The first night we talked he started dirty talking to me and confessed he has this crazy attraction towards me. He's 14 years older than me, he has a girlfriend and is moving in with her today. He tells me he wants to have a friends with benefits situation with me and I'm really interested. We kissed yesterday and he felt me up a little and it was amazing. I have a long distance boyfriend too. 

The problem is I dont know what to think about this guy. I know he's not trustworthy obviously but he's so so hot. We have been very clear with each other. He's not looking for anything other than sex and having fun. He even told me I never text him, he will always text me first to avoid problems.

138,"So I'm a junior I  college right now. I'm pursuing a bachelors in biology and have plans to apply to vet school this summer. I have a 3.7 GPA and have always been a good student. 
However, I'm pretty sure I'm about to fail Organic Chemistry 2. I've never failed a class before. It's not that this class is too hard, just too time consuming. We have all these online quizzes to take every day,  and online homework containing atleast 100 problems that are due every week. We have an exam every other week. Im struggling to support my self through school and work late nights at a veterinary hospital and I just can't keep up with all the busy work.  
My school only offers this class in the spring and the lab and the class combined is 8 credit hours. This means I probably won't end up graduating on time. I've thought about trying to take it over the summer at a community college in town but don't know whether that will make it look worse on my transcript. I'm not sure how bad this situation actually is. Any advice? Should I try to take it over the summer or wait and put off graduation?",29Apr2017,1

We have a carbon monoxide meter about 5 feet from the laundry room and my room is next to the laundry room. My dad thinks I'm being paranoid about wanting to get another CO meter to put in the laundry room because he says that having one in the hallway is sufficient. My concern is that we only have fire alarms in the bedrooms and if there were a leak, my room would be the first affected because it's so close to the laundry room. Should I be concerned or am I overreacting?

148,"So I had a bit of a rough patch recently so I moved in with a friend and his roommate.  Now I know the roomie is a bit of a womanizer, but he's also pretty attractive so I'm like ""eh, whatever, if the guy's lucky then good on him.""

It's been a month.  Out of the past 30 days, he has had a woman over 26 nights.  Out of those 26 nights, there were only 3 women I've seen show up two or three times.  The walls separating our rooms is thin, so I end up overhearing what he's doing and saying, and I'm getting really uncomfortable with what I see and witness on a regular basis.  He's refusing ""no"" as an answer, I hear women saying ""no, stop it, I don't want to, stop"" before eventually giving in.  He pushes alcohol on them when they're over, again not taking no for an answer, like the guy just does NOT care about consent.  

He gets manipulative with them, and having worked and studied in the social field as well as growing up with a manipulative parent, he triggers my intuition towards these things...everything's a game and a power play to this guy.  I feel like I'm living with a rapist and I'm pretty much complicit by not speaking up...at the same time my name isn't on the least since I just moved in.  The amount of women I've heard refusing or getting upset in his room disturbs me; though I can probably attribute that to having been sexually assaulted as a minor.

Not to mention I have barely been able to get a good nights sleep since every night seems to be 4 hours of full force fucking.

I don't know what to do, if or how I should address this, or if I should just be an unrepentant asshole.

Especially the umbrella.  Little memo to umbrella designers: wind and rain tend to go together, and so you probably should design your product so that it doesn't turn inside out when faced with a 15mph gust of wind. 

So does anyone have recommendations of umbrellas and headphones I can buy that are of high-quality and won't need to be replaced three months from now?  I am willing to splurge within reason, especially since the cost will probably probably similar once the costs of replacing the cheap junky version is taken into account.

He has filed for divorce but she is fighting him all the way. It's been 4 month and he is no further forward, spending thousands on lawyers when she gets her financial advice from the Watchtower. 

He's trapped in his house because if he leaves divorce can take up to 5 years, apparently only 2 if you continue to reside together. He was so happy last week because she agreed to put the house on the market. But took it down after 9 days without his permission, since she could in the first 14 days (cooling off period).

She's accusing him of being an alcoholic, having mental issues and he believes she's been trying to incite him to violence so she can claim domestic abuse. She is slandering him all over social media and to anyone who'll listen.

154,"I started working in the steel industry about a month ago. 2 weeks ago we got a new coworker that we can call Linda. Linda is on my team and works along with me sometimes depending on were we are needed. Linda clicked well with a guy I work with that was teaching her her job and on our breaks (not lunch break but short working breaks i.e machine being still) they would often make jokes about sexual nature. Mostly on her initiation.


I noticed after 2 days or so that she seemed not to like me. I remember a comment when I was coming by and she said ""oh there is you again"". To be fair I was also really new and at the time was very nervous about making mistakes so I asked ton of questions that I think bored my colleagues to death. Working now a month and knowing much more I can see how odd I must have come off. we get many new people and no one asked so many questions like me.

I would describe myself as a good worker but since this is a male dominated industry I have a hard time clicking on a personal level to guys in their 40's with kids (lots of them here) so I'm left with a small click of women I can bond with on a more friendship level, if this makes sense. So my days are mostly a bunch of ""hi hi's, everything good you? How was your week? etc etc""

An incident that I think sparked the whole thing was when we were sitting at our lunch table (me and Linda and others).I was eating sugarpeas,grapes and graham kex and Linda was eating her chocolate pudding and banana with a monster energy drink. A male co worker that was about to join saw this just had to point out in a loud way so that everyone in the lunch room could hear ""Look Linda this is how your supposed to eat healthy"" and then proceeded to slam a 2L Coca cola bottle (his) on our table to drink. I found the comment unnecessary but went with my day.

Here starts the problem. After this incident Linda became more hostile to me. The final drop for me was last Friday. You can't not not notice this anymore. At our first break she exclaimed loudly ""you look so tired"" and then she had to do this two more times. I joked that I've got a resting bitch face. The talk at the table went to another topic and then she asked me if I couldn't smile more (??). She turned to a guy and asked him ""what if I said across the room hey [my name] you bitch!"" which put me off guard....At our lunch break she commented how little I eat and had to persuade me after I ate my lunch to take some of the cake a co-worker that was leaving bought (she had). She had to tell me about 3 times to ""go take some of that cake"" when I wasn't interested and made an excuse about waiting for the line to end. She also asked me for my facebook and I said I had deactivated it and she commented ""well now we know [my name] doesn't have any friends"". This all comes of as a joke when she says it.


My last comment on her is that I think she is a very insecure girl. When I observe her objectively she often talks about sex with guys and to me makes these comments about how I look and eat to me and in general hangs little around other women or makes an effort. Like last Friday she told a guy ""Hi, [guys name], take me now!"" and showed me a vine video she is referencing. It was a joke about the guys ethnicity, that his language is sexy, and that his wife wants him to ""take him now"" when he speaks it. She played it to me loudly in the lunch room and told me from now on we should always say this to said guy like an inside joke.


I don't know right now how to tackle this. Most things she says to me come so unexpected. I put harassing in """" because I'm not sure what this is. I can't really avoid her since she is in my team. I can try sitting at another table but everyone will know it is weird of me since there are already ""groups"" (teams sit with teams) and our lunch rooms isn't that big and I can't go anywhere else for breaks. I don't ever or have ever talked sex or relationships to her. And the other stuff like religion, politics etc. I don't want to go after 1 month to the boss to complain since I desperately need this job (I'm on a 6 month contract and if they are satisfied I get the job) and I'm afraid of making any trouble.

tl;dr: My female work colleague is making inappropriate comments about how I look and eat and I don't know how to handle this.",29Apr2017,1
155," Ok, so first of all, I think this is going to be long, so sorry for the format (I'm on Android) and for any grammar errors. Also, throwaway because reasons. 

 So this story starts exactly 1 year ago (Actually, I'm not sure, maybe 1 year and a few months.). Last year was my junior year (I'm from Spain, so here it is called different, but it really doesn't matter). So there I was, an ordinary 17yo nerdy guy with no real friends, making my way through high school. 

 Around October my school told us about a 1-week trip we'd be taking in April (Maybe May?) to London. I signed up with some of my classmates and the months passed. April comes and we go to London. There I make friends with two girls from my school that I didn't really know well, but man, I gotta tell you, these girls were the bomb. Like, I'd think of them as some kind of goddesses (Not because of their body, but because of how they were.). I didn't really know how they would want to be friends with me but they did want to. At that time the three of us were a lot into twitter, so we followed each other. 

 So the trip ends and we go back to school. Then it all started. I remember seeing one of this girls in the hall the first day we were back, and instead of saying hi or something I just looked away, thinking she wouldn't want to be seen with me. Then I proceeded to do this everytime I saw any of them (They were very good friends, so they were together most of the time). Even though I was acting all creepy in school, we would still reply each other's tweets and stuff. 

[Just to clarify, it hurted like hell everytime I ignored them in real life, but it was really difficult for me to even say hello.]

 Two months later schools ends and we start our summer break. All I did that summer was work in the mornings and play videogames until 3-4 a.m. I did not see a single friend in 3 months, because I didn't have any real ones. So one night I was feeling depressed and I texted one of this girls, let's call her Jean. I knew she was not going to reply because it was 3 a.m, but I didn't care, I just wanted to say hello. The next day she replied and we talked like if I were a normal guy and not this loser I really am. We chatted around 6-7 times that summer, and I have to admit that I really liked it. 

 Senior year starts and I remember thinking and thinking over again how I was going to say hi the first day. I couldn't even let a word out. We still texted sometimes, but in real life we were like strangers. So one day we were texting and she just asks me why I behave so weird. I honestly can't remember what i answered, but I'm pretty sure it was some bullshit. 

One day, a friend invites me to his house for his birthday party. I went and do you know who was there? Exactly, Jean (And the other girl, who I was still behaving weird with) . At first it was awkward as fuck, but eventually I got to talk with them. They didn't say anything about my weirdness, but I'm sure they thought about it. The birthday guy asked us if we wanted to watch a movie, and we all (Around 8 people) accepted. I bet you can guess who I sit with. Jean. About half an hour into the movie (it was a horror one), we held hands. Actually, she held my hand, but I'm not going to say I didn't want to. The movie ends, we stop holding hands and we all go home. 

 The next day Jean texts me (She beat me to it) and we start talking. But it was different than before. After that, we started texting every single day as soon as we got home. But in school I was the same idiot as before. I wanted it more than anything, but I promise you I could not have talked with her even if my life depended on it. 

This goes on for months. 

I think she really liked me. Imagine that the boy you have a crush on texts you every single day for months but can't even say word in real life. Fuck, man, I'm an asshole. 

Even though we didn't talk in real life, we shared everything. She knows more about me than anyone else in the world. I think she even knows me better than I do. 

This last month we haven't texted that much. I feel like she doesn't want to talk with me anymore. How could I blame her? 

 One week ago she told me that I remind her of Clay, the protagonist of 13 reasons why. I've seen the series just because of that message. It is the story of how some people made a girl kill herself. Clay, does not do anything bad to her, but Hannah, the girl who kills herself, and him have a relationship and Clay does some stupid stuff (Like not staying with her, even though she told him to leave). I feel like she now hates me for not being there for her. 

 My life is a mess, but the only thing I'm 100% sure of, is that I want to be his friend. I don't care about anything else. I don't really know if I want to be in a relationship with her. I mean, she is so perfect I don't think I deserve being with her. She deserves way better. A man who is actually a man and not a text sending machine. 

I know I haven't asked for specific advice, but anything you can say about this will be of help.

EDIT: Just re-read this. It looks like a 5 year old has written this, so sorry. But the facts that English is not my first language and that I'm depressed are not helping my writing skills. I think you can understand it anyway. 

EDIT 2: Even though no one has replied, I feel like writing this has helped me a lot.

About 2 yrs ago, I reluctantly inherited a small 22ft sail boat from my now deceased father. While I loved him very much, I have to admit that owning it has been a financial hell. The boat itself is a wreck and I, quite frankly, know nothing about boats. Really it's the rental/slip fee of where it's docked at that is killing me. Even after trying to get rid of it via a donation sight, I still couldn't manage to find a recipient.

166,"I'm applying for a paid internship at a non-profit arts organization working with artists that have disabilities. So far, it seems that I am highly likely to get the position offered to me. The first sign was how the initial phone interview was stated in the email to be only ten minutes long but ended up being almost forty minutes long. They immediately asked me to come in for that same week after the interview ended.

When I got to there for the in-person interview, I was first given a walking tour of the place and introduced to some of the artists. I think that the walking tour was what helped solidify their decision a little better, because literally forty minutes of that almost hour and a half interview was spent interacting with the artists. Until then, it'd been the first time that I had interacted with that many adults with disabilities. It helped a lot that my other work experience, especially as a writing tutor at my university's tutoring center, had help train me for a situation like that in a way. Particularly, how to deal with students who are frazzled and ask abrupt questions - think of that times a group of ten different artists who are excited instead.

Another good sign was how instead of asking generic questions like they had initially on the phone, they asked me more specific questions about my previous work experience. Not the usual textbook questions per say but specific ones like ""what is your understanding of graphic design concepts"" or ""what was it like making your current body of work as an artist yourself.""

About an hour after I had concluded the in-person interview, I then got an email asking what my availability is like for the next week. This time, to meet with the non-profit's director. Do companies and organizations usually do these kinds of steps if they are seriously considering you as a candidate? It's so hard to tell since I still felt like I rambled a little during the interview by giving a background of what issues I know happen towards people with disabilities, instead of focusing so much on my actual work experience per say. I really hope this is a good sign. If there are specific tips for cases like this, I would greatly appreciate it.",29Apr2017,3

But this one retarded girl that thinks I want to talk to a freshman when I'm a senior in highschool really ruined my reputation. I was basically the one everyone wanted to be around but this girl, not cool, ugly, a lame, decides to sit by me at lunch. So of course, I embarassed her for it.

Skipping ahead past her it got to the point where I kind of wanted to talk to her, but mostly to mess with her. Her brother in my grade always seemed to tell me to fuck off. But that only made me upset, so I and my friends would torture her, lock her in lockers, call her retarded since she had special classes. We'll eventually one day, she came up ro me afterschool, I was with a lot of people walkinng home and she says, ""I know you hate me but I'm so sorry, I just want to beg you to please stop, I'll never walk your way or look at you, I'll mind my own business.... please, it's hurting really bad..."" I basically cut her off and talked so much shit and joked on her just because we had a crowd... Everyone was laughing and maybe I went too far but this retard actually bursts into tears screaming at the top of her lungs like she's 5 and runs across the street... on a green light... she was then hit by a car and died.

---------------------------------------

After this, everyone hated me. They all called me a bitch, a murderer, her brother literally beat me almost to death at school and got expelled. I literally had blood dripping from my face, my eye was red, my hair was ripped out, and I lost a tooth. But everyone was cheering kill that bitch... I still have bruises and marks on my face and it's been months. After that day though, I decided to be a bitch and basically was okay being hated. To make things worse, I joked about his sister dying. And even laughed about it just to urk people. Teachers start trying to fail me before test even started even though I wasn't even in class saying it. My group of friends became like one girl who only talks to me occasionally everyone else avoids me unless they want to make fun of me too. But eventually her brother's friends started bothering me so I kept laughing about it and tell them to get over their retarded friend.

&gt; **This is where I was raped**

A week ago I was walking home and that group comes bothering me but with her brother. He says you still talk shit about her after what happened? I said who your retard sister? And he punches me so hard I just blacked out. When I woke up I was in a room laid on the floor and he's like, I don't know what to do anymore, you killed my only sister and you still don't care. You make fun of her even after I beat your ass and you think it's funny.

My head was still hurting from being hit so I just watched him go on and on for what felt like an hour of him talking. Finally I just say go ahead then kill me. I'll never be scared of you or your friends, fuck you and your d... well... his... I admit that was harsh but... I expected to die there. 

But no, he grabbed me by the arm jerked me too him saying I want you to suffer for what you did and he starts ripping off my clothes, I try to run to the door and his friends are there blocking it pushing me back in and standing in the doorway watching, after that he just... put me on the bed and... he did that to me. I screamed and screamed but no one heard me... I even finally pushed him off and he pinned me to a wall and kept going. After that he sorry of just lifted me up and pit my back on the wall till he was literally just... going so far in I couldn't even fight back.

When he got off the wall his friend came behind and put it in the other hole... they went on until her brother... just... came inside of me... then his friend turned me around and did also, then the other came in a took turns with me all doing that inside of me... finally they carried me to the shower and like three guys was in there at once with me... eventually they ran extremely hot bath water while they kept going with me in the bathroom and finally when it was full picked me up off my feet and tossed me in it. I have never been in so much pain in my life. I screamed so loud my voice just faded out, I tried getting out so fast I fell back in and hit my head on the side of the tub basically busting it open. I think I slowly started to lose consciousness and one guy pulls me our and tosses me on the floor saying that's enough, I couldn't really move anymore, I just straightened my body out on the floor but no, her brother grabbed a bucket and dumped a few more loads of hot water on my back as I tried to scream in pain. And I just fainted.

Next thing I know, I wake up in the on the sidewalk at night where his sister died and I was in her red stained dress. I literally went crazy then and there and felt as though I was dead, I couldn't walk without falling over like I was drunk, I couldn't mouth any words. I felt like I was crazy. I couldn't even see straight. I just stumbled to my home and never left. I sat in my room rocking in fear for for hours that night.

Today I threw up and keep throwing up so I'm guessing I'm pregnant. Which is pretty obvious... I did tell people, the school, authorities. No one cared, it's as if everyone knows what happened to that girl... They said my body was clean even though I told them that they all came inside of me, but no, they don't want to hear anymore. My red burn marks were ignored and they claimed it as self harm...

It's like karma has ruined my life... I can't go back to school because everyone stares at me like they know. I wake up screaming at nignt because I have nightmares about it...

All I want is advice, talking, anything. Help me please... I'm not... I'm going crazy. I feel like crap, and I can't get help in person. What do I do?",29Apr2017,2
174,"So today I ran into my ex girlfriend of 1.5 years. We just broke up about a month and a half ago. I still have very strong feelings for her and still hurt a lot. So I was picking up some groceries and walking in the parking lot. I saw her in the distance and knew we would end up crossing paths. I had my earbuds in and had only glanced at her for a second, and started looking forward. I avoided making eye contact and avoided seeing her. As I was walking by her, I was looking at my phone changing the song and pretending to be occupied, and I heard her try to get my attention. But then I just kept walking. Why did I do that? I would have loved to have been able to see her, and I want to get back with her? Why did I just completely cut her out like that?",29Apr2017,1

178,"Throwaway account. I'm not sure if this is I have an older cousin who we'll call Joe. I've always had a rocky relationship with Joe. We grew up as neighbors and I thought of him as an older brother figure. Everything changed when I was 12 and Joe was 13. One day, he sexually assaulted me and it completely traumatized me. I told my mother, but because we were ""kids,"" no one felt it was important to dole out any sort of repercussions to Joe or separate our lives in any way. I had to see and live next to the person that took advantage of me for years. Fast forward to now. I obviously resent Joe, and the mere site of him sends me into a panic attack. I don't go to family dinners anymore or to my sister's house (he hangs out there a lot, she doesn't know about what he did to me as it's a big ""family secret""). I recently got diagnosed with MS, and have chronic, severe back pain everyday. I have tried almost every pain reliever out there, but nothing helps me as much as marijuana. I live in an illegal state, but I still smoke/ingest oil fairly often, because without it, I can't stand for more than 5 minutes. Apparently, a few months ago, my sister spilled the beans that I smoke to Joe. Joe is a big smoker/drinker and he's always broke because he's never stayed at a job for more than 3 months in his life. I hardly ever smoke recreationally, and I view my stash as my medicine. Joe takes the fact that I smoke as an invitation to come over to my house and ask me for weed whenever he's out. I live with my parents, so he comes, stays for hours talking to them, waiting to get me alone and ask me if he can have some weed. I always tell him no, but he does this about every three weeks anyways. His showing up unexpectedly always throws me into a panic attack, without fail. I'm genuinely very afraid of being around him. He's had violent tendencies in the past, and even telling him he can't have my weed frightens me. My mom thinks I'm being silly and rude for not coming out of my room to talk to him, and that him assaulting me is ""water under the bridge."" It affects many aspects of my life and self, so to me, it's not something I can just forget about. I see a therapist currently, and she says it's for the best if I don't see him. I'm not sure how to make him stop showing up at my home or how to not see him again without causing a bunch of drama to occur within my family. Any advice?",29Apr2017,5
181,"First of all,i know there's no definitive way of knowing 100% that he's faking, but I'm 90% sure. She is with an extremely manipulative guy and fully believes him, and is completely in the throws of love. It's heartbreaking because I know this can't end well.
He was in remission before they got together. Before her other people started catching on and cut him out of their lives. He never did chemo or radiation or lost any hair/weight. They asked for proof, all he had was legal weed and all the bottles were thrown out, they called bs and now he's with my friend that deserves way better. The cancer came back apparently now, and he's been for numerous biopsies and a spinal tap and it's all been inconclusive. He won't let her come to any appointments. He's on a 'trial drug' now that he only takes at the hospital, and only Monday to Friday. His doctor apparently made a house call while she wasn't home. There is other stuff but that's the jist.
He limps and apparently pukes often but this is all fakeble. The question is how could someone stoop so low? Like I said he's a manipulater and has it pretty good with her. It's driving me mental! We've dropped subtle hints that things are fishy and stuff doesn't add up, but she's hella defensive and is not receptive to any of these questionings (unsurprisingly). BUT everyone but her is suspicious of this guy, he is bad news bears. 
I know people do what they want and that's that, but I really want her to take these rose colored glasses off and get in touch with reality. 
Do I risk a friendship by telling her the truth that everyone is suspecting straight up? I know if the situation was reversed it would be super difficult to hear, but I would want a dear friend to tell me to get out of a tumultuous situation sooner than later.

182,"hey redditors i got this feeling since 18 yrs old.everytime when i woke up i feel anxiety and misery.that not because for my ideology or living style.Here is Turkey, i have to fight every second for get my rights.it's not like ""oh,that's life dont worry"" stuff.Corruption went at it maximum capacity.for example if you haven't got any friend who is member of regime's party,literally you wouldn't win a court even you are %100 right with the solid proofs.
overtaxement being usual.my father has passed away one year ago,me and my mom living together.i am the only child so i should take care my mom as my father.she is 65 years old.

i didn't eat meat since 4 months.when my mom got her salary(she was an teacher)it's %60 goes for home rent.other parts goes for bills.i work as part time in cafe,with that money we finally get some food for live.Pasta has became our main food.

bills rising so fast.because of country's inflation.for example one month you pay 40 dollars for electricity bill,next month it becomes 50 dollars,reason is none.

when you walking up against that unjust, you've got nothing to fight.as i said,courts went full corruption-local authorities doesn't work if you aren't member of main party.

with this struggle, my mother's money in the bank account has literally gone.she has been gathering her money since she become teacher,for short equals of 29 years hard work = erased in 2 years.

again it not because of my or her expensive shopping costs.government has been digging new taxements every day.""energy save taxement,home isolation taxement,if you change your passport it roughly takes 200 dollars""
i have been using my cousin's wear since 3 years.inflation and overtaxation has destroyed us.
and i am trying to find miracle way.i won university entrance exam and i went to istanbul university history faculty.after two years studying, my father just called me back because he was struggling to send money to me.(even i was working part time)

so i dropped out,back to my town - prepared next university entrance exam (took 1 year) and i won my local university's computer engineering.
now i am 23 years old and i am freshman...

when i come to my home, i catch my mom while she look my father's picture on the wall.

i feel she just ashamed of her son.i couldn't be a man as my father.

it didn't end yet.i didn't go to military,for you know it's compulsory in my country.
in next two years i should go to military and must service 12 months.
i am just thinking about that, without me she would be in despair and couldn't live.
what's next,i don't know.i haven't thought suicide in my whole life.nowadays every morning i am thinking me as corpse.so peaceful and silent and i am getting have enjoying it.

i thought other countries.but you know, i couldn't find a country which allowed my mother come with me.
it seems, it won't be end well for us anyway.

Girl friend: OP's girlfriend 
CF: and you're here because?
GF: Dont talk to me like that..

Then lots of arguing from there. My close friend is pretty laid back so she was like Lol this girls insane, OP are you sure you wanna date her..

199,"I have been struggling my whole life. I identify with many symptoms of ADD, but I am not sure if I have it. For my entire life, I have had to live with the daily struggle of procrastination, disorganization, trouble focusing, being distracted easily, having trouble getting school work done on time, and fidgeting. I also have some other struggles that I am forgetting to list. I have always had trouble in school. I can get really good grades if I really tried, but I cannot seem to focus enough to achieve that. I know I have stuff to get done, but I cannot seem to bring myself to complete it. It's either I don't even know where to begin or I will start, but not be able to focus long enough to get work done. I have trouble focusing in class and get distracted by the littlest things. I have trouble sitting down to study extensively for my tests. This is not just at school. Whenever I am told to complete a task at home, I cannot seem to get it done. I realize how much it would benefit me to get this done, but whatever I do, I just cannot bring myself to complete it. This affects me so deeply on a daily basis, and I cannot handle it all anymore. I want to do better in school. I want to get my work done. I just simply cannot unless I am really motivated. When I was younger, I was not involved in many clubs and sports, and had teachers that motivated me to do well through fun classes and easier material, so school was a bit easier for me. I was really motivated to do well, and I can only achieve something when I am motivated. Now, my classes are harder and less fun and I am involved in more extra curricular activities. I am really creative, so drawing and singing are my passion. I sometimes hyper-focus on things I have to get done for my drama club and choir, and have a hard time focusing on my schoolwork. I want to do well in school, but I get discouraged because I cannot focus, and there is no possible way I can focus. I wish I could learn easier and focus better, but I simply cannot. I have trouble staying on a schedule, and need things done a certain way for me to be satisfied. For example, my parents are strict about me completing my homework by 9;30. I have told them that I cannot function like that, and my homework is never completed to the best of my ability because I usually just do it the following morning, but they still make me do this. They do not trust me to get my homework done on my own, so that really stresses me out. I cannot function on a schedule like that. I used to stay up late to complete my homework at the last minute, and it was so much better for me. I actually completed all of my homework! I don't know what to do anymore. I am stuck with this daily struggle, whether it is ADD or not. I amp planning to go and see if I am right and get a diagnosis soon, but I don't want to talk to a doctor for nothing. I think I identify with this disorder because I have most of the symptoms and have struggled with this my whole life. I want to get on track with my work, but all of the ""help"" I've been given has been putting me through more stress! Does this sound like I have ADD? How can I focus more",29Apr2017,2

Upon this discovery they have decided that they will no longer pay for any of my college. They want me to take out loans for all four years (around 105k) with the stipulation that if I am clean they ""might"" pay off my loans. Due to it being so late into the academic year, almost all schools have already closed the admission process and awarded scholarships. Therefore, applying for scholarships or other schools is not a possibility.

To make matters worse, I must give the school a response by May 1st or my scholarship offer will be no longer be valid.

My questions to you all are:

Should I take the scholarship offer or take the opportunity to study at a much better university and take on the burden of student loans?

220,"I saw an ad for a free farm posted online.  I thought it was pretty cool and some of my friends and I applied.  I sent him a handwritten letter (including my return address) and several references as he requested in the ad.  
Several days later he called me and we chatted.  He told me about how he was overwhelmed by responses and pushed to his limit.  He mentioned several women who were manipulating him and had lied to him (one nicknamed Pittbull) and although this was weird I just thought he was an eccentric and harmless old fellow.  
He told me that my application was declined because I was a woman and he had envisioned a man, but that my letter was beautiful and so he had to call me. I did not send him my phone number, only my postal address.  Again this was weird (why had he called me?) but I guess I am more naïve than I thought.  

He read my blog and chatted about things I had posted there (interest in Japanese art, for example, or my upcoming speaking engagement on utopia/dystopia at a conference with Margaret Atwood) and he saw that I do web work.  He emailed me asking how much it would cost to build him a website, drive up google search results, and create an email distribution list.  (I have the email correspondence… important for later.) I made him a standard invoice proposal, and even contacted my subcontractor to pass the sustained google optimization work to her.

I uploaded his basic info he sent me.  It was scattered and a bit nuts, but he was the client and that’s what he wanted.  I explained to him via email in detail how to post his own blog posts, and he kept sending me posts.  I gently refused to post these, that it was time for him to take over his blog himself.  I had made him blog administrator. 

He called me several more times, mentioning that he had thoughts of suicide among other odd things, like that he had newspapers over his windows, a terrified ex-wife who told him she needed to escape him, an out-of-control rat and cat problem, a fiancé waiting for him in Japan, and that he was friends with Marshal McLuhan.  I could see that this free farm thing was probably a call for attention or just help.  I figured he was calling me so much because he was lonely and I felt bad for him, but I was starting to realize he was a bit nuts.  He kept asking me to post his content for him and I refused. 

Surprise, he sent me a creepy email saying he couldn’t work with me anymore because of his strong emotional attachment to me, and how much did he owe me?  I sent him the invoice for work done (since he asked, but I suspected he might not pay) and wished him well, sending him detailed instructions again for how to upload his own blog posts and to please repost the original post by my username in his own name via his own account so my name would not appear on the blog.  

He asked me if in exchange for paying me, he could just mention me on his blog, because the free publicity from his viral “Free Farm” scheme was worth millions of hits. Lol.  I politely declined, and at this point knew I would never get paid.
I was sufficiently creeped out (from the barrage of nutty emails that mentioned personal info from my website) that I had to send him a cease and desist letter to please not contact me again, along with step-by-step screenshot instructions on how to remove my name from the blog (too kind, I know I should have just deleted the blog, but I still felt bad for him). 

That weekend (Easter) he called me over and over, calling me multiple times in the middle of the night.  When I stopped answering his calls he called my friends and family, scaring the crap out of them, threatening me. 

I filed a police report.  They assured me that this man was a local nuisance with no convictions of violent crimes and no access to a vehicle, and since he was all alone he would likely not be able to convince anyone to drive him somewhere to shoot me or some crazy shit.  (Although he says in his online ad that he has a car, so either he lied to the police or he lied on the ad.) 

He called all the references I had included in my original letter including my PhD supervisor, telling them I was a manipulating wench seeking to take over his viral fame and fortune and hijack his website.  He called the president of the college where I teach ranting and raving about me, and the police had to call my boss to explain the situation. (Thank goodness they could all tell he was nuts on the phone.)  

Police told him if he contacts me again it is criminal harassment.  Instead, he has started a new blog (suckered some other naïve person no doubt) and he is talking shit about me online.  WTF do I do about this fella??

TLDR; crazy man I have never met was harassing me directly and is now blogging crazy stuff about me and I have no idea what to do. 

Thanks for listening.  I am so hoping Reddit can give me some advice.  ",29Apr2017,7
221,"I'm just sick and tired about being a virgin...although grant it while i still feel a bit young to lose it (17) I still get a sense of crippling depression...i mean practically ever Tom, Dick, and Harry has lost theirs, everyone seems to either be in love or some sort of relationship. I've been trying to go to gathers and parties for several years, trying various ideas...but nothings working. Meanwhile someone over in the corner grabs three off the bat...

Am I taking this too far? Am I thinking about this too much? I honestly have envy towards these people.

EDIT: THE REASON I TAKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS IS FOR A MALFORMED PART OF MY BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCING DOPAMINE! PERSCRIBED WHEN I WAS 6 YEARS OLD. MY DEPRESSION DID NOT ORIGINATE FROM THIS ISSUE",29Apr2017,1
222,"Ok, here are the facts:

1. I am an eighteen year old high school student who,

2. is attending a major university next August (United States) and 

3. I have zero work experience. 

4. I am financially stable and I am going to school for free. 

5. I live in a single parent household, and my single parent has three dependents (including myself) and I am the only other one who can drive/work. 

6. My parent is retiring and losing a great deal of money in June. 

So, I'm wondering if I should get a retail job over the summer; that way, I'll have at least some work experience and I'll be able to have money if I need it. In the next couple of years I intend to buy my (shitty, cheap) car from my parent and pay insurance for it so it. 

However I also like flexibility and I don't like obligation. I feel like this is my last real summer, and I should spend it kicking back, having fun with my friends before we all move on, enjoying myself, spending time with family, etc. 

So, long story short, should I get the job and start making money, or spend the summer enjoying myself? ",29Apr2017,1
225,"Hello lately or not lately I've always feel like I have big inteligente or that I'm just good at anything I do it's like I can be average good at anything I do, and this has led me to believe that well I'm gifted.

The thing is I've never tried to master anything because I can always be average good at anything I do so I loose interest.
When I talk about being average good I mean that I become average good in less time that the common human does.

So I feel I have and untapped potential and I don't know how to exploit it. Any thoughts ? I feel o really didn't expressed myself but it's something that I struggle with and this also leads me to believe that a lot of my thoughts and ideas stay inside of my head because of my lack of expression abilities.

I think that I have a lot of good ideas but I simply don't know how to transmit them... yes I feel I can be as good as any genius that has walked this earth.

I just feel that I know how things work without having to practice at all that certain skill I just know even before I start and the now how always seems easy to me to find I problem I always have is that I am always jumping steps.

I hope my text makes sense at all

226,"This is by far the weirdest experience in my life. I think he has a crush on me. The bad part is that he's  six years old and he's a boy(I'm a boy). I'm just sitting here like ""Where did he learn this?"" This is creeping me out. I thought it was just a phase but it's not. He's been doing this for a while now and I don't know what to do. I don't want him to get in trouble and I tried scolding him myself but it doesn't work. Any advice? Should I just tell?",29Apr2017,1

But I have never understand why people tell me this  it's like people is expecting big things from me but I don't know what to do whit this weirdness, with this being ""special"". How can I make this being unique weird and special good for me and how can I take advantage from it?",29Apr2017,1
231,"I'm age 20, live in California. Next year I will turn 21. I just lost my grandmother to alcoholism, and I feel conflicted about the situation. 

On one hand, I want to try drinking regardless of there being a history of addiction in my family. But I know that if I do, and I like it, I will be criticized by my mother. 

On the other hand, I'm afraid of becoming an alcoholic. 

What would you do in my situation? Is drinking okay? ",29Apr2017,1
232,"For quite a while I went out with some friends every week regularly to hang out and chill for a while. The last I heard from the ""head"" of the small group was back in February / march to come and hang out. I was going though a rough bit personally back then and I know for a few of the meetups I was a bit ~meh~ 

For some reason I'm getting random thoughts on texting the ""head"" of the small group to see whats up.

Should I? Or should I just leave it? Like I said I haven't gotten a single text nor invitation to come and chill again since back in late Feb / March 1st. {Basically two months}
