0,"I feel like everyone, friends and family always expect me to be the one to call them. Nobody ever calls me just to chat or to see how I'm doing. Nobody. I seriously feel like I just don't matter to anyone. 

And when I do call them they ALWAYS say ""How come you don't call more often?"". Like hello! You could have picked up the phone and called me for once. But nope...

So, I've stopped trying to be the one to call hoping someone else would call me for a change. And now I am super lonely. 

My mom just moved 1000 miles away a month ago. We were kind of close, I went to her house to hang out usually every weekend. We did the holidays together. I cried like she had died when she left. She didn't shed a tear. I haven't talked to her on the phone at all and have only talked to her through texts when I've asked her how she's doing. I haven't sent her a text in 3 days and I've heard nothing from her. 

I just don't understand. I'm a nice person. I help anyone when they need it. But since I've stopped being the person trying to always make connections, I have literally no one to talk to. And I have been going through a ton of depression but no one cares to ever see how I am doing. Mostly no one knows how depressed I am because I am not one to tell everyone my problems. 

I have been suffering from postpartum depression for almost 3 years. I just want to be happy and to know that someone actually cares. But no one does. 

Sorry for the life vomit. I just have no one to talk to at the moment... ",27Nov2017,1
1,"Hello, I'm in need of a bit of advice. I'm 19-21, and during my HS years I hurt a lot (non-sexual and sexual harassment) of people in my HS -- and in the end got kicked out. 

I've been feeling for the past few days, maybe even months (in the back of my head) that I should go and apologize to all of these people. But, I'm afraid that in doing so -- it would do more harm to me and/or them than if I just left it alone. What should I do? Does it even matter anymore?",27Nov2017,2

5,"So this girl in my chem lab at school texted me late last night asking why I was still awake and she told me we had great chemistry(yes, it was a very cheesy joke by her but I loved it lol). She's very cute and I am interested in dating her but she has a bf and has had the same one since I met her a few months back. She was being very flirty with me and even called me ""papi"". We talked for hours before we decided to go to bed and in the morning we continued talking for like 2 hours but then she just stopped responding then she posted something on her instagram about how her bf makes her the happiest person in the world... I'm very confused was she just using me to get attention?",27Nov2017,1
6,"For example, yesterday I was browsing /r/languagelearning and got really mad after reading women complain about how they constantly get guys hitting on them on language exchange apps. Today I was looking at a youtube channel of an attractive woman who has a lot of subscribers, despite her content being good, I still dislike her because I think her gender played a big role in her getting subscribers.

How do I become a normal guy and just stop noticing these things? ",27Nov2017,0
7,"I had been seeing this girl for about 4 months. We were really good together (and still are). Never argued, never had any jealousy issues or anything. Then around a month ago, out of the blue she started acting weird and pulling away from me. She was saying things like she isnt ready for a commitment and things are moving too fast. This made no sense to me so asked her if anything had happened. When i confronted her about it she told me she had cheated on me while on vacation a week before. She didnt want to tell me because she was ashamed and embarassed and didnt want to hurt me.

Now normally this would be a deal breaker for me but the story she told me made me have second thoughts. Basically she was at a club with her friends. She drank way too much and blacked out. She says she doesnt remember anything and completely lost hours of the night. Doesnt remember being seperated from her friends or meeting this guy etc... Just that she ""woke up"" from the blackout at a strangers house with a guy on top of her and she told him to stop and went home. Also apparently a bunch of people were doing xanax at the club which she wouldnt do but i guess its possible it could have been put in her drink (no proof of this though). Obviously its impossible to call this rape because the guy could have been (and probably was) also very drunk but its definitely a far cry from her going out and making a conscious decision to cheat on me.

Now i know what youre thinking, the whole story is BS and shes just trying to soften the blow. But i genuinely think this is how it happened. I can see her struggling with it and how awful and violated she feels. I never got angry with her or berated her but it was very hard on me and still is.

Ive decided I want to give her a second chance. It may be a huge mistake but its my mistake to make and im aware of the consequences. We have still been hanging out for the past month since it happened and it seems like it flipped a switch in her. She is being much more considerate and caring than before. Also she has stopped drinking altogether (unless im with her).

Over the past month its been getting easier for me to deal with it and the thought of it has been bothering me less and less. Then suddenly this weekend i was bombarded with all these feelings of jealousy, depression, anger etc... About it. Completely out of nowhere. So my question to people who have been through this. Does this ever get any easier? I want to be with this girl. She is really awesome and we're great together. Can anyone give me any advice on how to get past this mentally?",27Nov2017,1
9,"Lately, I’ve been extremely anxious and stressed. I am going off to college a year from now.. but I’m scared right now... I know it’s kinda far away from now but it’s all I worry about and I can’t stop worrying..

Also.. This past summer, I got my first job... worked a whole 2 days (7 hours total).. 

The first afternoon of work, I got home and was fine at first but then it got closer to time I needed to go to sleep. Well, my stomach started turning and twisting up inside and it got to where it felt like there was something stuck in my throat when I tried to swallow, or breathe.. I felt sore all over.. I didn’t know what it was .. it never happened before... I just pushed myself through it.. the next morning I felt sick to my stomach and stuff... I didn’t even eat breakfast.. I went into work and they tried telling me I had to work the cash register.. I was like, 
No.
I can’t do that.
(In my mind I didn’t tell them that.)

So I went along with it anyways.. luckily nobody came in to the restaurant for a while, and I ended up going to break and not having to do anything at the register.. 

After break I asked if I could leave earlier than the time they told me I had to work until, because I had to pick my grandma up from the airport.. they said no, so I told them I couldn’t work there anymore and that I was really sorry, but I had to pick her up from the airport since nobody else could.. which was true but not true.. my dad ended up picking her up anyways.. 
I don’t like the way I quit or the fact I even quit in the first place.. but I went home, went swimming with my parents after explaining to my mom that “they fired me” because I “wasn’t quick enough”.. and she was disappointed and frustrated with them but that was it. Anyways , the feeling in my throat, upset stomach, and turning, twisting hurting stomach pains went away after I quit and went home. 

I brought that story up about the job thing , because (I’m really upset and don’t know what to do. If anyone has any ideas then please let me know). But I don’t have a job, and my family isn’t doing so great financially this year... we’re having issues paying some bills and such.. I would’ve been able to help with all of that if I wasn’t such a disappointment and such a failure... I need advice or ideas on what to do... is there anything I can do to earn money online?.. I’ve been using r/beermoney for a while but i am earning
about $25 a week and that’s not enough..


So my questions are : 

Advice on what I can or if I can do anything to earn extra money online.

Do I have anxiety? I know you’re probably not doctors, but am I overreacting or should I get this checked out? I’ve talked to my parents about it briefly, but they say I’m fine. Am I? 

What can I do to keep myself from worrying and stressing so much already over going away to college and being on my own? I think a big part of me worrying so much, is that I’m scared of not being able to get a job and have money to pay for things I need and for college, because of my (anxiety? Maybe?) I’m not sure if it is or not, but whatever you call it that’s making me feel like that around people and when things are new happening or just when I don’t wanna go somewhere or do something. 


I’m sorry I wrote so much.. but this helped greatly just letting this out.. can someone please give me advice? 

If you read all of this, thank you so so much and I’m sorry for talking so much.",27Nov2017,1
10,"My band played a show at a small pub the other night. We were pretty stoked for it, we made a setlist and then we went on, playing for 50ish minutes. The bandmate in question seemed really happy.

The show is... good, not great, it could’ve been better. Thinking back, I noticed something strange about him midway through the set. I couldn’t see much as I was behind the drumkit, but I noticed that he was looking a little unenthusiastic, almost like he was tired or bored.

After the performance, we pack all of the shit up and then move them to our cars. Then out of nowhere, I hear the sound of glass breaking. I walk towards the back entrance and I see 1 of the 9 mini windows on the door has shattered.

I walk in carefully, avoiding the shards, and I notice blood on the floor beside the bathroom door. I walk in and I see him, bursting into tears by a cubicle. I call other people in to help me, as I didn’t know what to do on my own.

After 30 minutes of people consoling him and telling him things will be ok, he asks if he could talk to me in private. That’s when he unloads his true thoughts onto me. He said stuff to me like he’s wanted to kill himself recently, his family aren’t supportive of him and other things.

But then he says one thing that has been stuck in my head for ages: “I think if it wasn’t for you, I’d be dead by now”

It has made me feel all sorts of emotions.. But what do I do? What can I do? I want to make sure he’s ok, but I feel as if by constantly asking him how he is, it will make him irritated of me or it will trigger something in him to make his state of mind worse.

I need some advice, man.",27Nov2017,1
11,"I borrowed ~16,000 dollars in loans from the government to go to college only to preemptively flunk out before it hurts future college endeavors. I’m scared to look my mother in her eyes and face my family and tell them that I failed college and I failed their expectations of me. I don’t know what to do now since I’m still in a 12 month lease in my school’s apartments.

12,"I met this guy on tinder and we had sex. we planned to meet up again on Thursday, but he ghosted me which made me upset. He said incredibly hurtful things which me upset, but how I reacted wasn't even better, maybe worse. He now thinks I'm crazy (it wasn't that bad I just did immature things like taunting him and pranking him with another number which was wrong). I tried apologizing, but all he could say is ""you are crazy"" ""you need help"". No matter how much I say I'm in the wrong, he would keep saying ""you are crazy"" I feel like I should have waited until he cooled down before apologizing, and his response will be different.

I really want to be on ok terms with him, but I feel like we need to do more than texting for him to take it seriously. He is much nicer in person, but I am afraid to call him or he might think I'm being crazy again. I want to wait longer too so he can cool down and be more chill about the situation.

I know this sounds crazy but I want to go to the mall and pretend my uber isn't working and call him for a ride telling him, that I'm stranded in the dark and I need to go home. Maybe he can pick me up and I can find a time to talk about what we did wrong and why.

I know this plan sounds crazy, but I really need closure on this. I did stupid shit like this before and I promised myself to never act upon my emotions again, but I did and I feel ill never forgive myself until I get some closure on this.",27Nov2017,1

15,"Got to know this guy from mutual friends, and we often meet within our group of friends, and we've started to become better and better friends. I first met him when going to a pre-party with him and his girlfriend. They've been together for over a year now. His gf is really lovely and nice too. When we meet in our group we often naturally discuss girls and such, and this guy just nonchalantly says he had sex with a random girl a few weeks ago. He also makes out with other girls when out drinking,flirts with them, and he is even on tinder talking to girls. I asked him if he was in an open relationship or something, but nope. All he says is ""as long as she doesn't find out"". He doesn't seem like he has bad conscience at all and doesn't care. My other friends just kinda laughed at this, and i didn't really say anything, but i think he's an asshole for doing that and it completely changed my opinion on him.

I've met several guys like this before and i'm just surprised at how cool someone seems to be with this, and it also surprises me that the other guys just laughed at this. How can you do that and not feel like shit? I would never be able to do that. No one said anything about that being wrong or anything, it was appearantly very funny, or they didn't want to say something to get involved. Have you ever told on someone for doing something like that before? Is there a secret code to not tell on your bro or something? I'm sure he is bound to be found out soon, it's not a big city and his gf will probably find out sooner or later. Just makes me sad to think that this girl is just being played and knows nothing. I guess this question isn't really about gender as i'm sure this happens with women too, but i just feel like men are a lot more careless about this. Thoughts?",27Nov2017,2
16,"At my high school we have a pretty intense theatre program and I’ve been involved in it since I was a freshman. As a senior I was elected along with five others as an “officer”, we’re like a student council but for just the theatre program. The most important thing we do is plan and execute the 4 scene nights we have every year. 

Being a group of high schoolers, it’s a big mess almost all the time. I’m known as the tech guy so I almost always handle that side of things, and yet they still seem to hold no respect for me as an equal contributor. 

When we actually try to get something done, it’s almost always a mess. Most significantly, I feel as if every simple decision we have to make becomes a huge argument. I’ve tried my best to hold my ground on whatever topic and be polite at the same time but it’s as if everything I say is inherently wrong, and no one but me wants to debate it logically. 

I’ve heard that two of them complain about me to their friends all the time, which only creates more drama in the program. I’ll admit that I’ve probably done things that made them dislike me, but it’s getting absurd at this point. 

I’ve previously attempted to start fixing things by proposing an unofficial “officer bonding” but the two girls that dislike me the most keep ending up “busy”. If that’s not going to work,how can I go about fixing this? I don’t need friends, but I do need a functional group.

17,"Yes, that title is correct. Let me tell you ~~my life story~~ my family's life story.

**&lt;BACKGROUND&gt;**
//Don't read this unless it helps you

Late 60's. My mother is born an only child in our Scandinavian capital to middle eastern immigrants. Her father is an economist, her mother is young, but they both are forced to enter low-paying manual labour. Her mother starts teaching reading to other immigrants, gets picked up by national television, and is soon enough a nationwide journalist. Her father dies when she's 12. Her mother cannot emotionally handle this, and the rest of her upbringing is quite without boundaries. She drops out of senior high at 17 and moves to Spain for a year. Upon returning to our country, she uses her wits to become a successful copywriter for an advertising agency. But something is lacking in her life, she refuses a generous international offer and begins attending an art academy.

Early 70's. My father is born to an stern, unemotional father and a christian mother in Suburbia outside the very same Scandinavian capital. His parents separate and he stays with his father while his big sister goes with his mother. He attends a Natural Sciences programme in High School, all the while secretly developing his passion and skill for rock music. He begins a bachelor's in architecture, but drops out, opting for a course in film studies. After graduating, he begins attending an art academy. All the while, he keeps singing rock music and playing several instruments.

They meet and share a heartfelt love for arts. After a few years, none have still been accepted to art college, but a baby is on the way.

&gt; it me

Y2K. I'm born to a somewhat stormy but always loving family, and soon my little brother is as well. My parents are now service workers, but my mother has had it. She plows through high school mathematics and starts studying architecture. My father actually starts touring with his band, and are an influential factor in Nordic indie rock. As for myself, I'm comparatively logically and musically gifted, but bullied throughout my first years in school. I change schools to a classical-choir-focused one, and become one of the best in my class at singing, performing slightly better than average in theoretical subjects. Though I'm bullied and outcast, the daily singing makes it all bearable. I'm even regularly employed with the children's choir at the royal opera house. My mother graduates from architectural college and jumpstarts her career in her mid 40's, but my father stops playing with the band after their first major album and a few music videos. He instead takes work as a AV technician at corporate conferences. Money never mattered, family and happiness did.

**&lt;/BACKGROUND&gt;**

When it's time for me to pick a high school, I ace my admittance singing tests everywhere. But I've had a late change of voice, using my boy soprano voice for admittance. When faced with starting with a new instrument (my new voice) even two years of vocal coaching places me today as a promising but underdeveloped young singer. Despite that I'm now 18, my voice sound like I'm 15. And with college admissions coming up this spring, I have understood that I'm not going to pass the music college admittance tests. The ""normal"" thing to do instead is to attend a music community college for a few years, and try until I make it. But I don't want to do that. I'm afraid it would be a path of mediocrity, and that frightens me.

This fall, I took the SATs. Somehow, I ranked in the 98th percentile, meaning as long as I pass most of my courses this spring, I'm admitted to any bachelor's programme in Law my country has to offer. I'm a general know-it-all, and being a treasurer and vice chair of a medium-sized youth association has introduced me to the rigid legal language and to budgeting. So far, I'm in love. So I was thinking of fetching a LL.B. while still maintaining my voice, an if after that (at age 23) I still want to become an opera singer (as my dream has been for the last 8 years), I will always have something to fall back upon.

But my parents won't let me. They say that the only regret they have in life is that they never fully devoted themselves to the arts they practiced. They have always been extremely supportive and encouraging in my singing. They would be let down if I gave up my former dreams of singing. 

* How do I know what's right?
* Are they wise or bitter?
* Is this a reverse teenage rebellion that I'm doing?

TL;DR: Liberal arts parents force former dreams of becoming a classical singer upon 18-year old son, who wants to be a lawyer.",27Nov2017,1

19,"So, for starters, I'm a 21 year old guy- who still lives with his parents. I work off and on with my uncle, and I get paid under the table. So, on paper- I am unemployed. However, I am primarily a student at an online college. So, I've been living with my parents. And it has completely destroyed my relationship with everyone in the house. Nobody will say anything, but we all hate each other. More specifically, I hate living with them, and they hate me living here. Primarily my mother. I don't even look at her when we pass in the hallways, and she most certainly will not look at me. We used to have such a great relationship. But now, any conversation we have. Is completely fake, and even then. We only talk when other's are around. I need to leave. 

As for the job, as I said- it's all under the table. I work when I am needed. Sometimes I can make upwards of 2k a month. Other times, I may work a total of 3 hours a week. I really can't afford to take on any other part time work. Even if I tried, my limited availability would make it almost impossible to even get an interview. And if I did get a part time job. I'd have basically no time to actually do anything. Balancing work, and school. I realize it's to be expected of an adult. But is it really common to have maybe an hour of free time spread over the course of a week? That doesn't seem like a way to live...

I'm 26, I've always had a vague idea of where I've wanted to go with life and whenever I've felt down I've always had my partner to look to during the times I felt weak, my rock. 10 years together next march. I wanted to work, get some school under my belt, get a career together and buy a small house and live with them. I've had very small aspirations, and I learned that that's okay, that it's perfectly fine to want a simple life. Well...

My partner told me they don't love me that way anymore. They said that the love they used to feel had changed into a more platonic love, and that they love the friendship side of this and that I'm their best friend. Well see, I can feel that, I love our friendship too, but I wanted so much to have a future with them. So much so that it feels like the ship I was sailing on had stopped dead in its tracks. Meanwhile they just got a new job and are working toward a career, and I'm sitting at home just trying to survive the lonely feelings.

I don't know what to hope for anymore, since our relationship and life together was something I put so much stock into. We've spoken, and have both expressed that we want to still live together, and hang out, but part of me wonders if I'm losing someone who is there for me, and wants to experience life with me. They asked me honestly how I'd feel if they got with another person, and I didn't know how to respond.

Her father, on the other hand is very supportive of her, although her mother doesn't listen to him whatsoever.

I'm behind the pack of career choices in my household, everyone barring my youngest sister has a concise idea of what they want to do. Me? I have my ideas, but they get shot down for various reasons. Animation apparently doesn't pay well, and from what I've seen it's a competitive industry where if you don't get in then you're screwed. There's also the fear of the job not being lucrative enough. I also want to try my hand at being an illustrator, but the same fear arises. Another problem is that no colleges nearby where I live offer either of these, so either I make a long drive or I move. I have to make a career choice by Thursday and apply by Friday.

No fight, no gigantic fallout, just drifted apart. Well this person owes my family a couple hundred dollars, which we thought was a lost cause up until a couple weeks ago. After not speaking for almost a year, they texted me telling me they were gonna pay us back, it was just a matter of barely making ends meet. 

That in itself spoke volumes to me, not to mention the fact that this person still does have a place in my heart. Well through a series of very fortunate events, I’ve come into quite a lot of money lately, and I want to pay my family off for them, but in a way that nobody knows, as I don’t want to step on anyone’s pride. 

I also don’t want it to be too sketchy to where this person is overly suspicious and won’t wanna take the money, i.e. a bunch of cash mailed to them in an unmarked envelope with no context. 

My friends and I discussed a money order in this person’s name, or possibly paying off their rent for one or two months in advance.

57,"Hi Reddit, I really need some advice here, because I feel caught in the middle of a fight.  My brother is with a girl that had a daughter before they met, and she is very badly behaved, throws tantrums, is rough etc.  My wife spoke with my brother almost a year ago, and let him know that she did not want her son around her, because she does not want him to get hurt, or learn bad habits.  He seemed fine with her choice at the time, but my mother is not ok with this, and I don't think that his girlfriend is either.  My mother is constantly babysitting her, so we don't really take our son over there, except for holidays and birthdays, in order to avoid drama and interaction.  Well, today she came over to our house, and she brought the little girl with her.  The first thing my wife said when they ran into my son's room to play, was that we just replaced a toy that was broken the last time she was there, and she went right for it.  My mother told her to be careful, but my wife was not happy about it, because we had just replaced it TODAY.  My wife made a comment asking if they were on their way somewhere or something, and my mother absolutely lost it, and stormed out crying stating that they were leaving, and that she is her grand daughter and we need to accept it, and to call her when they allowed back over.  

Again, we don't want our son around her, she is mean, and has pushed him on the ground in the past and laughed, does NOT share at all, and constantly takes toys away from my son, and even shoved another little girl over at my son's 2nd birthday party.  She has been kicked out of daycares for being bad, and even taking poop out of her diaper and putting it on another child.  On top of that, her mother physically disciplines her, and I don't want my son to see that, because he cries out from concern when seeing an adult hit a child.  She is almost 2 years older than my son, and we just don't want him around it.

My one big dilemma, is that we live in a house that we rent from family, my grandmother is in a nursing home, and we rent it, but my father is the caretaker.  We live in an expensive city, and don't want to be evicted because of this choice we made.  I love my mom and don't want to keep my child away from her, but it seems that my brother and his girlfriend are constantly dropping off their kids at their house, so I don't want my mother to have him at her house, because they might show up.

I'm sorry that this has been so ling winded, but has anyuone ever been in a similar situation?

Edit:  on top of all of this, this will be our only child.  My wife had pre-eclampsia and post-eclampsia, and has been diagnosed with epilepsy this month, and has started taking medication.  What she said may have come off as rude, but she has not been herself, and the doctors said that she will have emotional changes.  She's 3 weeks into those medicine, and has been seizure free since.  My family knows this, and stress actually causes her to be physically ill.",27Nov2017,3

63,"I’m requesting advice for my gf. 

Her family has a lot of shit going on (sick father, drug addicted sibling, family cat is dying, etc). My girlfriend is very distraught over all of this and would like to be updated as to her father’s health, how her sis is doing, etc. However, without fail every time she asks when we can come visit (they live an hour away) or how everyone is, they ignore her. Her mother especially will never answer her calls or texts. 

My gf isn’t over bearing. She probably tries to contact them once or twice a week just to say hello, but her mother and older siblings always ignore her?? The only sibling that even replies to her is her 16 year old sister, who won’t give us an update on her father’s wellbeing. 

This hurts my gf immensely as she just wants to be included in the family and we can’t think of anything she’s done that could cause hurt feelings or resentment. Any advice as to what we should do? She’s asked them why they ignore her and all she gets is “well we have a lot going on”. But it’s been weeks and nothing? Her dad was even on his deathbed a couple months ago and they didn’t tell us until three days later when he (thankfully) pulled through and was brought home. Is that not fucked up??

The job itself though is not the problem. It’s my boss. The best way I could describe him is like an abusive boyfriend. He throws tantrums over things that make him mad in his personal life, and twists them around to make it something I’ve done wrong at work. He comes in, he yells at me, twists my words, makes me feel like anything I feel, say or do is stupid and wrong and threatens my job when it suits him. This is a daily occurrence and it is always a result of something that upset him outside of work, like an argument with his wife, it’s never anything that I have done. 

I didn’t really put any serious thought into quitting though until tonight. He has me at work until midnight doing this and that up at the office, which is fine, but it’s the weekend after Thanksgiving, I’m still technically supposed to be off until tomorrow. There was no schedule posted for next week, so I text him and ask him about it. He then informs me that if I don’t start doing this, that and the other, that he’s closing down my entire department until January.

101,"Hello,
I have a couple of questions, but first the situation.
My girlfriend's family consists of her Mom, Dad, and Brother. They all live together in the same house, and it is a very toxic and dysfunctional environment. One of the main contributions to this is her brother. I believe him to be a narcissist and was wondering what others think just purely out of curiosity. I also would like advice on what my girlfriend and I can do about the situation, so here it is.
   Her brother is 27 years old and has always lived at home. He is a severe drug addict and constantly abuses his parents who are both elderly, his dad also suffers from cerebral palsy as well. He also constantly steals from his parents, even if they have barely enough money to eat. Recently he has had a girlfriend living with her and he beats her regularly as well. He freaks out and lashes out at anyone when any criticism is given and believes all his troubles are are his parents fault. He refuses to take any responsibility and blames everybody else for everything. He has no respect for anyone's boundaries and is just basically extremely selfish. When I first met him, he told me he was a messiah, then another time a shaman. He thinks he is a genius and makes sure to constantly let everyone know. It is impossible to have a conversation with him because he is always trying to one up you. He can't accept anyone knowing more about a subject than he does and cannot handle being wrong. Even slight differences of opinions will make him fly off the handle. He seems to steal just to steal. He verbally bullies his sister (my girlfriend) and criticizes everyone else. He doesn't work or go to school, and has no friends or any type of social life. He has only had a few jobs which his cousin got him, and then lost each of them within about a time period of month. Her parent's house is destroyed because he has broken doors and punched many many holes in the walls. Her Mom gave up cleaning long ago, because he would trash the house immediately after she finished. He is always doing ""experiments"" like trying to make drugs and grow ergot. He has been assaulted many times by people outside their home because he rips these people off and try to do what he does to his family, but to them, and obviously they won't tolerate it. 

His parents are obviously very depressed, so much so that my girlfriend's Mom spends many nights sleeping in her car so as to avoid her Son, yet she is very codependent (another story entirely). 
Her Dad is not very assertive and just kind of puts his head in the sand. They constantly call us complaining and saying they need to do something, but they never do. They are incapable. Her Mom is too codependent to send him to rehab and follow through (they also don't have much money) and her Dad just says it won't work. He kind of denies and avoids dealing with any of it, I'm sure its hard seeing how your own son has turned out. Even though their house is destroyed and being destroyed more and more everyday (its actually a rental, which in some ways makes this worse), they are constantly being abused both verbally, and physically and the myriad of other problems, they just don't seem to have it in them to try and solve the situation. This has been going on for years now and it is breaking apart my gf. We have tried and tried to help and get them to send him to therapy, rehab, or just out of the house, but they are so codependent they won't budge. Here is an example of some complicit behavior, his girlfriend was previously homeless before meeting him, he beats the shit out of her and she runs away. He asks his Mom too look for her and his Mom goes and finds her and then brings her back and she is beaten again and they cycle continues. Anyways, its all madness and one of the most messed up situations I've ever seen and it is killing my gf, who is amazingly well adjusted given their dysfunction. What can we do? What can she do to help them and to help her self? What can I do to help her? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for such a long and rambling post. Thank you!",27Nov2017,1

However, I feel really down about it. The feedback is constant and it feels no matter what I do it will be the wrong way of doing it. I'm beginning to start each task with a feeling of existential dread. 'What's the point? I'll try my best and just get told it's wrong anyway.'

I add her back, unknowingly. They call me a nosy bitch, ask me what the fuck I think I'm doing, and come at me with an onslaught of swears and threats. It was really bad. I unadded her, and I have to say it ruined my day. This girl sent her friend to go and harass me, right as we were talking normally. Why are people so horrible? Why do they hide behind their screens?

this is whats holding her back. 

first off, currently shes a receptionists who gets a lot of freedom, doesnt have anyone breathing down her neck and shes good at what she does. she enjoys talking to people, however their are times where people who come in always want to have a conversation and shes not in the mood. 

 the position, which i believe is in human resources as a secretary/ assistant to a major supervisor. 
she needs to be efficient at excel. she knows the basics but theirs more advanced tools she gonna have to get down. 

her time management is not the greatest either. mostly in the mornings. she always gets into work right on the dot. she tends to get side tracked in the morning.

so besides that, shes afraid the work is gonna be too much for her and that her hew supervisor, whos offering the position and who she gets along with -is gonna be a bitch when it comes to work. however she is sharing the work with another person in the same position. So she wont have to take all the work on. 

a lot of people are telling her to do it. people think she has the ability to. The person offering the job position says she can pick her own salary. but she feels so comfortable as a receptionist ",27Nov2017,1

109,"We had a very messy breakup in February caused by me backing a crazy girlfriend, which led to me being an even crazier ex-girlfriend. He was one of the many people to end up leaving my life. I hit rock bottom in mid-summer, and I'm glad to say that I've gotten my life pretty much back together. I'm on new meds, in a new therapy tailored to my Borderline Personality Disorder. I feel like I've gotten my life in control. 

I had gotten over him pretty much completely by September, but all the sudden in October I started missing him again. I missed him more and more, to the point where I messaged him out of the blue. I sent him essentially a novel about how I've changed and how much I missed him. I wasn't expecting a response, but he responded. He said essentially: I'm glad you're better now, I'll add you on Discord tomorrow (long distance), but I'm going to be cautious with you. I literally cried from joy. I told my best friends while I was crying and everyone was so excited for me, because they know how much he means to me. 

Then he never added me. A couple of days later, I messaged him again asking if everything was ok and he left me on read. I messaged a couple of more times, the latest one or two he didn't even read and they were sent weeks ago. I messaged him more than I should've, and I keep beating myself up for it. 

He's not dead, he literally posted to Reddit today. 

I'm so confused why he would ghost me because in the past when I was crazier and sending him 50 messages in a row about how I wanted to die, he would still send me a message back saying he didn't think we should stay in contact.

I'm so confused. It's so out of character for him to be this cruel if he really is just ghosting me. 

Did I fuck up by sending too many messages after he never added me? Is this some kind of joke that he's playing on me? Is he too mentally unhealthy to talk right now (even though he seems to be fine posting random shit online)? He had severe depression/anxiety issues when we dated, could that be going on? I feel like he would still tell me what's up though. 

I feel like I fucked up and ruined my chance at having my best friend back in my life. I'm so hurt and confused. He seemed excited, or at least happy/willing, to reconnect, I don't get what happened. ",27Nov2017,2

112,"Hey I've been talking with this one girl every weekend and we became friends. After about 5 months we exchanged numbers and talked day in and day out for about 3 days over text. She ended up getting another job along side of her current one. Afterwards she began talking to me much less which is was understandable because she's busy but after a while these responses became very short and to the point so I thought she wasn't interested and decided not reply because I didn't want to annoy her.

Now yesterday she was smiling at me a lot showing obvious signs of interest and went up to my sister and asked her if I was mad and also told my sister that she was interested in me. So after my sister informed me that she wanted to talk to me and then I approached her and we spoke and things went well and by the end of the night she offered to give me a ride home so we could talk.

On the ride home things went great seemingly and we not only talked things out and joked around with each other then talked about our plans Sunday (today) that we made the day we first started texting. She said jokingly you know if you checked my last text you would have seen that I told you we could hangout at 4ish.

I told her that we should definitely hangout Sunday (today) and that I would get movies for us to watch and what not and we flirted back and forth a little. By the time she dropped me off we hugged and I felt like things were really coming along.

Now Sunday (today) is where everything got complicated and spiraled out of control and I'm surprised things made a turn for the worst and I honestly feel awful about it and can't stop thinking that it's my fault. Okay so the entire day I was preparing everything for her centering my day around her coming over basically which proved to be a bad idea. 

So at around 3:30 I started walked over to Mc Donald's to get us food and when I got there realized she had texted me and asked me for my address so I gave it to her and told her she should be at my house by the time I got back. I then made a quick stop to the nearby gas station and got her snacks. When I got close to my house I saw a car drive by that seemed to look very identical to hers.

Afterwards I got a text saying hey you know I actually can't make it because I haven't seen one of my family members in a while and they want to see me. I began to think that the car I saw was her and that she thought I stood her up or something when all I was doing the entire time was trying to make things fun and enjoyable for her.

But then I got annoyed because after we talked in the car and got things situated I told her and even texted her telling her to be open and tell me if there's anything wrong because she's the type that won't specifically tell you what's going on but will make you do literally all guess work which makes things so much worse.

So after telling her this she told me that her and her ex boyfriend contacted each other and wanted to talk thing over which obviously sounded like bs giving such convenient timing and the fact that her other excuse was clearly a lie.

So I pretty much confronted her and told her that I got held up because I was outed a ride and I was bringing us food to eat but after I tried explaining myself she left my snap messages on read.

What do you guys think because I'm trying to get a handle on this I'm kind of pissed of because I practically wasted money on her and she just flaked at the absolute last minute. But hypocritically even if that car was hers and she did show. Shouldn't she have talked to me to see what was up before assuming she was stood up.

I understand women like it when men are punctual especially on dates because it shows they care about them and respect the time there taking out. But she never gave me any specific time and just said 4ish so I thought I would take out an extra few minutes to make sure everything was just right.

My question is at this point, is this potentially relationship worth pursuing or even a friendship?If it is I don't know how I would go about getting her to somehow forgive me even though I don't feel like I'm at fault.

We seem get along well in person but we have such a hard time communicating through text and she's always busy and stressed. She still obviously has feeling toward her ex and quite frankly she doesn't really seem to know what she wants but regardless I do like her. Lastly do you guys think that I'm in the wrong or are to blame because I felt like I gave it all I got in my present situation?",27Nov2017,3

115,"To anyone reading this and willing to give advice i want to say thank you.
 
I feel like i no longer know who i am. From since i was young i never felt good enough. i would always compare myself to others and then regardless of who it is i would feel inferior.
I guess because of this i started changing who i am, but not in the way self improvement / discipline kind of way, E.g (Gym / Meditation / Reading etc.)
 
I would actually start changing my deep down character. If i didn't like someone or something i would force myself to like it. If i didnt feel confident i would fake it. If i felt unhappy i would force myself to be happy. If i was feeling dumb i would force myself to try and feel smart (i usually did this by overthinking things because i thought thats what smart people did - Think) etc etc.
 
I would basically have a mask on all the time and because of that i feel like i lost who i am. i have become so dependant on these masks that without them i get very anxious and stressed out especially when i am around other people.
 
I feel like each mask has its own personality and identity and views the world differently. its gotten to the point where i feel like one mask would like a certain thing and another mask would hate that exact same thing. this varies from food, entertainment, people, hobbies and life goals. Ive spoken to other people about it and have seen around 4 or 5 different councillors but none of them have been particularly helpful. They leave me feeling good for a couple of days but then the same cycle begins where i start thinking about which mask / personality i should put on given the situation i am in.
 
I have been given the advice that i should just ignore or stop thinking about the personalities. Ive tried that but i just end up feeling flat and lousy for the days that i do that.
 
Ive used the mask shifting / personality thing to my advantage as well though. Like there have been times where i was studying and the subject i was studying was very dry and boring to me (Accounting). So i decided to change my mask/ personality to one that i knew enjoyed the subject. And then just like i was pressing a switch i felt like a different person, and now being this new person i was able to look at my study notes and like magic i suddenly understood them and even enjoyed them.
 
Same thing goes with food, sports and even people. I could be having a conversation with someone who i know the current personality / mask doesn't get along with too well, so i would change my personality / mask to someone i know they interact well with. It's so strange and i just end up feeling like i cant connect form a meaningful connection with anyone because our relationship depends more or less on which personality i am in. 
 
And every time i change a mask / personality i feel like a new person. So if i start the day being one personality and for some reason i change around 3 or 4 pm, i would feel like a completely different person from that point onwards. I would feel like that wasn't even me in the beginning of the day because i would no longer be in the same personality / mask. 
 
This has been happening for many years now - around 7ish years. and i feel its getting worse and worse and im getting more confused as time goes on. I am 25 years old now, and this is seriously holding me back
If anyone has any advice on this i would appreciate it tremendously. I haven't been able to find anything else relating to what i am feeling currently and none of my councillors or therapists have been able to either.
Even whilst writing this my personality changed and as a result my writing style changed. So i adjusted the the title because my previous personality liked it but now the current one didn't so i thought i would change it.
Oh god, this is so confusing.

116,"I'm 26 in two days, and this girl I work with is 17, turning 18 in early December (which I'm fairly sure is actually legal in Canada, but even thinking about it makes me feel like a skeeze) who very obviously is into me. 

I'm socially awkward, fairly chubby, my hair is too long, I'm way to old to still wear my lip piercings, I spend all my free time playing video games, I have no higher education and no future prospects, and I've only ever had a relationship once in my entire life. Although, I might have a baby face and sound like a puberty stricken teenager with the sarcasm and innocence that go with it, I still am an adult and I do have adult moralities. 

How do I tell this extremely attractive young girl, who has NO earthly business being interested in a failure of a person like me, that she's better off with someone her own age or waiting a few years until she's ready for a serious relationship. 

I mean, if I were almost anyone else in my position, someone who had a much lower standard for morality, they could easily take advantage of this innocent little girl. They could use her and abuse her and then just toss her aside. What I want to do is instill a sense of self respect in her, let her know that someone as smart and attractive as her doesn't need to lower her standards so much that an adult-child like me can become someone to be infatuated with. Hell, I still laugh at the word penis.

I don’t want to make it seem like she can’t have friends or anything, it’s just a bit annoying. I’ve cheated on her once in the past, and she forgave me, and She’s wicked against cheating so she’d never cheat on me. We have sex just about everyday. We don’t have much in common i feel, which is weird cause i truly love this girl and would be devastated if we broke up. Winter break is coming up soon, and it’s going to take a massive amount of trust to keep things going. Over thanksgiving break she took my hoodie and sprayed my cologne over it before we left which was cute. She’d snapchat me pictures of her wearing it and cuddling with it.

My wallet contains between $20-40 in cash, a credit card, a debit card, a biolife debit card, my student ID, drivers license, insurance info, and I believe that is it. What have I done so far?

1. I retraced my steps from where I last purchased something to where I first noticed the wallet missing.
2. I called the local police department to file a report of it missing.
3. I called Visa to inform them of the lost or stolen card.
4. I called my bank to inform them of the lost or stolen cards. They have already informed me that I will be receiving new cards soon.

If it was stolen, I believe it was stolen at work. I am returning to where I work tomorrow morning to talk to the manager about looking at security footage. I am very confident that I had it in the break room inside my coat pocket (which is one of the worst places I could ever leave it) because this is where I have always kept it while at work.

So, I spent most of my time with three other people. 

-Person One (21F) and I dated a little bit, that didn't end well, but we were talking again and starting to get pretty close as friends. But, we were talking on Discord and I must've said something that tripped her out, and she decided that she needed a break from me because there's too much baggage surrounding us. I wanted to leave that in the past and learn from my mistakes, but that obviously doesn't erase everything. 

-Person Two (19M) was a really good person to hang around last semester, but over the course of this one he's gotten really confrontational with me. He always has to be right, and I guess he's decided that he's better than me. I can't spend time with him without him shitting on what I like and just generally being a jerk to me... To the point where Person Three is uncomfortable hanging with him. 

-I'm still on decent terms with Person Three (23F)... But she's graduating in a few weeks and leaving. 

I don't know... It just sucks that the group I went to dinner with and watched movies with isn't a thing anymore, and I'm not good with people so I have no idea how to make new friends.

I’m at the light and this car is turning beside me and they shine their light in my eyes, turns out it’s the former employee. 

 I know she saw me and knew who I was because I looked back at her and she stops in the middle of the road for a whole minute and then turns into our job where she knows she is not allowed on the premises but we have a new manager who didn’t know that. Anyway, I grab my food and just as I’m leaving I see her leave. I try to go another way to avoid her but no she sees me and drives so close behind me that she basically touches my bumper I try to speed up a bit but it’s No use. I try turning down some roads no one ever really uses to get home and she’s hot on my tail. I’m whipping around corners shaking and trying to get away from her worried she’d follow me home. 

 I call my mom just before I get home and tell her I may need the police because she’s following me home and right as I pull in my driveway she stops for a second and drives by slowly. I’ve never been more scared in my life. Everyone keeps telling me not to be scared of a petty person like that but I feel like I have every right to be! Am I blowing this way out of proportion? Should I go to the police for stalking and harassment?  ",27Nov2017,6

154,"So here is a quick summary of our relationship.

I met up with a few friends one night and we went out and had fun. We posted about it on Instagram and I was tagged in one picture. She is friends with one person I met up with, saw the pic, and started following me. We started talking and we just kept talking everyday. It turns out that we have a lot of mutual friends. It is worth mentioning that at this point in time I was at a low point and was desperately seeking companionship for self validation, I guess. It is also worth mentioning that we are both freshmen in high school so I can't just see her because she goes to a different school. In this low point in life, I started to like her purely because she was talking to me. Apparently she felt the same way. After two weeks of talking, we became a thing. I was ecstatic at first, but then I looked back and realized my mistake. In my desperate attempt to get a girlfriend, I looked over the fact that we have almost nothing in common.

All the conversations we have now just turn into silence followed by, ""so..."" As much as I love her, I do not want to be in a relationship where the only thing we talk about is how much we love each other followed by ""so..."" We also kept this relationship a secret to avoid drama and so that our parents would not find out. The relationship is not sustainable too as she is going to move soon. We talked about what we will do in a breakup situation, but she started crying just because we were talking about it. She really does love me, but I think I have trapped myself in a relationship with a person I don't want to be with. I don't want to break her heart by telling her that I wanna just break up with her, but I don't want to stay in the relationship either. I don't know what to do so I turned here.

Someone please help me.

So first some context.
My friend LOVES drag. Which is totally fine. I support him! I'm glad he's happy.
He also really loves RuPaul's Drag Race. I watched the show, thought it was fun. We talk about it sometimes.

he never stops talking about it. he also is constantly ""practicing"" for drag and it's driving me crazy
whenever he walks, he struts and puffs his chest out. kind of like runway model meets ""amadeus AMADEUS"" vine. It gets 10x more intense when he's listening to music.
He also does this thing where he bops his head to music he listens to. Like, headbanging, but ""fabulous"".

this is one of the most important people in my life and I love him dearly, but his habits drive me crazy. I've talked to him and asked him to stop going
""oh-KRRRRRRR"" and ""croooooo"" or whatever and he stopped, but he just won't stop with the walking and the bopping.

he comes from a very homophobic and controlling household and I can understand that he wants to express himself in a place where he feels safe but I've talked with a few members of our friend circle and it's driving us all crazy.

The problem I'm having is finding passion to do things that I need to do to get a degree or job in business. For example, I have a very good grade in my marketing class, and it is easily the most time consuming and difficult class I have. But in my psychology class, where all I would have to do is read a few pages out of a book and do easy assignments, I have a nearly failing grade. 

I am not sure if this problem delves as deep as I think it does, but I think it has a lot to do with my lack of self care. At certain, stressful times, I will do ANYTHING besides school work that isn't a business class. This has been happening since the beginning of high school. I have found my passion, yet I refuse to do things that I need to do to fulfill my passion. It's almost like the most extreme form of procrastination, I will wait until about a few weeks before the semester ends, and I will kick everything into high gear.

So I’m pregnant. I am 27, I work nights as a nurse (hence an erratic sleep schedule and bad pill taking). I make a decent income. My boyfriend just graduated from a masters program but is currently unemployed as he searches for job. He wants me to get an abortion. Which I understand, but I just don’t think I want to. This wasn’t planned but I want to keep it.

I just can’t figure out if it’s possible. Assuming my boyfriend isn’t around; I’m not going to guilt him into sticking around. I don’t have any family in the area. I don’t see how I could work my job and have some form of childcare and still make ends meet. I do have several very close friends who are incredibly supportive in whatever decision I choose.

I just feel trapped. I feel like I have to get an abortion. I know the other choice is adoption but I don’t know if I could do that.

176,"Grab some popcorn because this story is a movie. A confusing, sad, movie.

So, I lost my virginity to a guy I wasn’t dating on July this year and at first the agreement was that it wasn’t anything ‘serious’ but that we were going to ride the wave and see where things go. He was (and is) known for being a hit with the ladies and at first, I had no feelings for him or any intention of catching feelings. We had been talking everyday for about 3 months and we were having sex like.. twice a week during that time as well. As things progressed, I realized that I started to develop feelings for him and I had told him before we had sex that I wasn’t the kind of girl that was just going be a doormat and we were exclusive just with each other but there were no labels. I gave him so many opportunities to end things if he wasn’t on the same page as me to avoid being hurt and he knew that I was into him. I even asked him if he has feelings for me and if we were just ‘bites’. He explicitly told me that we were more than just bites and that he liked me too. So we continued being an unlabeled situantionship and carried on sleeping with each other and he told me he wasn’t sleeping with anyone else but me and I believed him because there was no time between us being together and talking all the time and him studying with his friends to be seeing anyone else. He even showed me his phone chats voluntarily to prove that he wasn’t trying to be with anyone else. Things started getting weird though ‘cause he was replying to my texts late but he’d be active on twitter and he told me he intended to take me out but I only ever saw him when I went to his place to hang out and have sex. I understood that there wasn’t really any time for us to go out because at the time that we became ‘more than just bites, we were in the middle of exam time. In the midst of him being weird and not treating me like someone who ‘liked’ me would, I got fed up and slept with one of his really good friends. He asked me about it and he said, “I’m not angry but don’t do something you wouldn’t want to be done to you”. I agreed and things continued as normal but he still wasn’t being what I wanted him to be. He said he was just trying to ‘take it slow’ but he wasn’t treating me the way I wanted to be treated. I slept with his friend again and I didn’t tell him this time. I also went out one night and kissed 3 other guys when he told me to ‘live my best life’ because I don’t owe him anything. By the time exams ended, I went back home and we were in two different cities with no way of seeing each other. The day I left, he stopped texting me and only spoke to me once a day and was being really shady. I realized later on that he found out about his friend (and the other guy I’d been talking to while we were a thing) but I was oblivious to it at the time and one day, I snapped and we got into an argument about the way he was treating me. He ended things with me that night and his message was as follows,

Hey 👋🏽

I thought about it the whole day and you're right. I haven't been treating you right. I think I really liked you and been trying to convince myself that I don't because of my own reasons but that's unfit on you because now you become collateral damage. That's me being honest. There's two extremes: trying to make shit work and not trying to. I have been comfortable in the grey area in between. I thought you were too. I also mized all signs that you weren't because of the pretense that we had agreed on the terms of what was going on. Which was selfish too. So yeah, upon introspection I understand why you're hacked. 

With that being said, I would love to say that I understand why you're hacked and now that I've actually accepted that I actually like you, I will do better but I'd rather not put you through that. All I ask is that you don't be hacked or anything like that because you're genuinely a fun intelligent quirky person and I enjoy that 🤷🏽‍♂️ I wouldn't want shit to go south 

I was really confused by what he was trying to say so he sent me a follow up message and his response was 

I think it's better we take a step in a different direction ito what's happening between us as clearly this path hasn't been a smooth one ☝🏽. That doesn't mean cut all ties but relax just to get our bearings right 🙏🏽



I told him that he’s the one that had bearing to gather because I knew what I wanted so I told him that we should just end this entirely (I ddidnt meant it though)


Things ended there but a few days later he continued to text me telling me he got a nose ring and again telling me that he was watching the powderpuff girls and he thought of me then the conversation ended. We never spoke again.

For someone who acted like he didn’t care about me or someone that doesnt have feelings for me, I was really hurt that he ended things so I started subtweeting him on twitter about how hurt I was and he would subtweet me back about how he doesnt care or just say hurtful things. We carried on on bad terms for about 3 months until I messaged him and apologized and asked him to come over to my place so we could clear things up and I could get my closure as to how he was feeling and why he did what he did. He said he’d come that night so I could ready and waited all night only for him to stand me up for a night out with his friends (including the guy I slept with). I was really confused as to why he wouldn’t come see me. The next day, he tweeted about how ‘his head and his heart were in two different places’. We’ve seen each other out since then and we haven’t spoken a word since that conversation 2 months ago. We don’t even greet each other. I still have really strong feelings for him but he doesnt acknowledge my existence and hasn’t even tried to reach out to me. It’s like he completely got over me and moved on. I spoke to his friends about it who said that he told them, “we were never anything serious” and, “did you really think he was going to date you?”

I don’t know what to make of this anymore and its so much harder because I still really have strong feelings for him but his close friends have all been hitting on me lately almost as tough he gave them the go ahead to shoot their shot ‘cause he doesnt and never did have feelings for me.

Is it possible that he just wanted sex from me and thats it and when things started getting deep, he ended it because that isn’t what he wanted for me because he never liked me?

What is he thinking? Whats his point of view. I’m done trying but I still really really like him because after all, he was the guy I lost my virginity to and he means a lot to me.

Please help :(

181,"Hello everybody, I’ve been contemplating where to put this post for quite some time and have decided to seek out the folk on r/advice for some help on a very serious matter (Warning, this will be a very long post but please stay with me).

My problem concerns something I’ve come across on YouTube entirely on accident. So after trying to do my own personal version of Cow Chop’s (a YouTube Channel) Wrong Side of YouTube (a show on their channel where they type random things and watch weird videos) I found a series of videos that have links in the description to Child pornography.

The titles are typically in Spanish and seem to get deleted after an hour only to be replaced by another almost immediately after being removed. The video itself is usually a meme of some sort on loop or something, but the link in the description leads you to a site that then leads you to a site where you can download a rar file with a designated number (the one I came across was 31, I don’t know how many there are). The file itself can only be accessed with a password, which the video itself provides. When I first downloaded the file I had no fucking clue what the hell I was going to see, and what I saw was fucking horrible to say the least. I will not describe what I saw but as someone with a little sister it made me gag and shake with anger and emotions I can’t describe. I deleted the file, and reported the video immediately via YouTubes reporting system. 

After a few days, I checked back to see if the video was gone. While the video that I had accessed was gone, another with a slightly different title appeared with links in the description. I again, reported the video. I checked back again the next hour but once again another video was in it’s place. I was growing more and more frustrated due to my lack of understanding as to how something like this could be on one of the most visited website on the internet. I then made a few complaints to a few sites that claim to get rid of child pornography, and provided the links to the videos themselves and explained what was happening, to no avail. The problem is still going on right now.

182,"In August, I began my freshman year at the University of Alabama. My hometown is about a thousand miles away and I chose Alabama because everyone told me it would be cool. After a few months here, I'm not loving it. I come from a suburb of a big metro area, and I miss living near a city. I used to do a lot in the city and now I feel a little trapped. Also, this school is really run by the Greek life. I'm a guy and I am not in a fraternity, which makes it hard to fit in socially. I thought about joining one, but the cost and time commitment is too much for me to handle. 
A lot of my friends went to a state school that is nearby my hometown, but on a similar level as the University of Alabama where I am. They all seem to love it, so I applied to transfer for the Spring 2018 semester and was accepted. Even though I got in, I am not sure I want to go there. I just went back for Thanksgiving and spent some time there and was reminded of why I initially wanted to leave. A lot of my friends are still in their groups from high school and I am not sure I want that. This might sound dumb, but it is kind of fun to brag to people that I go to the University of Alabama to people in my home in the midwest. Something about the football and aspect of a big southern school is cool to people from elsewhere. When I went home for thanksgiving, I flew from a nearby airport and I couldn't help but to feel cool and important just because I was flying home from college when most of my friends go to college a short drive from our hometown. 
Something worth noting is that I'm in a program here at the University of Alabama that is a little bit too challenging for me, and I am not sure about how successful I would be with it.

I then saw him recently and he looked straight past me like I didn’t exist and I just thought that maybe he held a grudge that I didn’t reply, but I was cool with that.

THEN today as I was leaving work I looked up and was shocked to see he was standing in front of me. He said he had been waiting for me to finish work so he could apologise for his previous messages and ask me on a date in person.
I was so taken aback that I didn’t really give him a reply and said I was late for sport.
I only work 2 days a week, and I work at three different locations over those days so I have no idea how he knew I was there. I’ve asked all my friends and they have said they haven’t told him.
Half of me thinks this is so creepy, and that he should have received the message long ago that I’m not interested, but the other half is saying to give him one chance and one date to either make him go away or potentially see what he’s like.

I am indeed quite the introvert and socially anxious but I'm trying my best to improve. I nowadays push myself to talk to others. When I speak to my parents, they say I'm a poor handler of situations and ""you don't think for your age.""

223,"I'm in a very stressful situation with my girlfriend (40F) and myself (32M). We have been together for 6 years and she's been living in my home for 5 of those years and things have gotten worse as the years go by. She's a very loving and sweet person, always there when you need her, etc. The downside of being with her is that she is pretty irresponsible, doesn't hold a job and doesn't contribute. Even though that stuff sucks, being that I love her I've stayed with her regardless. 
Where things get rocky is that her and I have pretty much turned into alcoholics. For me, I'm the type to get goofy and pretty much chill out and do things around the house, For her, she tends to drink much more and much more frequent and picks fights and gets very mean. It's gotten bad enough where I called the police to just talk to her and calm her down and maybe give her a wakeup call and she wound up going to jail for domestic violence since she was yelling at me and threatening me while the cop was trying to speak with her. Then a few months later the same things happened again. 

My legal concern is that she's been occasionally telling her friends and family that I've abused her and although that is 100% false and I would never do such a thing, it looks like she does! Here's a couple examples of what I'm talking about. Last night she was pretty drunk and although I had been drinking, I was not. She was laying on the floor and saying horrible things, even about my dad (who passed away a few weeks ago). I'm walking forward, chewing her out back and with the living room jumbled around from cleaning, I tripped and my knee landed in her chest, which was a total accident and I would never hurt her in a million years on purpose, It was also a bit embarrasing considering that I was pissed off and not trying to make myself look like an idiot. I can be a klutz. What makes it worse is that stupid things like this have happened before. As as example, once we were in our kitchen and with a new pup being rowdy, she was annoyed and kicked him a bit, not too bad but I reacted by pulling the dog back/shielding him with one hand and pushing her back with the other to stop this. As my luck would have it, I accidentally pushed he back into a corner of the counter top (only about a foot from where she was) and she got a bad bruise and hurt her ribs. I didn't even push her very hard but being that she was stumbly and drunk..., Again, completely by accident but it looks bad. I felt horrible regardless.

When she's been drunk and fighting with me and left the house, she goes around telling her family and friends, even on Facebook that I'm abusing her and then when she sobers up she'll back track a bit but when she's drunk again, she'll pull that card again. As as result of this, I've had some of these people threaten me and they don't believe me, of course. I don't blame them entirely because if I was this woman-beating asshole that they think I am  I'd deserve it. So now, among all of the other stressors in my life I'm afraid that either the police are going to show up or somebody is going to jump me. 

To top off all of this, I know that I'm being an idiot for staying with her and I'm trying to build up the courage to end it but it's so hard! This is a life-altering decision and if I do it I'll be alone with no close friends of family anywhere near me.",27Nov2017,1
225,"My SO's dad accidentally took my wallet this morning (before his flight), and I was slightly annoyed, obviously. And when I made a joke that he'd probably ship it back to the wrong address, she got upset with me, started verbally attacking/getting defensive, and basically shut down, calling me annoying and blowing this into a big conflict. She also said I needed to text them back that it was okay because he felt bad, as if that was the most important priority at the time. I was just waking up and obviously like, ""I'm going back to sleep, not texting him everything is fine.""

She was just pissed I didn't react the way she wanted, I believe. And I suggested she was projecting her own frustration with her dad's mistake. 

Anyway, this happens a lot. If I receive bad news from her, I'm supposed to brush it off immediately or react in the way she wants. How do you illustrate to someone that you're allowed your own reaction, and they don't have to police it, take it personally, or suggest I was reacting like it was ""the end of the world?""",27Nov2017,2

229,"Hi there, first time here actually, but wanted to ask some advice on my current situation. 

I've been struck with what some might call ""bad luck"" for the past months, death of multiple family members, had to change house due to a situation with our landlord (he had illegal people on the roof, there was police involved and was incredibly stressful), mine and my girlfriend economy went really bad because of health issues, there was some issues in our job and as a passionate artist I'm not achieving my goals and have less and less time to paint nowadays.

This has been going for the past 6 months, and it's been one after another without a single good thing happening, as a couple we're hanging on together but I notice that me and my girlfriend are both suffering psychological effects due to the ongoing situations. 

My girlfriend is less logical than me, so she's kinda down wondering what she's done wrong most of the time. I also know that there are good things happening, but those are small compared to the big unfortunate events, getting a cat is great, but 6 close persons dying in less than 3 months, 1 of them which was a suicide on the roof of the place we work in (we work together as well) is really not ""usual"", this leads to negative bias and attributing the root cause to sheer ""luck"".

All of this lead me here asking for advice on how to deal with this?  Logically this should get better eventually, but at the moment I don't feel that, how would one overcome that feeling of hopelessness?

Thanks in advance! ",27Nov2017,8
230,"Hello All, 

My family is extremely close and loving. Just last week, there was an ongoing family emergency involving my father and uncle. It required swift action to be taken from my mother, older sibling and other family. The minute I was available, my husband and I traveled to be with them. I was there for two days. I felt that there was nothing for me to do but wait and be upset with them. I did my best, but all the ""jobs"" and actions that could help were already being done. I tried to remind my family to eat and sleep and to be there for their emotional needs. After two days, I decided to go with my husband to his family's thanksgiving that we had already committed to. Honestly, I was relieved to be away from so much stress and pain. While I was gone I texted and called my family to make sure they were okay. Now, multiple members of my family (older sister and mother) have reached out to me to tell me they are hurt and upset at my absence and feel that I wasn't there for them. I don't know what to do. I am hurt and upset knowing they feel that way about me. I am also angry because I don't see the point of making myself and my husband miserable for three more days so I could ""be there"" and watch everyone be more stressed out and miserable than I am. Like I said, I have no idea what to do or say. I love them all dearly.  I am deeply upset about my father too but I guess I am not processing it like they are. I am also embarrassed that people may think I am a shitty family member (and frustrated-- I'm not willing to do things just so I look a certain way to other people.) I'm open to objective third party perspectives and advice. I want to tell my family that I love them and am deeply affected also but I don't see the expressing that in certain ways. 

P.S. The situation is still ongoing but we have reached a ""waiting period"" with it. 

EDIT: I legally cannot go into specifics. Here is my best shot. My Dad and Uncle were traveling far away from home. With no warning (and no ability to prepare) they are suddenly stuck there. There is a significant risk that very bad things will happen to them there. There was a crisis period of 1-3 days where my family at home did everything they could to a) make sure they were safe and set up for safety and b) try to get them home ASAP. Now my family has little option left but to wait around for who knows how long and hope b) gets accomplished in a timely manner. ",27Nov2017,2

I'm trying to decide between finishing college and joining the Military (Air Force) 

Pros for college: getting the degree which will boost my military career 
Cons for college: adding 10k in debt possibly more if I get below a B in any of my remaining classes (21 hours) 

Pros for military: stable source of income, get started on my future career now, can pay for me finishing 
Cons for military: pay is bad, easier to climb ranks if I have a degree

232,"I am 22M and my girlfriend has been messaging a guy from her work since mid October. I saw a message notification pop up on her phone from him on Instagram, no big deal. But I unlocked her phone to find messages from mid to late October. Very flirtatious on both sides, sending pictures (Insta now has a Snapchat-like pic messenger so I don’t know exactly what they were) followed by “Thanks for the pic” and a string of winking emojis. Never once mentioning my name or that she had a boyfriend at all. 

I told her that I’d seen what they were sending and was not okay with it. I have been cheated on before and seen the signs. She cried and said that she makes mistakes but didn’t really seem remorseful. Things are going better now but I’ve caught her lying to me more than a few times about still talking to this guy. 

They now use Snapchat as a platform, after she told me she stopped talking to him. As of yesterday he has a red heart indicating they’ve been each other’s best friends for over two weeks, and a streak (snapping/messaging each other for consecutive days) of 6 days. She has also turned off notifications of Snapchat on her phone and always keeps it turned over or turned off, making sure to keep it out of reach and won’t let me even touch it which never happened before.

Whenever I bring it up she gets stern and says “Listen we’ve talked about it and I don’t want to start an argument, I know it gets you upset.” And continues to lie to me stating that she does not respond when that guy or others message her. 

Do you think she has moved on already? She’s never really been single, jumping from one relationship to the next. Am I just the next Segway? She says she loves me and I continue to give her my all unconditionally. 

I don’t know if I should end things because she keeps lying to me, or if I’m over reacting/being obsessive. 

I really have put my all into this relationship, my before mentioned  cheating relationship messed me up and I took a two year break to date and figure myself out. I though she’d finally be the one.

Any advice would be great. 
Thank you for letting me vent a little about this too.


***UPDATE***

Thank you all for the comments and advice. You gave me the courage to do the deed. As of 9:15 we are no longer together. I feel just a tad devastated right now, but I’ve been through this before.

234,"I know I am already in a bad place.

College isn't helping, it's the main contributor.
I hate it.
I have exams in a week and all I can think of is how happy I would be to fuck off and not come back.

I'm half way through, and every piece of advice I get online is telling me to keep going, to finish it out.

That is 100% the best advice, because the other alternative is to drop out and have wasted a year and a half never mind the money it's cost me so far.

I'm miserable, I have been for a long time, i hoped that getting out of school would change that, but I am 20 and I'm worse of.

It's not just the course, I'm studying business.

I have no friends, I spent the entirety of first year with a group of 'friends' we went out to clubs, and spent most of the year drunk.
They've abandoned me for the most part. 
I was never really a part of the group but they other guys who were in the same situation as me are still apart of the group, they get invited to house parties, they go to pubs, they arrange holidays together.

I live with 2 guys who are friends from home, and while are good guys, we have nothing in common, I moved in late, didn't chose to live with them.
We have no common interests.

I've got no friends,
No interest in college, 
No interest in live.

The only reason I'm not dead is because I don't see myself playing out like this, I want to be able to look back and say 'that was the lowest point of my life, thank god I am no longer there.
But I am here.

I am interested in fashion and music, that's what I spend 90% of my time at. 

I cannot transfer course (I'm from Ireland, different system.) My only option is to drop out and reapply as a first year.
I will have to move to Dublin, I will have to develop a portfolio before February if that's even possible, to study fashion.
I also cannot afford it, my parents won't fund it, I wouldn't expect them to given I've wasted so much time and money.

I've just lost all interest, and I've just got Post Malone on repeat because I'm going to break down otherwise.
I can't talk to my parents, they just see me as being grumpy, being a general cunt, someone who's just bitter about life, a waster.",27Nov2017,2

239,"Hello Everyone, 

I hope we all had a great thanksgiving. I spent the holiday with some family and my sister attended whom I haven't spoken to in 8 years. She wants to apologize and reconnect. I am not sure how to proceed. Let me explain how we got to this point. 

We had a pretty terrible mother. There's no way to sugar coat that. She abandoned each of us multiple times, had very poor taste in men, and always tended to prioritize those shitty men over her children. When I was still a toddler, she dropped me off at my aunt and uncles house on the other side of the county and never came back. She had just divorced my father and couldn't handle the responsibility of raising a child alone at 23. I was legally adopted by my aunt and uncle and had a turbulent at times but relatively normal upbringing. I still knew my mother and would see her on holidays and birthdays and other rare occasions. She remarried several times and had other children. The 10 year age difference and the distances between us growing made it so that we were never that close growing up. 

Fast forward to adulthood and I moved across the country to try and be closer to my mother, my 2 sisters and the rest of my family here. My mother and her husband had gotten divorced and my mother had left them with their father and moved. They were getting visitation every couple months so I would see them only occasionally. My mother had remarried again (5th time's the charm) and seemed to have gotten her life together. She had a well paying job. Bought a house and seemed very happy. One night while she was making dinner she gave me a speech about how guilty she felt about leaving me when I was a child and all the things I had to deal with because of it. She wanted me to know that if anything were to happen to her that she had made sure that I was going to be taken care of. I was 23 at the time of this conversation and she was not yet 45. I did not give much thought to this conversation since I didn't think it was something I was going to have to worry about for another 30 years. Two years later she died in a car accident. 

Since my two sisters were both minors and still in high school, I became executor of the estate. I had no clue what I was doing but I jumped in and did what I had to do. Everything was a challenge, even small things down to just calling to get their daily newspaper subscription cancelled. We discovered that she and her husband had life insurance policies that named each other as the beneficiaries. Since they both died in the same accident at the same time, the estate went into probate. There were two life insurance policies for a million each, the house, several cars, savings accounts, retirement accounts, etc. We started to understand that this was going to become a complicated situation so I made an agreement with my sisters. No matter what the outcome was, we would split every thing 3 ways.  While the probate process was going on, my sisters were able to hire an attorney and named themselves as sole beneficiaries. They argued that since I had been adopted as a child, that had severed all legal ties that I had to my mother. The judge accepted it and all money went to them, minus probate fees and taxes. There was still a year or so after this decision was made before probate closed. I expressed my concern over this to my sisters but their stance was that the agreement was still in place. I had nothing to worry about and when the money was in their possession I would be getting my third. 

As obvious as it is to any outside observer, the inevitable happened. They received their checks and no money ever came my way. I was livid to say the least. They argued that if the money was actually mine then I would have had it already. They had the support of other members of the family as well. After an argument about it one holiday I told them both that I never want to speak to either of them again. This was eight years ago. 

Fast forward to Thanksgiving of this year. My sister was going to be present this year and sent me a very lengthy text with a clumsy apology. She wanted to clear the air before we had to share a holiday together. At Thanksgiving, she said she made some very bad choices because of the grief that she was dealing with. She apologized and wants to move on. She has plans to move to the city I am in and wants to reconnect with me and my child. I have not really given her an answer since I was pretty intoxicated most of Thanksgiving. 

Am I wrong for still being angry? I tried to put some of that aside and just talk to her like a normal sibling but she kept talking about all the travelling she's done. She spent a lot of time in Greece and Spain and other places. Meanwhile I've done nothing but work the past 8 years and have barely been able to keep my head above water. Not only that but this money to me was my mothers way of taking care me of me in death when she never could in life. It was a monumental and emotional betrayal when this was taken from me. 

How would you handle this?

So yesterday, I had a reunion with some of my elementary school friends and it reinforced what I said above. I literally have nothing. When I look at my friends, they have careers, jobs, friends, lives and significant others.

I never had a boyfriend - let alone anyone who complements me or even asked me out.

246,So this happened yesterday. I had an ad up for a Marshall amp listed at $1000. Guy comes to check it out and after about 30 minutes of seeing if he wants to buy he says he only has $800 cash on him. I agree and he takes it home. 8 hours later he emails me saying the amp isn’t performing the way he wants it to. Claiming it sounds buzzy and the tone changes randomly with out touching the knobs. I have owned the amp for around 2 years and I’ve had zero problems with it. He wants to give the amp back and take his money back also. I am a little concerned that he didn’t know what he was doing and may have damaged the amp. Would I be wrong to tell him I can’t accept a return? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

247,"So for the sake of story we'll call him Vin. Vin has been working at the job for a couple months now and is usually pretty regular, even funny at times. 
Then a few days ago I noticed him talking to another female coworker of mine and he was rough as shit yanking on her arm and making fun of her makeup. She was laughing it off but shes also much smaller than him and from where I was standing it looked like it hurt. His friend was also there but Vin was the main one shoving on the girls but we're all adults here so I expected the girls would say something if they had a problem. This night he also dropped me off after work and we didnt have an issue.

However, although I am a girl, I am also bigger than him so that could be why we have never had that sort of issue. In fact, embarrassingly enough I've made my own jokes about fighting him have even shoved him once but it was all in good fun.

Now, fast forward to a party we were at last night. A different female coworker clomplained to me about Vin being a dick and heckling her. When I tried to talk to him at all last night he got very offensive but I figured it was him just trying to get it on with the girl he came with. So now I am jist sitting with the information. 

Regardless, I feel like this behavior isn't okay. I am bigger than him so its not like he'll ever attempt to lay his hands on me. But I also am not fond of the idea of him manhandling the smaller girls. Should I call him out next time I see it, or is that not my place?",27Nov2017,0

251,"Hi everyone. For starters, I’m a 30 year old female, married for 5 years to a 36 year old male. We moved halfway across the country about 7 years ago, away from our families and friends. I left behind a pretty dysfunctional family- brothers in their 40’s still living with my parents, their custody battles and various arrests draining my parents finances, which have never been very stable to begin with. My parents just finished a tumultuous 7+ years in bankruptcy brought on by the 2008 recession. Now, they want to move near us.

I have very mixed emotions on this. On one hand, it sounds great in theory - to have my mother and father present as my husband and I start our family in the next couple years, become closer during the last unknown stretch of their lives, fulfill their dreams of seeing their youngest become a mother. It’s all very romantic and lovely. But the facts are more daunting: they are on the brink of 60, financially irresponsible, codependent alcoholics. My life, although lonely and longing, became infinitely less stressful the very moment I left my family drama behind. I fear that my parents moving to be near me would not only be inviting the beast into my backyard, but would be financially devastating to my entire family- myself included.

I live in one of those hoity toity “top 5 best places to live” places. It is incredibly expensive and competitive to get housing or jobs here. I fear that my parents, being on the older side and visibly unhealthy, will find it nearly impossible to find gainful employment and find affordable housing. They wish to rent for the first couple years, but having just come out of bankruptcy, who will approve them? Especially with so many people competing for housing and jobs. I definitely fear that they will move here, fail, and ultimately depend on me financially or resent me for their choices. I do not want to see my parents’ lives in shambles. I only want happiness for them, as it seems they have never truly felt it before. 

On a more selfish note, I have to add that I’m afraid what our relationship will become if I suddenly have to entertain and become much more involved with my parents. At it stands, I speak to my mother for a couple hours a week on the phone. I do not have much of a relationship with my father due to resentment and discomfort surrounding his alcoholism and declining health due to said alcoholism, plus a whole plethora of childhood issues. He wants to make amends and apologize, “throw myself on the cross” style, whenever I am around and he has been drinking. I realize I am selfishly uncomfortable with this, but it’s worth including.

For those of you wondering about my brothers, they are both seemingly encouraging this move. At least, that’s what my mom says. I don’t know what they will do if my parents move out of state - one has not worked in 10 years and is on disability- he is all-out insane narcissist and will never not depend on my mother to bail him out of every dumb situation he gets himself into.  The other is just semi dependent but I think he will be fine without the parental clutch. 

Before you get in to the “don’t worry about it, they’ll never really end up moving, they don’t have enough money,” point- let me add this:  they recently came in to some money from an older relative’s will. This doesn’t mean they’re loaded, as they only got about $20k, but that’s just enough to set this dream of theirs into motion. My mother said in conversation last night that they plan to come look at houses and apply for jobs in the spring. 

So, my question to you, dear Redditors, is this: am I being a total curmudgeon? Should I let this happen? How can I stop it without totally crushing their dreams? Move Home? What happens if my fears come true? What should I do? I am desperate. I am so afraid of breaking their hearts, be it now or later, when they give up everything and have to start over. Ahhh! What can I do?! 

TL; DR: unstable parents want to move across the country to see me start a family, I’m unsure if that’s a good idea/if I want that to happen. Please help.",27Nov2017,1

Even as a supervisor i get paid the same as everyone else and often get stuck with grunt work due to being short staffed. I don't want to live this dead end life and its seriously affecting all other aspects of my life. I stopped going to college beginning of my 3rd year when my grades kept tanking due to depression. I left with enough credits to get my associates, however my gpa fell below 2.0 so i am not allowed to get my degree. gpa is 1.98, so im being held back by the 0.02, i tried reapplying this year and was denied, they want me to go to community college to raise my gpa. It seems like a HUGE waste of time and money to take classes there which wont count towards anything, i took 3 classes prior to reapplying to this school and got an A and two B's in those - i thought this would be enough for them. I hate living with family and i've probably only gone out with friends less than 10 times in the last 5 years. I don't want to hold my friends back from doing fun stuff just because i can't afford it. I've paid off about half of my student loans and will be able to fully escape debt by next summer.

260,"Backstory: I am a University student in Ontario with 3 dogs and a cat. I know it’s a lot. I had a cat and two dogs, and someone dumped the third with me because they know I’m into animal rights, and no one would adopt him because he has all these expensive health and dangerous behavioural problems. 

I live in a neighbourhood where a lot of people don’t like dogs, and in addition to that I’m kind of a bitch (not a good thing I know, but fortunately also not illegal) so a lot of the people here don’t like me. My downstairs neighbor doesn’t like me because I bought a noisy home gym (I’m very respectful about using it during daylight hours, but I do use it). There is this girl who thinks I’m trying to steal her bf (I’m lesbian af 😂), there are two guys who hit on me and I rejected. There is this girl who’s a neighbourhood dog walker that I fired because she’s a bit slow and I don’t trust her with my dogs... there are rednecks and muslims who don’t like that I’m a liberal lesbian. 

Anyways a few months ago someone (idk who) started spreading rumours that I was abusing my dogs. They called the SPCA and said that I yell at them (I do. Sorry not sorry, they don’t always listen when I speak at normal volume, and there are times they HAVE to listen to me, like if they’re about to chase a squirrel across the road). and that I use things like muzzles (I do, because the third rescue would have absolutely no problem biting a kid if they tried to pet him) and ecollar/ prong collar (I do, because they are effective training tools. They cause discomfort, but not pain). Obviously the SPCA didn’t care about that at all when there is real abuse going on like dog fighting and shit. 

So a few weeks later this person (whoever it is) called again and said that I let them piss and shit inside, and that I was starving my dogs. (They’re all house trained. And my youngest was losing weight, because he was sick. We’d been back and forth to the emergency vet for like 2 weeks doing tests. The third dog is also losing weight because he’s on a strict diet under vet supervision. When I got him he weighed 2x what he should have. And most annoying of all, no one has even been in my apartment to see if there was or was not piss and shit. My third dog is aggressive, and this is his safe space.) So the SPCA officer came over, saw how immaculate my apartment is, I gave her my vets number etc... and she said “I’m sorry I wasted your time”.

My nemesis saw that this didn’t work, so he/she told my landlord the same story. The landlord inspected, saw how clean it is, and said sorry. 

A few weeks later this fucking cunt called bylaw and told them I don’t pick up my dogs poop. Obviously there are times when I forget bags, and if that happens I just pick it up next time I’m out. But that is so infrequent it isn’t even funny. I have poop bags and dog treats in the pockets of every piece of clothing I own. And Not only do I pick up my own dogs poop,I pick up other dogs poop when I find it. Then she also told the landlord I don’t pick up the it poop on his property. Ugh. My dogs pee on the property but I can’t even remember the last time they pooped on the apartment property. They poop in the public field next to the private property. 

Anyways today I got a note from the apartment management that I would be evicted if I didn’t fix these issues in 7 days. And I’m just like, wtf can I fix?! Some psycho bitch is fucking with me.  And unless they picked up any poop on the property, DNA tested it and DNA tested my 3 dogs, they have no proof. And I KNOW they don’t have proof, because as I said my dogs don’t poop on the property.

And even if I get past this, what do I do about the bitch who is fucking with me? My initial instinct is to find her (I sense a feminine hand in this) and throttle her, but I doubt that would help my legal case...

262,"sorry about how long and rambly it is

so, me and a friend talk occasionally. we don't talk much, just an occasional discord chat. however, he recently (about 3 months ago) moved to a new discord server, and just now I realized I hadn't friended them. So, we can no longer talk (he doesn't allow DM's from non-friends). no biggie, I will just send him a friend request. however, it has been about 2 months and he hasn't acknowledged it. he hasn't accepted or declined, so it could be that he just hasn't noticed. I met him on a different site, however, he moved away from that to Tumblr. I didn't have an account at the time, but I decided that I already had his kik and discord, so it would be fine. so, I recently decided that I would try to message him through kik, to let him know about the friend request mess up. However, he apparently has deleted his kik. So, I made an account and tried to find his Tumblr. however, the way he said to find it doesn't work, so I can't find him that way. at this point, I don't know if I have just gotten unlucky, or if he has purposely ghosted me. He hasn't given me any clear sign that he doesn't want to talk anymore, such as DMing me or refusing my friend request. still, I don't want to be that creepy person who tries to stalk you through every mean they can find. Should I keep trying to contact him, or just assume that he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I just wish that he would tell me if he didn't want to talk. (Also, I do know that he is on discord. he just a few days ago changed his profile pic)

TLDR; a friend recently changed their discord server, I can't contact them, they haven't acknowledged my friend request, and none of the ways I have tried to contact them have worked. I am asking whether or not I should keep trying to contact them.",27Nov2017,2
263,"I was diagnosed years ago with ADD, medicated once, Ritalin zombified me, and I haven't sought medication since.  Though this is becoming something I'm going to look into again soon.

For now though I'm looking for advice from other people with ADD, and the jobs they've taken.  Unfortunately, I've been let go from more than a few jobs because of my lack of attention to detail.

I either mistake one part for another, forget to get three signatures and only get two, miss steps in a procedure, or just wind up getting bored doing the same repetitive things over and over again.

265,"Long story short, shortly before I met my current girlfriend, she was raped. For almost nine months she has repressed this, but recently told me. We went to the police together and she filed a report. However, since the rape occurred such a long time ago and there are no physical evidence, neither of us have high hopes he will be convicted. Therefore, my aim is to destroy his life.

Before anyone asks, I will NOT DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL(Or at least in terms of abuse). Trust me, I want to bash his head in, but of course this will lead to nothing good for me, and especially not my girlfriend. What I believe I have to do, is to destroy his social reputation, without the possibility of being charged with slander. I also need to be extremely careful not to unintentionally affect the outcome of the case in any way, albeit I don't think he will go to court at all. Here are some suggestions I have:

1. Contact his mother. My girlfriend has already said this was a pretty good idea, simply writing a Facebook-message to his mother detailing what happened and what a monster her son is. However, I'm afraid this could mess up the case, and also be illegal(slander). He's 18 and lives at home(My girlfriend and I are 17), so one way or another his mom will find out, but I suppose it would be more impactful if she read a direct message from my girlfriend.

2. Contact his workplace. He works at this local supermarket, and I've thought about simply going there and telling the manager that one of his/her employees is a rapist. However I believe this could also be slander.

3. Spread it to his friends through social media. Now this could definitely qualify as slander, but the thing is I don't believe he would report the slander since that would only spread the fact he's accused of raped to more people. Thus I believe telling all his friends could be an effective way of ruining his life.

Any suggestions?",27Nov2017,0

274,"I've always told myself that losing my virginity to someone I truly cared about was worth waiting for, but I'm 20 years old and have never had a serious meaningful relationship with anyone really worth sharing that experience with. I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's really starting to affect my self esteem.

It's hard for me to even meet people I click with, let alone start a relationship with them. Girls I do find myself interested in for the right reasons, and moving in the right direction with seem to always lose interest and things don't go anywhere.

I realize I'm a bit weird in that I have weird interests and a different personality, but I always make an effort to just be normal with women and just in general too. I also struggle with anxiety and depression.

I go to the gym so I'm not in terrible shape, and I wouldn't say I'm a very bad looking guy either. I dress normally and I have good hygiene as well.

I've tried going on Tinder to no avail. I am either not interested in the people I match with, or the people I do meet up with lose interest.

Its just sort of hard because a good majority of my friends are in serious relationships and I know that's something I would really like, but seems like I can't achieve.

I think being in a relationship is more important than the actual losing of my virginity, but it seems like neither of those are even on the table. I'm also at a stage in my life where I have a high sex drive, which gets frustrating when I don't have an outlet.

276,"I'm at a loss at this point. I think I may have made an extremely big mistake and I feel lost, depressed, scared and extremely sad. I did something I am not proud of and I know I will probably get a lot of negative responses on this. Trust me, I realize that I did a really shitty thing and have been very hard on myself since.

About 8 months ago I started dating my current boyfriend. I had known him for about 5 years prior. The twist to this situation is it was one of my best friends exes that she dated for about three years. At the time this happened he had always been my friend and we were always close but nothing romantic ever crossed my mind because of the golden rule. You don't date friends exes. At this point they had been broken up for about 2 and a half years but she was still not over him and hadn't moved forward with her life. He had dated other people and made it clear they weren't getting back together.

Our dynamic ended up changing and we ended up hanging out a lot. He ended up making a move on me which I was surprised about. I thought about it and we talked about it and I knew we had something special and I really liked him and trusted him because we had such a good foundation for friendship.

I ended up freaking out and not knowing what to do. What I should have done was talked to my friend immediately about it. What I did instead was go back and forth and eventually told her after things were getting serious. Him and I discussed that if this were to happen it would be a long term thing because I was not about to ruin a friendship over this.

Well that's exactly what I did was ruin a friendship. And a good one at that. I told her in person and she was extremely upset with me. Then I come to find out they had hooked up about 6 months prior to us dating. I had no idea, she didn't tell me or anyone else because she was embarrassed.  Needless to say I felt even more horrible and at this point was stuck in the situation.

We have been dating for about 8 months and things have progressively gotten worse. He has gotten verbally abusive when he drinks and can be very jealous and possessive of me. I know he loves me a lot but it confuses me because he was never like that when he dated my friend. He said because he truly was not as in love with her but I'm starting to worry things wont improve.

I completely ruined my reputation, got kicked out of a mutual friends wedding I was the bridesmaid for and am overall just ashamed at my behavior and decision. I know most people would say my friend is better off without me in her life and I'm sure she is, but I miss her a lot. I can't get over the fact that she hates me and that I hurt her so much. I have a group of people that I used to be friends with that have all ex communicated me and slandered my name. I feel extremely depressed and just disgusted with myself.

I don't know what else to do at this point. I don't know how to move forward. I love my boyfriend but I'm worried about our future. I'm worried I threw a 10 year friendship away over a man. I chose a relationship over my friend and I can't get over the fact that I allowed myself to do that.

I don't know if this can ever be mended. I don't know what else to do aside from shut myself off from everyone. I tried talking to her I have apologized and texted her but she doesn't answer. I don't know how to pick myself up after this disaster. 

My boyfriend is loving and supportive for the most part, but when he drinks things take a turn for the worst. I love him but have lost significant feelings since he's started acting this way. I don't know what to do anymore. ",27Nov2017,1
277,"My husband and I are 30 years old and we just got married last year. In October he graduated from his PhD program in Chemistry. We had been living in Michigan, where we moved so he could get his PhD. I HATED living in Michigan, but put up with it for 5 years. I moved there without a job and even though I had a Masters, I ended up having to take a job as a babysitter for two years before I found a real job. (Not that being a babysitter isn't a real job, but it's not the job I wanted)

Since we knew he was graduating and we both did not love the city we were living in, we did not resign our lease last August, which meant we had to move right away. In August, my husband was supposed to graduate, but it turned out he wasn't finished and would instead have to stay for a few more weeks. We moved out of our apartment and put our stuff in storage and I moved in with my parents in South Carolina while he finished his work in Michigan. Eventually, in October, he moved in with me at my parents. 

We are currently living at my parents retirement community in South Carolina. I quit my job in Michigan with the hopes of finding a job in my field (writing) and was able to get a few freelance jobs, so now while I work from home, I'm basically employed full time (although not making as much money as I was before in an office job). My husband is still looking for a job.

As you may have guessed, living in a retirement community at 30 is super boring. We have no friends who live here and it's incredibly hard to meet people who we have anything in common with considering we are the only people under 60 who live on this island. The town nearby is also pretty small and mostly populated by retirees. It's beautiful here and we've taken up kayaking and biking, but still. It's pretty boring. 

It was fine for awhile, but it's been almost 4 months for me and I'm pretty much done. I want to just pick a city and go. But my husband wants to wait until he has found a job, since moving to a particular city will limit his options. (He's applying to jobs in most major cities in the US) I feel like I moved to a city for him that had limited options for me and had to take a shitty job for two years, he should be willing to do the same for me, but the difference of course being that I work from home so we don't HAVE to move anywhere. But I am a writer (I mostly write comedy and personal essay) and have ambitions to write for TV or a related entertainment type of writing or at least be involved in writing sketch comedy for a theater (which I did back in Michigan), just generally have more opportunities which would involve living in a bigger city like LA or NY.  I'm not demanding we move to LA so I can maybe be a TV writer, I know that's kind of insane, but I feel like I've compromised a lot for his career and I'm ready to be somewhere where we both feel like we are thriving. I don't really care what city we are in as long as it's a major city and there's stuff to be involved in, people we can be friends with, etc. Our families are spread out across the country, so it's not like we have a place to ""go home"" to, although I grew up in DC. 

So I guess my question is: what do we do? Is it crazy to move to a new city with one person having no job and another having a currently pretty low-paying job when we currently have a place to stay and aren't spending money or is it worth blowing our savings to get out of my parents house but maybe limit our options by going to a specific city?

After a while I started to have feelings for her and I started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward. I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it. What do you guys think I should do?

282,"When I purchased my car at the dealership I was told I can't take it off the lot until my car is insured. My mom called her insurance company and gave all the necessary information and had them add me on to her policy. Within the next hour I received an email from the insurance agent saying ""Congratulation,"" and an attachment of my insurance card. 

I registered my car at the DMV and the man said he isn't seeing my insurance in the registry, but it can take a few days for a new policy to show up. At this point I thought nothing of it, since he made it sound like there's nothing out of the ordinary.

A week ago I received a letter stating my car isn't insured and that I would have to pay a fine and reregister my car if I can't provide the proof that my car is in fact insured.

Since my mother has known this insurance agent, and has used her for many years, she called the insurance lady to speak with herself. She was notified that there was a death in her family and to contact another agent at the company. We have been trying to contact this women constantly and our call is going to voicemail. The rare times she has called back I was unable to pick up due to work. She has been made aware of the problem, but I'm not seeing anything being done.

297,"My boyfriend's parents found out about us dating and our long distance relationship, and they weren't happy he kept it a secret. The reason for keeping it a secret was because if he did tell them, there is no way they would get their approval. 

We've been dating for 1.5 years. He is 17 in high school (from new Jersey) and I'm 18 in college(in Washington state). We've been long distance since the beginning. We met gaming and it's been fun ever since. We've met up twice and it's been great. I love him dearly and wanted only the best for him. I know he feels the same way for me. We Skype, call and/or Snapchat daily.

His family has a long complicated history, so when I refer to parents, I'm referring to his sister which has assumed the role of his mom. His mom is sweet, but she is disabled (his dad is even more disabled and stays uninvolved mostly) and his sister lives with them even though she is 30 and is unmarried. His sister is physically and emotionally abusive, not only punching him, but has told him how better off her life would be if he was never born, how he is a burden, and only wants the best for him. One time he told her he was feeling sad and maybe depressed (hoping maybe they would go see a therapist) and she ended up grounding him for ""being unnaprecaitive and being on the internet too much (because that's the only place where he could get such ideas)"". He's never mentioned it to anyone due to fears of being removed from his home, and saying it's not that bad. The way they've reacted to these things, as well as showing disgust for young, long going relationships (he mentioned his friends being in a happy 2 year relationship, and his parents felt bad for them for some insane reason) is the reason he never mentioned us to them. 

His mom and sister found out about our relationship two days ago when his sister pressed her ear to his bedroom door while we had a phone call. She has not done this in the 1 1/2 years we've been dating, and his sister was quite angry at him for lying to their mom all this time. She held him by the throat to his bed (but did not choke him) and punched his arm. He's a smaller guy, and has never been able to physically overpower his bigger sister. They took away his phone and his laptop and all means of communication. 

He was able to email me through his 3ds of all things and explain everything. He has not responded to me since yesterday, which worried me, but I stayed calm. I'm more worried that he has not shown up to school today. His friends investigated, finding out it was a parent excused absence, and even contacted his sister, and she claimed he was sick but he was enjoying his new ps4 he got for black Friday (which is true he got a ps4, but he was not sick last time I checked). 

I'm worried sick about his well being, and how he's doing.  He hasn't been able to talk to any of his friends since the incident. And I worry about losing him. How do I deal with a situation like this and how do I continue with my life as this anxiety eats me alive? I know there's nothing I can do, but how do I love forward?

The big reason why I've been considering his advice lately is that I've been trying to publish my own non-fiction writing.

I'm a crossroads in my life. I don't want to ramble on and on so I'll do my best to be concise. 

I *hate* my major. For various reasons I didn't realize that it isn't right for me until the first semester of my senior year. I'm studying Political Science and wanted to eventually go to graduate school to study International Relations or something similar.

I've liked planes and military history since I was young and would study the field of Military Science and or fly planes if I thought that was possible.. 

Anyway now that I'm about to graduate and disliking my classes more than ever I'm almost constantly depressed and on autopilot. Time is blurring by and thinking clearly is a struggle. 

But today I went to the library to do some research and found the ""Military Science"" section. There were topics as trite and outdated as a *History of Diving Bombing*, *The U.S. Navy What It Does and What Role It Plays In Our National Defense*, *Beam Weapons and Their Future*. 

Upon finding these books and others, I wanted to drop everything where I was and lay down, on the floor between the shelves, curl into a ball and read until the sun went down and came up again.. 

It was the first time I found something intellectually engaging and thought provoking all semester. The thought of being allowed to read these books and memorize *EVERYTHING IN THEM* was reminiscent of coming up for fresh air after thinking you'd never reach the surface.. 

Despite my being crying out that this is my passion and that I should pursue this, I'm fearful.

I fear that if I follow any one path I could miss out on others or find a better path and regret the one I took. I know that not deciding is a decision but.. It's still hard for me. 

**Question:** How did you find your path and commit to it?

For example: I *should* join the USAF or Army and see chase my passion of Military Science, but then I'm locked into a given path for 4 to 8 or 11 years. 

In short I'm having trouble committing to any one path.

309,"I need advice on if i should switch schools please read my story.

I've gone to a catholic boys only private high school for the past 3 years because my mom forced me too. I went to public school my whole life up until high school like i stated. I've never been happy at my current school for the following reasons  

1. all of my closest friends go to the same high school and a lot of the time i feel left out when they are talking about things at their school, not to mention we have different vacation schedules so sometimes i'm in school when they're not or i'm out of school when they're in. 

2. The school i'm at currently is college preparatory and i'm already not planning on going to a 4 year college right after i graduate anyway because i would like to attend community college first.

3. I'm a full Atheist and i absolutely hate that my school is Catholic because i feel like a complete outcast.

4. There's no girls here and it sucks because all of my friends are talking to girls and getting girlfriends and i'm over here just listening to their stories about it. Maybe it's my fault that i don't socialize with girls outside of school but i feel like it's important to be in a work environment with females. 

5. The classes are a zoo. there's no maturity and everyone is yelling, farting, and burping it's obnoxious. One of my classmates pulled out his genitals in the back of the classroom which is absolutely disgusting

side comment: My only really good friend at my current school transferred after last year to a public school and he says he loves it and doesn't regret his decision one bit.

So should i stay for senior year even though i am not happy where i'm going (i know no one really loves school but i feel like if i switched it would make things better for me) or should i try and switch schools ",27Nov2017,2

Most recently, we had a fight that I honestly didn't understand. Essentially, she told me that I was insensitive, and even went as far as to call me sociopathic.

I remembered that she seemed a bit slow, and that she also had a broken hand, and that her friend asked her how many times she had broken a bone this year, and it seemed it was the second or third time.  I wouldn't have minded dating her, but my conscience told me that it was exploitative of her mental condition and her broken hand state to date her. What do you all think? I want to be as reasonable and ethical about this as I can.",27Nov2017,1
312,"Over the past year, my family situation has been a bit messed up. 

My mother and father got a divorce after a midlife crisis, got back together (although the relationship will surely fall apart again), and she's now in a stasis of depression and anxiety. 

For the past 12 years, she's cleaned houses for clients, all undocumented (no taxes paid, etc). She doesn't like her job, but think's shes too stupid to find another one (I'll get to that in a minute)

And for a majority of that time, she hasn't looked for another job or set herself up for success for her later years. No savings. It's been filled mostly with Keeping Up with The Kardashians, Facebook, various movies, lots of alcohol, and other time wasters. 

Lately, her depression has been resurfacing. She talks to me about how she is sad, how her life is pointless, and how she ""can't wait until the year is over"" before things get better. And each time this is brought up, I try to ease my way into a conversation about how I believe her actions outside of work are contributing massively to her depression. 

But each time I try to talk to her, she resorts to many excuses for her behavior and says whatever comes to her mind in order to make my statements seem false. She doesn't want to admit it to herself. Our conversations go something like...

""Mom, I understand how you feel. I feel the same way sometimes. But the reason you feel this way is because you do not have any goals in life. I think you need to start finding something to dedicate your time to instead of TV and drinking."", I usually say. 

""I'm too stupid to learn anything else. My life is pointless and I'll never make it out of my situation."", she says. 

""You aren't stupid. You've implanted that thought in your head from a young age because you never put effort into learning. If you were to try, you'd find out that you aren't stupid. And you're right -- if you don't stop drinking and wasting time, you won't ever get out of your situation."" 

""What else is there to do? I don't have any hobbies, I don't have friends; I have nothing.""

""Mom, there are infinite things that you can do. I know you're interested in working out, so start learning about fitness and nutrition and see where you can take it. You've had a cleaning business for 12 years, challenge yourself to start hiring employees to make more money and become self sufficient instead of relying on dad. Become your own person."", I say. 

""Yeah, but I'm too stupid to learn how to do any of that."", she says. 

At this point, I'm starting to get annoyed, as the things I'm saying aren't registering with her. These conversations usually happen after alcohol has been consumed, so maybe that's why. 

""I've already told you you're not stupid. And if you keep telling yourself you are, you're going to be stuck in this terrible situation for way longer than it needs to continue."", I say. 

""But I'm not in a bad situation..."", she says. 

2 minutes ago, she was discussing with me how she was depressed and felt like her life wasn't going anywhere. Now, obviously, I know that she's just saying things to counter whatever I'm saying so she won't have to take responsibility. 

And at this point, the conversation is over. I'm not going to continue if she's not willing to help herself out a bit. So I leave, and she's left to wallow in her sadness for longer, thinking about how her life is in a bad spot. 

This was a real conversation, by the way. And many more like it have happened. 

Day after day, I watch this woman that I once new devolve into something that I've never seen. But she's still HUMAN. I know she feels the hopeless anxiety and weight of her situation hanging over her head, but the lies she tells herself keep it holstered up enough to where it won't come crashing down. 

And what's worse is that I WAS THERE TOO. I've had massive depression and thoughts of suicide every day of my life for years, but I KNOW it's possible to continue reaching for your goals because I'm doing it myself. I just can't seem to articulate that into her head. 

I'm a firm believer that after a while, you can't help someone if they don't want to help themselves. But standing idle and watching someone feel the horrible feelings that I've felt myself, especially when it's my Mom, is something I don't know how to approach.

316,"Today, I was walking to class when a mutual friend came up to me saying “Hey OverprotectiveWind! Did you hear about Friend? She may to coming to (our school)!” And my stomach just sunk. I felt like my whole world was spinning.

‘Friend’ was my “best friend” throughout middle school and it was the worst relationship I had ever been in. She was a horrible influence on me and brought me down a path with her with lots of regrettable, haunting choices I don’t really want to discuss. I wanted to stop being friends with her but I was so scared of her. She was sociopathic and manipulative and knew how to hurt me. She would talk about me behind my back all the time. I wish I never met her.

I finally cut things off last summer when she hooked up with my older brother on our vacation. I was devastated. 

I thought that was that and we would never speak again once we were in high school. She went to a different school far away from mine and I felt safe. I have a group of friends I like now, I’m happy to be myself. 

I’m not 100% sure she’s coming, but worst case scenario she does, what do I do? I guess I’m scared she’ll tell everybody awful, private things about me and I’ll lose friends. I spent so much time in fear, I don’t want to go back to that.

325,"I apologize if this turns into a giant wall of text; I have a lot to say on the matter.

So, there’s this guy at my school who nobody really likes or dislikes. He’s normally shy, so nobody has a reason to hate him. On the outside he looks like a good guy but, when you get to know him, one can tell that he’s far from it.

A few months ago, he tried to befriend me. I had no reason to decline his offer of friendship, so I accepted. I’ve never actually called him my friend, though. It started out fine, he was a bit annoying because he would talk to me even when it was clear I wanted to be alone. Eventually, it turned into something worse. He sits next to me in every class we have together and physically stop me from doing my work. He does this in a number of ways, from stealing my pencil, shoving my paper to the edge of the workspace, grabbing my arm and not letting go, or just punching my arm over and over. He’ll try to justify these acts by saying that he doesn’t have enough space when he has more than half the desk to work on, or by saying that he just needs a pencil. It’s not like I can tell him to stop, either, because he mocks my voice or my dialect whenever I speak. He also laughs at my work all the time, even if he has no idea what what I’m writing means. He argues in favor of ridiculous things, even when he knows they’re dumb. He laughs at me when I try to refute his claims.

I have a couple of examples of these things.

I was staring at the skylight in the roof over the porch of the classrooms and he asked,”What are you looking at?”
I responded,” The sky.”
He proceeded to laugh at me, saying that it wasn’t the sky. During class, he would stare at the ceiling and say,”Hey, look, I’m looking at the sky.”

Another would be this.

We were drawing a band album cover for our made up bands in art class. We had to come up with the names of the band and album.
He asked me,”What does hysterical mean?”
I told him. He asked,”Does ‘Lyrical Hysterical’ make sense?”
I responded,”Not really. What about ‘Lyrical Miracle’?”
He like that a lot and wrote it down on his paper. He didn’t end up using it, and instead went with ‘Mystic Mystery’. I wrote down the idea I gave him on my paper as a potential band name. I also wrote ‘Cynical Pinnacle’ and ‘Horribly Deplorable’. Later, he went over my band names aloud, laughing at each one. He couldn’t even read or understand the other two. He wouldn’t stop laughing at them for the rest of the day.

-

We were having a small debate over something stupid, and when we were done he said,”You know you’re an idiot.”
I responded,”Hm.”
He asked what I said, so I said it again, louder. He laughed and then went on the make the most exaggerated,”HEEEERRR” noise as possible. To this day, he mocks me for using that word.

I can’t do anything. I try to ignore him and I try to stop being friends with him, but every time I do he puts on the good guy facade. I can’t help but feel sorry for him when he does, and I always forgive him. I’ve tried just ignoring the pity and continuing to ignore him, but he still doesn’t stop bothering me. Telling a teacher won’t do much, I’ve tried that. He mocks me for that as well.

What the heck do I do? I can give more information if needed.",27Nov2017,3

328,"About a month and a half ago I started dating this girl. We’ll call her B. It was great for the first week. We hung out a lot and had a great time. I should add that I lost one of my closest friends by dating her because he had feelings for her even though they constantly fought. But I really liked B so I went for it. After the first week she got really busy with school and extracurricular stuff which is fine but whenever she did have free time she would spend it with other people and not me. It went on for another 2 weeks and in that time B became really stressed out about school. She started to seem annoyed when ever I tried to talk to her but she acted completely normal around literally everyone else. I was really confused but I never brought it up to her. Then one day I asked B what she was doing the next couple days because I wanted to hang out with her as I hadn’t seen her outside of school for 3 weeks. She got really pissed and didn’t talk to me all day until about 10 o’clock when she told me that she’s super stressed out and that she doesn’t have any extra time to give or else she would. So I asked B if I fit into her life and she said she would think long and hard about it. It was early in the week when I asked and the weekend rolled around without an answer. I figured that if she really cared she would’ve come up with an answer so I began to assume that things were pretty much done because she didn’t seem to care and as I said before she hadn’t shown much interest in talking to me or hanging out with me. I began to like her best friend in the next week. We’ll call this girl W. I had a sort of thing with W a couple years ago but it didn’t really work out. We stopped talking until this summer when her and B started hanging out with my group of friends. I liked W again this summer but the situation wasn’t right because she had a failed thing that got messy between two of my friends. But we’ve talked ever since and like I said I began to get feelings again for her. Now back to the present, I had gone to hang out with my friends that weekend, now a week and a half after I had asked B the question, and I told them about how I don’t think it’s going to work out between me and B and how I liked W now. Huge mistake but that’s what happened. Two days later I texted the B and asked her what was going on because I hadn’t gotten an answer in two weeks. She said that she was going to talk to me until she found out that I was going after W. Now let me clear something up. Yeah I had feelings for W but I definitely wasn’t going to act on those feelings at the time because I knew it wouldn’t go over well. But B was really mad and hurt about that and it horrified me that I hurt her like that even though I didn’t actually act upon my feelings. We decided that we would take a week or two to think things over and revisit everything when we were ready. A week and a half went by, it was now the Tuesday before thanksgiving and we had barely talked to each other but I went up to her and asked her if she would be able to talk over break. B seemed really mad and said that there’s not much to talk about. I was pretty pissed to say the least. Now she’s been hanging out with one of my friends and he likes her. I don’t know if she likes him like that but I’ve got a feeling that she does. I told him that I don’t care if he goes for her because I honestly don’t. I really like W though. We’ve been hanging out a lot and we always have great conversations and I think that a relationship with her would make me really happy but if we ended up dating B would be pissed at her. I lost one of my best friends because of B and I don’t want W to go through the same thing. On top of it all I don’t even know if W likes me like that or if she just likes me as a friend.

341,"Sorry this is pretty long. TLDR at the end.

I am a freshman (girl) at a small liberal arts school. This year I was invited to stay in a program house with 12 other girls, and was placed in a room with another freshman. I’ll call her K. K’s boyfriend is a sophomore at the college, and for the first three weeks or so, she would stay the night over in his room almost every night. I basically had the room to myself most nights. 

One night, they both came back from partying and they were sleeping in her bed. The next morning after K’s boyfriend has left, I start to tell her that I felt uncomfortable with him staying the night. She cut me off and said, “I totally understand. We were drunk and fell asleep here, and it won’t happen again.” Sweet.

A few weeks later I come home and he’s sleeping in her bed again. The next morning after he’s left, I remind her that the situation made me uncomfortable. She asked if we could talk about it later and I agreed. Later we realized that neither of us would be home till late, so we decided to talk over text.

I reminded her that I felt uncomfortable and explained why, and she argued that she wanted the right to sleep in her own room with her boyfriend. She claimed it didn’t matter because it was her side of the room. I reminded her that it was still a shared room, and if she wanted to sleep with him she could always go to his room. I didn’t care if he was there any other hour of the day, I just didn’t like him spending the night. She accused me of calling her boyfriend a creep, and that I was being unreasonable and that she would have him stay over whenever she wanted no matter what I said.  

Things got heated and I told her that if she insisted he stay the night, I would call someone to have him removed. If she didn’t like it, she could take it up with our house leader (similar to an RA, but not really). 

She eventually apologized and I said if she wanted to we could sit down and talk with our house leader. She said no. At the next house meeting, the house leader asked if everything was okay, and she said “yes” very enthusiastically.

I thought everything was fine after that but she was definitely still bitter. She doesn’t sleep in our room at all now. I’ve texted her asking about stuff for a class we’re both in and she ignores me. I asked her if some friends and I could pregame in the room Saturday night and she said:

&gt; No, I don’t feel comfortable with these people I don’t know in the room, plus I’m going to be doing lots of cleaning and rearranging of my side. The kitchenette is always open. 

...which is strange because she had no problem forcing me to sleep in a room with a stranger. I suspect she’s saying this to get back at me.

I’m not sure what to do now. I want to be able to use our room for friends and whatever, but I feel like she’s going to continue doing things like this. I have to room with her until the end of the school year. This may seem petty and stupid but I’m actually anxious about the situation, especially since she is closer friends with the HL and the other housemates than I am :/

342,"How do you keep having healthy romantic relationships? My partner and I are very much in love and I've never had a support system like this. Its been several years strong, but last night we had a terrible fight, and it triggered me. I have these fights at the beginning of the end of all my past relationships. The basis of the argument is that they do something or say something that they dont remember (whether it be from being intoxicated, tired, or in passing like while theyre on their phone and computer); after this happens so many times, they tell me they can't figure out if I am just confused and making them part of my delusions or if they have a problem with their memory that they only seem to struggle with when I am around. 

I am sure I do get confused sometimes, but there have been cases where I have specific memories and facts that helps me realize it wasn't just conjured up, and they still either don't believe me or aren't ready to accept that their memory loss is something they have to recognize. 

I cried for three hours last night literally praying that this cycle doesn't continue with my current partner. I would be heartbroken and devistated if I ever lost them.

So life has been really stressful for her and we also have a 19 month old son. I also work and watched my son as much as i could before i had to work again as i was the main provider. When i first got kicked out she didnt really give me a reason why she was leaving me.

But i soon found out she made new friends at her school and she told me that i wouldnt have let her hangout with them. It was a group of two guys and a girl i later found out that she also started talking to one of the guys as soon as i left. I'm a (25M) and she is a (24) and the guy she is talking to is (21).  She also said that she just wants to be alone (single?) And that the ""SPARK"" in our relationship was gone. My wife has never really had her own group of friends before she was always really shy and quiet. But she is persistent that they are just friends.

So fast foward two weeks now. And I gave my wife some space and haven't talked to her, but today was a breakthrough. She texted me out of nowhere a few questions about computer related stuff. And that soon just turned into a two hour conversation of how have you been what have you been up to. I know she has been hanging with this other guy but not very often, since she is trying to pick up more hours because I'm no longer paying for the bills. 

But i invited her and my son to hangout with me tomorrow at a park. And she said she would think about it and sounds fun.

I don't believe she is cheating on me i think it's really about friends, I've had jealousy issues in the past so maybe thats why she assumed i wouldn't let her. Also she never would talk to me about any of her problems so i never had a clue what was going through her mind. It might be too late to fix this but i would really appreciate some advice or tips to fix my broken marriage. Feel free to ask questions i did leave quite a bit out just so this isnt so massive to read.",27Nov2017,1
345,"I’ve recently realized how toxic one of my friendships that I have been in for almost 8 years is, and am finally fed up.
Me and this girl, who we’ll call Sam, met in middle school and have been friends ever since. We had similar interests at the beginning, we both loved the same shows, music, both loved the same NHL team, and we just got along really well. A few years ago she started dating one of my best friends, who well call Ryan. This was cool and all cause he’s a great guy, but I specifically told them both at the beginning of their relationship that, if they want to date I couldn’t care less, but I don’t wanna get involved with their fighting. They agreed.
A little down the road and of course she went back on this. Ryan has never looped me into any of their arguments (which is surprising as they have had MANY over the past few years) but ill often get phone calls from Sam at 2 am with her crying about how Ryan hung up on her phone call or couldn’t see her that day and she thinks he hates him and blah blah. And ok I get it, we’re good friends and ill do my best to give advice, but it always leads me to having to take sides with her. Sometimes she even demands that I ignore him because he said something she didn’t like. 
It doesn’t end here. I’ve had my share of problems too, but for some reason, I never get to share them. I specifically remember telling her about something I needed help with and she changed the subject in the middle of one of my sentences. When I asked her why she did that she said “Oh I got bored,” laughed and continued on with her story. 
She’s commented on my appearance (extremely blunt and negatively) at many points because “we’re close enough to be honest with each other.” I can’t hang out with her anymore without all of the conversations being about:
A- how great/awful (depending on the day) Ryan is
B- How smart she is
or 
C- How hard all the classes she’s taking are.
I just want to end our friendship but at the same time I feel like I can’t. My boyfriend and Ryan are best friends and He and Ryan’s favorite things are hanging with all 4 of us. We’ve had so much history together it feels impossible to end it at this point. I’m a senior and both of us are going to college soon and we’re planning on moving to two entirely different places, so I feel like I should just wait it out until I get to college to cut off communication. But at the same time, I don’t know if I can wait that long? What should I do? ",27Nov2017,3
346,I've been working at this pretty decent company for the past two years while at college. I'm graduating soon and have been offered a big girl job elsewhere. Now I have to put in my two week's notice and I don't know how to do it correctly or without becoming overly emotional.,27Nov2017,26
347,"I've applied to several schools and been accepted to one. I've been offered a scholarship because of my declared STEM major, but how do I begin my search for other scholarships? My guidance counsellors are seemingly always reserved for meetings, and with my other senior responsibilities like thesis and now finals (as December is nearing), I don't know how to begin even allocating time at all for applying for the remainder of my colleges and for scholarships. Everything is just too chaotic, and I need help.

Any advice is appreciated",27Nov2017,2
348,"Hello, I am providing ive translation for online meetings in my company since it seems I'm the onlly employee who can speak a different language and knows about IT. It is not my primary duty at my job.

The meetings have been quite heated lately and I've been asked to be more ""emphatic"" in the way I translate to the client.

I overheard my boss speak to another boss about how they need some other translator than can ""get their message across"". Personally I don't understand how it is the job of a translator to be actually rude to the client, or to yell or curse.

Have you guys any experience with this? Is it the job of a live translator to express such emotions? How does one deal with that?

Thanks in advance!",27Nov2017,3
