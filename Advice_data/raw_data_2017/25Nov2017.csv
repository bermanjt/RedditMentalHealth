0,"So MIL wants to buy a Cricut Machine, a pattern cutting machine that requires a computer interface...think crafts. for the wife. She let me know her plans and wanted to make sure I hadn't already bought one. But the thing is, my wife would not like this at all. She uses my MILs machine to make her moms projects for her when at her place. I understand this would make MIL believe my wife loves this type of craft. But she is not really into it on her own. She just does her moms small projects for her, because MIL has zero computer literacy. How can I politely tell her that such a purchase is not a good idea?",25Nov2017,2

9,"Hey all. I came here to ask for some advice to do with a relationship I'm in. So I met this one girl from a friend's boyfriend and we started officially talking last Saturday. Since yesterday she hasn't said one word and I think that I F'd up. Here's some back story. So I met this girl last Saturday and after texting for a little bit we got hung up on each other in a special way. She wanted a picture of me and once sending one she said that I was so cute. The first day was great, we played 20 questions and got to know each other a bit. The next day we kind of didn't talk, but the next day we did. Monday night I got to FaceTime audio her and everything was awkward, but after a few hours we seriously went full on flirting with each other. She said I was perfect and I kept complimenting her making her happy. 2 AM hits and she falls asleep to me singing ""Take Me Away"" by John Legend. The next day pulls around and I'm seriously the most happiest I've been in years. I come home after school and want to talk to her because of the bond we grew the night before but she says she can't and talks to one of her friends. After a little bit we call and get on flirting again. The call ends up to be shorter than the night before because her iPad dies. The next morning I'm happy once again for knowing her and I leave her a paragraph saying how thankful I am for her. This girl and me had a bond that was just irreplaceable. We would literally talk and compliment each other and send pictures. Wed's. is different because she doesn't have an iPad and we call on Snapchat. Before the call I blocked her. The reason of me blocking her was that she kept ignoring me and kept saying ""oh."" Btw she has a lot of Snapchat friends and she leaves people on read a lot. Anyways we grew a very strong bond and this bond was sorta like a boyfriend and girlfriend bond. I block her then a few minutes unblock her because I didn't want to see  her snap on my blocked list. Right after I unblock her she adds me back and says ""I was on my period, and I have dramatic mood swings."" Then she confessed that she was bipolar and she has cut herself before. I tell her to call me and we have a sorta short convo about what to do with our relationship. I ask her what would happen if I said no to giving her a second chance and she told me that she would block me and not talk to me because she would've lost a great person. And if I said yes she would be forever grateful and would make our relationship better than it was. I said yes and she's happy. Thursday hits and I send her a paragraph about how much I love her and she just saves it. Later in the day I ask her if she wants to call and she kept leaving me on read. I wrote a paragraph saying I was sorry for what ever I did. Anyways later we call and she's pissed off and annoyed of me. She told me she had 3 mental breakdowns that day and she was annoyed of me texting her constantly. I was only texting her constantly because she leaves me on read a lot and she likes me being clingy because it ""shows that I care."" The call ends then I just back off the night. Since yesterday I have sent her a paragraph picture of my face saying I was grateful for her existing and being beautiful. She responds and says ""thx."" She would usually take screenshots of me because I was just ""so fucking cute."" Since that I have not talked to her and friends think that she is terrible for me, but this girl is the most prettiest girl I've ever seen and she's just perfect. We haven't talked and I think she's over me and everything. I feel if I've ruined everything for being too annoying and clingy. Like she told me that I was the nicest person she has ever met and she doesn't want to lose me ever. I'm just confused and I feel like all chances are over. My friends are telling me that I'm too nice and she doesn't deserve a nice guy like me. I just want her to love me, I want her to know that I care about her, not about her body or looks. I haven't sent a paragraph today and we haven't texted each other at all. Can someone help me. ",25Nov2017,2

Everyone has casual sex nowadays so most guys are not interested in waiting for me to warm up to them (why would they when there are many girls who put out more easily?). 

I'm always horny and think about sex at least 50x/day. It's driving me crazy. I just want to get married so I can have sex everyday but I'm ambitious and want to first establish my career and get my MBA.

My family and I went to the movies after dinner, and as we were exiting the theater and I was about to go to the bathroom, my uncle grabs me from behind pretty aggressively.

17,"Hi there, I'm looking for some additional perspectives and experience on the idea of going back to finish university. Hopefully this will assist not only myself but perhaps offer some insight for others in a similar situation. I'll start with a quick summary of my situation for some context. 

I'm a 22 year-old, have been 'unemployed' for the past couple of months after coming back from a trip overseas. I spend most of my time reading and writing blog articles, poetry and short stories. I was planning on becoming an author but it looks like it'll take at least a few years of writing before I'm able to make a stable income off of it. I'm academically minded but dropped out of university a year ago after finding little challenge in what I was doing and having no clear end goal of a career in mind (my papers were all over the place in the Arts faculty). The dilemma I'm facing is probably a common one: I'm still uncertain on a career but it seems rather likely I'll end up with a job requiring at least some degree in the future (e.g. perhaps a job in politics or education). On the other hand it seems unwise to rack up more debt without a clear career path in mind (some advice I've read suggests it's not a great idea to get a non-STEM degree just for the sake of having a degree). I'm considering leaving the degree for now, moving to a new city and trying a variety of part-time jobs and see if anything sticks.

What would you do in this situation? Feel free to ask any questions if I've left anything unclear. Thank you.",25Nov2017,5

29,"Hey all,

I'm 17 years old, in high school. 

Over the past six years, I have found it very difficult to establish real, emotional connections with other people. I've had my fair share of fun over the past view years, but I've found myself becoming increasingly antisocial. I've found the majority of people my age to be incredibly two-faced, fake, and very difficult to trust. It seems as if every time I have a friend, they turn on me, talk shit behind my back, and back stab me whenever they get the chance. This probably seems somewhat petty and child-ish, but it's seriously become a problem and I don't see it stopping. That's one of the primary reasons why I refrain from associating with so many around me. *Everybody just seems so phony.*

I'm also not into all this mainstream social media bullshit (e.g. instagram, snapchat, etc.) that everyone my age is into. I'm not into drugs and alcohol. I'm not into partying. 

That said, I really, really love reddit. I love video games, and I've come to love a couple other activities (e.g. owning a business) that I'm very passionate about. I love reading. Be mindful that none of these things really require me to leave home. I'm also reasonably fit and good-looking.

All that said, for the past four years it almost feels like I've become a social recluse. I typically stay at home, study, play video games and browse reddit, and partake in all the other aforementioned activities. It feels like the friends I've made online are closer to all the ones I have in real life. Most people think I'm incredibly boring because I don't do all the other stupid shit (social media, drugs, partying, etc.) that most others are into. And, like I said, everyone just seems so fucking phony and fake. It's incredibly disheartening and it makes me lose hope that I'll ever find someone like me. That's the reason why I can't make friends and establish real, genuine connections with people I meet. It makes me so fucking sad and depressed.

I desperately need advice.",25Nov2017,3
32,"Hey all, so I’ve been thinking about writing this for a while and finally got to it. The title explains most of it. Her mother and father were drug addicts, alcoholics and criminals for the majority of her and her brothers life until her mother pushed her dad to overdose in 2015. Since then her mother has become a pill popping addict who favors the son over her and treats her like shit. She is verbally abusive and is just a mean person. She already threatens to kick her out and take her stuff away which she hasn’t paid for. Her grandfather is well in life so he financially supports her because her mother won’t. They receive money from the government because of her fathers death and social security. They get about 1600 for the both of the kids, 800 each and my girlfriend doesn’t see a penny of it. Her mother calls her a fat piece of shit, a cunt, a lazy bitch/whore. She expects everything from a girl who gets nothing from her. My girlfriend who we’ll call “M” for reading sake has to pick up after the brother “J” who is allowed to drink and cuss everything under the sun. The mother doesn’t take J to school and leaves him at home to play video games. The mother works and gets money on top of the 1600. Today she sent texts to M about having to be home from my house the next day because the house was a mess and that it was M’s fault but she’s been at my house for the past two days. M always has to do the dishes and clean up after them. The mother has had child services called multiple times but to no success. M always covers for her. She won’t say what’s really happening.

She's always had a drinking problem but over the last year she's gotten worse and worse.
She's been coming home and just falling over in the garden or the hallway and then screaming and making a scene demanding I pick her up and bring her to bed.
I told her the last time this happened that if it happened again I'd leave here there, hoping she'd think before doing it again.

Tonight she came home, fell over and hurted her leg so she's sitting on the ground screaming that I need to help her but also screaming if I try to move her.

Yesterday soem men came to the door offering to do some household repairs if only she paid them in cash up front. I told her 20 times over that this was a scam, I even had a friend over and he told her it was a scam too but she wouldnt listen, ggave them cash, even took some of my cash to pay them and of course they disappeared never to be seen again.

The only reason I havent moved out is because these people seem to know she's a fucking idiot and prey on her, there has been multiple attempted break in that were only averted by the fact I was there. I'm pretty sure if I move out she'll be dead/murdered within a month or two.

She wont listen to anything I or anyone else will say and is just relentlessly stupid, should I just move out and let her deal with it?

I tried getting her into AA previously but it made things far FAR worse, they told here there was nothing she could do to stop drinking, only jesus and god could make her stop drinking, so she feels like she's completely absolved of any responsibility in her actions",25Nov2017,4

42,"I'm a life sciences first year in university. At the end of each term, you have to hand in a lab notebook from your chemistry course to be marked. I handed mine in, it was beautiful, and I got 9.5/10, which is not bad for a first time notebook. 

However. The problem here is that for two experiments, 4 and 5, I got almost NO marks whatsoever. My mark in the course has dropped from a ~95 to an 84.  For experiment 5, my TA never gave me a report sheet, so I asked someone else for the questions and answered them in my notebook, figuring I'd still get credit. Well. That didn't happen.
Similar thing occurred for experiment 4. This time, I had the sheet, but the week before and during the labs/hand in date, I'd been in and out of doctor's appointments (which were in a different city than where I go to university) basically every other day, so I said to refer to the lab notebook for answers to the questions, because each entry is supposed to have answers to all of the lab report sheets in case you lose them. Despite having the graphs and perfect answers, I didn't get any marks. I suppose this is my fault for not clarifying the situation, but I really can't have my mark drop like this.

43,"Let me start by saying this happened Thanksgiving evening, between 7:30-9:30pm. 

Once all the members of my household had left the house at ~7pm, by 7:30pm my local fire department got a call for open flames in a dwelling. They arrived on scene within minutes ( I live 2 mins down the exact same street as the department) and then attempted to knock on the front door to see if anyone was home, which we weren’t. I have a video of me speaking with the head of the team, that forcibly entered my apartment after they didn’t get a response, that says he didn’t see any flames in any windows. They broke my front door, entered my home and found an “unattended candle”, extinguished it and “deactivated” a smoke alarm from the detector in a room of my apartment. Before I go on let me add this.. we burn candles and incense in my apartment, a lot. I make MY OWN candles, I am very well of fire safety, and not once after burning any candles and leaving them unattended on many occasions, has the alarm went off, or me come home to an open flame. 

The fire department didn’t extinguish any flame, no damage was done other than my front door and another door that was locked in my apartment. Now here’s where I have questions, if the alarm was going off in the room, and the department noticed a “burning odor” why would they break down the locked master bedroom door? Anywho, after this whole ordeal they write me a note stating they were here and responsible for the damages done, with a response id and phone number to Risk Management division of my city. They leave my door, lock busted through, easily opened if pushed or nudged, leave me a note, and go along their business. 

Well within the time of all this happening, and my family returning back home by 9:45pm, my apartment was burglarized lots of my electronics and jewelry were stolen, including a fire-safe that held my important paperwork (birth certificates, car titles, passports). In all over $3,500 in electronics were stolen, but so was my sense of security within my own neighborhood. I called the police, statements were made, signed the paperwork they needed, and told them I’d like to press charges if any suspects were to be found. The police took fingerprints on some things that were touched, and pictures of the doors as evidence. 

Now in one of the many conversations I had with the officers present, one mentioned that in cases like this, there is a division of the city called Code Enforcement that is meant to determine if the swelling is secure to leave alone, especially at night. Since the police report I have spoke with the fire departments chief, the team member in charge of the forced entry and I’m waiting until Monday to call the Risk Management division, because they are closed on weekends.

The question I have is who is really at fault for leaving my apartment this way? And what are some of the steps I can take legally into getting anything payed for? I’d also like to add that the landlord is obviously paying for the repairs to the front door and master bedroom door frame, but of course after the police report was filed, and of course I have to wait until Monday because of the holiday season. So now I’m forced to stay awake, with no electronics in my home in my living room, making sure no body walks into my apartment while my family is sleeping for two more nights. Thank you in advance for all that actually read this and any answers you have! Have a blessed holidays!

He then berated me acting like I was an idiot and didn't know simple ideas like new and old. It made me feel awful.

This mixed with the constant stress I have over whether or not I missed something or if I'm good enough at what I'm doing is really really having an effect on my sleep and emotions.

Should I just quit? I don't know if I can handle a boss that is so rude to me over simply not wanting to make a mistake, and a job that constantly stresses me out about making small mistakes. I went back tonight off the clock just to put it all away because I'm so stressed out about it.",25Nov2017,2
52,"So pretty much here's my thing. 18 years ago when I was 19 I moved out of my parents house into a nice 5 bedroom house. That was my first mistake, everyone I moved out with had good jobs for our age and we were all only 19-21. I still am working a crap job and am living paycheck to paycheck to this day. This house has basically become a start out point for a bunch of 20-22 year olds. I've lived with about 35+ roommates since I've moved in here not even an exaggeration. The thing is, everyone moves on once they hit about 23. I never moved on. No one in this house except me has ever exceeded 25. 

Right now there's me,37. A 20 year old, 2 21 year olds and a 22 year old. We go through a lot of roommates. I'm getting too old for this. These are all college kids or just young adults starting their life's and everyone moves on accept me. M

I don't doubt sooner or later that I'm going to get kicked out at some point by whoever is living here at the time. There's constant parties here and college kids over, and I barely speak to any of them cause I'm pretty much some old guy to them. I haven't had a friend here in probably 10 years. Each time someone moves out they get replaced by someone who's like 20 and then they live here for like 2 years or so and get replaced.

I constantly get weird looks from roommates friends when they have them over and I'm just tired of this. You'd think living with young people all my life would keep me feeling young but I feel very old and I want to get out of this while I'm still somewhat young. I don't want to be a 50 year old living with a bunch of college kids one day. But like I said, I'm broke, what should I do? Keep in mind most of the kids who end up here are wealthier kids who come from richer families who don't struggle at all to pay the rent. They also don't struggle with moving on pretty quickly either. 

Another sad thing is I turn 38 in 2 weeks. So add another year on that im stuck here. ",25Nov2017,3
53,"Hello ppl on the internet, 

I need some help and advice since I'm not very experienced in this whole love thing in general... I met this guy last year and we became friends.  We used to hang a lot after class and we still talk now and all, but we definitely have different friend groups and schedules.  However, I have liked him for almost a year now.  In general, he is just a really great guy.  He is still very single right now... and I don't know if I want to just keep my feelings to myself anymore.  I want to confess to him, but I don't know if that is a good idea or how to say it in general.  Any advice or positivity would be greatly appreciated!

54,"Today my mom told me that she was laid off from her job (not her fault, but due to a contract being prematurely ended). This is a new job; eight months ago she was laid off from a school due to budget cuts. Last time she almost lost the house. This has happened two times before that (within a few years), due to budget cuts in the school system. 

I’m asking for advice as to what I can do to protect myself. A little background - I grew up in a very abusive household —&gt; emotionally supported my mom growing up —&gt; now have ptsd. I’m in medical school, studying for my boards. I had to take off a year in order to deal with some things and make money (my school gives little money for living expenses). I’m working now, trying to make enough money to live and to pay for the materials I need to study, and I’m trying to study. I have to take this exam soon, otherwise I can’t return to school next year. 

I don’t know what to do for my mom. When this happened before, I talked with her every day and helped her emotionally. I was so drained that it contributed to part of the reason I had to postpone my boards. I just can’t do it again, but I don’t know how to not help her (if that makes any sense). 

Any advice/wisdom would be really appreciated.",25Nov2017,2
55,"Over the past few years my dad has had pretty bad health and I had a lot of trouble keeping track of him, as he was in Arizona and I'm in the New England area. He was in and out of hospitals, ERs, ICUs, nursing homes, assisted living places, etc. A lot of his things were stolen or went missing from various people taking advantage of a sick person. He was also in a coma few times. 

For the most part me and my Dad had a pretty good relationship except - one day he was drunk (he's always been an alcoholic) and we got into a pretty bad fight and I ended up hitting him. What I did I feel terrible about everyday, even though he was constantly provoking me to do so. I am not a violent person, I am very anti-violence.. anyway I think about this event everyday because soon after I left Arizona to come back home to my other family, and this is also when his health started to decline.

Anyway, me and him never really talked about it and I know he admitted to my mom (they have been divorced for years by this point due to my dad's alcoholism) that he deserved it. That he deserved to be hit, but I don't feel like this excuses my actions, I feel so sick and disgusted in myself for doing what I did. Flash forward a few years and we're talking again and things seem fine minus his health getting worse, then a few months go by and I don't hear from him, he was in a coma and some other bad things happened that I wont go into details about but he came out of the coma and we got back in touch again, and this sorta thing would happen. Due to him being kicked out of places for health reasons or various other health issues we didn't have a real static relationship, but he finally was doing pretty well and I was able to talk to him pretty consistently for a few weeks and things were great, I even sent him a father's day card, which I still don't know if he ever got.
One morning I woke up to a message from the icu saying that my dad is in pretty bad shape but should mostly recover. Every day for two weeks I was glued to my cellphone, I called the ICU everyday, but I was only able to talk to my dad once because he had to be ventilated.

He passed away a few days after.

It's been nearly a month; his ashes had to be shipped and I did a lot of traveling, I met with a lot of people and family I haven't seen in years. In a way, his death has brought a lot of relief because I guess I don't have to worry about him anymore, but my heart aches every second because I miss him.

Also discovered quite the hard way that when someone dies, it's extremely expensive. My dad loved music, and had many guitars some of which were way older then me and he had forever, they were basically my brothers and sisters haha. They had to be sold sadly, which also breaks my heart even more. The cost to ship them was insane, and I'm not a rich person, I'm a very poor person. My first week in this apartment a lady died down stairs and I get my mail stolen all the time but the rent is cheap and I can afford it.

I couldn't afford to see my mom for thanksgiving this year because of all the extra expenses I've had, on top of missing out on black friday sales (as a gamer this sucks lol, but I'm just whining at this point)

Things seem pretty bleak, I'm just venting I guess. Somedays I want to just sleep through them to get them over with. I try to play games with my friends, read, dick around on reddit or whatever, but everything just seems empty.

I just honestly miss my dad.

60,"So basically I’m in kind of really bad predicament. In English 11 I’ve kind of been caught coping, I’ve not really copied just worked with a friend during lunch periods and we have used the same ideas but something is definitely wrong with the way the teacher is handing the situation. We use google classroom as our way of working is most of our classes and everyone has laptops. So what happened is today my teacher handed back a few of my assignments from our short story unit so I went to check and I got a comment saying basically me and another student had similar marks and she couldn’t tell who did the original work and we needed to do a make up assignment. I’m fine with this and understood why, but here’s where things change. I’m a straight A student and I had 89% in her class and my mark dropped to 74% cause I was missing all the short story stuff, I understood why. But an hour later she changed it, she deleted the comment she wrote on the marks document she had returned to me. I’ll try to attach a picture of it. I can still see what she wrote through the doc history. This made me freak out why had she all of a sudden removed the assignment so I checked the history of all the documents she handed back and on another on the comment she had put on there has been removed was saying the same thing but she also said a lot of class has been sharing answers. And now my mark is also back up to 89%. I have no idea what to do, I have a good group of friends, we all are mostly A students and part of a premier program involving business and the only reason we share ideas is because we have such a heavy workload for the semester so next semester we can have a better semester. If she takes this to the principal I can completely over flip her argument by saying we work together and tell the principal all about how much cheating goes on in her class. A lot of students blatantly cheat and I just do my tests legit and then watch while half the class cheats and she just sits there. I’m not sure if I should use all the things I’ve seen against her and just make her seem like a retard and point out how much cheating goes on in her class. I’m almost 90% sure if she takes this to the principal we’re getting kicked from the program. But the thing is I know a lot of other peoples copied me and my friend but everyone I talked to didn’t get any comments like I did? So I’m not sure what I can do to prove that I’m innocent.

td;dr: I kind of partially got caught cheating and I’m afraid of being cut from a premier program but have a lot of “dirt” on other students.",25Nov2017,3

62,"In-laws house stinks from 20+ years of smoking indoors, they are trying to quit (smoking outside only already) but are nose blind to how much the house stinks. 

My wife and I don't smoke, I've got asthma, and since I had to use my inhaler in their house while my wife and I were dating they have stopped smoking indoors.

Neither my wife nor her parents understand asthma, and my wife loves to dominate conversations so I never get to talk directly to my in-laws about it. I've tried explaining it to my wife, and we're at that point where if she heard the exact same words I'm saying from a doctor she would believe it, but till then she sees it as a mental illness or something I can just ignore.

Anyway, my wife and her parents got in an argument over my asthma, and she convinced them that I used my inhaler in their house because of the smell. Now every holiday they bring up the topic of whatever efforts they have made to remove or cover up the smell. My wife tells them that the house smells better than the last time we were there, and I stay as far away from the conversation as I can. 

The house doesn't smell any better, it feels like hitting a brick wall when I come through the front door. Our clothes and luggage have to be washed in vinegar when we get home to get the smell out.  Any time we visit her friends in town we smell so bad they notice it instantly. I've tried convincing my wife we should stay somewhere else in town... It never works.

She's still mainly attracted to girls though, but I guess guys aren't out of the question ?

We're very close friends, and we are in many ways alike, and I don't want to lose that but at the same time I feel like hiding my feelings is wrong and that maybe we'd miss out on something. If I do tell her I'd want to make it clear that regardless of her response I still value her as a friend and I don't want any sort of awkwardness between us. 

I'm seeing her tuesday, should I tell her ? What should I say if I do besides what I already wrote ? I could use a little bit of external advice as I'm kinda lost, these feelings are a lot to process and I definitely don't wanna screw up. Also, this is a weird situation to be in lol.

I know a frosh, Chris, who is kind of awkward and has had trouble making friends. I talk to him sometimes, but he can be kind of weird. I'm not interested in being his friend, but i know what he's going through, and i can tell he's been having trouble, so i feel like i should give him advice.

We're on the same intramural team, and in our group chat he'll try to get people to hang out (""practice for the next game"") and has made self deprecating jokes (like ""y'all are the only people i know""), but no one really pays attention to him. I'm the only one who encourages him, but again i don't want to be friends. i don't want him to think we're friends either. Like last week he said he found my instagram and went through it, i found it kinda creepy to say that. If it were a new friend or girl saying that, it'd be fine, but in this case i found it weird and just laughed along

I'm 2 years older than him and just as new to our uni as he is. However i've managed to make some friends i can play pick up games with and get drunk with, he hasn't made either and doesn't drink. I wouldn't want to drink with him either and i certainly wouldn't invite him to. Some people go to me for whatever reason, i'm a likeable person i guess, Chris is a nice guy, but doesn't really know how to talk to people. I know he wants to be more social, but what advice can i give to make him more social and likeable? 

My friend Jake is also on our team, doesn't like him much but isn't mean, and we're making our own team for next semester, i just don't want him to think i excluded him if he thinks we're friends.

71,"So just a bit a bit of background on me...I started off University to a rough start. I struggled with health and mental illness (anxiety and depression) for many years and had to drop out after my first semester. I transferred to a school closer to home the following fall, and after a lot of ups and downs I managed to graduate last June after 5 years.

I had no clue what to do with my life. I considered teaching and counselling and applied to those programs, feeling pressure from my parents to jump back into school. I got into the teaching program, but after doing some researching and talking to people I felt that occupational therapy was really where I wanted to be. So I declined the offer. 

Cut to a few months later. I am now applying to OT programs and felt pretty confident about how this is what I wanted to do with my life. I thought OT would be a great fit for me. I like advocating for others, and like how broad the field is. 
So I am dedicating all of my effort to getting into school for OT and I am in the midst of applications. I feel like I function well when I am setting realistic goals for myself and like the idea of helping people get back to their everyday lives after dealing with an illness.

But I'm starting to get this horrible sinking feeling that this is all a mistake, and I am starting to think about what is going to happen if I don't get in. I don't have a backup. I would reapply to teachers college but the deadline has already passed so that's not an option for next year. Which means that if I don't get in I will spend another year with no direction towards a career. OT school is extremely competitive, and because of some of my ongoing health issues, there are only 2 programs that I am applying for as I need to be close to home for ongoing medical appointments.

Part of me regrets declining the initial offer to teachers college. Part of me also regrets that I didn't reapply this year to another teaching program as a backup in case OT doesn't work out. But I feel so sure about OT. I really feel in my heart that is what I am supposed to do. What if I don't get in? I'll have to figure out another path. I am 25, almost 26, and have always felt so behind in my life and don't want to waste anymore time.

My panic attacks have returned and my depression has been quite a bit worse. I just keep thinking about the worst case scenario. One day I feel like I am doing the right thing, and the next day I am filled with panic and regret for declining that teaching offer.

I know no one can tell me what is going to happen with my future, but if anyone has any words of wisdom or comfort that would be appreciated. Has anyone had a similar experience to taking a big risk in your life? How did it turn out? ",25Nov2017,2

74,"So I fucked up, on a throwaway here.

Last night my wife and I were asleep and our baby woke up screaming at 2am, at first my wife tried to console her, didn’t work, then I did, didn’t work. I put her down and my wife tried again, still nothing, screaming continues. I try again and she try’s to crawl away kicking me and I dunno, stress I suppose caused me to slam the bed and push her leg away. 

In hindsight it was pretty dumb and my already stressed out wife heard the slamming of the bed of course and got angry saying “what are you doing!?” “Did you hurt her?” I of course did not, because I just slid her leg over, she (the baby) was still very inconsolable and continued to cry. I dug myself deeper by saying that it was nothing and the baby is fine (well, she is fine) but that somehow made my wife even more furious.
Now, I probably should add my wife did a little slamming as well, but when I mentioned that, she just said her way was ok and mine was horrible, in her eyes...

Anyways, the story goes on.
So today we were invited to an friend of mines annual party that we’ve been going to for years. And had nothing happened last night, we’d already be there. 
This morning my wife was still pretty angry and said, I don’t want to go with you etc. basically saying we’re not going. 
This friend I would say is a family friend, but closer to me than my wife but they have kids and my wife enjoys talking with his wife etc but I can’t say too much without possibly giving things away but we’re connected in many ways.

Anywho, I accept that I fucked up, but I think my wife is blowing things way out of proportion, I’ve never and never would even consider any kind of violence in the slightest whatsoever to my daughter or wife. Period. Her family however has a bit of history of that whole violent father thing so I think even this minor thing; which was I agree, immature, caused her to get angry.

So I’m trying to think of how I can try and explain the value of our family friend to her and get her to agree and go to the party (it’s an all day thing). ",25Nov2017,2

77,"Recently, I began working at a retail store for the holiday season. I have been with the same retailer for a few years, but it is my first time at this particular store location. There's a coworker (I'll call him Alex) who treats me badly, and I'm not sure what to do.


During my first night there, Alex constantly interrupted my work to make sure I was doing it correctly, often while I was speaking with customers at the cashwrap. I’m very familiar with company policies and procedures, but I didn’t say anything because I thought it would be easier to just listen and move on. Since that night, I have worked with Alex a few other times. In addition to interrupting my work with customers, Alex has asked me to clean up parts of the store that are assigned to him, or help him clean the fitting rooms when he is assigned there, even though I have my own tasks. I complied with his requests because, again, I thought it would be easier than saying no.


One night after we had closed, Alex was putting away some things. I was cleaning up some tables in the front. He called me to where he was, only for him to tell me to go to the back to get him some hangers. He was closer to the back of the store where we keep the hangers. He did not ask if I would get him hangers, he told me to do it. I was steaming but did it anyway.


I could handle such requests from a friendly or even neutral coworker, but in addition to all of that, Alex is flat out rude to me. I can sometimes be clumsy and Alex’s presence makes me nervous which only adds to my clumsy tendencies. Multiple times I have fumbled or dropped things in front of him, and he laughs at me in a very unfriendly way. He has insulted my field of study. He has insulted the store I used to work at. He’s insulted my home state. It seems like any time I share something about myself, he has a negative comment.


There are two reasons I haven’t said or done anything yet
1) The idea of confronting Alex about this makes me nervous, and unsure of myself. I wonder if I’m blowing this out of proportion and if I should just deal with it.
2) I was only planning on staying at this store for the holidays
Since then, the store has asked me to stay on after the holidays. I genuinely like everyone else I’ve worked with, and the pay is pretty good so I’d like to stay, but I don’t know what to do about Alex! Your advice is appreciated :)

TLDR; I have a rude coworker who interrupts me to tell me things I already know, asks for help with his assigned tasks while being rude and insulting towards me. How should I deal with this?",25Nov2017,3

94,"I went to college and moved out to Los Angeles to get into a tech or film job, it hasn’t happened. I’ve been in Los Angeles 7 years roaming from temporary job to temp job. I just don’t feel the same way as I use to. I feel like I’m without the purpose I once had. I’ve sent out resume after resume for 7 years, and out of 7 years 5 interviews that really mattered, and four of them were good. 

The interview that wasn’t good, the guy came in and said “impress me”. It caught me off guard and let’s just say I didn’t get the job. I’ve had one to three good close friends out here, one no longer because of politics, and the other hasn’t had a good go of it here either, and plans on moving back home. Honestly I’m just not that outgoing for LA. Part of the problem I think. I have a girlfriend that i can’t really take seriously. That’s a whole other story. Check my post history if you want more details on that fiasco. 

I don’t know what to do. My father lives in Missouri. My father sure would like to have me home, but I have mixed feelings about moving back to where there’s absolutely nothing out there. I think in a year I could be making good money Bartending, as I just got into the business out here. So I feel there is some hope there. I’m just sick of all this wasted time out here. I don’t do anything because I don’t care about anything anymore. I’m older and just don’t care to make a difference in the world like I use to. 

I tell myself it’s ok to just be a normal bartender who makes money and goes home every night. Other people seem fine with it. Maybe it’s just the little bit of youngness I still have left that wants to take on the world and do outrageous things like move to Los Angeles. ",25Nov2017,1
95,"To keep things as simple as possible, there are (fake names of course):
*friend Alex
*friend Barb
*friend Chloe

While in college I made friends with Chloe and have met her entire family and we have a good time. Before college, I hung out with Alex and Barb. Alex is as close as a best friend as I have, and Barb is also but more reserved. 

I was invited to attend Chloe's Party (some 2+ hrs away and over a year ago) and Alex says 'can you ask if i can go'. I'm very hesitant because Alex doesn't even know Chloe or anyone close to them, but trying to please everyone I do and Chloe says sure.

Fast forward to now where now Alex and Chloe have met a total of 3 times and there's another party coming up. I again was invited and Alex says she was invited during a brunch by Chloe. Barb wasn't aware of the plans that were made and wants to go. Alex says ""why can't you ask because technically you'd be only bringing one guest?""

After that question, I start saying to Alex, ""It's not just 1 guest because you only met Chloe 3 times, and her family once before so even if you do come, you're still a guest"". She doesn't seem to understand why inviting others to someone else's place is not alright and I think she's becoming way to possessive of my other friendships over her.

Would it be ""wrong"" of me to just not let her go to anything related to Chloe in general anymore? Probably anything related to any of my other friend groups in general now.",25Nov2017,1

100,"So I've been living with a friend of mine for about six months now. She got a cat without really asking me-- we had discussed it, and I had given the okay if she followed a few guidelines, but then she brought one home without any head's up and without following any of the guidelines we'd agreed upon. I have a really energetic dog, and my main thing was that I wanted her to get a cat that had lived with dogs before, but she didn't do that and the cat hates my dog.

The cat also gets into EVERYTHING if she's left unsupervised. As a result, any time my roommate isn't home, the cat is stuck in her (very small) bedroom by herself. At first, I was trying to let the cat out any time I was home, but the cat was either getting into things or getting into it with my dog, so I stopped.

Now, my roommate is hardly ever home. She's a student, she works, and she recently got a boyfriend. A couple weekends ago, she was gone for over 48 hours, and hadn't made arrangements with me or with anyone else to ensure her cat was fed or played with. She frequently will come home only to feed her cat, spend about five minutes with her, and then leave again-- or ask me to feed her cat because she's not home. 

The cat is frequently up at night when she's not home meowing and waking me up. I often hear her scratching at the bedroom door, seemingly desperate to get out. I feel so bad for her, but I'm *done* trying to mediate between the cat and my dog and babysitting the cat to make sure she doesn't get into things around the house. 

I don't know how to address the situation. Our friendship has already become really strained because of this cat-- I've brought up a number of issues in the past, and it's caused a lot of tension and fighting. We've come to a point where we're not actively fighting, but we also don't hang out as friends anymore, and mostly just keep to ourselves. I really don't want to make things into a big deal, but she always takes things extremely personally, so I don't know what to do.

Is this something worth bringing up? I had cats growing up, but they were outside half the time as we lived in the country, so I don't know if it's actually a big of a deal as I'm making it out to be. If so, how do I go about bringing it up? When I've talked to her about things in the past, I've been very diplomatic and brought things up very gently (I've gone over our conversations with multiple people to make sure I was actually being good about bringing it up and everyone agreed I was diplomatic and even maybe too kind about things) but she still takes it extremely personally. She's said that I've made her feel like a ""failure"" and that my ""standards"" for pet ownership are ""too high."" For reference, that was after I asked her to ensure her cat stays in her bedroom when no one is there to watch her (because her cat had knocked over the garbage and dragged it around the house for the third time that week, and had knocked over my cereal boxes, so cereal was all over the place). All I had said was ""Hey, can you make sure Dessie stays in your room when you're gone? She knocked over the garbage again."" 

I feel so awkward about the whole situation, and don't know if it's something worth bringing up, or if I'm maybe making it out to be a bigger deal than it needs to be. Help?",25Nov2017,2
101,"Let me start off by giving some context. I am an average looking 18 years old guy. I am shy, awkward and an introvert although it was worse when puberty was in full swing. I've had an inferiority complex but I managed to get somewhat over it by just soldiering on.
 My social situation is that I don't have many friends although I am in an active social circle and go (hang) out most weekends. I'm not, and have never been in a relationship and I don't have any close friends. I used to have two, however I got too attached and tried to ""romance"" one and botched it up. That happened two years ago and I've had a fear of becoming too attached to someone ever since. 
 Things were going fine for me untill a few months ago when a friend who has already been in a relationship started flirting with the close firend I talked of earlier. Since we're all in the same social group they have been doing it in front of everyone. For me it started off being sightly annyoing but now that they're getting more and more serious it eats at me every time I look or hear them. It peaked yeasterday when after they talked how much they wanted to fuck eachother (their wording, not mine) whenever the other was not around I just said ""I can't do this anymore"", abruptly left and walked 10km back home in the middle of the freezing night. 
 Thinking about why this made me so miserable when I should have been supportive has gotten me to realize how lonely I really am and have been. I never talked about my feelings with anyone for two years now as I didn't really feel there was anyone who I could talk to. Now that I desperately need a hug and a friend to understand me I find myself too afraid to ask anyone. I am left hoping that by some random chance someone will break through my facade and realize in how much distress I currenty am, but I know that it won't happen as it is more of a movie cliché. 
 Last night they said they're going to throw a small party for me and a friend who has also had her birthday recently but I don't know if I want to go since I don't find myself comfortable around my friends anymore. What should I do? Should I turn to them for help or distance myself and maybe seek out new friends (although I am terrible at making friends)?",25Nov2017,1
102,"All right so where I live I gotta take 4 years of math (I already completed one year) and I'm currently taking geometry and my plan is to take algebra 2 over the summer and finish it and be in pre-cal in my sophomore year and once I finish that, I'll just take engineering for next two years as a math elective and be done with my 4 years of math which sounds great but here the tricky part... 

If I want to take Algebra 2 over the summer I'll have to do it on the computer but the thing is that if I want to go to my camp next summer, I'll need to finish algebra 2 in TWO weeks. And believe me as crazy it's sound doing a year long class in two weeks  I know fellow class mates who has done this and what they told me is that they finished the class by sitting on the computer for 8 hours a day for two weeks and I'm thinking alright that seems do-able for me but the thing is that I'am worried if i fail the class and waste the $250 or I go way to fast and fail it but at the same go at a fast rate because I want to go to my camp which starts a month after school ends and another reason why I want to do this because I'm sick and tired of math.

106,"Some background: I'm a 21 year old chubby blonde girl who easily passes for 14. I am one of very few white people in a rough urban neighborhood, ad I'm honestly unsure if that plays a role in what happened. I substitute teach at a local elementary school and take a 20 minute walk from work to the bus stop on nice afternoons. At the end of one of my walks one day, I reached a very crowded bus stop and waited for the next bus.


Then a woman, 30s or 40s, comes up to me and starts making very loud conversation. I assume she's either extremely extroverted, intellectually disabled, or a mix of both, so I just try to be polite and talk back. Then she starts pulling at my hair. I have no fucking idea why I didn't stop her for this, she was tearing at my curls and knots so hard it genuinely hurt and she probably took a few strands with her. Then she starts asking me for money so her 'friend' could get on the bus. I look back at said 'friend;' she didn't look desperate or hopeful, or even indifferent, she just gave me a nasty look and kept quiet. The lady reached towards my purse and I took out my wallet to rifle through it and prove to her that I literally had no money (again; no idea why tf I did this. I'd like to think I'm a logical person, but I guess that's not the case when I'm nervous). She saw a gold piece in my wallet and said there was some right there, I pulled it out to show her my fucking house key and put away my wallet. Then she went back to pulling my hair and mentioning how knotty it was, then said how she could curl or flat iron it for me. Everyone at the bus stop watched this happen out the corner of their eyes but no one wanted to do or say anything (and I hate to say this, but I wonder if I wasn't white if they would have tried to say something). I get fed up and tell her I had to visit my uncle, walked down a curvy sidewalk to my friend's house so she wouldn't see where I was going, and called my mom to pick me up from there.


Then last night after driving back into town from my aunt's house, we stop by a redbox at the 7-11. Then a lady starts calling across the parking lot, ""Excuse me miss, excuse me!"" but my mom doesn't hear her, and I just ignore her. I ask my mom to go up to the box with me even though we'd reserved the movies before hand. Low and behold, it's that /same/ fucking lady, who has now teleported from the parking lot to right next to the red box. She comments how she hasn't seen me in a while and starts asking us for money. She's still obnoxiously persistent but is now keeping her hands to herself thank god. She says how she just wants something to eat, and I say how I didn't have any cash on me but would be happy to go in with her and buy her some food. Then she just say that 7-11 serves shit and tells us that the sub shop down the road knows her order or whatever. She even tells us there's an ATM right inside the 7-11 that we could get our money from. Between withdrawal fees and the creepy vibe she gave off, my mom and I both declined this and ignored her while we waited for our movies. We told her to have a good night and we walked back to the car. As soon as we drove off I told my mom that that was the lady who pulled my hair. Of course my mom wanted to turn around and cuss her out, but I don't know if this lady's just annoying or completely dangerous.

Anyway, what the actual fuck do I do? This lady seems to be everywhere, including on the bus route I rely on every day. I don't know if she's dangerous but I sure as hell don't feel safe, but you can't really get someone arrested for week-old hair pulling. Also, I've been in karate for 3 years and am a little miffed at myself and the curriculum for not knowing what to do in a situation like this. Idek, I'm just nervous and could use some input on this if anyone can help me. Anyway, thanks for dealing with my obnoxious whining.",25Nov2017,47

However, I recently tried to help my bro get a new job (his current one is pretty rough) by putting him in contact with a friend who was claiming that she could help out. He took a month or more after I'd talked with her to ask for her number and then got snippy with me because she didn't know who he was and couldn't help him. I told him that if he had contacted her earlier than perhaps it would have been a different story and he responded by completely flying off the handle (this is all via text) calling me a very derogatory name and telling me to fuck off. I made it very clear I was hurt but he refused to apologise. I've since deleted him from social media and cut contact with him.

I liked the idea of psychology-type stuff but wasn't prepared to dedicate myself to a lot of schooling, so I started attending a community college mental health assistant program. It was a short program, but I found out that I would also be very limited in my career options on this path so I switched to social work half-way through.

I am currently working as a behavioral health technician at an inpatient residential treatment facility that clients stay at for a short period of time to get treatment for substance abuse and/or mental illness. I don't really feel strongly one way or the other about working here, but it's really all I can do right now.

I recently entered into a bachelor's degree program for social work at a local university but managed to mess up my scheduling and dropped a pre-req class that is only offered once per year. This is a class that I need to take before I can take 90% of the other classes I need to graduate.

I will now graduate in the year 2021, rather than 2019. The thing is, I don't even know if I really want to do this kind of work anymore. I don't feel much of a passion for it anymore and I have so many other interests...

I don't know the boyfriend very well, we've met a few times and get on, but I barely know his kids. I've met them once at my nephew's birthday and the 8 year old was fine but the 12 year old was having a pre-teen tantrum. 

I feel like I need to turn up with gifts for them for Christmas, seeing as we'll be together. The boyfriend won't be too difficult, I can just get him a bottle of something boozy.

What do you buy 8 and 12 year old girls? I haven't had to interact with one since I was one a long long time ago. My default with younger kids I don't know is to just turn up with a load of sweets they can tear into and while this might suit the 8 year old, I reckon the 12 year old will find it childish.

128,"So my cousin [21M] and my sister [20F] have always have always had a difficult time getting along and very much dislike each other, even though our families are extremely close and spend a lot of time together (we practically grew up as siblings).  Me [22F] and him were in the same grade and have always gotten along, but recently I’ve gotten a lot closer to my sister, and there’s A LOT of tension and aggression between the both of them, which is stressful for me listening to them bitch about each other. I’ve decided to try to understand them both more and bridge the gap between them so they can at least get along enough to be in a room together (Thanksgiving was very tense).

My issue is delving into this issue I’ve discovered my cousin is very sexist and has a superiority complex, which I find very concerning and want to help with. It turns out a big reason my sister has started to hate him more recently is because he sexually assaulted one of her very close friends, and thinks nothing of it. This is very concerning for me because I’ve heard other people tell me that he has mistreated women and come into them without their consent (unwanted kissing and grabbing). He doesn’t have any close female friends, and thinks less of people who don’t have the same education as him (he’s about to graduate from an Ivy League with several STEM degrees). 

As a victim of sexual assault myself I don’t ever want him to become the type of person that thinks it’s okay to treat women that way, or people in general as inferior just because they didn’t have the same opportunities or education (note: he’s very privileged). I’m in a position where he respects me because I’m older, have a calm demeanor, and am getting a degree in mechanical engineering  so I think he kind of thinks of me as “one of the guys”, but when I calmly try to address these topics in conversation he is very stuck in his ways, and openly admits to him thinking he’s superior and having a complex and thinking less of people like my sister. How can I help? Both of these people mean a lot to me, but in general I think my cousin is in the wrong here, however he seems unwilling to budge on his opinions.",25Nov2017,3

She also has been bullying our new young female boss.  So that also made me wonder how much of this was just a show of intimidation and domination?  Maybe she likes me, but maybe deep down something else is going on as well.  How am I to know?   I don't know how to feel.

140,"I have been feeling really depressed since I went to the orthodontist and he told me I'll need 7 fillings (maybe a tooth out), braces and then jaw surgery to fix my mouth at nearly 19 years old. I haven't been to the dentist for 1 or 2 years, maybe 3 until now. I have never liked my teeth so I kind of had a 'what's the point, they're fucked anyways' mentality. The treatment is going to be long/painful for me and expensive on my parents (they might not even be able to afford it so I'll be stuck with this shit until i can personally pay so I'll take a year out or drop out of university if I have to).

143,"My mom has a history of mental illness (suicide attempts, childhood trauma, addiction) and has been in and out of mental health clinics twice now. The most recent being 7 years ago.
Recently, she has gotten so so much worse. She’s no longer an addict, but has these MASSIVE mood swings where she lashes out at me and everybody in my house, or runs away (she always comes back the next day), or claims we are all out to get her and owe her apologies. She says things like - “I am clearly unwanted in this family”, “I am hated and targeted by all of you,” “Nobody appreciates me”, and even vague threats of not wanting to live anymore.
Keep in mind, she has also recently stolen close to $1,000 from my 16 year old sister (for bills, not gambling) and soo much money from me and my dad over the years. She never repays us. She continually has these episodes where it legitimately feels like she is possessed. (it will be over stupid little things or one of us trying to call her out on her behavior.)
She claims she’s been tested for bipolar and all that, but she is also a compulsive liar. Now, obviously she needs professional help - and we’ve had minir “interventions” with her - but she refuses/freaks out every time it’s mentioned.

149,"WARNING: this post is pretty long. 😆

Hey! So I need some advice as well as new perspectives to this issue I'm having with my anxiety. Possible coping mechanisms would be greatly appreciated as well. This is really starting to screw with my life in the way that it prevents me from being the best I can be and I want to change that. I'm 19 if that helps. 

what I'm struggling with a lot currently is my perspective of my future and jobs/being employed. Even though I'm still at the stage where I'm still quite dependent on my parents and an infant in the work world, I feel this immense pressure to be absolutely amazing right out of the gate. 

Also that if I choose the 'wrong career', that my whole life will crumble and be over and there's nothing I can do about it. I do have a general idea of what I'm interested in and want to do, but there's always that voice in the back of my head saying, ""HA, but what if you do all this schooling/training for said thing only for the market for it to be completely dead? hmm??? all that for nothing. what if it's not good enough to support you and so you have to resort to something you have no interest in at all and you end up having your soul eaten out of you with only a shell remaining?"" 

this last thing really chokes me up metaphorically. now I do wanna say beforehand that if you are an employer or anyone who hires/helps hire in the hiring process, there is NOTHING wrong with you and in no way am I trying to insinuate that you're this horrible person or anything. just so you know. But this last thing I REALLY struggle with is that I have this warped outlook on this sort of thing. Like the employer/interviewer/whoever ultimately does the hiring is this really mean, monster-like person who ultimately conspires to Make my life a living hell. yeah you aren't defined by your job, but at the same time you technically need one to support yourself in the world.

Even though I know that all that isn't true and really dramatic... But no matter how much I try and tell myself that, these thoughts always tend to come back. And honestly, I'm tired. im tired of almost constantly feeling like a prisoner and would like to be free for once. I can never truly enjoy my life this way. It feels as if the world is against me and that I'm destined to crash and crumble.

NOTE: it's not responsibility I'm afraid of. I want to be able to rely on myself and not weigh anyone else down.

it's ok if you don't really respond. I mean if someone can relate to how I'm feeling, that alone means a lot to me and know that at least you're not alone. 😊",25Nov2017,4

154,"I've always had a problem with bad breath, ever since middle school. 

Here's a little breakdown:

**Teeth**

* I brush at least once a day (in the morning)

* Even if I brush my teeth at night, I will still have bad breath in the morning

* After I'm done brushing my teeth in the morning, even if I don't eat anything and drink water, I will have bad breath shortly after; sometimes the bad breath is still there right after I'm done

* If I ate something with onion or garlic, the taste/smell will stay in my mouth for a few days, even after brushing my teeth twice a day

**Tongue**

* I have a tongue scraper on back of my toothbrush that I use every time I brush my teeth

* I always notice white gunk on my tongue, which I suspect is the main cause of my bad breath, but even scraping doesn't get it all out. If I scrape for too long, my tongue will start bleeding, and there will still be some gunk left (although significantly less)

* I'm also pretty sure that gunk comes back throughout the day, so my tongue is never a clear pink

**Floss**

* I'll admit I don't floss. I'm going to try really hard to do this regularly, but like I said, I feel like the source of my bad breath is mostly my tongue (I can feel it in my mouth, sort of like a thickness)

I constantly have to be chewing gum in order to keep my bad breath under control, but it can get really inconvenient (and expansive) at times.

Now, her family is Italian and very tight-knit. My family is French with Jewish roots and very tight-knit. We have had instances in the past where family members have lived together under one room indefinitely. My aunt, her husband, and her kids lived with my grandparents for a very long time. It wasn't a situation where my aunt didn't work and didn't contribute. It just wasn't a big deal for family to live together past 18. Same with my in-laws family.

Anyway, my mother, who is in her late 60's will be coming to live with us in the new house. We have a third bedroom that she likes, and she has agreed to pitch in a little by paying the cable and internet bills, doing some cooking on days we can't, and watching the pets when we are out of town. She has never lived alone, she is divorced, and my other sibling never visits. 

Now my wife and I are fine with this. We like her company and it's a big enough house that we won't be in each other's way.

We don’t hit each other, or anything of that nature, but it’s got me thinking that perhaps we differ in fundamental opinions. Sometimes I really think she lacks empathy for other human beings in difficult situations, and that bugs me because my entire career is centred around treating individuals who are in those situations and ensuring their mental well being.

She tells me she’s only joking, but still gets mad at me when I’m uncomfortable because I “make her out to seem like a terrible human being”. One specific example I can think of is me sending her a video featured on here recently about the opioid epidemic in America. I found it very sad that the cashiers were so doped up they stopped responding to customers altogether and seemed very lost. Her answer to this was calling them idiots and telling me she’d give them 1 dollar to pay for her goods but then telling them she’d actually given them a 20 (so she could get more money out of them). I asked her if she was joking and she said no, and asked me at what point people need to be held accountable for their actions. I told her I sent her the video because it made me feel empathy for the evident addicts. She then got mad at me and told me I’m making her seem like a horrible person who doesn’t care about anyone else.

I had a lot of counseling since I was 12 and never brought up me being molested until I was around 15 and was ready to do something about it. My counselor set up a meeting with CPS. I met with them told them all the details and mentioned he had a daughter who was a little older that told me she went through it too. After that day was done we received a phone call being told nothing could be done because there was little evidence. I'm 18 now I'm not satisfied that I had nothing done for my experience and still want justice. Is there anything I can do now to make that happen or is it to late?,25Nov2017,3

178,"I'm mid 20s/Male.
My two half brothers, 14 and 12, have been in a shitty situation since they were toddlers. Our mom is emotionally unstable and has mild intellectual disability, and she just lets them do whatever they want so they don't walk out on her. She is gainfully employed as a maid and a waitress, and she provides for them, but she has major problems telling them no.

I've been picking up my brothers for weekend visits 1-2 times a month since I moved out, but she wouldn't let me do so from mid September until now because she thought I reported her to CPS. My youngest brother's condition has worsened a lot since then:

My younger brother has Dx's of ADHD, Asperger's, ODD, and Dyslexia. He started having major problems with things like hygiene, sleeping, and antisocial behavior at the start of his current school year. He was made to repeat the 6th grade after failing classes, and he's also started being friends with the wrong crowd. He used to be insecure about 14yo bro being smarter than him and decided he didn't want to try at all in school because of it. He has a thug persona now and gets suspended for bullying and pranking his classmates. He's also been banned from the stores around home for shoplifting keychains and candy.

I'm going to make a small list of the stuff I want advice on:

- He doesn't shower or change his clothes unless he is yelled at, and then he doesn't use soap when he does. Instead of not understanding the need (his problem as a smaller child), he is just willingly refusing now to make people mad at him. What worked before was to have 14yo bro or me in there helping him--he had a good time and eventually started washing himself without help. But that strategy just doesn't work anymore. He gets violent. Not to mention that 14yo bro is at an age where it's awkward to shower with his brother regardless, so he also runs away until after it blows over.

- Not sleeping right - He stays up until after 1am playing games and makes a huge scene if anyone stops him. He goes to school sleep deprived, which makes everything worse for him, and he falls asleep in class. She doesn't want to take away the Xbox even though it absolutely works in getting him to fall asleep at a normal time after he stops being pissed off about it.

- Not doing reading/homework. The only time he'll do any of this is for our mom in the morning when he is still calm and sane, and by then it's too late to get it done before class starts. He's going to fail 6th grade again at this rate. I can get him to do it when he's at my apartment with no video games, and it works only until he gets majorly distracted by something.

- Hanging out with bad crowd. His new friends are older kids who do the same things he does. From the way he describes them, they're not his real friends. They tell stories about how they steal cars and kill people, and they laugh at him when he believes them. His mental illness makes him very gullible like that. They have a bunch of rules like no talking to white people, and he's mean to his white classmates because of it. Many of the things he gets in trouble for are their dares or things he does for respect. He showed me a text from a girl around age 14 who was asking him to get her some weed. I'm afraid he's going to do something seriously illegal if he keeps hanging out with this group, but he thinks adults like the therapist he sees are just telling him he's not cool enough to have friends.

He is getting professional help, but it's not a cure-all. I haven't talked about my other brother much in this post. He is extremely introverted, but he largely makes the ""right"" choices in life. He hates his other brother and avoids him as much as possible. The two fight constantly when he can't do that.",25Nov2017,9

186,"Ever since I was in middle school I've wanted to do something important in life. I'm in my 20's now and don't think about it much but from time to time it still crosses my mind. I've tried writing books and playing in bands but they never seemed to go anywhere or I lost interest fast. It's more enjoyable to me to just relax and live a normal life, working and listening to music, watching movies. I guess I'm a better art enthusiast than artist. Based on my life background people have told me I should be some type of artsy person whatever the format may be, and I even like to dress fashionably from time to time, a little more so than casual people. Based on my uniqueness of clothes people say I must be a musician or something. But I'm not and I kind of feel fake or like a wanna be.

Acting always appeal to me and musical icons in general. I suppose I like to have my own identity and it makes me stand out. I'm a really great guy, I've had a lot of friends and I've lived a good life. It's just sometimes I aspire to be something more, somebody important in the world, like an author or motivational speaker or something along those lines. I don't know if I would consider it a delusion as much as a dream, but I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I'll probably never become anyone big and I'm fine with that, it's just that it would be nice to be the guy that became big in life. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? Anyone want to share thoughts and opinions? Is it okay to still dress like a somebody while not generally being someone important or significant? 
I'd also like to add I would like to have some things to describe myself as. A self image or identity. Kind of like how Slash is a guitarist and wears a top hat. I'd like to have something similar, an identity. But I don't want to seem like a weird person or socially awkward. I just want to have something more to me than a job to make money.

I need serious help here and I appreciate your advice.    

To give you some context, I just turned 40, I'm rather physically  healthy, and I'm a single male living in Canada. I have a BSc and MSc in Mechanical eng and now I'm doing my MBA (I have a few professional designations too which all seem worthless now).

I'm asking in this particular subreddit because I want to get my Bachelors Degree in Philosophy (it's basically a pre-law degree) and go from there. My only problem is that the benefits don't extend to graduate students, so after my Bachelors I would have to start paying full tuition. I have been fascinated with philosophy and law most of my life and feel that this would be a huge opportunity for me to pursue my dreams.

212,"**BACKGROUND / MINI-VENT SECTION** 

I was raised in deep shit. This is a fact that I'm working hard to deal with the ramifications of. I'm not one for dwelling on it, but it's something I have to face. 

Describing the circumstances that made my childhood a living hell seems too morbid, so instead, I'll describe the psychological effects or psychological side of my childhood. 

There were many things, but basically two main things:

1) Being extremely paranoid about, extremely (irrationally) fearful of, and restlessly anxious about everything, but specifically about **just being at home**. 

2) Truly feeling like whatever I was as a person was worthless, stupid, useless, and plainly *wrong*. 

*CAUSES*

1) Anything that I did that my dad found dissatisfactory, (and he found 99% of what I did dissatisfactory) he beat the shit out of me for (and in creative ways, too, props to him. I'll never forget the day he unfolded extremely portable chairs and threw them at me). Over time this developed into me worrying intensely about doing everything perfectly or suffering the physical-abuse consequences. I don't want to get into the details, but it should suffice to say that I was terrified to my PRIMAL CORE of just being in my house and attempting to do anything at all when my dad was around. 


2) What was worse than the physical abuse was the psychological warfare. **He knew how to manipulate the shit out of me.** Despite all the daily abuse I was still convinced that my father was a cool guy that I had to work hard to impress and please, and that i pretty much deserved all the ""discipline"" because I was actually stupid. Through abuse, insults, mind games, abuse, lies, false promises, abuse, emotional abuse, blackmail, deception, conditioning, abuse, and abuse, he convinced me that I wasn't good enough. That I was stupid and deserved all the abuse he served me. With all the innocence of a kid I was convinced of this. I was convinced that I must be a real piece of shit that can't do anything right because why else would someone as cool as my dad be so angry at me all the time? It was heartbreaking then. It is heartWRENCHING now. 


**THE BEGINNING OF DISHONESTY** 

After 5 years of living with my dad like this, in my 4th grade year of school, I became visibly depressed. Before it just seemed like I was an awkward kid. But now you could see that my will to live had vanished. 

People started to notice. Things started to escalate. The truth about what my life with my dad was like was coming dangerously close to surfacing for all to see, and I DEFINITELY DID NOT WANT THAT. 

Long story short, I decided to start lying about everything. I had already developed good lying skills to cover up many abuse-related things over the years, so at that point I decided to lie about EVERYTHING. Who I was up until that point was *clearly* a failure, so I had the idea to make someone up. To make myself a dynamic person. I decided to change myself based on what I was after or what I wanted to accomplish. 

And to my astonishment, I was good at this. Eventually people stopped suspecting anything. I had more friends now. I had a reputation for being a smart and rambunctious kid at school now; I would get in trouble for talking too much and creating riots. I started getting into fights. I started gaining notoriety. I stopped getting bullied. I answered every question in class. I, externally, seemed like a normal, abuse-free kid, and that was my goal. 

As I got older started wanting things for myself. I didn't want to just cover up anymore. And I moved out of my dads place in 7th grade. So I would lie and lie and lie and pretend to get my way. Pretend to be dumb only to strike back with unexpected intensity later. I would feign docility then attack mercilessly. I would fake overconfidence and get away with all kinds of shit. I would lie just to LIE and get away with it. I would stare into  people and watch as their stupid faces conformed to my veiled intentions. 


Middle school was awesome. 

The first two years of high school were stellar. 

**The felling of emptiness and depression never went away fully. But at least now I could do things to distract me from the void, and from the boredom** 


**DECIDING TO CHANGE**

In my junior year of high school the same debilitating depression from earlier in life came back full force. I did not understand why. I had it all. Friends. Girls. Drugs. Excellent grades. A sick gaming PC. Puberty kept gradually blessing me physically. And yet, I felt like utter shit.


Over the course of a year, I looked into it. Started reading, watching videos, meditating, etc. I came to the conclusion that: **having to pretend my whole life and never addressing my childhood issues had left me dead inside**. 

I could not feel for others. I felt nothing for myself, only hatred, if anything. Everything was boring. I felt purposeless. I was desensitized to everything from years of seeking thrills as distractions and, especially at that point, from doing drugs. 

This made me more depressed. What the fuck was I? And why couldn't I be happy without having to pretend? And why didn't I love anyone? Why didn't I love even myself? Did I even feel anything? 

I gave up on school, on universities like UCLA, on friendships, on girls, on everything (it really wasn't a huge deal to me. I don't care about many things) and committed to fixing myself. 

**And here I am, almost 3 years laters, treading this same lonely, hard, tedious, sad path.**


**THE QUESTION**

I've been meditating for a while now. 

It seems like the capacity to generate the emotions necessary to create bonds with people are non-existent in me. I don't care about anyone. I don't care about what anyone does, or what they think about me. But at least now I care about myself. 

I've decided to stop pretending and that leaves me blatantly unable to make friends or do much of ANYTHING, really. Well, I still do pretend because I do get bored and want things like sex and companionship, but I really, really try not to. That's left me pretty fucking lonely over the last 3 years, especially because I've been moving around so much. 


**QUESTION**:

Should I accept that I am meant to be a lonely bastard and stop pretending? I fear this will leave me alone forever. 

Should I seek therapy for my childhood shit (and everything since) or should I just keep meditating? 

Should I find a way to generate things like love and compassion? Or would that be incongruent with who I'm meant to be? Is it even possible? 

Or should I just keep pretending forever and accept that my emptiness will never go away?

218,"I’m mostly a digital artist but I’m becoming more and more interested in working with clay. Problem is I have no idea what clay to go for. 
We used a type of clay in school that you would have to wrap in a plastic bag with wet papers to keep it from drying and you had to “glue” the different parts together and I hated it. 
I would like something that’s easy to work with and it would be nice if I could paint it as well.

219,"Hello, reddit. I'm writing this post because I need advice about what I should do in my current situation. I need to give you guys some background information first. I am 17f, currently living with my dad, 45. My mom passed away in July,  about a month before my last birthday.  We were living in the southern USA where my mom's family lives when this happened. We never had the best relationship with my mom's family, so a few weeks after my mom's passing my dad and I moved to the northern USA where his family lives.  We moved next door to our cousins. This cousin we moved next to, let me just call him B. B was probably my dad's best friend growing up, he looks at B like an older brother. He almost hero worships B. B is kind of a horrible person,  even though my dad doesn't recognize it. B cheated on his wife with her best friend, he's an asshole, he's a manipulator, he treats his wife like shit, he lies constantly, (just like my dad does.) B is also on meth, and god knows what else.  B and his wife have two kids,  and are trying to get custody of one of our cousin's babies because she was on meth herself. B and my dad started working together when we got up here,  because my dad had nowhere else to work and nobody was hiring. They started hanging out together more and more until they became pretty much inseperable. B has convinced my dad to move somewhere 8 hours away with him and his family,  after they get custody of thethe two babies, which should be some time in January.  But, I plan on moving in with my grandma and uncle when they leave, or trying to move in with my LDR boyfriend (18).  B and my dad are in said place they want to move to now, supposedly somebody from that place has a job for B and my dad, and they're there for an interview and to look for a house. Meanwhile,  B's family and the babies are moving into my dad and I's house to save money.  Now, the main reason I'm writing this post... I have reason to believe that B has gotten my dad addicted to meth or whatever B is on himself,  and is manipulating my dad into doing whatever B wants him to. I notice my dad has become much thinner, he isn't sleeping right, he seems tired constantly, and he isn't eating much.  He also isn't acting like he normally does.  I have asked my dad if he's on anything, he swears up and down that he isn't.  That doesn't really matter though, because as I said before, he is a huge liar. So, reddit, I apologize if this is all jumbled, or if it doesn't make sense. I'm just really scared for my dad and anxious about what the hell is actually going on. I need advice on what to do here,  besides move out to my grandma and uncle's place, or with my boyfriend when they leave. I dont want to call the cops or take any sort of legal action, because they are my family. I dont want them in prison or anything like that, I just want them to seek help. Thank you in advance, reddit. ",25Nov2017,6
221,"Basically I'm utterly dependant on my abusive boyfriend, I need a new life away from him but I don't know how. 

I have crippling debt. I have no income or money whatsoever. I live with my boyfriend who pays rent etc and this is the only reason I can't leave. 

I had a really good paying job but left in March because of my mental health. I've been trying to get a new one but my mental health and his abusive ways are making it impossible (I get loads of interviews, I've only made in to two but got both jobs, had to leave both jobs after a day) believe me I'm trying. My anxiety has just gotten so bad and my boyfriend sabotaged my opportunities by bringing me down so much I have a breakdown literally as I need to go to an interview or start a new job. I can't even get help for my mental health issues because I'm living with my boyfriend unlawfully so can't provide proof of address to register with a doctor (I have tried to)

222,"I’m not really sure what I saw today and I just need advice on if this is something serious or not. 

I was at an IHOP having lunch with my 4 yr old. We were seated next to this guy and his (I assumed) brother. The guy seemed to be about late twenties to early thirties and the kid was maybe 10 or 11. I really didn’t think much of it and mainly was focused on having a good time with my child. 
        The thing that caught my attention was the conversation the two were having. The kid was talking about how old his mom and about his family. He kept saying things like, “well MY mom does this....”  or “when I was younger, my grandma did this”. So I figured the two aren’t related after all. Maybe the guy was a neighbor or baby sitting. I did notice the older guy kept giggling at the kid and they would start almost whispering their conversations. I started feeling really weird about this situation. My daughter asked to use the restroom a few minutes after I notice this. As I start to grab her to head toward the bathroom, I notice that the older gentleman is stroking the kids arm then starts holding his hand. I have no idea what to think. By the time I talked myself into saying something or at least ask the kid if he is ok, they had left. 

So.... what the heck did I see here? Maybe I’m just misunderstanding the situation? Should I do something about this? ",25Nov2017,3

227,"In the last few years my younger brother, now in his early 20s, started acting very weird, stopped talking to the whole family and became extremely unhappy and serious, even if we had a pretty close relationship and talked a lot and shared interests before. He completely closed off. 

Our parents tend to be very emotionally neglectful so they didn't do anything besides just asking if he was ok (he always replied that he was), we had no idea what to do and didn't want to force him to talk to us and just let him be.

After a few months he tried committing suicide. At first it looked like an accident, he had to be taken to the hospital and it took him a few months to heal because he fractured a few bones; then he confessed to my parents that it was a suicide attempt. He said that for a long time he felt like everything was pointless and nothing mattered and like we didn't love him.They told me but I don't know if he knows that both me and our sister know it. They offered to make him see a therapist but he refused, said he only wanted to forget and move on.

He's been extremely functional and independent despite the injury, he caught up with school work and managed to graduate with amazing grades, and even decided to attend university (he didn't want to do it before despite being a great student, wanted to work and move out immediately).

However, he still doesn't talk to us at all and shuts down all attempts at communication, and only acts ""normal"" with his friends. It's like he lives on his own even if he's here. I miss him terribly, we all do and we worry about him constantly, but we have no idea what to do. I don't even know what I could talk about with him, and I feel horrible for not being there for him enough during his recovery, but I was so scared and he didn't want anyone around.

I think he hates us too much and I'm scared that if I ever tried to talk to him about this he'd tell me to shut up and that he doesn't want to have anything to do with me. I feel guilty because I've always been a problem child because of my own issues and maybe he resents me for getting more attention from our parents, and that he thinks I'm an idiot.

I don't want to force him, I know he has the right to cut all ties with us if he wants, because our parents are objectively toxic and we both had to go through a lot because of them, and if he does i I hope he'll be happier and won't be in pain anymore. But I miss him terribly and don't want to risk losing him forever if I can do something, literally anything to resolve this. What should I do?",25Nov2017,3

230,"My dog is a female boxer named Sadie, she's soon to be 12 years old (next April) and she's going downhill fast. About a month ago she started walking around like she was in serious pain, and stopped wanting to play with my puppy who she was always active with before. We gave her doggy painkillers because it looked like a back problem, but she would just become a zombie when she was on them so we took her to the vet a few days later. He said it was arthritis, common in older mastiffs apparently, and that she would just have to suffer through it, that all we can do is give painkillers to her. Well She started getting worse about 2 weeks ago. She stopped eating so much and started peeing blood. We took her to the vet again and he gave us some antibiotics that seem to help, though she still pees blood sometimes. He thought it was a urinary tract infection, but we really don't know. Come the last few days, she absolutely refuses to eat anything that isn't almost liquid and throws up almost anything she ingests. I think she wants to die at this point, and is deliberately starving herself, though I really don't know. She has a doggy door and when I go to bed around midnight every night she's just standing outside on the porch at the edge of the light staring at the fence, but I always find her inside sleeping in the hallway near the master bedroom every morning. I don't want her to starve to death, she wasn't fat to begin with and now she seriously is starting to look like some of those horrible pictures of holocaust survivors right out of prison camps after being starved. I don't know what I should do to feed her, we've tried chicken broth and she ate the broth and the chicken chunks in it, then just threw it all up a while later. Today the only thing shes eaten, drank really, was sugar water. I even offered her bbq chips, a really good smelling steak, the steak bone after I was done with it, canned chicken, canned dog food, kibble that I mushed into an almost applesaucy texture, she won't even touch it. She sniffs it and walks away. She's going to starve to death and I don't know how to get her to eat.",25Nov2017,2

234,"I rarely get sick, but when I do, I’m miserable.

It started off as congested sinuses and a runny nose. The next day it had caused ear pressure and pain. A nurse practitioner diagnosed it as an ear infection. I’ve been taking cefdinir every 12 hours and ibuprofen 800mg every 6 hours or more.

The only thing I’ve eaten today is a little vegetable soup and a few sips of Gatorade. I took both the cefdinir capsule and ibuprofen around 4pm. Around 5pm I felt nauseated and eventually threw up the soup and Gatorade. I felt better after and sipped the Gatorade once again. About 10 min ago (6pm) I threw up again! All Gatorade.

I didn’t think this was related to the meds but I suppose it might be. I know it’s recommended to take antibiotics and pain relievers with food, but they’ve never caused nausea, vomiting, or stomach discomfort before. 

What should I eat/drink? I don’t like throwing up and would like to avoid it as much as possible, especially since I’m already slightly dehydrated. This issue is trumping my ear discomfort &amp; congestion by a long shot. ",25Nov2017,2

237,"So, this is an overall problem in my life, but there is something specific that it could very well screw up.

So, I've known this girl, let's call her Jenny, since we were in primary school. We've fallen in and out of friendship over the years, but ever since last year, we've been really close. She was dating a friend at the time, and over the summer they both went through a really rough breakup (turns out he's an abusive scumbag). She's also Bi, and it seems like since the breakup, she's a little sick of guys at the moment

Here's the thing: I think I love her. I have genuinely loved her since I first met her, and she's the only person I've ever felt comfortable around. Even if she isn't interested, I'm fine staying friends, because of how much she means to me.

My problem is, I over analyze everything. This week we got high together and it was fine, we watched some TV, I made food, we played video games... But after she left, I couldn't help but think what I always think when somebody leaves my house... ""She fucking hates you, she had a terrible time, she probably never wants to see you again"".

Every little detail, every brief pause, every joke that didn't land... I just felt horrible. I want to rip out my brain, it doesn't work correctly, I'm fucking sick of this. Every time I have something good, I screw it up by overanalyzing.

I guess I am asking for 2 things, really. How do I stop overthinking things? Any tips on how to tell her I have feelings for her?

239,"I am currently studying medicine, and it's been such a weird experience. I sometimes feel like I could actually keep on going and eventually my personality will ""mold"" into it, but there are days like today when I feel completely alien to the whole thing.

Academically I'm doing good, but my little secret is that I always cram way too intensely before exams, while I see most of my classmates actually studying daily, and doing so passionately, while I have to really push myself to do it, most of the time anyway.

And well, there's also the social aspect of it. I don't feel like anyone at medical school actually ""knows"" me, or is *like me*. Everyone has this very ""empirical"" personality, while I'm sort of the opposite of that. A lot of people at my school think I'm clever, but that actually makes me feel guilty, since most of the time I think I'm just sort of faking it all. I just engage in polite chit-chat with most people, and have even dated a girl from school, but again, I feel like I'm just not being myself with others.

Now, there have been times when I think ""well, this is actually pretty cool, maybe I could really see myself doing this for a while"", but those feelings are usually short-lived. There are times that I really enjoy reading about some subjects, such as those related with fertility or embriology, but as a whole, I don't feel truly fascinated.

What really fascinates me, though, is computer science. I spent most of my childhood in front of a computer, teaching myself programming and trying to grasp some of the theoretical concepts behind computers. I'm by all means an amateur, and have lately ""forgotten"" this hobby of mine because of medical school. I'm not sure, but I think that in the end what really drags me towards the idea of being a ""computer guy"" is it being a low-profile thing; I fantasize about having a more relaxed and laid-back life and I sometimes think doing computer related stuff would be just that...

So, why did I go into medicine? I'm not sure; perhaps it was because my brother is a doctor, and because my younger self thought it would be something more worthwhile than computers. Perhaps also because I thought that maybe I could fit into the sciency aspect of it. So once I got into it, I just kept on going, and going, and now I'm halfway through and about to start the clinical aspect of it, and I'm not really sure about what would be the wisest thing to do next.

Right now I don't care about anything more than living a laid-back life where I have just enough money and can spend most of my time with people I love. Would that justify doing something drastic about my current situation (changing careers, but not necessarily getting into college again)? Or perhaps I could just start something by the side and hope that it eventually will get me out of this? (like a small internet business, I don't know). Debt is not a problem, as I'm receiving my education practically for free, and I don't mind the time I've invested into this whole thing already. I just want to feel excited about my life again. I'm about to be 23, by the way.

243,"First off, I'm gonna preface this by saying that my mom isn't struggling financially. She has a decent amount of money, lives in a very nice house in a nice city, and has three adult children with stable jobs.

As far as I know, my mom has been taking advantage of at least three people in her life: her retired boyfriend with a good pension, and her two filipino friends who work in this country as nannies for rich families.

These three people are incredibly nice, but too nice for their own good – they let people take advantage of them, and freely give away money to anyone who asks for it, including my mom.

My mom often comes home bragging about how her boyfriend paid for dinner for her, or how her friends paid for her gas and meal. Today, she invited her two filipino friends to our Christmas skiing trip, because, in her words, ""she wants them to contribute money to our trip.""

I've kept quiet before because I didn't know what to say, and I'm used to being the child that no one listens to because I'm the youngest, but at this point, I fucking lost it. I didn't call her a gold digger per se but I told her to stop bragging about using her friends for money because it sounds wrong and weird and shows that she doesn't care about their relationship, but their money. She got mad at me, we got into a fight, and now I'm not sure if she'll ever listen to me about this topic again.

I know I got emotional, but I'm seriously worried not only about my mom's moral failures but for her safety. She has been receiving threatening text messages from her boyfriend's family members, calling her a ""gold digger"" – which I had to admit is true. It really sounded like the person was out for her blood.
