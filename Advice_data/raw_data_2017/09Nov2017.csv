1,"We've been dating for several years, and my parents are quite conservative and judgmental. They made a judgment about him when they first met and decided that they don't like him. They've never liked me or any of my sisters dating - for example, they disliked my sister's boyfriend for a very long time until they finally got over it. 

Because of this, I've withheld lots of information about my life from my parents. I'm not even sure they know that I'm dating anyone, much less living with him. They think I live alone. And they live less than an hour away from me.

With the holidays coming up (and family obligations), I am feeling quite stressed over this. My parents have done things to lose my trust before but I still talk to them and attend family events. If they knew I was living with my boyfriend, I don't think they would just abandon me (I think I could deal with that). I think they would try to make my life miserable and shame me. And they visit the city I live in often enough that I might have trouble avoiding them or going no-contact.

What do I do??",09Nov2017,2

3,"I've suffered from severe social anxiety since I was about 15 years old (I am currently 21 years old). This has caused me to have no friends and absolutely no chance with women or dating. Recently, I've tried to interact with people, but my social skills have diminished to the point that I seem like more of a nuisance when I attempt to talk to people. I've reached a level of loneliness that has become unbearable. How can I get out of this hole I've dug myself into? Does anyone have any suggestions or advice? ",09Nov2017,2
4,"Hi!
So there's this guy who I think possibly likes me, but even if he doesn't, it wouldn't matter, I don't have any interest in seeing him at all. We met are a month ago. He's a nice guy and all, it's just I'm not interested in him even as a friend. He keeps on texting me, you know the usual how are yous etc, but also keeps asking me to go out with him, and recently he's even asked me if I wanted to go to his place. I want to just stop talking to him and stop meeting up with him, basically like we never met. I feel that it would be too cruel to just say I don't want to see him anymore, and besides what would I say, we're not dating or anything and how am I even supposed to bring that up? I mean we haven't been meeting up for that long to make it seem understandable, it would be a bit weird to just say I don't want to see you after seeing the person 3 times outside of school, at least i think so. And ghosting is pretty cruel too. How do I get out of this situation and stop seeing him?
Thank you so much!",09Nov2017,3
5,"So I have been going to interviews here and there for a couple of months while I near the end of my degree (I finish my last exam at the end of this month). Throughout the process I narrowed down all the companies I interviewed with to two potential companies.

Company 1: Last interview was nearly 2 weeks ago. I sent my CV in unsolicited as they are based in an area I really want to move to and the lifestyle would be great. The General Manager emailed back and was actually (coincidence) a friend of mine from high school. He liked my CV and we got along great so he was keen to have me on board, as the company is really small and he was becoming overloaded in his role. I met with him and a couple of others first, and then advanced to a meeting with him and the owner. They said that they would have to carve out a new role for me which would be extremely varied, and they would get back to me when they figured out how they could make it work. I was excited, but not that optimistic that it would work out- like I said the company is very small and they would need to reshuffle a lot to create my role. Last week they came back to me saying it was unlikely that they would be able to create a role for me this year, but perhaps in the New Year.

Company 2: Interview was last Friday - large, successful company that had advertised a position on a job seeker website for a Sales Administrator. Straight forward hours, straight forward work, and friendly, long-standing staff with great attitudes. They rang me on Tuesday (2 days ago) to offer me the job, and came in $8000 above my bottom line, with a pay review in 3 months. I accepted this role

My dilemma is that after I accepted the role with C2, I emailed and told C1 that I was accepting another role and thanks for their time. The owner of C1 called me this morning and told me that my friend the GM had resigned (not in protest- he was poached by another company), and they would want me to take over the general management of the entire company. That is an extremely amazing opportunity for someone coming straight out of a degree, ESPECIALLY in my industry. 

HOWEVER, the package they offer is not competitive. It is less money than what C2 is offering by quite a bit (but they offer a car). I just think that the salary they offer is laughable considering the scope and responsibility of the role they are now offering. I told them my bottom line (in terms of salary) when we interviewed for the lesser position and they offered me that - my bottom line - for this new bigger position.

C1 wants to set up a meeting tomorrow where I may be able to negotiate a higher salary from them.

My question is, what do I do ?? - I have already accepted (verbally, but not signed anything- I haven’t even seen the contract yet) the sales role with C2. On the other hand, C1 is offering an incredibly varied and coveted role, but with a poor salary (a joke, frankly) and I feel guilty even going to another meeting with C1 after being offered a job by C2 so quickly, easily and with so much friendliness, which I then verbally accepted.

8,"I'm currently 19, in my 3rd semester at a state university, sub-2.0 gpa, failing most of my classes because I don't go to most of them.
I live with a roommate off campus, and I'm lucky enough that my parents are paying for most of my tuition and my apartment. 

I don't really know where to go from here. Most days I just stay inside and play video games with friends. I think it's selfish of me to stay in school and waste my parents money on that, especially knowing that I probably won't finish a degree in the near future. I've never had a clear idea of what I what to do for a living, and I think this is why I'm never motivated enough to go to my classes. I think if I found a career that I actually enjoyed and wanted to strive for, I would be happy and go to all my classes, but currently I don't know what I want to do in life. The only things that interest me is cooking and eSports. I'm not sure if I would ever want to be a chef considering how hard you have to work and I have no clue what sort of path would lead me into something in eSports. I really don't have any sort of plans for the near future, so I'm not sure what to do, if I should stay in school, if I should get a retail job, if I should stay in my apartment or move back in with my parents a state away.",09Nov2017,2

14,"Hi Reddit! Firstly the obligatory 'this is a throwaway' as too many people IRL know my username.

I own a house and rent to people that I've found through work. One of them, we'll call ""Andy"", I get along with great. The other, ""Brett"", is difficult, to say the least. Both are great tenants, paying on time and having a baseline of respect, but Brett is a little harder to get to be a team player. More often than not I feel like Brett's mom instead of his landlord. General things such as putting dishes into the dishwasher that you use instead of the sink, using coasters, throwing away trash instead of letting it build up. 

Many of these I've expressed as being important to remember as we have animals that get up to no good when people aren't watching. With two of the animals having digestive issues, it can get stressful to make sure everything is out of reach before leaving the house. Occasionally when I call Brett out on it he'll grumble and do what I ask, but sometimes he'll come back with a snarky remark along with ""I'll do it later"", in which later never comes.

The latest issue has been that Brett will turn up the AC or down the heater, depending on the season, to keep the house cooler. Summer? wants the house at 64. Winter? Turns down the heat to 66. I've told Brett that the thermostat is on a timer and requested for him to not touch it as the AC bill gets atrocious, but as Andy and Brett pay a flat rate each month it does not seem to phase Brett. It is getting colder now for winter, and I'm not sure how much more I can take of Brett turning down the heat. 

I have many severe medical issues, all of which Andy and Brett are aware of. Part of this includes having limited ability to handle temperature changes and being unable to keep up a warm body temperature. Because of this I often keep long pants and socks on to stay warm. However, with Brett continuously keeping the inside temperature so cold it makes me feel sick. More than that, I just physically cannot keep up picking up after Brett as he continues to live without concern for others in the house. 

Its a looped issue: I can't let it pile up as it'll risk getting animals sick or myself sick, but I also can't keep picking things up as I'll become (more of) a pushover and still get more sick. I'm at my wits end. I've tried talking to Brett but he gets defensive and shuts down on what I say. Andy is no help as he is more of a pushover than I am.

Reddit, how can I get my point across to Brett? How can I re-claim my home?",09Nov2017,2
15,"Looking for a bit of advice. I've gone to the hospital for heartburn I'm pretty prone to indigestion so I've modified my diet significantly in the last year but it still pops up. 

Now my problem is a couple years ago, a woman staying at one of the hotels I was working at came to the front desk to complain about really bad heartburn. That night she died of a heart attack. So whenever I get heartburn, even though I'm a perfectly healthy woman in her 20s, I start to panic. Which in turn makes it worse as you can imagine. My rational thoughts are really no weapon to the physiological stress I end up going through. The only thing that helps is laying down and trying to sleep and relaxing my heart. 

Anyone have any tips or experience anything similar and have advice on how you get through it? I've been to the hospital three times. They're always really caring, the service is great but waiting in the emergency room for nothing at the end of the day seems like such a waste of time. ",09Nov2017,7

18,"About 13 months ago i started going to see a Therapist every 2 weeks about sexual addiction, as it was getting out of control, ruining my life and effecting my relationship.

One of the methods of finding the roots and cause of sexual addiction is to look at the person's sexual background and history, and through this my therapist began to look at early sexual antics. 

I don't want to go too far into detail with this but it was this delving that made me recall a series of times where at the age of 6 i was forced to do things by an older teen to him and another 6 year old boy.

My Therapist helped me try to deal with this as best she could but stressed that she was a specialist in addictions and that i should try and seek another therapist to deal with this issue.

I've finished seeing the addiction therapist but i never went to see another therapist because (although i was probably being naive) i thought that i would be able to handle the revelation.

Unfortunately it's been about 9 months now since remembering my incident and i still have trouble just about every single day dealing with thinking (and trying not to think) about what happened when i was a child.

Does any one have any advice on how i can either move past what happened, forget what happened or just deal with it?
thanks.

25,"My father and I have always had a very tough relationship, ever since I was a little girl.
Without going into the minutiae, he and my mother never had a good relationship. He left us when I was 2-3 years old and then showed back up, 6 months later, with no explanation; he cheated on her multiple times throughout their 20 year marriage, and he always very distant from us - drowning himself in work. He was cold, avoidant, and had anger issues and never really made an effort to be a good dad or a good husband. My mother and I were extremely close and most of the time, I felt like I just had a single mom who was my best friend.
They finally divorced when I was 17 and he immediately married our neighbor less than 6 months later- it came out that he had been cheating on my mother with this lady for 4-5 years and it was the talk of the neighborhood. Humiliating for my mom and me. She had 3 kids and he seemed to suddenly be a family man with this stranger and his 3 step kids- something he never showed with us. Again, hurtful and humiliating.
After the divorce, my mom was diagnosed with cancer and passed away 2 years later. She was 52 and I was 21 and it was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I am an only child, so basically I turned into an orphan at that point.
He did a lot of other crappy things, but it's honestly too much to list here. After a lot of failed attempts to continue a relationship with him (since he was all I had) I decided enough was enough. I'd come to the conclusion that he's basically a horrible, selfish, angry human being that was never meant to be a dad. I decided that if I wanted to by happy, I needed to cut him out. He was the executor of my mom's will because she didn't have any other family close by, and after the estate closed a couple years later I basically told him I didn't want anything to do with him and that I was done. He has written me several letters and emails over the years, trying to justify his behavior (he literally said he left my mom when i was 2 because she ""gained a lot of weight after she had you and I wasn't attracted to her anymore."" Literally.. he said that. I kid you not.) I think the last time we actually spoke or saw each other was 2013, so at least 4-5 years ago.
It's been extremely tough (I spent every holiday alone from ages 21-27- some of the worst times of my life) but I have somehow gotten through it, and while I think I have some emotional/ mental issues from basically being an orphan and a loner and from my mom/best friend dying so young, I think I have done pretty well for myself- I graduated from college with honors, concentrated on growing my career, etc.. and a few years ago I met the love of my life... A warm, compassionate, loving man who makes me laugh and has helped me heal from my past trauma in a lot of ways. We got married, bought a house in a gorgeous neighborhood, and are expecting our first baby next year. Things are great and I am as happy as I know how to be, considering some of the things I've gone through.
So here is my dilemma. My dad recently sent me a card saying congratulations on the baby (I guess he found out through the grapevine or by stalking my social media) and that he loves me and always will, and while he didn't directly say he wanted to be involved in the baby's life, I can't help but think he want to someday meet my husband and my baby and see the life I created entirely on my own. Maybe it's because I'm a little older and more emotionally stable.. but this new sensitive motherhood/nurturing side is coming out during this pregnancy, and part of me wants to reach out to him and forgive, and give it one more chance. Maybe I can forgive him and have a dad again, and my little girl can have a grandfather on this side of the family. Maybe we can start fresh, and I can show a little grace and let bygones be bygones.
Or maybe it's a terrible idea and I need to leave the relationship closed forever.
My husband says he supports me in whatever I decide, but he is a little nervous about me opening myself up to more hurt and heartache at such a happy time in my life. On the other hand, maybe he has changed for the better and we can mend what's happened.
Does my dad deserve a second chance at a relationship with his only daughter, and now grand-baby? Or should I just close the door and keep it closed for good, and focus on being happy and creating my own family? I have to say, part of my motivation for wanting to possibly contact him again is because I almost want to rub it in his face that I have succeeded in life and am happy, despite all the crapy things he did... I know that's not the right reason but it would feel so gratifying.
What would you do in my situation? I'm open to hearing all viewpoints and advice. Sorry this is so long winded- thanks for taking the time to read.

27,"I am 17 years old, a junior in high school, and feel liket I'm caught in a lot of things. My mom (mid 40s) recently moved out of our house after 10 years of dealing with her diagnosed schizophrenia, bipolar, and anger management issues. We now lock the doors and make sure she cannot get back inside. That had been a long ongoing problem ever since I was at least 7 years old and never knew about her illnesses until I was about 13 years old. Now with her out of the house it is just me and my father (late 60s) who live here. Recently we have been butting heads often and he seems to be easily set off by things I do. Almost everyday he'll ask me to do something whilst I am already doing something else and i will ask for him to ""hold on"" or something of that sort he'll start to shout at me that I never just do anything and am a ""perpetual 8 year old"" or something else like that. Also recently I accidentally locked the doors before he came back and he was locked out for about 3 minutes and when I rushed to let him in after hearing the knocking I am told ""what are you doing"" and ""why are you like this"" and various other phrases, but the things that tend to hurt me the most are when I can hear him muttering things from downstairs or wherever when I have left the room which are thing like ""fucking idiot"" which give me a slow descending ache in my chest and sad feeling and it only seems to be getting worse with things said just 20 minutes ago like ""when will you learn"" and ""please tell me why you have to be this way"" which I usually shrug off with an ""I'm sorry"" or ""ok"". But probably the most painful things I hear and have to think of are things about my 2 half brothers (early 30s them both). I often get things like ""you are the most challenging to raise by far"" and ""your 2 brothers never did this why do you"". Comments like these make me think that I am the least favorite as I'm constantly reminded of my brothers achievements and how I don't live up to any of them at all. My brothers have been out of the house for over a decade now and my dad never seemed to have any problems or heated discussions with them ever like we have weekly, and whenever we're around either or both of them he seems much happier and interested talking to them while I am usually the butt of silly, but cumulatively humiliating and kind of hurtful jokes. I love my brothers more than anything in the world but just feel like that in the eyes of my father I am kind of the odd one out and the last hurdle that he has to get over before he can retire once i graduate in 2019 and move to the mountains (not kidding). I constantly am reminded of all the trips my bothers and my dad took back when they were my age (England, Grand Canyon, Air Shows, College Football games, Germany, Istanbul to name a few) all of which I am told of how great they were and how much fun they had and when the Germany trip happened back in like 2015 I asked if I could come and i was told ""no you wouldn't enjoy it"" but when they return I am showed photos of fabulous buildings, magnificent sculptures, and happy faces on that of them and ""how much fun I would of had"". Now i have about 1.5 years left here in this house before I move on to whatever college I will get into and be constantly reminded how expensive it is and how much I will be in debt when both of my brothers tuition were paid off almost immediately with no real hassle or bickering. And here's where my other fear begins about my mother. When she is not in a fit of rage and screaming, or one of her paranoid rants of people following her and how her car is bugged (she wont even let me speak whilst i I am in her car because of her fear of ""them"" hearing it) , she is one of the friendliest people i know and this is about 60% of the time. But, she now lives with her mom and almost certainly could not support herself on her own whatsoever. Her mother, my grandmother is in her mid 70s (only about 7 years older than my dad) can only support her for so long before eventually getting sick of her mental instability and getting her out, or passing on in whatever time she has left (shes very healthy but you know most people pass before their 90s and so on, but who knows she could live to 110 and I wish her the best health) and my dad is in that same age range and when they are both gone in 25 years or so, I will be about late 30s early 40s and be literally the only person that my mother has left, she has no friends, or anybody willing to put up with her or support her due to that other 40% of her personality. So this means that most likely I will be supporting my mother in arguably the most important years of my life until she eventually passes on as well. I just feel very weighed down and have been that way for a couple of months and have not been in the best of moods for a while. I could really use some advice, anything, just something to help me deal with all this, I am known as a funny guy at school and consistently try and make good jokes and appear very positive socially but when I return home that laughing attitude goes away and I'm left with all of what i have explained in this post and heel like I'm dragging around a ball on a chain attached to my leg and there is no key and eventually the chain gets shorter and the big heavy ball will be left for me to carry.

31,"Warning, long post incoming. Tl;dr at the end

I hate parties, I truly do. I didn’t always hate them though, when I was a little kid I was very social and loved playing with the other kids at the homeschool playgroup or Boy Scouts. But my first year in public school, 7th grade. I was ruined I suppose. I was bullied a lot, didn’t have a lot of friends, yada yada. 
My friend invited me to her birthday party that year, and I was honored to be there...until I realized I didn’t fit in. My friend was too preoccupied with her boyfriend, (which didn’t help because I had a crush on her too) and I knew nobody else there, and I was being made fun of because I was hanging out by myself, but I was too shy to talk to any of these new people

Fast forward and now I’m 20, in college, and my socializing consists of the internet, three people from high school, and the girlfriend that I was lucky to meet online. (We live in the same city). All this time of feeling outcasted has made me despise social culture. I see all these people in my school risking their livers and getting STDs just for nights of fun, and I’m disgusted by it. Call me jealous if you will, but I despise the idea and would rather keep myself clean. This isn’t just parties either, any sort of gathering with other people makes me anxious, and I avoid every one. I risked getting punished by my parents for refusing to join extracurriculars back in high school, just so I could avoid putting myself into the disgusting gathering of normal people.

And I haven’t been sad about my choices, I’m content with my lifestyle, my corner is my corner. But now that I’m almost done with my AA, I’m starting to hear about this thing called “networking”, where I apparently will have to get to know bunches of people in my education field in order to get myself a job, and now I’m doubting my future, I was hoping I could get through with minimal contact as possible. (And yes, I have a customer service job, but I don’t interact with my coworkers outside of work ever, I do what I must to make a paycheck)

Am I really screwed because I decided to take the path of solitude?

Tl;dr I despise parties and other social gatherings because of bullying in my early teen years and now I worry I won’t be able to get a career someday because I don’t network.

32,"Had a bit of a spat with a couple of friends on Facebook today.  They were angry at me for posting comments on their timelines which they thought were lecherous, inappropriate, rude and just plain creepy.

I looked at the comments again and agreed that they could be construed as being offensive or inappropriate. I removed the comments and apologised, saying that I will not post anything like it on their timelines in the future and will think twice about posting anything similar to anyone else's timelines.  Its all I can do and hope they'll be mature enough to accept my apology and forget about it.

In my defence, I have to say that I don't understand social queues and find it hard to understand when someone is hinting at something.  I find it hard to pick up on the tone of comments online, so even when people are straight up telling me to stop, I usually believe that they're just having a laugh and being sarcastic.

I fully take responsibility for what ive done, but it got me thinking of all the past times that i've posted something on peoples posts.  Comments that I thought were just innocent fun or a compliment could be thought of as creepy, inappropriate and obsessive.  Then I thought of all the times I thought someone was messing about, telling me to behave.

I realise that i've done this a lot, for many years and haven't noticed it in the slightest.  I feel like a creepy sex offender, perving on his friends and being slimy and sexually inappropriate.  In short, I feel like a monster.  I feel like ive hurt my friends by being a slimy, lecherous creep.

The main problem is I didn't know I was doing it.  I was just being me.  Does that mean that I AM a creep?  Is that just who I am?

I've been single for 10 years, never having a date or a sex life and I'm scared its because I'm a sleaze and not realising it.  I'm terrified of being alone for the rest of my life.  

How do I stop myself from being myself, if the real me is a creep?

Any advice would be welcome.  ",09Nov2017,0

I have a degree and a college diploma in social sciences. I have been interviewing for jobs in the field while I work on the oil rigs. 

The closer I get to opportunities at jobs in my field, the more my pride makes me question the choice. 

The hours here are crazy. 12-14 hours a day, 21 days straight, 3 days off. You get home, eat, shower, play on your phone for an hour, and go to bed just in time to not be dead tired for the next morning. Additionally, you get yelled at by cranky old men and treated like garbage for being young and new. The redeeming qualities are pride in hard work, growing strongee both mentally and physically, and obviously the money.

My field offers better locations to live, respectable income, and are not hours upon hours of manual labor. I'd have more free time to find a partner and pursue hobbies.

The only problem is, I keep getting anxious about him deciding he doesn't want to know anymore. This wouldn't seem like a big deal to some people but I am very scared of this being the last chance I'll have to get into a relationship and be happy. This is a recurring worry that I've had throughout the last couple of relationship/friend with benefits situations I've found myself in. I'm really scared of being in my 60's/70's without any family, completely isolated.

Okay, here's the problem:

I'm in love with Alex. Like, fell head over heels, holy-fucking-shit-this-is-actually-serious in love. I'm cool with it, and I want to start a relationship with him in the near future (I'm 16, he is 19, but considering I'm going to need to get to know him a lot better in order to get this going the age gap may jump to 17-20 or even 18-21). So, a friend of mine suggested I tell Charlie beforehand if anything serious happens. I agree, as not only is he my friend, he's also Alex's boss and I'm his student, so not telling him is most likely a bad idea. It would be better to tell him sooner than later and to basically warn him in case Alex gets into a problem for dating me for some reason because, y'know, it's pretty serious stuff to be dating your boss' student.

52,"After my grandpa died a year ago my brother (age20) has been acting not himself. He's always out late, smokes in his room, started smoking cigarettes, keeps weed in his room. It's like he doesn't care about he consequences. My parents are extremely strict so when they caught him they yelled at him and he started crying and apologizing. That was in February. 

In April he tried to take my dads car out for a drive (knowing he doesn't have A LICENSE or any driving experience) and didn't even make it out of the garage..he crashed it. He cried and cried and apologized, said he wouldn't do it again.

In the following months he continues to smoke cigarettes by the PACK, buy drugs, leave lighters in his pockets-especially after my mom keeps finding them, he doesn't try to hide it. it's like he doesn't even care to get caught! But what's weird is he begs for forgiveness and cries when he gets caught. I confronted him once, he said he feels depressed, he doesn't have friends, he's insecure because of how he looks. But I don't know if that's a real reason? Or mabye it has to do with my grandpa passing?

He does have a very big heart, i know that for sure, and he loves his family. he's not distant with us or anything, or rude or mean to us.Hes not like those bratty kids in the movies with a ""don't give a fuck"" attitude and rude to parents. He's just acting dumb. Like i smoke too, but i hide it. He also has a problem respecting property. He continues to take my stuff from my room and my parents room and use it after we tell him to stop going through our sh*t a THOUSAND times. It's like he doesn't think. 

We tell him no and he does something anyways. He cries and swears he will never smoke again, then he basically does it in our faces. He apologizes for taking our stuff and then does it again, doesn't even try to return it before we come back. he doesn't care. it doesn't make sense 

I guess what i'm wondering is, are any of these symptoms of depression? Or is he mentally ill? Does he need to see a therapist, a doctor, or does he just have a problem with authority?

However, for the past couple of years as I have become more involved and entrenched in the organization, I have noticed some very concerning things. Basically, we are supposed to be non-partisan but I've learned that that is not true and we've been supporting one political party pretty covertly.  Nothing illegal or anything but we are supposed to be as a whole, politically neutral. Our organization has been outed in the media for this recently, and it came out that we are also financially supporting another lobbyist group. Not only do I disagree with the party we've apparently aligned ourselves with, but the whole business feels underhanded and shady. This isn't what I signed up for. Maybe it was naive of me but I honestly felt like I was doing really good things by working for this organization. Now none of this information has been shared with the staff which is very odd, we know only through the media. The upper management contacted us to basically say not to worry, we're just doing the best things we can for the interests we're pushing forward. Still, no information on why or why we weren't told.

67,"Hello, I have never played hockey before but recently after going through my late fathers things I discovered he did. I am 19 and for the last 10 years he has been battling cancer and recently lost. 

He has some old brown leather goalie pads, a CCM stick and a Bauer stick along with a old school Jason looking mask.

Looks like he used to play some amateur hockey when I was very young. I found about 2 dozen trophies most for goal tending but some for right wing. 

I took the pads to a local store and wanted to know if they where my size. The shop keeper seemed more interested in buying my dads pads and selling me new ones but he did confirm the fit was a good match for me. 

The stick also feels good as far as length but one is cracked and the other feels flimsy. The leather in the pads seem well oiled and in good shape. No major damage but definitely well used.

I guess what I am getting at is I am 5’7 and only 170# I know my dad and I are almost the same height as he was 5’8 but I am unsure of his weight as with his cancer he has always been very very weak and thin. I have seen pix of him when he was younger and looks to be 180-200 I think. 

But am I to small to be a goalie? Is this gear to old to even use? Is the old Jason mask even legal to use in hockey?

71,"I have friend who my best friend and I met at work six months ago. 

She is in an on and off again abusive relationship with a boyfriend with whom she lived with at the time. 

Through work and during a sleep over at my best friend and I's apartment, we got  to know a little more about her relationship. we felt bad for her because she was always breaking down due to her boyfriend and she always talked about how they would get into physical fights. 

Being the kind people that we are, my best friend and I offered moral support and offered to help her if she ever wanted to get out of her toxic relationship.

A little while after first meeting her came her first emergency. She called us LATE at night and slept over.  She said got into a major fight and swore up and down that she was over him. Next day, she and her boyfriend made up and she left.

We were kind of stunned by how quickly she bounced back, but we just saw it as part of the downsides of being in a toxic relationship. 

From there after, the same situation would repeat, she'd be pissed and over him, seek refuge then run back to him. We CONSTANTLY gave her advice telling her to let him go and that they were bad for each other (she would scream at him over the phone and air out their dirty laundry over the phone when she would sleep over.) We got tired of the repeated situation, but took it as her  steps towards leaving him as we know it takes time to get over and out of a bad relationship.

Fast forward a few months later, she called us at around midnight asking us to pick her up. She's over him. Its final. She came out with packed bags, all her shit and asked to stay with us for a little while. We said okay cause we wanted to help her, but the problem is ITS BEEN TWO MONTHS! ALMOST THREE.

A week into staying with us, she started secretly seeing him again under the guise of getting her stuff from him. After a while, she didn't even bother to hide it anymore. She would go over to his place to have sex or watch shows with him and then come back to our house to LIVE. We tried to give hints but she wouldn't leave. The reason she left his apartment was because she broke up with him, yet, when she got back with him, she continued to stay in our house.

Now that boyfriend has left the state and she has also lost her job and she's more helpless then before, but we want her OUT of our house! She's been here for two months before losing her job and she hasn't contributed a thing except $200 when we were almost evicted because our bills went up. [My best friend and I have always been able to cover our rent and expenses. But with helping her out, and her running up our bills by constantly leaving lights on, forgetting to turn off the oven, and her other bad habits of eating energy, we soon started being unable to keep up with our ever growing bills.] 

We had to spend DAYS complaining about our bill situation to another friend before she even reluctantly offered to help out. Meanwhile, she was posting on Snapchat her going out to eat and party which she could afford to do since she was freeloading off of us.

Now, were almost about to get evicted again because once again, we don't have enough money to cover our expenses and she hasn't even offered to help. She handed us the notice like it didn't even concern her. That was the final straw. We've put in so much effort into helping someone who doesn't want to help herself and doesn't give a damn about us. 

How do I kick her out ASAP. I know I'm coming across as a harsh person, but I'm just at my wit's end with her and need her out. She doesn't contribute, and she has DISGUSTING tendencies  like bringing our glassware into the bathroom to clean her hair and hold solutions that she uses to treat bumps caused by her piercings and apply creams to her hemmeroids. She has even screamed over the phone to her boyfriend about an untreatable disease he gave her and acted like she never said anything when she got off the call.

We're disgusted. She can't take any hints. We're tired of her and we need a polite way to kick her out.

84,"I'm in a pickle. 

Im in school right now and 2 of my classmates and I have been offered a TA-like position. I've been working very, very hard for this position. My higher ups know this as I have made it very clear throughout the whole class. I've put in the time, the effort, and learned as much as I can to ensure that my students will receive as much value as possible from the class. This position means the world to me right now and I would hate to lose it. 

Not so long ago, a classmate told me that she had feelings for me. My response was ""I don't think that's a good idea, I don't reciprocate the feelings."" She seemed to take it okay. I made it a priority to treat her the same here on out as I did before she told me she had feelings. Since then, that's exactly what I've done. 

She's now been offered the same position as I was as there are multiple TA's. 

Since the night, she's started to treat me differently. She's rude, she tries to boss me around, and she won't talk to me the same way. I understand it could be weird for her now, but we are in a professional environment. 

I have remained neutral on the whole topic. She's the same person to me now as she was prior. My priority is to keep our relationship as professional as possible and I've stuck to that. 

Another wrench in the machine is that we are working in a group on a project together with two other people. I've worked very hard on the project and put in a lot of extra time and effort. Some of my group mates have not put in their fair share of effort. While i don't expect them to put in the 15 hours a day that i have, i expect them to put in the minimum required 8 hours a day that we are in class. I voiced my concern to the group and it definitely has improved but i still feel that the tension is high and i may be viewed as an enemy. 

I talked to the two group mates and apologized for any actions that i carried that may have offended them. They accepted the apology and things are just fine between us.  

The aforementioned future co-worker still acts bitterly towards me, though. She comes up to me today and says that i offended one of our group mates and needed to apologize. I went to talk to that group mate later, he said he had no negative thoughts. I believe she's using him as a scapegoat to purvey the negative emotions she has towards me. 

I'm concerned that the dynamic between us will affect my ability to provide my students the best learning experience.

""of course, shes so nice &amp; pretty, who wouldn't love her?"" i said in repsonse, soon it was dinner time, I tried to chat with her family but they seemed kinda cold towards me, i just took it as ""ah, their having a bad day"" we finished eating and I thanked Rob &amp; Jane for their lovely cooking, Zoe walked me towards the door, i kissed her cheek and i started walking home. When i got home i was a little anxious that they might of not liked me but i told myself ""its fine, their just a little grumpy today"" i went to bed and fell asleep, i woke up at 4am from a wet dream (sorry, this is an important detail) i went to grab a new pair of underwear when i heard a knock on the door, it was Rob, ""oh, Hey MR. [insert last name here], what are you doing here at this hour?"", he looked at my boxers that i was holding in my right hand, ""why are you holding underpants?"" he asked, ""oh, um, wet dream, their so annoying"" i replied awkwardly, then he proceeded to ask if i dreamed about Zoe, i said that i do dream about her but she wasn't in my wet dream, he glared at me and said goodbye then left, i was kinda weirded out by this but i brushed it off, later that day (5pm to be exact), i got a message from Zoe, it said the four words that no one ever wants to hear ""we need to talk."" i completly flipped, i messaged back that we can talk tomorrow (i said this so my emotions weren't raw when we talked), the next day came round and everything felt like it was in slow motion, when the clock turned over and Zoe finished school i called her right away, she exaplined that her parents don't want her seeing me and i was kinda in shock, she said that shes going to do something drastic so we can stay together, i told her that it might be a bad idea but i cant stop her, later that day i got a call from her dad, he said that she almost got hit by a bus, and that he's sorry for overeating, i said its no big deal and told him that he was just looking out for her, i messaged Zoe afterwards telling her that jumping infront of a bus was way over the line, she pretty much replied with ""but it worked, be happy Harls, we can keep dating"".

but... this is where it really hits me, my parents have recently told me that ""you cant date her cause of the age gap"", i assured them that the furthest we've ever gone sexual wise is kissing eachother on the lips for like... 5 or so minutes, and that we're planning to save sex until we're both of legal age (16), my mum went on and on about how relationships with age gaps are weird and freaky, then i said ""you and dad are 7 years apart"", then she shut her mouth, my parents are still pushing me to break up with Zoe, and Zoe's parents are still a little cold towards me, to top it all off Zoe's younger brother told me that Zoe has been ""sad and crying"" a lot lately, i feel kinda upset that she didn't tell me that she was upset over something.

guys... Can you just tell me something to do to occupy my mind, (i'll take anything but break up, thats not an option)",09Nov2017,1

Some background: I'm 22. All through college, I worked at a library, and when I graduated I got lucky and snagged a full time job at the same place. I've been working full time for 6 months. The job is a perfect fit for me, and I love it.

Here's the thing, though: I want to travel. I wanted to study abroad while I was in school, but it was always too expensive and I could never find a good program that fit my degree plan, so I stayed home. Now I really want to go abroad-specifically to Australia, a top pick of mine, country wise-but I'm worried about losing my job. Everyone likes to say that it's just a job, but I genuinely do like this one. Plus, the library industry is brutal, and I'm worried a year or so off will hurt me when I return.

99,"Or, at least initiating in the first place, more specifically.
Some backstory; they had a very bad childhood, which I won't get in to, but it was a lot of abandonment and mistreatment. Later in life, they had a rough relationship with someone--they were both clearly in a relationship and in love, but she refused to acknowledge it or make it official in any way in spite it being obvious. It took awhile to make her open up about this--she also said that she feels undeserving of love, which is perhaps why she refused to acknowledge the relationship she had in spite of wanting it and being devastated when it ended.
She is very combative of any emotions in general, I'm not going to lie, it's almost painful. She shows signs of empathy, but she is quick to dismiss kind words to say and to resort to joking or taunting or empty insults as an alternative to affection, likely because growing up she had no adequate outlet to give affection to, and no one really showed it to her. 
I'd like to say I love her; I've my own problems and I understand her trouble, and I care about her and want to initiate a relationship and attempt to show her she's deserving. And sometimes, I feel like I have a chance, or she's even pulling the same thing as she did with her ex:
We talk a lot about the future. We're taking a trip together in the future, for a long time. We are going to live together after that. We often talk about raising a family. We talk about marriage, but often apply a greater scheme to this marriage, such as a religion. We share very similar values and goals; I feel quite close to her.

107,"I'm an apprentice electrician in Canada and I've been lucky enough to get into a Union. Which is great because I get health benefits and faster access to 2nd year of my schooling.


The problem is my co-op: Work has been slow and I'm constantly getting laid off and switching companies with up to months in-between and it is frustrating.


I have however, a family friend who is licensed and is willing to take me in whenever I need work, and I love working with him and his small company, unfortunately they are not unionized and my union allows but does not seem to like me working with them.


I work with them in-between lay-offs and he is more than happy to take me as a permanent worker.


But my Union refuses to let me work with him permanently. 

Even though he is licensed, submits proper work hours and taxes for my credit hours, my union yanks me away from him every time they get a job (which is usually unstable, only lasts a few months, and is in uncomfortable environments for me)


If I stay with the union I'm forced to go on and off jobs and inconvenience my family friend every time I get laid off due to no work (not because of him needing me to give him a job, but the sudden transition of him needing to shove me into his work schedules). Not to mention the jobs I'm sent to are often... uncomfortable for me, I'm afraid of telling most people irl for fear of being called ""not a man""


But I get health benefits and a faster access to my 2nd year of schooling


If I leave the union my job becomes VERY stable and I no longer get jerked around as much. I learn just as much from my family friend and the environment is much more friendly and comfortable for me (even my family likes it more due to the fact that they are the same religion)


But I lose my health benefits, and I have to wait possibly up to 2 years in-between schooling. (5 years total if I'm in union, and possible 7-10 years of I'm not)

111,"This is gonna be long, I apologize. Looking for advice on how to help a friend of mine. So I'll set the stage: he's turning 30 very soon, and still lives at home with his mom and dad. Not only that, but he has no car and doesn't even have a driver's license. He's also never had a job.

Beyond that, his parents can barely get by as it is. They live in a very rural part of town, about 15-20 minutes away from anything. Their income is low and unreliable; their only saving grace is the house they live in. It's a decent house, although the only reason they have it is because my friend's uncle helps them pay for it.

Now some history. About 10 years ago, my friend's mom bought him a used car. Since he was utterly unwilling/afraid to get his license, she started driving it. Shortly after, she got drunk and wrecked it, I assume with no insurance and so it was never replaced.

A few years ago I tried to help my friend get his driver's license, driving him to the dmv, etc, and he did manage to get his learner's permit. Sure enough though, he never practiced and allowed the permit to expire. I've mentioned multiple times that I would be willing to drive him to the dmv again, or to a job interview, etc. Nothing. And that's not even the only problem, I mean even if he DID get his license, how would he pay for insurance? And how would he afford to buy a car? Since he lives in the middle of nowhere, he would have to rely on his parents to drive him to work. I guess that's the only option, but apparently he doesn't want to do that.

I think he's deeply afraid to work, just afraid to put himself out there. And I think the longer he's waited, the more that fear and anxiety has grown. Sometimes I just want to shake him and ask him why he's wasting his life, but it's too awkward. At the end of the day he's a great person otherwise. He's my best friend, we've know each other so long and know each other so well that I can't imagine not being friends. 

Another aspect of this is that I recently moved to another city a couple years ago, about 2 hours away. We still hang out regularly and talk via email almost daily, but my ability to help him is more complicated now. But I do feel like his problems are more psychological than anything, I guess.

I feel like he's falling down a pit and won't save himself. More and more he becomes separated from the outside world. He used to have a cell phone, but doesn't have that anymore. Why would he need it? He doesn't talk to anyone anymore except me and our mutual friend. His computer died recently, and I seriously wonder how they're going to scrape up the money to buy a new one. Now his only window to the world other than his telephone is his tv and his playstation 4.

So what should I do? I desperately want to help my friend but I don't know how to make a horse drink, and subtle hints haven't really worked.",09Nov2017,2
113,"Hi guys. I'm a freshman in college (currently more than halfway through first semester).

So I've never had a girlfriend before. I've never even come close. And everyone I've ever told about this just tells me, ""you're 18, you're still young, just be patient,"" and other things like that. I'm really tired of hearing that. It just doesn't help me.

I've been trying to do all I can to meet new people and for all that effort I haven't made a single friend who's a girl. And by friend I mean someone I actually hang out with outside of class and stuff. I've been getting involved with lots of things relating to campus life and most of the time I talk with the people I sit with in lectures (only made like 1-2 friends this entire semester this way).

Anyway. So I had a dream the other day. I was with a girl and we were cuddling, and eventually making out. Nothing too sexual.  But when I woke up and realized what was (not) happening, I got super sad. I still am. These are feelings I have never experienced with an actual person and it makes me feel like a fucking failure.

It's just making me feel like I'm worthless or something or maybe I suck at making new friends, I don't know. I'm not bad looking or overweight or anything. I think I'm alright looking.

Well after 20 days (gave it some extra days) I emailed her saying I haven't received it.  She sent me an email back a couple of days later saying that she's in Africa (yey) and send me a picture of some generic customer service email from her bank stating that they're working on whatever issue she submitted to them (doesn't say what it's about) and that the money already came out of her bank account (I don't understand that since I didn't get any check) and the bank is going to void the last check and send me another one.

Well I waited and waited and maybe a week and a half ago I sent her another email stating that I haven't received any check yet and I have yet to hear back from her.  I don't know why she didn't personally send me a check BEFORE she went to Africa so there wouldn't be any issues with going through the bank.  It's a lot of money for me and I feel I've already been plenty patient, MORE patient than I think a lot of people would be.  Should I keep pestering her about it or should I try some other tactic?  I feel that if I keep pestering her on vacation that she might get pissed but then again I'm also annoyed that over $1000 of my money hasn't been returned like promised.

118,"Hi, first off, I want to say that this is going to be a really long post so if you read it all. I would really appreciate it...and thank you for the empathy. 

Eight months ago I experienced one of the worst days of my life. If not the worst. I broke up with the love of my life. Or at least the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life. The apple of my eye. The one who was my entire world and the one who blinded me from the world we live in and who made me feel the happiest I had ever been. 

And I still have feeling for him until this day. And when I unknown calls on my phone, I secretly wish it was him. I miss the smell of his skin and the sound of his voice. Even the smallest details of him. Like the three small freckles he had around his left eye. But the most that I miss is his comfort. And how he would calm me down in the times where I felt my whole being would turn black and I couldn’t even breathe. 

Last month I finally decided to go on dates with someone (let’s call him “A”) who had been wanting to take me out for months. And I thought I was emotionally ready but I’m not. I feel like I’m running away from my feelings. I’m not sure if I like this person or if I’m just longing for the rush I would feel with my ex. And also when we hooked up, I told him I wanted to go home immediately after that. And well, let’s just say that’s hes been a little attached to me since. Which I don’t mind since he’s a gentleman and he knows that I’m not looking for a relationship. 

Okay, what I need advice on: At this point in my life, I have two best friends (B and V). I love them for many reasons and for different ones. 

B is a great listener, gives the best advice, is mature, gives me a great example of how I should believe in things and in myself. I haven’t been able to talk to her about much that’s been going because she’s always busy with work and her own personal life. 

V is a fun and loyal friend who is very overprotective. My party friend and drinking buddy. The one I’ve had good laughs with and who loves that I always receive compliments from people. And she is the one who I hang out with more. 

But recently I feel that V has been a little jealous that I have been talking to guys (only talking to two as of right now — the one I went on a date with and one I have met online). Or maybe it seems that way because but I think she may just be overprotective and she’s scared I might get hurt again. She’s telling me to tell “A” to fuck off since he’s getitng attached and he’s getting “butthurt” when I don’t reply to his texts, etc. 

What bothers me from her...Every time I try to vent about my ex she completely shuts me out so I feel like I can’t talk to her about how my feelings feel messed up or in other words...really fucked up.

Right now I’m completely fucked with my I want to meet the guy I met online because I feel like we click when we text and he’s into the same things I am into. And I might go on another date with A since he asked me to for my upcoming birthday. Another problem is...online person and A want to meet on the same day. And I have no idea what to do, lol. And in all of this I still have strong feelings for my ex and I feel guilty for even doing all this. And wanting to meet other people. But if I don’t I feel pathetic for holding onto someone who never put me as a priority. 

Has anyone ever dealt with this? Should I be even dating? How should I talk to my friend about my feelings and the discomfort I feel opening about things like this? Is it harmful that I’m talking to two people at the same time?

123,"I'm 19, and have a horrible diet. While I'm not overweight (actually slightly underweight, thanks to a fast metabolism), heart issues run in my family and I don't want to pre-dispose myself to anything. I work full time swing shift, and it's very hard for me to eat healthy. The past few months, I've turned to nothing but quick snacks, and it's made me feel awful. I've tried cutting out snacks, and I've gone absolutely crazy. I tried cutting down throughout the day, cutting out completely, etc. Nothing seems to work, and I've started to feel like a total piece of shit. I want to get out of this habit before it effects my health more then it already has. I have a dietary plan in action, but as easy as you can say ""just follow it"", it doesn't work that way. I'm addicted to sugar. When I say I've tried everything, I mean everything. I couldn't list everything I tried.

I've started to bring my own healthier lunches from home, and I always end up eating it, then buying more junk food on top of it from work. I can not help it at all, I go insane without it.

I started reading online about people who would vape non-nicotine flavored juices to break other habits, and how much success they've had doing it. I started reading online about any long term effects of vaping (Non nicotine.... many studies are with nicotine), and nowhere really has any solid information. Every study is calling another study a myth, and the only thing I found they agreed on was of ""Popcorn Lung"". It was stated that chemicals used in flavored juices of vapes CAN cause this disease, HOWEVER there has been no noted cases of anyone getting it from vaping.

Now if you don't know what vaping is, it's not smoking. It's an electronic device that produces flavored vapor that you inhale. Nothing more then just vapor. Some people buy juice with nicotine in it, but I don't. It doe

So here's my thought. You can buy tons of different flavors for Vapes, and my idea is that the flavor, or ""juice"" I use will substitute my habit of constantly buying horribly unhealthy pastries, snacks, and candy bars. That way, I can taste it, but not actually consume the calories, sugar, or other crap in it.

So I bought a vape pen today and tried it. I bought, ""Strawberry Cream"" vape juice, with no nicotine so that it would not be addictive. Anytime I felt like I wanted to get a pastry or snack, I vaped, AND IT HELPED!!!! Instead of having at least 4 candy bars, and 2-3 pastries, I was able to have just one pastry, and no candy!!! The flavored vape allowed me to taste pastries, but without actually consuming them!!!!

My thought is, is this too good to be true? I want to tell myself that it's not, but part of me says it is. I want to know what anyone else would do in my situation. At my rate, I don't know what's less healthy.

Is this a safe ""cheat"" plan to follow?",09Nov2017,1
127,"Age 18, year 12, college in Australia.

This current year I have went through pretty severe depression, and it had directly influenced my schooling. To the point that, through the entire year, I failed all 4 classes of the 4 that I was in.

I had only needed to complete one class and I’d have passed, but due to the depression I spent probably about 80% of this year in bed. And because of this it was impossible to pass. From year. 11 I had passed 2 of the hardest courses available for the year level with flying colours, as well as pass every other class. In year ten I did some courses that also applied to my college points in the future, as well as piano, which counted towards the points as well. So, for the most part I’m a relatively smart person, and have done well in most of what I’ve done. But depression just doesn’t give a darn, so cant help it.

And I was wondering what options do I have or what can I do?

It seems stupid that my entire education is effectively ruined due to ow year of depression. History shows that I have put in effort with good grades, and it’s clear that I would have passed if I wasn’t going through depression.  Is there a way to get the education system, or whatever, to see this to get it so I pass college? Or do I have to redo an entire extra year of schooling just to pass a single class? Is there even any point? I have no idea what I want to do in my future, and I’ve been trying to find it out for a while. But I don’t see how another year of school would help. But if I don’t do this I’ll have to start work next year, as well as not have a college graduate.

So do I do another year of schooling for one class?

Do I go to an education board or something to get a scrape by college pass due to good history but bad present?

Just not give a damn and just fail college and just take up work?",09Nov2017,6

133,"This is a throw away account and all pronouns have been neutralized to protect myself. It's gonna be lengthy, I apologize....

My SO of a little over a year and I both work in a restaurant. They are a line cook, and I am a bartender. I consider it a point of pride that I operate my bar as if there is an ALE officer in the building at all times. I do things by the book, and I regularly make sure I am up to date on my state's ABC laws. Anyway, for some background, my SO has a drinking problem. It is destroying me inside, and our relationship is incredibly taxing on me, but since we work together and they are the way that they are, it is in my best interest to stay put, in the relationship and my job. I have one of the most coveted bartending gigs in my area, and I make the money I know I deserve, and also I adore our customers so I'm not going anywhere. My lease is up in a year and depending on how this situation pans out for me, I may reevaluate my desire to be at this job then. But for now, I am working at this place, dating this person, and for my safety it needs to stay that way unfortunately. SO's alcoholism has led to many problems. They are constantly late to work, sometimes up to 2 hours, and they are impossible to get out of bed for work. They lost their license to a DUI, and have alienated literally everyone else who could do it, so I am their ride to work. Meaning I get a nasty phone call saying ""where is ____"" if they are late. I've recently put my foot down on this, which means that someone else from the kitchen often has to stop their work and go get my SO out of bed and get them to work, or we don't have someone to work their station. I've recently learned that SO frequently drinks on the job. It's amazing this person has already gotten away with so much, and part of it is that I live in a drug addled area where it is truly almost impossible to find clean, sober people with a decent work ethic, especially in the restaurant industry. Part of it is the owners of the restaurant have known this person since a young age, and care about them deeply. They have punished SO by taking away one or two shifts in the past, or confining them to only working in the kitchen (SO sometimes waits tables and the money is better), but the cycle repeats. The rest of the kitchen staff are slightly less problematic alcoholics, and they don't want to lose their drinking buddy, so no one will do anything, even the person who let it slip to me that my SO is doing this.

Now I am scared to even go pee when I'm shutting down the bar by myself, because I don't want to leave my rails unattended. I have started coming in early because I have heard through the grapevine that it's servers who are pouring SO's secret shift drinks. So I do all the work I have to do away from the bar before the servers get to work. When I close down myself, I mark some of the bottles but I'm afraid whoever is pouring will start to notice and it's impossible to inconspicuously mark EVERY bottle. I also don't shut down every night, and our other bartender is awesome to work with, but I can tell you now he's staying out of it, which I respect.

 Our workplace does not have cameras, so my next step would be to set one up, where no one would see, and find out who is pouring the drinks, and confirm that they are being given to my SO. To avoid throwing anyone under the bus, or making it look like I was trying to ""get back"" at my SO for personal reasons, I would just say I found a cup in the kitchen that smelled funny, and I had no idea who it could be since no one had been appearing drunk at work. I'm at a loss for what to do. If this person got fired, it would be easy for me to do what I know I need to do, which is end the relationship. But I also don't want to go out of my way to get them fired because I know how things like that come back to haunt you. But also, now I know that they are stealing from the business and while others I work with may not care, I fought hard for my job and I will not allow someone to steal from stock that I am trusted with, so they can ease their hangover. 

What should I do?",09Nov2017,4

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I reach out to people in real life, and have my fun with them, but when the time comes to go, and I ask for contact information, I always get some BS excuse about how ""I don't give out my number"" or some such. Happened dozens of times now. Same story online. I message people I meet in groupchats on kik, or on Reddit, and I'm lucky to get a reply back, and if I do, the conversation never lasts long, despite my best efforts.

141,"So my roommate and I have been best friends since we were kids. We've been living in the same place for almost 3 years now, and share a lot of things. Unfortunately our PS4 falls into a weird gray area (but that's a whole thing..)

That brings me to the Switch. We had been talking about splitting a Switch for a while now. And I was actually totally onboard about splitting it. But today I picked one up on a whim, and am starting to think I just want to pay for the whole thing myself and feel free to take it if I move out. I'm just worried he'll feel like I'm being selfish.

I know this sounds like a ""duh"" thing, but I do feel like a dick about wanting it to be mine after we talked about it being both of ours. He's been really hyped about it and wanting to buy a Switch for the place for a while now. Thoughts? Or at least thoughts on how to talk to him about more clearly defined lines when it comes to buying ""mutual"" games?

I love my children more than anything. 
A bit of back story to why I feel this way might help you understand better. 
After the birth of my youngest son, my wife had a lot of health problems which resulted in 7 operations and ultimately led to a partial hysterectomy. 
She was sick for nearly 6 years, but the last operation helped and she was able to do things like pick the kids up from school and food shopping ect. 
I had done pretty much everything on my own for 6 years, playing the role of mum and dad, working, fetching the Kids, shopping and cooking. 
My wife managed to get a good 7 months pain free, but 3 weeks ago it's all started again. 
She's gone right back to square one. 
She's done nothing and I'm having to do everything on my own again. 
I struggle myself with anxiety, depression and PTSD from sexual abuse as a child.

144,"Recently, I've said and done stuff to someone who I shouldn't have. My life has been confusing recently and I haven't known how to handle big changes in my life. So I started talking deeply and more often and intensively with my best friend, whom I've only known for a few months, but we clicked immediately and have been best buddies since.

She said she was fine with me talking to her. So I did and I said a lot of weird shit, I made up stuff and I said too much sometimes etc, cause I was all so confused. She stilled seemed fined with that and was supportive and all, until asked to go meet with her to talk through everything. I just wanted an ending to all this deep talk everyday. I wanted to just explain everything and if I just could've been let to do that it would have changed so much. That was gonna be the last time I talked to her about all the stuff that had been going on, and the last time I bothered her with it. Instead, that was the breaking point for her. When we met she lost everything and said that she's tired of me and of me making myself the victim of everything and just trying to bring negativity to her life whenever she's happy. She said she'd felt closer to our other friends the past weeks because of all this.

After that meeting, we said we'd be like normal and like before I started saying all this shit to her, starting Monday morning (that was a Sunday). She said she wanted me to be like a brother who she could talk to about everything and who'll grow up to live in a retirement home together in 70 years talking old memories.

In school on Monday morning, all the others in our group of friends happened to not be there, so she was kinda forced to be with me. At first she didn't really say anything and as soon as I tried to bring what has happened between us up, she got real mad, but as the day went on we were quite like normal again. After the school day, she ditches me on snap (I know it doesn't mean a lot but we used to send snaps every quarter to each other essentially). I write to her asking why we still don't feel like normal. She just gets angry and says ""stop it"" etc.

Next day comes and our other friends are in school. She ends up being like normal to them but not even saying a word to me and essential ditches me every time I try to say or do anything to her.

It continues to be like that for the rest of the week. Sometimes she could have 5 minutes every day where she just acted like normal and made some harmless insult like we used do, but then all of a sudden back to not saying a word to me. 

I made the mistake of writing to her most evenings begging for everything to be good during this time. She still just got mad and asked me to stop. She said she needed some space and that she'd seen ""the true side if you (me)"", she doesn't want to explain what she meant by that. But I really haven't been myself for the past weeks when I said all those stuff to her, but it feels like I can't make her see that. Stuff happened, that made me change and made me confused, I just hope she could believe that.

Then autumn break came, both of us went abroad to different countries during that break. She sent me a few snaps every morning and a few every evening but that was all. I made myself not write to her bringing this stuff up, even though I really wanted to. I've really just wanted to properly talk to her again but she doesn't allow me to and I know that every time I bring it up it just makes things worse, but I can't help myself sometimes.

Then we're at this week. Most of the time in school now she talks to me and act somewhat normal to me, but she obviously talks more to and act closer to our other friends, and we don't sit with each other at essentially any lesson now, it used to be quite the opposite. She barely sends any snaps more than those to keep our day streaks alive.

One of our close friends who knows most of this, says she's pretty sure I've screwed it up and that it will never be the same between us. Another one says she's sure it will be good again, if I just give it some time. The little the girl herself has said is just ""I don't know"" to wether or not it can be the same again. She's said we could try but sometimes it feels like she isn't. At another occasion she said ""you ruined it"".

All I want right now is for us to be the same again. I haven't been myself this past period of time and the only way for me to be that and for me not to go on doing bad stuff and seeking myself to worse communities and friendships is to have her close. I don't just want it to be good again and for us to just be cool etc... I want us to be BFFs again and for things to be the same. She has certainly though picked another one from our group of friends to play that role for her, and I feel like that's in the way for that now. 

She used to say I was her world and that we're absolute best friends and so much more and now I'm confident that we'll be good again but scared that we can't be as good. All I want is to properly say sorry and for her to forgive and forget. We share so much that we just don't with others of our friends, that made us extra close. I want her to see that.

I don't know how to live my life right now without her and her support and jokes, insults and hugs.

145,"I'm 18M living at home with my single mother and my brother, 23, in Florida, if any legal reference is necessary.

As a preface, my brother is home all day. He doesn't work, drive, or go to college, nor has any friends to leave the house with. He's in his room on the computer all the day, often with a wildly messed up sleeping schedule.

The problem: his anger. Whenever anything at all bothers him, whether it be the cat, his game, players on his game, or his personal favorite: poor internet, he'll start to scream and shout. Without exaggeration, this lasts for several hours every day total of him yelling at something. Imagine someone angry over their favorite sports team losing a game, and then multiply that a few times to get an idea of what I'm talking about.

Given his sleeping schedule, he'll usually start in the middle of the night. It's loud enough that my mother across the house can't get any sleep, and me the next room over definitely can't either. When he's yelling while we're awake, nothing makes him stop. He doesn't listen to anything my mother says or tells him, and he'll argue back with her and start making her the target of his shouting. He'll scream at her and insult her, verbally abusing her and swearing at her, and it personally upsets me how nonchalant he is about treating her that way. 

Beyond his shouting so loud that you can hear it from outside the house, his temper is as uncontrollable as his yelling. On numerous occasions he has gotten physical with my mother for trying to tell him to stop, shoving and lashing out at her if she tries to come in his room or close his door (which he refuses to close at all when when he's shouting,) one time even getting out of his chair to charge at her during an argument over his temperament.

This has been going on for over a year and recently I've grown extremely tired of it, more than usual. This night I turned off the internet after another shouting match he had with my mother because I was fed up having to listen to it and hearing him yell at his computer about how bad he thinks the internet is (he does this every day without fail.) As a reaction, he came into the room where the router was, so we were in the hallway as I was leaving the room, and when I so much as put my arm out and told him he didn't need the internet on, he attacked me. I defended myself and fought back for a few moments before my mother came over to break it up. At that point I already had several scratches and marks all over my upper body and my face, most of which drew small amounts of blood. I wasn't hurt, but that to me marked the sign that something had to change.

My mother refuses to do anything about him even after this and I'm afraid in my own house. I don't like living here and I'm already planning to move out as soon as possible to get away from everything here. I hate confrontation and combative environments, and there's hardly ever a peaceful and loving environment here. I don't know what to do in the meanwhile. I've considered calling the police after what happened, but I don't know if that warrants a phone call, or looking into involuntary commitment for him. 

I feel threatened and worried for my mother every day this goes on and as I said, she refuses to get him to a councilor or do anything about his clear lack of anger management. I didn't know where to post so I came here. If there's a better subreddit, please let me know.

Thank you.",09Nov2017,1

147,"Hello,

I'm a 17 year old Dutch boy and I made a wrong choice on what I wanted to study. Let me explain the details:
The Dutch highschool system is made up from different tiers of education. Last year I passed my exams for HAVO (Higher General High School) with flying colours and I decided to step up my high school game by entering Atheneum (University Preparatory Education). However after two months I'm sure I made the wrong choice. My relationship with my parents is not the best (I'm sure this counts for a lot of 17 year olds.), meaning we never talk about my internal problems. So I decided to ask the dean for advice. I told her that I made the wrong choice and am facing emotional problems because of it. I really don't now what to do so she suggested a break year (a year in which you don't go to school) so I can put myself back on track and figure out what I want to study. This sounded like music to my ears so I went to explain to my parents. However they won't have it, saying I have to man up and finish with what I started. They're also really angry at my school for ""putting wrong ideas in my head without consulting the parents first"". 


Now, my school suggests we'll all have a talk together about my future but I'm afraid my parents will decline. I went to multiple people for advice but they're not very helpfull and my emotional problems are only getting worse. 


Perhaps someone here has encountered the same problem as me in his/her life and could help me out.

I was trying very hard to practically whisper on the phone, and she had become aggressive and picking fights with me. Telling me that people on the internet are all pretending to be people and that I would get killed. I had dated guys in an LDR 2 times before, so she had stated I only liked far away losers and that I haven’t gotten killed yet only because of her. She went on to further say that I give my address out to everyone on the internet which is even more crazy and untrue. It kept escalating and she eventually left her room to fight with me, and it became hair pulling and punching. She kept punching me in the back of the head and pulling my hair, while my boyfriend heard on the phone. After the hits to the head I punched her in the face two times to get her to stop. Now her nose is swollen and she is telling me she is gong to tell her coworkers that I am abusive and have me kicked out/arrested even though I defended myself. 

When I was 17, something similar happened when I came home at 12 after falling asleep watching Tangled at an ex boyfriends house. She called me a slut and punched me in the face/tried to choke me. Cops were called and I had to deal with CPS, even before I was 17 cps would come sometimes. I think one of my friends told her mom or someone my mom was abusive awfully to me because my mom would act crazy even when she was there. 

I have no idea why she does this because she cheated on my dad and left him, she didn’t even want kids. I have heard her mom was similar and did this shit to my moms sister. So why is it happening to me?

My boss is driving me insane. He squeezes every second of work from me while I'm there. I didn't finish scanning items yesterday, so he stood directly over my shoulder and watched what I was doing. He told me I was making my images ""too perfect"" and each item should only take one minute. 

I love the work involved in my job. It's super cool. I get along well with my coworkers. My photos aren't the best, but with the limited equipment and time constraints, they're much better than what he was doing before. I ordered a tripod and I have a portable light box that I was going to willing to offer to get spot on photos. 

My boss is constantly in a rush, and makes me switch and jump from task to task regularly. He rushes everything, I've caught a few mistakes he's made because of this. 

My coworker asked me not to quit. We get along really really really well. Same with the other two part time people. 

He hasn't been able to keep anyone full time because of his behavior and people get burnt out fairly quickly. It has a very high turn over rate because of this. 

I've been thinking about quitting. I love my coworkers and the job itself, but I believe that you should take the time to do everything correctly and neatly. My photos compared to his, still not 💯 but they're significantly better.

I don't know what to do cause I am an ex self harmer and now I am contemplating whether I should do it and I don't want to start shit with her since I barely know her. She is a good kid and I don't want her to have drama because of me. It still pisses me off because I don't want her to think cutting is a hobby and shit.

176,"I [38F] am a career executive assistant working for a busy president of a large company [50M]. I've worked for many executives in my career. Some lovely, some jerks. I'm tough, I don't take things personally and I'm damn good at my job.

I've been at my current job for a year and my boss is just seriously an a-hole. Not just to me, to everyone. But also to me. Part of my job is being able to read my boss's mind, and I'm pretty great at it most of the time but this guy...he'll ask me to do something and give me NO direction, then if I ask a follow up or clarification present he throws up his arms, rolls his eyes, huffs and puffs and bellows about how he should be able to count on me to take these things off his plate. I'll be truly asking for 30 seconds of his time to give me a few clarification points. But then he'll just scream NO! He'll do it. I try to argue with him, I'll say I am just asking for 30 seconds of clarification which will save us both a lot of time in the end, and he will literally ignore me. He'll pick up the phone, or walk out of the room.

These kinds of things happen several times a day. I'm not exaggerating when I say any time I ask him a question he spends 10 seconds huffing and puffing and full body sighing and laughing condescendingly, as if to say ""seriously you have to ask me that?"" I have never had a boss that refused to answer any question. I could understand if I was constantly confused and asking the same questions over and over again. But he'll say something like ""Write a letter to Joe"", and I'll say ""Do you mean Joe Smith?"" because he knows a dozen dudes name Joe and he can't just say yes, Joe Smith. It's like, HOW DARE I ASK WHICH JOE, I should just know. Even if he had a meeting with Joe Smith yesterday and I'm 99.9% sure he obviously means Joe Smith because they just met, part of me being good at my job is to ask that clarification, and it takes him less than a second to say yes, instead of however long he spends flipping out that I dared to ask.

I am actively trying to find a job, but at my level and salary it can be tough so I need to know how to survive here in the meantime. ",09Nov2017,5
178,"Hi all

Weird question, maybe this is common knowledge to anyone who's read a magazine, I don't know.

What's up with the thing women do when they watch you coming, and as you pass, look away.  In a situation where you all work in the same building I mean, so there's a chance you've met and would nod or say hello.

It only came to my attention as my colleague brought it up, and now I keep noticing it.  I asked my girlfriend and she doesn't like it at all, she thinks it's an attraction thing, but I'm not so sure.

As a man, if you're a woman, I talk to you no different than a man - I'll even say things like ""no problem, man"", ""ah man, I think you've lost all data on your PC..."" that kind of thing.  In the corridors, I'm the guy walking by head down thinking or in my own little world.  On the commute, I'm the guy oblivious to anything other than my next stop.  I don't flirt, I don't impose, my interactions are strictly cold professional, f*ck man I don't even really smile at work.  I don't let conversations stray from the matter at hand, I'll certainly never talk to you on a personal level, I give no indication of wanting anything other than to get you working again on your computer.  100% dedicated to the woman I love, if I pass you at work, I'm often carrying flowers for her.  Come into my office for help (computers) and I'm the guy that doesn't notice you come in the room.  My desktop background is a pic of her from a glam photo shoot, it's quite clear I'm deeply in love already.
I say all that to try to give an idea of me - hopefully it does, probably not the most outgoing and friendly picture - but that's me.

I decided to seek some views on this from strangers because I have it in my head that perhaps they're scared of me?  This would be an issue due to the nature of my job - eventually ladies, I will need to come to you to fix your PC, we will have to interact.  In the eyes of a woman, am I doing something that makes you think ""perv"", ""wrongun"", ""stalker""?  Sounds mad but honestly those are the only things I could think of that'd make you casually turn to face a blank wall as I pass.  And no, I'm not watching you blatantly now I'm aware it's happening, but I'm not blind either.

Trust me, this isn't bothering me in the sense of ""oh no girls won't look at me"", for all I care you could all disappear, my heart feels like it was made for my sweet bubboo, even if she gives it back, I feel it'll be useless to me, it'll only work for her.  However, since my colleague raised the point, I think I'm just in need of a double check that there's other perfectly innocent reasons for it.  If it's a sure sign I've come across as a chest-staring pervert, I'll be mortified, but wow I honestly don't know what could have caused it.

thanks and I hope this makes sense to someone!",09Nov2017,0

She's been going out more and more, and whenever I ask where she's going, she always says ""out with some friends."" She never lets me see her phone and is always texting someone. I've noticed it's the same person whenever I do get a sneak peek-some dude named Brad. I got real sick and tired of this, so last week when she went out, I decided to follow her. I got in her car (as she likes to drive around in mine, it's much nicer), and followed her to a house in a nearby neighborhood.

182,"I live at my mom house and she keeps using outside propane tanks with a top heater attachment to heat the house. How do I convince her that she needs to stop? 
She's been struggling to fix the furnace since last winter. That's when she bought the propane attachment. At the time I was uncomfortable with it but it was the end of winter in Maine so I figured we were desperate. It's almost winter again and she now has two running inside the living room and her bedroom EVERY night and on her days off, all day. She also smokes cigarettes in the same rooms. 

I usually don't want to get involved in situations that seems controversial... (Like telling my mom who lets me live with her that she needs to stop doing something.) 
I've told her they freak me out, they smell bad and I don't use them but she laughs it off. Her argument is that I'm silly and there's enough ""air flow"" that we don't have to worry about Carbon Monoxide. I doubt that's true with all the windows and doors closed. Also those things explode! She acts like that's never going to happen. With two running plus two full tanks stored INSIDE? I think the odds are worth being worried about.

My plan is to confront her about toughing it out until we get the furnace fixed by a professional. She keeps changing her mind about hiring someone. I will offer to save up money with her to get it done.  I just don't want to die in my sleep or have to try to survive a house fire. I need some facts or some clear way of making her get it without her being able to throw me off. I want to be heard without having to get visibly upset.

TL;DR How do I convince my mom who thinks she's always right and my worries are laughable that using OUTSIDE propane tanks with heater attachments INSIDE is dangerous for everyone?",09Nov2017,3
184,"I'm sorry this is long. I'm 20 years old and all i'm doing right now is a part time job as a garbage man.

I've also been thinking about joining the Marine Corps. My biggest fear about the military is the commitment. If I could enlist, serve, and then be discharged all within the span of like 2 years, I would do it. But as far as I know that's not possible. Correct me if I'm wrong but all military contracts are 8 years with some active and some inactive but still 8 years. I'd be 28 when my contract expired if I joined right now. I don't like that. Also I'm not fond of the strict rules and lifestyle but that's on me. I'm not responsible, I don't like authority and I'm kinda egotistical and arrogant. Ironically though i'm also kinda insecure. I just don't think i'm mentally stable enough for the military aside from my already established commitment issues. So I'm just lost. I don't know what to do. I'm already 20 and only getting older. Do I try college and see how it works? Do I try the military, swallow my issues and just stick it out for 4 years or 6 years? I'm lost and scared. I don't wanna be a deadbeat.

185,"The worst part about this is that I’m only 15. I never had any memory problems with anything other than life memories, for example, I can easily remember what I’ve studied during school tests, remember chores I’m supposed to do on certain days, etc... The problem is in remembering detailed memories. If someone were to say “Hey, remember that day when *blah blah blah* happened?” I could remember the moment, just not in detail. The surroundings during the moment are the easiest to remember, but I only have vague ideas of what people said and exact actions. Pinpointing the year or my age is also difficult unless I state my age in the memory. 

I’ll use some actual memories I have as examples. Sometime when I was 8-10, I was with my mom and brother, walking down the stairs in the apartment building we lived in. Then, a tall man walked down as well, passing us, skipping every other step on the way down. I remember thinking how cool he was and how I wanted to be just as tall as him and be able to skip the stairs like that. I can remember how the stairway looked, where we were standing, and even the pattern on the stairs, but not anything me or anyone else said out loud, how the guy looked, or where we were going.

 I could tell you my favourite and least favourite tv shows as a kid as well as my favourite cartoon characters, but I can rarely tell you of a single moment I remember where I was watching the show, but there are a few moments. A Garfield movie once came on tv, when I would’ve been 9, and I had seen it before and knew there would be a kiss scene at the end. My mom and brother were also watching with me, and I thought it would be really awkward, so when the ending came near, I went to my room(I can’t remember myself actually watching the movie or running to my room) and started to jump on the bed to seem a little less suspicious. My mom then came in and told me the movie was about to end and asked if I didn’t want to see the end. I then remember walking back to the tv room, but I’m not sure if this was before or after the scene.

I also remember going to the beach a few times before, but again, no vivid memories. I can remember that my cousin was riding in my family’s car and we thought the bumps on the road were fun to go over, I remember the ticket booth, my dad parking the car, finding out that the freezies in the ice box had melted, and warning a family I didn’t know about “eels” in the water. I’m not even sure if this was on a single trip or if these moments were spread out over the 4 or 5 times I’ve been to the beach. I can’t remember anyone talking, or specific actions except for the final memory. I remember where I was in the water and where the other family was when I told them about the “eels”, I remember me talking and the father of the family responding with something like “Is that so?” However, I’m not sure if I thought the weird fish or whatever they were in the water were tadpoles or eels.

Strangely, the most detailed memory I have is from when I was 3. I was at home, sitting on the floor, with my back against the wall. My mom was in the kitchen behind me. I was playing with a cable that ran along the bottom of the wall and since I didn’t understand years yet, I asked my mom when I would turn 4(this is how I know when it was). But like many of my other memories, I see it in 3rd person and I’ve heard this happens when the brain does it’s best to assemble memories based on the little amounts of information available. 

Sometimes I have a hard time determining if a memory was a dream or actually happened, and on the topic of dreams, they are a lot easier to remember than memories. If someone asked me to tell them about dreams I’ve had, I could go on and on about various dreams in vivid detail, with the images in my head. However, if someone asked about a memory, I would take a long time to think of just one.

I’ve tried searching this up, but many websites say this happens to victims of abuse in their childhood. I am lucky enough to have never been abused by anyone. Not my family or kids at school, I have never been traumatized or seriously hurt by an event either.

Is this normal, or can you vividly see your own memories and be able to describe the moment in detail? How can I better my memory?",09Nov2017,2
187,"I (27f) had a weird experience in an uberpool last night, and I guess I'm just wondering if there is actually any point in going to the police? Or if there's anything that can be done at all?

The driver picked up the couple outside a bar and I was already in the backseat. It sort of happened really quickly, but they just kind of piled in, which I though was weird at the time. I'm behind the driver, Crystal, the woman,is in the middle, and the man is on her other side. They were clearly drunk, and really giggly, and after a bit started to kiss. I had my nose in my phone, really trying not to pay attention. After a few minutes, the man reaches around the woman and starts touching my upper and chest and shoulder. I asked him to please stop, which he did, but a few minutes later started again. This time I said something like, ""excuse me, stop"" a little more aggressively and the woman then holds the guys hand so it's not feee to wander. 
I was annoyed and creeped out, but just figured they were drunk and kept reading on my phone. A few minutes later, the man asks if I speak English. I didn't answer because I honestly had no idea that he has talking to me, since I had clearly spoken to him in English earlier. He then more aggressively and pointedly asks, ""Hey YOU, do you speak English?"" 
Me: what?
Him: do you speak English 
Me: are you asking me if I speak English?
Him: yeah do you speak AMERICAN English?
Me: of course I speak English 
Him: AMERICAN English 
Me: of course I do, I grew up here, I'm from the states
Him: oh, then you're just a dumb Jew

At this point I'm terrified and I just keep asking questions because it's so bizarre and I can't quite grasp what's happening. The uber driver says something like ""hey man, you can say that, you need to be respectful,"" which was cool but just made the man laugh. 

We weren't far from my house, so I asked the uber driver to let me out there and walked the three or four blocks home even though it was 35 degrees and after midnight. I made a report to uber, and they said they would open an investigation and suspend her account,  but she didn't do anything; it was they guy who was with her. I got a notification later that the driver also made a report, and that's reassuring. 

At this point is there anything else I should do? Would a police report be useful or helpful? I still feel pretty shaken up. Also I'm mad.

We  hooked up a few times after that and I told her that if things weren't working out to let me know because I didn't want to keep wasting my time.

I got annoyed because she would tell me things like ""I only hook up with guys I like"" and that ""I felt like I was falling for you so I backed off"".  When I told her she messed with my head by sending me mixed signals she acted like she didn't realize she was doing it. I told her I was done with her and that i probably would get another job rather than have to go in and see her. She seemed upset that I would go as far to never see her but I told her I really liked her and that it would torture me to see her at work. 

She told me this is what she wanted to to avoid. I called her out her bs and said that she wouldn't have hooked up with me multiple times if it really mattered.

The doctor thought she said/meant that she wanted to kill herself at that moment, but what my mom as trying to say was that her father was dying NOW(due to heart problem I don't know much about.)  The doctor then had police escort her to the nearby hospital to get evaluated so they'll know for sure whether or not she's a threat to herself or others

We're in New York and she's been there since yesterday late afternoon(it's almost 11AM now.) She's been waiting for a doctor to evaluate her so that she can be deemed fine and get discharged, but they're busy and understaffed so they said it can take up to 72 hours before she's even looked at. They took everything away, including her phone, so she's not able to contact others(they haven't even bothered to connect her patient phone yet so I can't call) and visiting hours are very brief.

I'm waiting for a call from the doctor that sent her there to see if she can do something for her, but I doubt she can or will. My mom is missing work, and quite possibly her father's last moments alive. They're pretty much holding her prisoner and I don't know what else to do but wait.

I don’t know if I said or did something, but even after my faux pas she showed interest at least in going out to dinner, go to events, and never hesitated to invite me in occasionally.  I’ve only ever hugged her (at her behest) or tapped her on the shoulder, sometimes I’m a bit too self-conscious.  Above all I don’t want to lose her as a friend, she really changed my life for the better.  I know I have to prepare myself for a time when she’ll be gone.  I feel its better if at least I have an answer.

I usually think a letter is a cowardly way out, but she doesn’t want to seem to talk anymore so here’s my hypothetical note to my female friend:

Dear Deb,

   I know I may have sent poor signals in the past but I just want you to know that I really value you as a friend, and whatever I might have done to offend I want to remain friends with you.  I admit I had a crush on you early on, but now I realize that was infatuation.  I miss talking with you and spending time with you outside of school.  Maybe I’m reading too much into things, but lately you seem uncomfortable around me.  The last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable.  If I do you I won’t ask anything of you anymore.  I hope that we can remain friends because I think you’re a singularly great person.  At times I can be a bit too enthusiastic and at other times too subdued. 

     I know that time we have together we have as friends is quickly coming to an end, and I know it will end and we will go our separate ways, but for the time remaining, I would like to spend more time with you, because this time will never come again.  You may not realise that when we met, I was quite a lost person, and you changed me for the better.  You woke me up from a two year sleep, and that is something that I can never repay.  So when I may seem overly interested, or ask you to dinner I’ve only done so because I like you, and want to show you that.  I’ve wanted to reciprocate and be a good friend, because no friendship should be one sided.  Whatever you may feel I respect it.  I hope you know I’m not an angry person, and I never can be angry at you.  I hope we can move on as friends, if not, I’ll keep my distance.

Best,
Mark 

TL;DR:  My friend has been acting really aloof, and I don't know if its because of me.  Have I angered her for some reason?  Should I try to get an answer?  She seems to be ignoring me for some reason.  I just don't know what to do.

202,"I can't seem to find a sub that really fits this topic...was hoping to get some ideas of how to handle this awful situation I'm dealing with. I separated from my ex over two years ago, have been divorced now for a year. I've been in and out of court for the last couple years so many times I stopped counting. Let's just say it's been more than 20...
At first it was dealing with his complete abandonment of the kids, he left and moved in with his girlfriend he had while we were still married. He was physically and verbally abusive, would show up drunk at my house trying to beat the door down. He's choked me, thrown me down and slapped me....When he found out I was seeing my now bf he slit his tires. The list goes on but I did get a restraining order after all that. He's had 2 CPS cases opened on him in the last year. He doesn't pay child support even though there is a court order, the back support is up to over 5k now. He can't hold a job so they are constantly trying to track down employment for him...it takes time and while that's happening no support payments are being made. He basically comes and goes from the kids life when he feels like it, has no regard for the agreements made in court. 
I was able to compensate this entire time with the help of my BF who has been amazing(he's a better dad to my boys then my ex could ever dream of being) my moms help and the fact that I had a really good job that paid very well. 
Fast forward to May 2017, I became very sick and ended up in ICU. I have a medical condition that was in remission, due to all the stress I've been under for so long  it came back full force and I almost died from it, My body completely shut down. Since then I went on disability which ran out in August. My job let me go for not being able to get paperwork to them in a timely manner, the private insurance company I was dealing with has screwed me around in every way possible to get out of paying. That's a whole different issue...that being said I'm now sick, unemployed for the first time in my life, not receiving help or support from him, unemployment just denied me. I literally have no income at this time. I'm trying to take care of 2 little boys, 4 and 7 and I'm depending completely on my bf right now financially which is not a long term solution. It's not enough money for all 4 of us. The courts just tell me my ex doesn't make enough money to pay any more in support, not that he pays it anyways. I asked him for help me 2 weeks ago, he's know everything that's been happening but never offered any help. I explained the situation in detail and He said he could take the kids more and said he would help out with their schedules with school....but it was all a lie. He doesn't even respond to my messages now...

I go some days without eating so my boys don't have to go without. It's out of control and their dad has the ability to help but just won't. He wants to stay the fun weekend dad who gets them here and there and return them so he can have his freedom and life. 
If anyone has any suggestions what the heck I should do here...I'm at a loss...I feel like I've exhausted every legal channel....I'm still in debt 5k for attorney fees from the first CPS case opened against him.  I appreciate any advice or thoughts",09Nov2017,2
203,"Alright, some background. I am a 19 year old American citizen, and have lived abroad for a few years. Graduated high school in the Netherlands, and decided to go to a private university in Spain, costing me 10k euros a year. It's been a couple months into the first year, and I'm not happy, and can't really see myself doing this for 4 years. The thing is, since half of the payment was due at registration, I've basically wasted 5k euros plus the 500 euros that is charged every month of the program ( so ""wasted"" about 6.5k right now).
I'm now considering dropping out, moving back to the Netherlands, (where my parents still live) working for about 8 months, and applying to study in the Netherlands starting next September. Basically, I'm an idiot for not doing this in the first place, but I'm trying to solve it now. However, my credits won't transfer over (I already checked with the uni) so I have to start from year 1 in the Netherlands, and tuition is 10.5k a year. The good thing is that Dutch degrees are only 3 years long. Anyways, I would have to go through the dreaded Sallie Mae loan program due to my parents not having enough to pay for my university for all three years. There is about 6k euros left in my account, so just about enough to pay for half of one year, and if I work for most of 2018, I can save up another 5k~ which would reach to about 11k, which would mean having about 1/3 of my tuition paid off. Wooooo. I'm freaking out though, because that means I'll still have to take out 20k in loans. You guys in this sub seem like a wise bunch though...is that a lot, or ""doable""? I'll be studying International Relations.


Part of the reason of why I decided to study here in Spain is due to the high demand for native- English speakers. After doing a TEFL diploma (which I have not done yet), apparently I could make at least 700-1000 euros a month...enough to pay off my tuition. However, I'm not happy here and I'm very stuck trying to make the right decision. So do I stay, hope it gets better, try to make hella cash, graduate hopefully debt free or go back, have a community there for me already, better ranked university, etc.  Advice is very very appreciated, as my parents are not being very helpful in this regard.

I've spent my whole life indoors and never really got out to experience new things. I keep going through different types of careers and I set my mind to it for a few months and after looking into it a few times, I realize that career isn't for me. Right now Im at a loss. There is no career that I want to pursue. I'm trying really hard. I wish I had more options to be honest. My parents are strict to a certain point, and they are mad at me because I don't know what I want to do. They think that I am not motivated. But that isn't it. I am very motivated. I am smart, I pass all my classes. Piece of cake. 4.0 GPA at the moment. I work hard. The only thing is I am not interested in a specific area. If I had a career in mind, I KNOW that I would be good at it. I don't want to go to college doing something that I know I don't want to do.

I don't want them to look at me as if they failed as parents just because I didn't go to college. They are proud of my sister because she already has her life figured out. She's about to graduate college, she has a fiancé, and just in all she's a great daughter. So my parents obviously play favorites and wish I was more like her. I don't know what to do.....

Location: Idaho
Insurance: Tricare standard 

I’ll be graduating from college in May with my undergrad and Tricare has informed me that since I’ll be over 21 (by a month and 4 days) when I graduate, I won’t be able to stay on my parent’s health insurance and i won’t be eligible for Tricare Young Adult because I won’t be a “full time” student. I have an internship in the fall 2018 and then am planning to go on to graduate school the following fall (2019). I can’t go to graduate school right away because I want to do a joint program and the law degree only starts in fall and I have to be on campus for that. 

I’ve looked at certificate programs. Since Tricare bases “full time” by the institution and most of them list full time as 12 credits and a certificate is 12 credits I wouldn’t be covered or if I was it would only be for 1 semester. 

Is there any loophole you guys know of or any strategy that will let me stay on my parent’s insurance? Have I misunderstood them? Or is there another place I can look for insurance?

213,"Long story short, the 1st friend I ever made in Kindergarten is actually my 1st cousin and he has no idea. His parents split briefly and his mom had a fling with my Uncle, she told my Uncle she was pregnant but that she wasn't sure who's it was but the plan was to stay with her husband. My friend was raised by that man. Here's where it gets tricky, my friend is the baby, and looks nothing like his siblings but looks near identical to my Uncle. We are still friends to this day but not super close. For all I know, he could know that's not his dad, or his ""dad"" could know he's not his biological father. The mother for sure knows due to striking visual similarities. This has been eating away at me for 2 decades.

Last night I had a long talk with one of my other friends/roommates (let's call him M) about our frustration with some tension that's been going on with our roommates/friend group. Part of this was some frustration with my other friend, B. At one point, M mentioned that there seemed to be some tension between B and my boyfriend, which was a little surprising to me. When I asked what he meant, he said that he's heard B saying things like ""at least I'm not like (boyfriend)"" and complaining about him being immature. M tried to relay the example B gave, which was that me, B, and my boyfriend were in a car and my boyfriend asked someone (M couldn't remember if it was me or B) to buy him food, and whoever that was said no, but in the end my boyfriend convinced them. M also said there was something about videogames that he didn't remember (sorry that these stories are so unspecific, I think M might have just overheard them, hence why he didn't remember the details). I did not remember this car instance at all, and didn't really know what he meant about the videgame thing either, but I don't recall my boyfriend being very immature in similar situations. 

Knowing all this makes me very uncomfortable not just because he's my boyfriend, but because my boyfriend really likes hanging out with B, and it bothers me to know that B apparently thinks so little of him. I don't know if there's anything to really be done here though; I don't really want to confront B about it, because that would be betraying M's trust. How can I stop worrying about this?

220,"It's a complicated story but I really need some advice here. PLEASE. HELP. I would REALLY appreciate it. 

I met Craig less than 6 months ago, and have only hung out with him 5 times, casually. We have mutual friends but I never see Craig around when we go to parties etc. Our relationship is young to say the least.

Craig and I discussed renting a part of his workshop so I could create some large artwork. The space is about 45mins from home, but everything else seems like a good fit at this point. 

**Here's the order of events over a month period:**

1. Within the first week, I ask explicitly 2 times not to sign anything until I see the paperwork. I say this because Craig needs to re-up his current lease to add the workshop space. First he has to convince his landlord to rent it to him. 

2. I tell Craig several times that I'm interested in moving into the space. It all seems perfect.

3. I lose my job due to some nonsense- but have savings and ready to rent the space. This is just added stress and Craig knows about this. 

4. We continue talking, I say I'm still interested. I give my details and potential uses for the space. As a large format industrial artist I would need to use power tools etc. So we discussed things like noise hours etc. 

5. Craig informs me that his landlord will rent it to him but at $3,200, but I am only able to pay for 1/3 of the space and inform Craig that he'll have to come up with other income to make up the difference. I feel like he is doing a favor for me and I feel super appreciative.

6. About a week passes and I am still interested, but our conversation shifts to how he will pay for the remainder 2/3. I only bring this up because I don't want him to lean on me for income. He shouldn't be doing any favors for me. He has ideas of throwing parties and events in the space, but I'm not keen on this idea because it is supposed to be a workspace. Craig is also beginning to talk about ""fixing"" up the place and how it will look so good. He is talking about putting even more money into the space and it is making me uncomfortable. It is seeming more and more like Craig is putting his livelyhood on the line just to help me out.

7. I'm agreeing with his plan because I want the space, but keep telling him he shouldn't put more effort into this because it's going to be a messy workspace for my art in 1/3 of the workshop. 

8. At this point, I have only seen the space via pictures and through a peep-hole at night.

9. Craig calls to inform that he is putting money down on the space the next day. This was the first of my hearing that he was ready to put money down. Craig tells me it's happening tomorrow without my seeing any paperwork or laying out rules for usage of the space. I have not met the landlord who owns the space so haven't discussed what type of work I'm legally allowed to do on the lease. 

10. I agree on the phone because I felt pressured. We end the call. 

11. I discuss the above with my business advisor right after the call, and he tells me to immediately call back and delay the deal for 2 weeks because everything has been done verbally at this point. 

12. I call back and the floodgates open. Craig is furious. I'm attempting to get some paperwork from him, but he won't send paperwork over because he thinks that my delaying 2 weeks is cancelling the arrangement. At this point Craig is yelling on the phone that I'm a ""phony"" and ""we are not friends"" anymore. I have a bad taste in my mouth from this call. 

13. We end the call on an OKAY note. I say that I'm not pulling out, just delaying because I don't have the information I need. I need to see contracts in order to know what I'm getting into before i can even consider renting the space. He says he's not sending out a contract to someone who is not committed. SO. We are at a draw. We say we will be in touch. 

14. Fast forward 3 weeks to Monday. Craig hits me up to say hi. I know he wants me to rent the space because he put money down on it. But I don't want to rent the space from someone so hot-headed and irrational. I feel like I led him on. But I also feel like my needs were not met. 

**How do I keep my reputation amongst mutual friends untainted, while I need to distance myself from this whole situation. Craig and I obviously have different understandings of how business works. What should my response be?**

225,"Hello Reddit. I have a very sad tale to tell about a marriage that may be ending. I met my wife in person two years ago, but I've known her for almost seven years. Admittedly, we got married very quickly, but we both really loved each other so everything was okay for a while at least. My wife has bipolar II disorder, chronic depression, and PTSD. This has caused some problems, mostly because at first I didn't understand very well. She has a lot of past trauma which includes severe abuse by her parents, as well as abuse by several boyfriends. I've grown to understand her traumas very well and deal with difficult episodes in a much healthier way the past couple of years. Well, anyway, my wife has been seeing a therapist for her PTSD. This has gone pretty well for the most part. But then, about 3 or so weeks into her treatment plan, my wife was sexually assaulted by our close friend. My wife is a very friendly, trusting, and open person so of course this has devastated her to say the least. Ever since the event my wife has (understandably) been pretty distant and has gone through a lot of lengths to self isolate, only getting out on occasion. She barely eats, she stays up all night, and she drinks more than she used to (though she thankfully recognized that as a problem and cut back recently). We have had a few arguments since the event that occurred, and yesterday she told me she wanted a divorce. She said she feels as though she can't be a wife to me, and that she loves me, just not in a romantic way anymore. She outright said that it was because of what happened she feels this way. She later in the night revealed she wants to try but just doesn't feel like she could be close to anyone. She thinks I deserve more. I've told her I'd wait for her to heal, even if it takes weeks, months, or even years and while she's healing be more of a friend than a husband to her. She seemed to like this idea, but I'm still rather anxious about the whole thing. I don't want to lose my wife, especially not because a friend of ours betrayed us. Also, she has said multiple times this isn't about trying to get with anyone else or sleep around, etc. It's about wanting to be completely alone and to herself. We are religious (don't laugh) and I know she has strayed almost completely from God. It sucks, I just want our lives back the way they were. I don't want to lose my wife, as I genuinely feel as though she's my soul mate. I know I will never love anyone the way I love her. She is my heart and soul. I do everything for her. I bike to work because I can't drive, I cook for her, I clean, I buy her things, etc. She told me she knows about all I do for her and not to think this is about being a bad husband, but it's hard. She wants me to have better than her but I keep trying to tell her that no matter what, she is the best. I still feel a spark when we look at each other, when we hold hands, and when we kiss. I know it's there. I'm just completely at a loss for what I can do to help this situation.

tl;dr my wife was assaulted, and because of her past traumas and existing mental illnesses, this has almost ""pushed her over the edge"" and has made her want to be completely alone (romantically).",09Nov2017,2

227,"The strangest thing in the world happened yesterday and I have absolutely no way to explain it or have any idea what to do.

I work at a fast food restaurant that is constantly busy so the employees have to stand outside to take orders. Yesterday morning it had gotten really busy and I wanted to crank out the orders as fast as possible before I went on break. When we're this busy, it's typical of me to not pay much attention to what customers look like and just get straight to the point (ordering their food). 

Around noon, I approached a black car (don't ask me what type, I seriously don't know those things) and had asked the two people what they wanted while I was looking down at my order pad. The man in the driver's seat answered with his meal and then turned and asked the woman in the passenger seat (who I thought was his wife) what she wanted as well. When there was a really long pause and the man asked his “wife” again, I looked up and saw that my aunt was in the car. I was so shocked to see her there, and I wanted to say something but I just couldn't get any words out. The way she was looking at me was unsettling, as if she was caught in a lie. She seemed a little horrified at seeing me, and then quickly tried to hide her feelings and pretended that everything was normal by ordering. The man didn't catch her reaction, but I could see in her eyes that she was telling me to keep this a secret, so that’s why I wrote this here because I seriously don’t know what else to do. I wanted to say something to her but something told me I shouldn’t have. 

My aunt has been married to my uncle for over 20 years now. They're both in their forties and it seems like on social media and in person that they're really happy and in love. They have children too, which just makes it maddening for me.

It just doesn’t seem right. I don’t know who the man is but he was around her age as well. I want to say she's having an affair but I feel like there's more to it than just that. It just seems so odd that she’s all the way out here where I work ordering food with this man when she lives an hour away from me. I was almost going to bring it up to my mom when I got home that day but I didn’t. I couldn't get myself to because something tells me she doesn't know anything either and it would be best off if it stayed that way. But I really want to know what in the hell is happening and what I should do about it.

Anyway, before I got this job I planned a trip to go home to America for 3 weeks. One of the weeks is Christmas, so it doesn't matter if I miss that week. But I need a good excuse for the other two weeks. In total I will be missing 8 days of work. I already tried to get a day off when I had the stomach flu and they forced me to teach anyways because no one else could cover me. Which is why I'm worried. Also If I say I'm sick, I need a doctors note to get the time off.

So I'm wondering if I should just quit since I have only been working there 2 months. Or if I should makeup some crazy lie. Like my mom is dying, my sister needs my kidney etc. 

Also, another guy at my work had his mom really pass away and got his shifts cut down but didn't get time off.


Any suggestions?",09Nov2017,2
233,"As the old saying goes ""gotta start somewhere"", and that's for sure true when it comes to trying to get a significant other. I was wanting to know if it'd come off creepy to women if I randomly approached (say I'm walking to class, but have time to get to the other side of campus) and happen to catch a girl coming out of the residence hall. Would it be weird if I tried starting a conversation by walking up, and smiled and just said ""hey, my name is ABC!"" As a conversation starter?

an example is, I've decided to go to al-anon meetings for adult children of alcoholic parents (my dad). I don't want to tell her because A, she'll tell my father and I don't want either of them to feel guilty in reference to their parenting. and B, I just don't want to.

249,"Hey everyone. I feel like I'm not enjoying life. I believe that I'm not depressed or suicidal but I often feel unsatisfied in what I'm doing and it leads to some nasty episodes of negativity.

So for those still reading this silly little post, I'll tell you about my current situation.

I'm in a college course where I study and practice creating short films. I've got a handful of friends that I'm close to but I think they can be quite pessimistic and negative in their attitudes towards life. Other than this, I'm in a relationship with someone who has a completely different outlook on life to myself and we don't have a lot in common. When I see all of this stuff everyday I begin to grow tired of it all and I lose the motivation to get up and out.

I find myself diving into music and history for some escapism but the way some of my idols (Hendrix, Chuck Schuldiner) have lived seems so free and exciting to me that I wonder if a similar, more interesting life would be better for me.

I gotta know what you guys think. Should I get rid of it all and start fresh? If so, where should I start when it comes to building up a fulfilling lifestyle?",09Nov2017,1

The dreams always start with me waking up from the nap/sleep and continuing with my day. I’ll tell you how my most recent one went. But first, I woke up fully, decided to skip my first class and went back to sleep. (It happened when I went back to sleep) So I wake up (in my dream) and continue with the day, I had an online tutorial to do and work on my paper before my next class, however I got high (when I’m high I don’t remember anything unless told or seen when I’m sober) and later found out I drank too so it felt like I blacked out. When I found out everything that happened I was also told it was Friday and I was missing work and I was told it was Friday in the bathroom across my bed so I ended up trying to wake up myself up, again 1 second ahead and I officially woke up looking at the bathroom and every time I’m gasping for air (not that heavily).

257,"Hey there! So here’s my post here. I am a girl of 29 from east Europe, leading a life in survival mode after I got heartbroken after when I was 16. Ever since then till 24 I have periodic memory of myself and don’t think I ever made any important decision at all. I did the bare minimum everywhere. I went to the uni mom paid for and got useless diploma. Last uni year I got receptionist position in a huge oil company. 

Well, I still work here but now I am an administrative assistant and translator in engineering department

With years my life didn’t become happier. I ended up married to a man who occupied all my apartment and deprived me of personal time. Besides I didn’t get enough sleep because of him mostly shouting at team members in rainbow six. After several times I tried to say I need divorce when drunk ended up in fights initiated by me he took me to shrink. In a year a didn’t drink and fight at all. But he kept the habit... I ended up hiding in the kitchen on amphetamine to have some time just not hearing him. Used time well - studied abuse and made my final decision. So  a year ago a kicked him out and that was my first personal important decision in my entire life. This is the only achievement I am proud of. 

I felt so free and happy and for the first time in ages I’m feeling alive for the first time since 13. It’s amazing! But I led a terrible life and still lack control sometimes and find it hard to enjoy activities,

I met the guy that I think is the best person I know in the world and we live together now. i feel alive but I don’t seem to have same energy levels. The main problem is that I still don’t find most things as worth the effort to watch/read. Other thing is that my work is so boring. I have to spend a lot of time to force myself to do anything after I arrive 2 hrs late. I do the bare minimum required to not be kicked out. My salary is rather small but generally the team is nice. 

But I am so bored of this type of work. I am burnt out and can hardly make it to the office by 11am. Every task seems stressful. Sometimes I get to answer 2 emails only by 5 pm. 

And I have no idea where to start when trying to understand what type of work that would suit you? The problem is - I find most things tiring still and can’t even name what I really like doing now. I don’t have a hobby too. I don’t even have deep  interests I suppose. 

It might look like a poor start comparing to other people of my age, I know. But I am happy with recovering my personality  and finding the traits that I had when I was 13-16. I was so happy to find out that I am calm, resilient and have normal memory! 

I feel I am drowning at my work  but I have no idea where to start to understand the types of works that could be fulfilling and interesting for me. 

.Before my best hope was being free to commit suicide after my parents die. But now I want to live! And I have no idea what else I want of my life. We want to get married in a year or two and would like to have kids. But I feel sad that I won’t find a way to realize myself. How do I know what I want? I actually have no idea what do other people see as their vast life plans/goals? 

So what can I do except boring administrative routines and ms office? 

I can draw pretty well, but I feel too tired to do anything after we go home from work and do it very rarely. People say I am a good listener and give good life advice. And I am good at not panicking and finding solutions. It seems that people seem to like me and that also helps to get things done. As well I know I am quite good as a private English teacher. I had 2 students and they both seemed to love me and even asked me for a personal advice because they trusted me. 

What would you recommend me to start with to understand what profession shall I seek for and how to find my interests and life plans?

No matter the weather, my clothing, activity levels, inevitably I’ll be sweating, and the strange part is that it’s always more from my right pit.

(All containing deodorant as well, except Certain Dri) I️ apply them at night as well as in the morning. 
I️ do feel like my body builds a tolerance to deodorants and antiperspirants very quickly so I️ end up changing my deodorant 1-2 times a month IF the new deodorant I️ chose works at all from the start. 
But excessive sweating isn’t my concern. It’s that no matter that deodorant scent I️ apply, once the sweating begins, I️ feel like I️ smell.

It could be a mix of both, but when I️ think I️ smell, my boyfriend sticks his sniffer right in my pit, and says I️ smell good or like deodorant. 
Am I️ the only one who can’t differentiate BO from deodorant scent? 
Is my nose correlating the smell of sweaty, sticky underarms and wet clothes to deodorant and not body odor? 
Since I️ can’t tell if the scent is gross or like deodorant, I️ always feel like I️ smell disgusting and am embarrassed of the smell, much less the sweat marks on my clothing.

I'm 19 and I'm struggling with my mental health and have been for some time. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at 17. During a recent hospitalization following a suicide attempt I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I started seeing a  psychiatrist again and after several visits and a psych eval I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Today I had an appointment and my doctor recanted his diagnosed and said he suspects I may be bipolar, despite previously saying I ""definitely don't"". He also said I may have ODD(?). I cannot go to a different psychiatrist and I'm looking into being evaluated somewhere else. I have been told many times that the diagnosis doesn't matter as long as they're treating the symptoms but I've been in and out of therapists and doctors offices since 12 and I don't feel like I'm getting any better. It concerns me that no 2 doctors can reach a consensus about the state of my brain. I find myself wondering  how effective any of this treatment can be if I don't  know what the problem is.

281,"Hi. First of all, I’m in 3rd year of high school in Scotland (roughly 10th? Grade I think maybe). I’m an above-average, relatively smart student who normally, if not almost always gets an A in tests (A is 70% in Scotland for most tests, 75% for some others.) 

However, I get extremely stressed before a test, even though it probably doesn’t affect my future and is just a meaningless test for the teacher to ‘check on how we’re understanding the subject.’ Normally this wouldn’t be a problem, and hasn’t been until the start of this year. I’m afraid this could be affecting how I do in tests, etc. 

And this year hasn’t been an easy year for me already, which could be contributing to the stress. My dad died of a sudden heart attack in April this year and my grandad (on my dad’s side) died a few weeks later. 

But I think another problem is that I have ridiculously high expectations for myself sometimes (as my dad did) - like if I don’t get an A, I consider the test a failure. Even if I scrape an A, I still go into panic mode, start thinking I’m a complete dumbass, etc. The last time I got my lowest score ever in high school, 72% - I got a brain training app to play every day cause I thought that I was getting dumber. 

But, I usually get by with really good test scores with 90% in a recent maths test. Yet, when I did a French listening test today - even though the entire class found it too difficult for our level and the teacher himself said that our class were the ‘guinea-pigs’ and they might disregard this test and make us do another, easier one - I still think I am really stupid for not understanding a fair amount of it and have been thinking about it all day. 

I know this probably comes across as a major first world problem but any tips on how to manage this would help. Thanks :)",09Nov2017,3

I am getting annoyed as her BF is coming every weekend, they are hogging the bathroom and I can hear them through the wall. I am also getting woken up any time I want a lie-in (not often unfortunately), as she keeps slamming her door. I have spoken to her about it but it is still waking me up, and she still hogs the bathroom with her BF. I have tried moving my room around and also wear earplugs to try and help! I have also spoken to everyone about trying to tidy up a bit after ourselves, and have implemented a cleaning rota just to try and keep thing fair. 

She is getting annoyed at me as I play music while I study. It's difficult as we are both on the same course so we can't really get away from each other. I have my music on very quietly and I don't have it on any later than 11. Sometimes when I hear her and her BF through the wall I will play my music louder as I don't want to listen in. Otherwise it's quiet. Well she keeps knocking on my door to turn it down, shouting at me through the door, so I am having it quieter and quieter.

I'm a healthy person in my mid-20's living in a big city. I don't have any friends in the immediate area but I have a lot of friends from all the various places I've lived. I consider myself extroverted, positive, and outgoing. I occasionally struggle with depression but I've never felt that it's something I need to be medicated for. I have a full-spectrum lamp that I use regularly which helps with seasonal issues. I work from home and I live with my partner, so I do see someone on a regular basis. I'm pretty healthy. I spent an entire year backpacking and I'm pretty sporty.

I haven't been outside in ages. I take care of myself, eat well, etc.... but I haven't been outside. And I'm not inclined to go outside either. It seems like so much effort to go out shopping or running errands when amazon works just as well.

When I think about going outside I get a terrible feeling. It's like punishment. My brain always comes up with a nonsensical reason of why I don't want to go. ""Ugh now I have to brush my hair"" or ""hmm, the weather report says it's going to rain in 8 hours."" or ""I'm trying to save money and it'll look pathetic if I go to a free event."" I don't feel like this attitude is sustainable. How can I expect myself to maintain a healthy social life in this new city if I don't even bother to go anywhere?

291,"My problem is that everything is good except for the job. Location is good, pay is okay, hours are okay, it's in my field, the people are good, but the type of work I'm doing is stressful and I keep thinking about how I hate work and want to quit outside of work.

I just have to last 2 more months and then I'll have enough saved to not work for a semester to concentrate on school before working again for the summer. 

I'm hoping at the 2 month mark I'll get used to it.

In the mean time I just have to figure out how to mentally manage a stressful position. Do you have any suggestions or coping strategies? ",09Nov2017,2
292,I start college in Fall 2018. I currently live in Pennsylvania and am attending school in Pennsylvania. I currently live with my mother. My mother plans on moving after I graduate (in June) to New Jersey.I'm eligible for grants but only if I live in Pennsylvania. I plan on living on campus for the whole 4 years. I heard I need a permanent PA to qualify for residency. I can't afford to move out plus i don't turn 18 till June. Can I use my dorm as residency? If not what can I do that will allow me to claim residency?,09Nov2017,2
293,"Ok so I’ve had a crush on this boy in the grade above me for a really long time. It started out as just an innocent little crush that never really mattered to me because I knew there was no chance of us ever being together (we barely knew each other). But then over the summer we started hanging out together with a group of people and my crush on him got a lot worse. I think the reason this happened is because he either liked me back or was leading me on. We would snapchat each other and talk a lot and we always seemed to give each other secret glances when we were in a group or just walking by each other. Maybe I was reading too much into it because I liked him so much but for some reason I thought we had a chance together. But now it seems like he really likes this other girl and I know I need to get over him because he will never like me back. I know this sounds cheesy but I honestly feel broken inside and it’s wrecking me knowing that I like him and he likes someone else. I know it’s time to get over him but I have no idea how. I could really use some advice, thanks. ",09Nov2017,2

295,"Im a freshman in high school  and I wish I was not me.  I'm ugly. I know this. If I wasn't ugly wouldn't guys have crushes on me? If I wasn't ugly wouldn't someone say so? Maybe I'm ugly since I get good grades or study, maybe I'm seen as too nerdy even though my friends definitely aren't. My friends are gorgeous, perfect faces, curvy bodies, tan skin, straight silky hair falling down like waterfalls (either blonde like the glimmering sun or brown like rich chocolate), eyes so blue they seem as if they have captured the sea itself and soft, gentle facial features, smooth as silk. Me on the other hand, I'm no rival, with my long curly brown hair, hazel eyes, full eyebrows (sigh), full lips (only good quality), fair skin, button nose, slender body and sharp features cutting through my happiness. If only I was different I think everyday and I try. I workout. I eat healthy. I take care of my skin and hair but nothing helps. I work hard to be talented. I try to change my more shy personality. Nothing works. Btw english is my 4th language don't judge. ",09Nov2017,2

297,"My parents are dealing with this when it comes to my 8 year old twin siblings. My little brother is often shirtless outside; whether he's playing with friends in the yard or intending to go to the skatepark. The twins are absolute best friends (they're homeschooled, what can I say?), so my little sister also rides to the skate park and hangs with the same friends. 

My sister has been asking my parents if she can go out and play without having to wear a shirt, just like her brother. My parents seem to be hesitant to give a definitive yes or no. They've been letting her go out in her swim suit top, but she doesn't seem to be fond of that. Today, they told me she actually ripped the thing off right as she left. 

I really want to be of help and give them some advice. Anyone have anything I could tell them? Should they just suck it up and let her do what her twin does? ",09Nov2017,127
300,"I (28M) moved to a new city just over three years ago to start a new job in a new country. It was all new and exciting, until it wasn't. The one bright spot (and probably the only thing keeping me here) is my wonderful partner. She and I have been looking for a place together for weeks and we've finally found somewhere lovely. The only problem is that it's a one-year lease and I'm now dreading the prospect of another 12 months here (turning 29, nearing the end of my twenties, etc). In my head, I'd been planning for the past couple of weeks to save up and quit in approx. 6 months, and go travelling. So now I'm torn: do I take the place and try to enjoy the next year with her, see what happens? Or stick to my plan?

TL;DR: Can't decide whether to stay in a city/job I'm bored with to enjoy a nice new apartment with my partner, or save up for six months and go travelling while I'm still in my twenties.",09Nov2017,2
302,"I have suddenly been put on the spot by my husband, and I am at a loss of what to do.  Every year his birthday is an awful affair.  We usually are having a bad month and can't afford to do anything let alone give him a gift.  I work to do things but he still says he has a crappy birthday every year.  

This year though he was talking to me from work and happened to mention that he was really excited about this year.  We have money, but not much.  And yet he seems to want a miracle!  I know there is something really awesome I can do for him but I can't think of anything at the moment as my 8 month old is teething and crying non-stop. 

So here is the deal.  I have less than $100.  I was going to home make the cake, dinner has already been bought and planned.  He likes fishing, loves pets (but is allergic), he is a writer, and plays video games a lot.  Especially the Monster Hunter series.  He likes that so much he installed Monster Hunter World which is Chinese only and uses his phone to translate the pages.  

Any ideas how to blow him away for his birthday?",09Nov2017,2
303,"I’ll try not to write you guys a novel because I definitely could. 
I’ve been with my girl for almost 2 years now. It’s gone well so far, so well in fact that we recently moved in together. 
Now Ally (that’s he name today) has had health issues since she was little. Like fatigue when running and low blood pressure stuff like that. 

But when she reached her 20 it’s gotten worse to the point where it effects her work and her personal life. She’s now 29 and at her worst. Previously diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency otherwise known as Addison’s disease. However after several years of steroids with her health still declining we finally got with a endocrinology specialist who threw out that diagnosis. So now we are here struggling to find an answer. This correct doctor while very caring and understanding is helping all he can but this is no longer his field of expertise. 

She’s since been with a neurologist but again results come up with nothing out of the ordinary. On paper she looks fine. She even looks healthy, not overweight, good muscle tone. So there no explanation to why this seemingly healthy girl needs a cane and can hardly handle a set of stairs. 

Her work which is everything to her has placed her on a 90 day light duty period, after that it’s a un-paid medical leave. So she’s looking for a second job. So on top of health issues there’s financial worry. She’s my roommate and therefore responsible for half the rent and utilities. I make ok money and I work full time but I would barely be able to afford this place by myself. 

I’m closing in on 24 years of age. I love her very much and it’s hard to see someone struggle and feel so useless. I do everything I can. I️ provide moral support and go out of my way to brighten her day when she’s had a rough one. But it’s never enough. I can’t fix it. And I KNOW it can be fixed. I can’t imagine a illness like this doesn’t have some kind of solution. 

I believe she needs more than what she’s getting from her current medical professionals. But we don’t know how to go about getting her that. I with House M.D was real. Him and his sarcasm can figure this out. The point is that I am lost and out of answers. We just don’t know where to go from here. 

I know this is a loaded question with no one answer, but what else can I be doing? What else could she be doing? All I want is for her to be comfortable and stable and above all, happy. Any advice or words of encouragement will be welcome. I’m alone in this. Don’t really have anyone to talk to. 

Anyway thanks for listening.

305,"Generally speaking you are able to deal with inconvenience and loss to a regular degree but every now and again (rarely), something not that terrible happens and you go ape shit.

For example, you are happy as a clam driving in your car and you get pulled over and get a ticket. You spend the next 2-3 hours screaming and crying and feeling like your life is over and no amount of people talking you down seems to work. You say things that you shouldn't have said (like you feel like you want to die) and want to break things. This continues on for several hours with short breaks that mostly include silent anger and more things you shouldn't have said. You might punch a wall, you might flip over a table, you might even gently kick an animal thats bothering you at the time but you have just enough sense not to hit a person. This continues until you are completely physically and mentally exhausted. Then you take a nap and you wake up shaken but generally feeling all better.

I know that this is not much information to go on and making a proper diagnosis would be impossible with just this but I don't really understand what it could be and I would like to know what its leaning towards. I know some personality traits come into account here but consider that the person is generally calm and collected most of the time. 

Thank you.",09Nov2017,2
306,"I got a shirt from Etsy I thought I would review it. This is what I put: 

&gt; Everything was excellent (order processing, shipping times, graphics on shirt), but damn, this shirt wrinkled from the moment I put it on.

I gave it 4/5 stars. Not a horrible review. I praised everything, and gave my only problem with it. I got this reply from the seller shortly after: 

&gt; I just got your feedback. There should have been a little info card in your order explaining it would be like that until you wash it. Once washed it will be like normal. If this is the case, please consider revising your feedback. I go out of my way to make sure everything is ok, so please let me know if it is not. I would hate to lose a lot of these sales over The feedback. Thanks :)

Now, I did not see the info card and I have had this shirt for a couple weeks, so that is gone. So, it can be understandable that maybe I missed something. However, I am not sure if it is right for the seller to ask me to change my review. Looks like Etsy allows this and maybe it is apart of the culture of Etsy that I missed. However, I think my as a company you have to deal with the fact that some people may be unhappy with the product and you have to either go on our adjust your merchandising. Thoughts?",09Nov2017,2
308,"I'm a nurse in an inpatient hospital setting where we are often short staffed and our patients are often more critical than we can handle on our unit. So many days I come home worn ragged and it is affecting my relationship with my husband. But there is change in the works, we got new managers (who are fantastic) and we will be doing more interesting procedures and education. Eventually there would be opportunities for me to leave the bedside but stay involved with the unit (and further my skills and possibly raise in pay), but there is no timeline on when these positions will become available. I like most of my coworkers, except a secretary who is harassing and bullying staff (HR is moving very slow in regards to this).  We all used to work so well as a team.

I just got an offer from our outpatient department in a clinic setting. The role would be more office based. No nursing skills like IV starts or medication administration would be needed. It would be people skills, educating patients, and triaging patients/concerns as well as working directly with a doctor and midlevel provider. The pay is $2.17 an hour less than what I make now and HR will not budge on this. But it is guaranteed 40 hours a week, where I currently am at 36 with the possibility of being called off for low census, but I get shift differentials for weekends/nights/holidays. It is four 10 hour shifts a week, no weekends/nights/holidays. Currently I work every other major holiday, rotate shifts, and work every 3rd weekend.

I worry I will be bored in the clinic but the work/life balance seems better. I am often too exhausted mentally/physically that I haven't been working on hobbies or even keeping up with housework. In the hospital setting I have the opportunity to advance to a charge nurse with more pay. 

**Tl;dr:** Current job is lots of skills, more pay, shitty hours, affecting my home life but job offer is lower pay, better hours, might bore me to death.",09Nov2017,3

311,Hey there! I just found out from a doctor that I have a deviated septum in my left nostril. For years I’ve had problems breathing in my nose (started complaining when I was 7/8). Now in my mid-20’s I have insurance to do to an ENT doctor and get an idea of why. The doctor says that my septum is a 7/10 in severity (one being not a problem and ten being the worst). My doctor told me the ins and outs of the surgery but I want to get an idea from other people who have it or know anyone who has had the surgery. Was there a noticeable vast difference? Did you feel like it was worth it?,09Nov2017,4
