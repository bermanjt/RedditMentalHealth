0,I want to make a website for my blog/news hobby but I am completely new to this kind of thing. I want to have my own **personalized domain** and I am willing to pay money to set up all the hosting/creation of the website etc. Also having the option to link it to my social media would be spectacular. Anybody got any good ideas of where I could go to do this?,29May2017,2
2,"Hello every one,  

     Just for the record, this is a throw away account I made up specifically just for this post.  Let me start from the beginning.  

Im a 35 year old single father.  My sons mother left us both when he was 2 months old, shes not around.  In 2014 I had a full time salary job, a beautiful mortgage home, and my son and I were doing great!   

During this time my brother was running my parents business.  He was living at my parents home, running the business which is right next door, and not paying any bills.  He lived there for 5 years, ran the business for 5 years and never once paid bills for the business or to help my parents at home, which is where he lived.  My father always had to pay for everything.  My father was broke! My brother was just running the business to the ground deeper and deeper.  He didn't care.  He told the worker that he was just waiting for them to close it all down then he would leave. 

Fast forward to later 2014. My mother has just passed away.  He and my father have a huge fight.  My father found out that my brother took out loans under my mothers name after she passed. He found out he owed all of the vendors thousands of dollars and the workers were short on paychecks.  It was a big mess!  

So a big fight occurred and my brother left the house and the business.   My father being a 90 year man, was freaking out and didnt know what to do.  

I came to visit him on one of my days off and he told me what  had happened with my brother and how he left.  I felt bad but with a full time management job I didnt even think of stepping in.  Until my father called me later that night to come have dinner with him.  While dinner he asked me if I would consider stepping in and taking over.  I thought about it all and I said no.  

After thinking, the next day I made a decision to help my father.  I quit my job and sold my house and moved in with my father and took over the business.  Lets fast forward a bit.

So during all of this time,  I had quit my job, sold my house and moved back to my home town, moved into my old house and began  my new journey at the business.  May 2017, my brother makes a surprise visit after 2 1/2 years.  I am courteous towards him but keep my distance. My father on the other hand is some what happy. 

So these past couple of weeks my brother has been showing up every day and is just at the house next door to my business always chatting it up with my father.   Just in two weeks they have become very close, much more than before.  It seems everytime I come home from work, he is there.  It has become annoying to me after a long day at work to just see him there.  
I always make dinner for my son and my father.  Lately Ive been making dinner and my father wont eat, but my brother will call him or come by and say ""hey lets go eat"" and my father will say yes and go.   

I dont want to sound jealous, but I am feeling more disrupted!  I am a very routine person and I guess this disruption is really disturbing me.   Yesterday, I planned to ask my dad to go out to eat some chinese with my and my son , as I was going to ask, my brother pulls up,  plan cancelled.  Today I asked my dad to go to the movies with us, he told me that he was going to my brother house to a bbq.    

  I am some what worried.  I sacrificed my job and my home to come back here and fix the mess he made.  Now my father seems to act like nothing ever happened.  It bothers me because I know if it was me, things would be different.  

I feel like shit right now, all this work I put in,  not to mention the investments I made for the business to pick it back up, things I never even mentioned to my father on how much I spent!   I feel insecure about him coming around and feel that this is what my father wants,  he seems happy with him here, but I smell a rat.  

I have already sat down with my father and explained to him that I do not trust my brother.  sighhhh.  What would you guys do in a situation like this?  ",29May2017,1
3,"Im an 18y old male who gets along great with his parents. Last month I was fired from my part time job and never told my parents in fear of their reaction. For the past couple weeks Iv been pretending to go to work, but I don't like lying to them especially now when they have started becoming suspicious that something is wrong. I know my parents love me and only want whats best for me and the more I think about it this less then serious situation has become kinda stupid and juvenile. Im finally building the confidence to confront them with the truth and was just wondering for some advice on how to tell them. I know the full coming out with the complete truth is best, I would just feel much more confident confronting my parents with a plan in mind.

4,My wife of 7 years said she needs to move out to have time for herself.  We are still living together until she finds somewhere to live.  We don't have kids and we just have some dogs to worry about.  I just don't know what to do now.  I feel like I'm not processing this.  I don't want to think about it but I can't stop thinking about it.  I just want to curl up into a ball and die but I can't.  I have to keep living my life but I don't know where to go from here.  I have to figure out how to live my life all over again.,29May2017,5
5,"So this is kinda an earful, in terms of context, but here goes nothing:
-
Yesterday I was relaxing at home, hungover and, for some reason in an introspective mood.  The night before I went out on a shitty tinder date with some girl that I almost immediately knew I had no real interest in.  But still, I went back to hers, did the quick and dirty and then left to meet up with a couple friends to go out drinking for the night (Friday's have become somewhat of a ritual for us lately).  And next morning, in that state of being hungover, I felt a that aforementioned sense of introspection (i.e. ""what am I doing with my life?"") creep up on me.

--
Facilitatingly (to my mind-state) enough, lazily cruising the internet, as one does the next morning, I stumbled upon a video posted by an old acquaintance on my Facebook mini-feed.  It was a commencement speech.  But the speaker wasn't Will Ferrell or Matthew McConaughey.  It was some random you-tuber who I've never heard of, called Wong Fu Productions.  The speech was raw and real and connected with me in a very real way (link:  https://youtu.be/H5k9T12b9bs?t=4m17s).  It was centered around what you should expect to experience throughout your 20s and boiled down to two main points.

--
In your 20s everyone talks about and searches for: 

--
1) Finding out what you really want to do
2) Relationships

--
It went through the ideas that nobody truely knows the answer to the former and that you will do things you hate and things you love, but the point is to follow those urges of passion; and that love is about finding yourself, being with someone that will push you to be your best self and understanding that love is not magic.  A lot of cliche platitudes in the latter for sure, but if you have time to watch the video, I think the eloquent way these ideas are delivered will ring through to you as a cloud of universal obviousness. 

--
Anyways, after that video I stumbled upon another one about this woman who grew up in a rural strip of Maine, writing and making folk music as a kid.  In school she lost her passion and stopped playing for a while.  However, on a year of study abroad in Paris she had a spiritual experience with dance music, which up to that point in time she believed was the cheapest, most generically manufactured genre of music.  But at that point, something ""clicked"" and she came back to school to make music in where she incorporated elements of folk in to dance music.  Very interesting and inspiring story about following passion and, as an aside, a very interesting sound too.

--
But in culmination of watching both of these videos (and some other less relevant ones) in the internet rabbit-hole I plunged in to that morning, I realized that I may be unhappy with where I am in life.

--
I am a recently graduated student working in the financial sector in a big financial-center city. I went to school for business.  When I first started, I always thought I'd do internships marketing, fusing my love for creativity and strategy together in a role that I can travel the world and make a decent-to-strong income.  It just so happened that when I applied for my first internships I happened to only get one offer, and it was in finance, so I took it, and ever since I did 3 more in investment finance, not straying off the safe path.  I thought I liked it, I still do think I like it in many ways.  One of the biggest attractions to me was (and is) the conquering of the learning curve of how to assess an investment.  Every investment is like a subjective, million-piece puzzle, but the pieces are moving around as relevant parts of reality change, as if carried around the table by ants, and understanding/conquering that process has always been a draw to me (it still is).

--
That being said. I recently took a full-time job and in this role I have become more and more jaded.  In many ways I feel like I am seeing some of the worst elements of the industry (intellectual laziness, dis-ingenuousness, white-lying by omission, putting spin on things) and it has been slowly crushing me and the love that I thought I had for my profession.  Furthermore, I feel like there is no real opportunity to learn here, I feel like the only thing I can do to keep expanding my knowledge is personal reading on my spare time.

--
**After watching these videos and doing some ""soul searching"" yesterday, I can't help but think that I have strayed from a possible path that I may have been happier with in life.**  I have always had a very deep understanding of sound and a passion for writing (something that I admittedly don't actually do very often, but I have become more infatuated with the idea of over time) and the more I think about things, the more that I feel that I should quit my job and travel the world (which I have done a bit of and loved deeply) while writing and maybe painting and exploring other venues of self expression and realization. Even if I am no good at any of those things, I think the experience may be more important and bring me close to self-realization for how I want to live my life.  

--
**On the flip side, I acknowledge the massive risk that this proposes to my life and career.**  I am a recent grad making decent money in a market where -- and I know this from first-hand experience -- it is very hard to find a job.  In many ways I am incredibly fortunate to be where I am, and a rational part of my brain is telling me not to do something so radical (I say ""A"" rational part, because at the same time, I also acknowledge that my desire for a step back and rethinking my life and my personal values is not grounded in irrationality).  

--
As far as a quick commentary of the ""Relationships"" part of the afformentioned commencement speech video.  I think in many ways my desire to do this is just as much about ""finding myself"" and learning to love, trust and respect myself, as it is about rethinking my career path and values as a person.  I have had mostly one night stands in terms of ""relationships"" with two smaller relationships that lasted 6 months and 1 month (the latter ending fairly recently).  I am still young, but still I feel like I should have experienced realer more serious relationships by this point in my life, as many of my friends and peers have started to over the last few years.  This in many ways is crushing to me too.  I feel like I wear my heart on my sleeve and I am filled with love for others, and I think in part this excess love is really surplus love that I should have for myself.  I guess what I am saying is that, in some ways, I think I don't love myself the way most people do. 

--
I think I am unhappy, but am not sure... Is what I am doing right now just an investment that I should work out for a couple years so that I can reach greener pastures?  Should I wait to find out, given the way I've just described my feelings? Would it be short-sighted and frivolous to follow my gutt?  **I guess what I am ultimately asking is:   Reddit, based on the story I've just told, should I quit my job and go explore other venues that I used to think I was passionate for, but didn't do in order to ""play it safe""?**

7,"Hello,

I'm sorry if this is long. I'm not sure if it's because I just came home from a 3 week vacation in Asia, but I just feel so lost right now. (Please excuse the choppy writing, I'm a little jetlagged and just want to get my thoughts down). I'd love to hear words of wisdom from you guys and gals. I'm a 19 year old college student on 4 month summer break (yes, it's that long here). I'm back home now, and I just feel so demotivated to do anything...to be anything. I'm sitting here in my room typing this and I've come to remember just how lonely I am in the summer. I don't have a girlfriend, though many people in my life have told me there's no reason I shouldn't by now given the fact that I take relatively good care of myself and am generally a thoughtful and warm person. If there's one thing I truly want in my life right now, it's someone whom I can be affectionate with. On top of that, I've always had some trouble making friends, and currently I literally only have 3 people in my life, outside of family, who I consider to be true friends. Last summer I spent some time with these people, but mostly spent so much time alone in my house that some days I wouldn't bother leaving it, until I got a job last August and began working full time. 

Aside from severe loneliness, the job is partly what's bothering me. One of my seniors is an abusive jerk who enjoys finding any reason to criticize me. While I was on vacation celebrating my acceptance into a prestigious faculty at my school, he sent me a nasty message claiming that I had somehow ""seriously breached"" company policy by not checking my phone and updating my availability while I was on vacation. I was battling shingles (usually only found in 50+ year olds with poor immune systems) triggered by school-related stress on the first week of the trip and I didn't even have wifi for much of it. He even stated that he was ""very concerned"" about my future because of this ""job abandonment."" In reality, those who truly know me, including my parents and coworkers, know that I am an overachiever and a perfectionist. I worked so hard all year at school and work to go on that vacation and that one message really hit me. I decided it's best that I leave my job to rid my life of this abusive individual and work on improving my mental health. I've had a lot of stress and anxiety building up inside me because of school and work and feel as though I need time to look after myself better, both physically and mentally. FYI, the job and my new faculty are related, so the experience is valuable in many ways. 

I'm thinking of leaving end of June. My parents have told me that it's my decision and that we - truly - don't need the money, but I'm afraid to sacrifice the sense of independence that job has given me, the sense of purpose and even belonging. And I know it's stupid, but I don't want to lose the buying power the job gave me - my own ability to buy the things I like, the clothes and gadgets and food that have kept me artificially happy all year round, without having to ask my parents for money. How will I pay for that jacket spent hours looking at online? Or that new shampoo I wanted? I'm afraid I'll have nowhere to go, as I did last summer until I worked, and that I'll waste it away at home on my computer. I really enjoy working out at the gym, but there's only so much of that one can do in a day. I still need to learn how to drive. I'm trying to become a more independent and interesting person, and I feel this job has enabled me to take some major steps toward achieving that. Without it, I won't have a reason to go anywhere and interact with people who make my life more interesting.

I just feel really lost right now. I'd love to just talk with you guys and hear what you have to say. If there's anyone here with advice, or who feels trapped in a similar situation, please feel free to post below.             ",29May2017,2

She also scratches my rug (mostly at night when I'm trying to go to bed). There's a cat scratcher right next to my door (which is where she scratches), but she can leave the room if she wanted. I really don't know what to do about this.    
Also, spraying water won't work, b/c in the past when I sprayed her with water, she just sits and doesn't mind getting soaking wet. Also my cat doesn't mind the smell of vinegar and citrus fruits (which I know most cats don't like).

I do not go to the gym, and I don't plan to. I prefer to workout/excersie at home. I don't have much equipment, all I have is a pullup bar, 1 pair of 10lb dumbells, and a semi-soft mat for working out on. I don't plan on really buying anymore equipment, as I figured I can do alot with just my bodyweight and those few objects. Ideally, I would like to create and morning and night routine. Ya know, something I can do after I get up in the morning, or do before I hit the hay for the night. Overtime, I plan to begin actual workout sessions. Any tips?

Over the last 2 years I've gotten to know a girl really well and consider her my best friend by far. I've had a big crush on her forever.

But she leaves in 2 weeks and we're going to different colleges. I won't see her for a very long time and while we haven't talked about it, I know we're not staying together ""long-distance.""

But I can't tell her that because it's a stupid high school relationship and it will get weird weeks before we pull of ""staying friends"" afterwards. I'm happier with her than anyone else I've ever met. I've cried probably 4 times in the last half decade, and 3 of them have been just about knowing she's going to be gone and I'm going to lose her.

I usually eat only lunch and dinner with walking to classes being my primary exercise. Now that it's summer I need to find a replacement and exceed that.

I am 22, grew up in a strict Muslim home, with a bully of a misogynist father who beat me regularly and didn't let me leave the house basically. Last year he died. This drove my older brother, a mini version of him, crazy. He became crazier, stricter, told me and my mother (we all live together) he would have to be man of the house now. Today he found out I booked an Airbnb in Chicago with my friend and lost it. He beat me, I tried to fight back but he's much stronger. He hit my mother, calling her a whore as well as she knew about the planned trip. He has beat me before, and held a gun to me. I know this sounds deranged but I grew up in a violent home and this was a routine for me.
I need to leave this house. I am afraid he will hurt my mom if I leave alone but my mother is all about maintaining familial harmony or whatever and would never want to leave with me. I want to leave alone as well, as she has also imbibed all of these patriarchal ideas that I can't do this or that.

I know Im old, im 22. I just graduated college. I have no money. How should I run away?

25,"This may be a bit unorganized and I'll try my best to be understandable.

Backstory: I had an old friend (she's a girl I'm a dude) and we were bffs. I moved away at a young age and 10 years later I moved back to the same town. (We both leave for college in like 2 months). When I was gone I eventually got back in contact with her and we talked a lot. I began to kinda have a crush on her (probably irrelevant info tbh). 

Recently she broke up with her boyfriend of nearly a year and apparently it was a toxic relationship with a terrible ending to it. Both sides of the relationships are hurt and it's just a big mess. Although I have not been told the reasons why they broke up (I don't want to be intrusive and ask her). She asked me to attend her prom with her, and obviously I said yes. By me saying yes, more people are causing unnecessary drama about it and stuff surrounding the issue. (There are a few weird things I'm leaving out for privacy)

Basically, I want my friend to have a happy summer and I want her to know that I've got her back. We've already spent hours together hanging out since I've moved back a few days ago. I don't want anything bad happening to her from her ex or from the assholes antagonizing her. Is there anything I can say or do that would make things better for her? I'm sorry if this is a mess.

34,"I apologize in advance because this is going to be a long post, but I want to give the full context and this also is cathartic for me as well.

I have my B.A in psychology and went straight into graduate school the summer after graduation. I dropped out after the first semester because of growing anxiety/depression pertaining to not being cut out for becoming a therapist. I'm socially awkward and for whatever reason didn't factor this into my future career in this field, and fear I have made a huge mistake with pursuing this line of work (i'm 23 years old). 

I needed a job after dropping out, so I got an entry level job that had horrible hours (3-11 PM) and was an hour away, making my social life non-existent. The work was also not what I was told it would be, so during the second week of training I quit, and almost immediately found and got another job that i'm currently at now. 

This job is 8:30-4:30 M-F, which is way better and it's only a 12 minute commute. The problem is I have a case load and responsibilities that I've zero experience with, such as calling up to schedule doctors appointments for people, call managers of various other programs and coordinate meetings/dates, and deal with on the spot problems. As someone with social anxiety, I'm struggling hard to keep track of all my responsibilities. The kicker is that I've barely started my job in full, and have only 3 clients assigned to me out of the average case worker having 12-15, and i'm already feeling this stressed and anxious (the number of clients would increase throughout the coming weeks/months).

I know the logical thing to do would be to stick with this job as long as I can until I reach a point where i'm incapable of accomplishing my tasks, which would definitively prove i'm not qualified for the position. But in this instance the clients are of various levels of functioning and grow attachments, and making a mistake could be detrimental to not just my job but to their health potentially in the most extreme situations. So if i'm not capable/qualified to handle this, I don't want to wait until the breaking point, because by then there could be potentially a serious problem or incident for someone i'm responsible for. 

Just to give a little more context to who I am personally, I've never been to a therapist or diagnosed, but I'd assume I have some degree of depression and anxiety disorders, and a major self confidence shortage. I'll have my good days, but generally i'm dreading the next moment/social engagement/day of work, and wish I could be inside all day away from people and sleeping.

You can see how this is a problem then, when paired with the fact i'm a case worker which requires a ton of socialization each day. 

Quitting is a difficult task for me in any realm of my life, because I feel so bad for putting that burden or pressure on the employer/people who need to fill the position and hate doing that. Especially in a situation like this, where there's no good reason why i'd quit without getting into my life story with my supervisor (something I absolutely want to avoid). It's also compounded in this particular situation, because they keep informing the new hires (two other people) that they are so thankful we applied when we did, because they've been going through a staff shortage recently and everyone has had to double up on groups and extra clients which made their jobs way more stressful. So if I quit, that would add to their workload. 

TL:DR- I'm a 23 year old introvert with social anxiety and not formally diagnosed (but most likely have) some form of depression and anxiety. I have a bachelors in Psychology, and dropped out of my first semester of graduate school due to the stress, pressure, and feelings of incompetence with a potential career as a therapist. I got a job in the field with my B.A, and quit after the first 2 weeks. Then I got a second job which is where I am currently, but the responsibilities are piling up and the stress and anxiety is building to the point i'm dreading each day, and unsure if i'm capable of caring for the people i'm assigned to. 

I don't know a way out of this, and would love to hear any thoughts on my situation and what you'd recommend. Thanks for reading this wall of text, I apologized in advance but feel the need to do so once more because i'm sure there was a lot of rambling I went into that was unnecessary.

P.S- This isn't suppose to be a sympathy play, so please don't go that route if you're thinking of replying to this. I genuinely would like to hear people's thoughts on my situation and what they think is the best course of action.",29May2017,1
36,"It has been a rough couple of weeks. I went out to just have a few drinks with a friend -- we just intended to maybe ogle a few ladies that might also be drinking -- but instead, I felt like there was this deep anger slowly rising, and I ended up just telling him I was leaving, less than an hour there.

This isn't an isolated case, either. It doesn't matter who I'm with, or what we're trying to do, I feel like anymore, any time I head out to try and ""have a good time"", I wind up feeling angry and alone.

All I can keep thinking is how unattractive I am. Doesn't matter how hard I work, or the kind of person I try to be, I'm never going to be anything more than ""last resort"", if *that* much to anyone.

Even worse than feeling unattractive, is that I feel like I couldn't even connect with anyone even if I *was* attractive. I don't know what to say, or how to say it. It feels like every other person on the planet knows some kind of ""secret"", and I just don't. There are times I wonder if there's actually something wrong with me, that I literally have some kind of mental handicap that I don't realize, that makes it impossible to see why I'm so repulsive.

And now, I feel this anger and bitterness well up inside of me whenever I try to ""put myself out there"". I'm 29, and it feels like I've missed out on my chance to be happy. At best, I feel like I have to hope for things to fall apart with a woman to be willing to ""settle"" for me.

I just want to break something, or get in a fight. I feel so completely worthless, lonely, and unwanted.",29May2017,2
37,"Over the past 2-3 years or so, I have naturally grown distant from my father, due to his constant emotional manipulation, neediness, and pure narcissism. His personality is the complete antithesis of mine, being that he emphasizes superficial grandiosity and fanfare, shows an apparent lack of empathy for others, and is constantly marginalizing any individual that opposes him or his beliefs. It is also worth noting that he is a former extreme alcoholic, but continuously shows characteristics of a dry drunk.


I have not physically seen him for 1 month, and have been staying at my mother and step-fathers house, where I will normally spend at least half of my time. I have told my father that I have not been at his home for the past month, because his overbearing behavior is distracting to my online schoolwork that I am required to finish in the next 2 weeks in order to graduate high school.


In this process, he has constantly berated me over text message; questioning me of drug use, criticizing my mother and friends of ""brainwashing,"" and throwing guilt trips saying that I have ""abandoned him,"" saying that I have ""killed him"" by not coming home. He is sending threats of calling the police on me and my mother as a ""violation of the court custody order,"" and ambiguous notions that indicate he could harm himself or others (""I have no one else/nothing else to live for/you're my only family, etc."")
More than anything, he constantly demands that I come home, and questions ""what he has done to deserve this,"" saying that he has ""done everything for me."" In his demands, he shifts from a hostile, cursing demeanor into an emotional and pitiful conduct in the span of a few minutes.


He is in law enforcement, and carries a gun. My mother and I are additionally paranoid knowing that fact. In past experiences where the police have confronted him over domestic issues, he has used his badge as a means for swaying out of the situation with no repercussions.


I'm not sure what to do. While I do acknowledge it is difficult for parents to accept their children's transition into adulthood, my father has made clear that his selfish needs of keeping me in his home are his top priority. I no longer wish to be in a hostile and emotionally draining environment. I have already discussed with him that I will be living at my mom and step-father's house essentially full-time, being that the college I am attending in the fall is 1 mile away. Although I have no legal obligation to him in September when I turn 18, I am still stuck on how to deal with confronting this issue.


I am fearful that if I openly express these issues whilst ignoring him completely once I turn 18, the situation will only become more dramatic for all parties involved. Simply put, I do not enjoy him as a person or the decisions that he makes. I could use any objective advice on how to deal with this issue.

45,"Sorry in advance for how long this is probably going to be, and if you took the time to read it, thanks.

So last December, I (19 M) tried to kill myself. I felt extremely alone in the world and that I had nothing left. I've struggled with depression and self harm pretty much my whole life, mostly because I kinda had a fucked up childehood (abusive friendships, intense bulllying) that made it hard to ever get close to people or make friends. All I really ever wanted was to have friends or people that I was close with. Well, I had a rough semester in college and lost it and was about to kill myself. Well the police ended up getting involved and I was committed to a psych ward. It was the worst experience of my life. The place I ended up in traumatized me and really fucked me up. I have recurring nightmares about the place. Well good news, Im now in therapy, on antidepressants, and on the road to recovery and havent self harmed in about 3 months. I also really never told anybody about this because Im afraid of how they'll react. In fact, I went to extreme lengths to cover it up and make sure nobody ever found out. If youre going to take anything away from this paragraph its this: Im kind of an emotional trainwreck with severe social  anxiety and a limited knowledge of how to approach social situations. 

Well, come the next semester followong my suicide attempt, the person who I thought was my closest friend and the only person who had knowledge of everything decided to abandon me for a girl. I was still struggling a lot and basically had just asked him to carve out a little time to hang out with me since he was pretty much my only friend and he told me, and I quote ""You should have just offed yourself and saved everybody the trouble of dealing with you."" Great guy, right? Well, me being me went in to a fucking emotional spiral and started crashing because whay else do you expect a suicde attempt survivor to do when put in that situation? Well, I somehow started hanging out with this guy I had known since the previous year, but wasn't super close with. Lets call him Hanz. Well somehow we started to hang out a lot and actually kinda became friends. Then one night I told him everthing that happened. Don't ask me why, it just kinda happened. He took it really well. Since that point we've become really good friends. We talk everyday and we would hang out almost everyday. We've also gone on Spring Break and a few road trips together. Hes the first real friend Ive ever had and Ive opened up to him about a lot of personal stuff. Stuff Im not even putting in this post. Stuff that even people whove known me for close to a decade don't know about me. Hes my best friend and I trust him with everything. Hes been there for me more than anybody else ever has. And this is where things get complicated. 

I like him. Like I really like him, as in the attraction kind of like him. Ive recently come to terms with the fact that Im at least bi-curious and I definitely feel some kinda way around him that I don't really feel around other people. Also hes just a really attractive guy in general. But I have feelings for him and its a problem. He has a girlfriend, whos also kinda my friend. The three of us hang out together all the time. And like, him having a girlfriend is kinda a big deal. Hes not the kinda person who does relationships. Freshman year he pretty much slept around. So him being with this girl for over a year is kinda a big thing. Hes also not a super emotional guy, in fact if you meet him he kinda comes off like an arrogant asshole. But I know hes there if I ever need him and has my best interests at heart. Hes stuck around long after most people would have bailed. 

I just don't know what to do. Like I want to tell him how I feel about him, but it won't do anything besides making things uncomfortably awkward considering hes 100% heterosexual and has a girlfriend. I don't want to put him in that situation and risk the best friendship Ive ever had because of the way I feel. And he really cares about his girlfriend. Hes talked to me about how he feels about her and how this is the first reationship hes ever had without any real problems and I don't want to be the wrecking ball that comes in and complicates things. But at the same time sometimes its hard to be around them because they are in a relarionship. Basically anytime the three of us travel anywhere they just end up having sex and ignoring me for each other. I just feel like 1) Im third wheeling which makes me really uncomfortable because of stuff in my past 2) I get kinda jealous just because shes getting all of his attention. Its just kind of an internal struggle because I know I cant be mad because theyre dating and want to spend time together but its just hard for me not to get jealous. I really just don't know what to do at this point. Any advice at this point is greatly appreciated. :)

47,"Tl;dr: person I cared very much about is no longer in my life. I miss them but need to move on. How do I move on?

I miss him. It's not my fault, and I did everything right but I still miss him and remember all of the good times and we had. I'm talking to girls (I'm not actually gay, he just hit a soft spot where I cared for him like a puppy or close family member) and I have new friends who don't hurt my feelings. I just want some recognition from him but I know it's not coming. I feel like I can salvage the friendship somehow but I know I shouldn't. I cry every day and sometimes contemplate suicide just from the pain of heartbreak and loss. We might be in the same classes next year and I will see him again. My plan is to ignore, and not to get close again. Writing this helped if nobody responds.

I write him as sort of a villain here, but he's sweet and I genuinely hope the best for him, but it just felt like he was a real dick to me and he didn't realize it. He definitely got caught up in his ego after girls began to give him attention. Before he was lonely and I was the only one that talked to him on a daily basis.

Backstory:

Before I met him I was really closed off and didn't interact with others. I opened up and allowed him to get close and it was great. I am a better person because of it. He started to seem kinda gay for me (yes am dude) and I began to simply care for him in a non-sexual way for him except we never talked about it and it was only cuddles, light touches, and pressing our knees together under tables.

This was fucking fantastic. Until drugs. He introduced me to weed which was whatever. Then I got the great idea to jump to LSD and he was on board. We got caught tripping balls and everyone's parents involved put huge boundaries up. No more socializing with each other (we broke this later).

He got his phone back and we texted a little bit then summer came and he stopped answering my texts which I didn't think much of because he was at camp. I knew it didn't last all summer, but still he never communicated with me. It wasn't until we got back in school that we talked to each other again. It started off weird because I hadn't seen him in a while, but slowly we sort of redeveloped our friendship. And that was good.

A few weeks go by and he tells me about how he had fallen in love with a girl for like a week before she left him and moved onto some other guy. No sex or anything. He didn't seem to acknowledge the fact that we cared for each other, and I was really hurt, but I couldn't show it because we weren't gay we we're just two friends who cared about each other in a really gay way but didn't want to admit it to one another. I went home and cried a lot. I lost the support of my parents because of the drug thing and at the time he was the only person I cared about, my family didn't matter to me. I suffered all summer thinking about him and using him as my only lifeline of care only to come back and have it all be fucked by his summer relationship thing. I got dramatic, I contemplated suicide like many times before but this time I actually had a loaded gun just I wasn't ready to pull the trigger.

Whatever. Near suicide was nothing new to me I moved on and I kept chugging on ""one more day"". I could rebuild my relationship with him. AND I DID! We became closer than previously! We were actually holding each other now and he kept making gay jokes and giving me those eyes. Previously he had only put his head in my lap and called me ""baby"" or ""honey"" when he was drunk or high but now he did it sober.

But he doesn't always do this. It seems like he loves me then he turns his back and doesn't. Every day almost. One second we're looking at each other intimately and the next he's making fun of me. In a really annoying way too. He is all happy and joking around but what he's joking about puts me down. He doesn't purposefully do it but he's got some sort of ego because girls think he's cute. He seems to think he's better than me or something.

This goes on for months and I just feel terrible. He doesn't stop. It gets worse. Now he's saying ""I'm not gay, but if I were, I'd be out of your league."" In an upbeat joking tone that expects laughter. But it isn't fucking funny nothing in that is funny that's literally a put me down and he expects me to laugh. He talks about how I'm all serious.

I bring it up several times that I don't like that. I say that he needs to stop making everything a joke. He jokes about how I'm a snowflake.

(We're still holding each other and having little intimate moments periodically)

This goes on for months. I don't want to end the friendship because I love him, and he is still showing signs that he cares about me just he's also busting my balls by putting me down constantly. 

We fight because I told him he had no sympathy for me and that I shouldn't for him. We make up but things are still tense. I tell him he has to stop putting me down. The next day he seems to hit all the marks that piss me off. He jokes for the third time ever ""I'm not gay but if I were, I'm out of your league."" I don't react, that'd be open waters for him to make fun of me for being gay. He says some other shit in the same way and I'm pissed, but calm cool and collected on the outside. Then he says something like ""You can't take a joke, and you have no sympathy. You need a therapist for a friend."" This hurts me. I've been seeing a therapist b/c my parents have had me on appointments ever since I had an overnight stay at the hospital psych ward for suicide. I had anger issues as a child and learned to control myself to extremes, and this is the first time I show any of it in years.

I turned to him and stumbled through words shouting, ""What kind of a friend says that?!? fuck you."" (a cold fuck you). Then I turned around and left. I just heard him say my name normally first, then again but much fainter and sadder like a puppy that had just been abandoned. I drove home. Thought about driving into water and dying. Figured I'm not in a good place to be making a decision like that.

We don't talk. I disappear for a week. He doesn't say anything. I miss him. I text him ""wanna reconcile or no?"" He doesn't respond. This pisses me off. I find him and confront him, he's clearly off guard. I ask him why he didn't respond to my text and he dodges the question. He talks about how I just disappeared for a week for no reason. Fuck him.

A month later I'm still missing him but I know I can't talk to him. I've made new friends. I'm with a girl looking at a scenic view talking about it and she forces me to text him and put in words that the friendship is over. I ask him to stop using my hbo account if he still is and he just responds that he hasn't used it in months. I'm still pissed he didn't acknowledge anything. I block and unblock him on snapchat (it clears all the saved chats), delete the conversation from iMessage, remove him as a friend on everything. He knows. He hasn't said anything.

I'm 15 years old, and I'm pretty shy.

So I go to a technical school with 30 kids in my grade. I have been dating this girl for about 5 months now, but it's really nothing serious. I haven't told my parents yet, and I don't think I ever will because I want to break up with her. I'm honestly just not happy in the relationship, and I'm too much of a wuss to tell my parents. I really do not enjoy being with this girl, and I want to break up. 

This girl has had a troubled past, and has tried taking her life on multiple occasions before I met her. She told me that I am the only reason that she is alive, and that kind of makes me scared. I have a feeling that if I break up with her, she is going to take her life. Yesterday I had an argument with her, and we didn't talk for a while, and she told her friend that she shouldn't be in this world. 

This girl also will not take advice from counseling, and is very stubborn, even with life problems

58,"*(General advice about long-distance friendships is welcome if you don't feel like reading all this text)*

I have a close friend (let's call her Annie) who I've known since middle school. Ever since we started college (we attend schools 8 hours apart), we still message and call each other, but the long-distance factor has been slowly straining our friendship.

Being in two different environments with different friends and different majors, it's been hard to connect through conversation. When I talk about my STEM classes, Annie's responses sound generic (""wow, that's very cool"" or ""that sounds interesting"") and I know it's not her fault because that's not her field. But it does make me hold back what I want to talk about because from her responses, it feels like she doesn't care. Likewise, when Annie talks about her faith, I (an areligious person) am very possibly giving the same generic answers that I hate receiving! So our conversations tend to be shallow and sometimes frustrating.

The straw that broke the camel's back happened last month.

Annie got into a major car accident. She didn't sustain any serious injuries, so even though the news was shocking I didn't think much of it. She's also a confident person and when I asked her if she was fine and she said yes, I took her word for it. (Guess who needs to work on their empathy skills?)

About a week later, we were talking on the phone again and Annie commented that I hadn't checked up on her throughout the week. It seemed as if I didn't care or understand the impact that the accident had on her. In hindsight, I probably did come off as uncaring and I feel terrible about it. I apologized and she said she appreciated it, but since then our conversations have been short and infrequent.

When I finally mustered the courage to ask her out she panicked and asked us to just be friends for now. I know she panicked because the week after a friend of mine told me that she still had feelings for me. However trying to talk to her is the worst way to go about things because as I said before she just panics and runs away, or she ignores me over text.

It's been a couple months now and I've tried to start anew and move on but I really can't. It seems like every time I try something I end up seeing her again and I'm back at square one. (Avoiding her is not an option) we're still friends but I don't know how to tell her that ""we should date"" or something else relationship related to get some closure. 

Again she's not one to open up, or talk about her feelings, she can't even make the first move. She's an introvert who sticks to ""the plan"". I don't know why I like her but I just do.

I've heard the response of ""she clearly doesn't want to do this, move on"" but I've tried, and I always can't help but think what if she didn't panic and we were dating because she clearly still had feelings for me afterwards.

60,"Inspired by the askreddit thread, ""what are signs that someone is lonely"", I decided to make this thread.

I am a 21 person born in Spain. At a young age I moved to Brazil, the move was huge to me, and so was the cultural difference. In Spain I had friends, good grades, I spent more time playing outside than being at home, but all of this was about to change. When I was young, my parents were told that I am extremely smart, possibly even ""gifted"", whatever that means. Anyways, I had above average grades in school. However here in Brazil, we were constantly moving around, and as a result I was constantly going from one school to a different one. This led to me never being able to develop any friendships. I used to be a clown-type person, always joking around, and all that fun stuff, I participated of school activities like soccer and such, but the constant moving around ended up killing my motivation to do anything gradually each time I left.

Eventually I started going to a high school, in which I was bullied pretty hard. I was called names, my innocent, european mentality made of me an easy target for such things, I suppose. My grades plummeted, I dreaded going to school. Had no motivation to do my homework, and in group activities, I was the last person to be picked. One of my mistakes at the time was coming up with excuses for all of this to my parents, all this time they thought this was me being lazy, they never knew the events that led up to my... downfall. I failed a year in high school.

After this we moved back to Spain for a year, in this year I studied in a high school where I got along pretty well with people, however I was still unmotivated and ""lazy"" about my studies. A lot of arguing and family drama caused us to come back to Brazil.

Once I was back, I did not go back to school. I spent 2 or 3 years isolated in my room, rarely leaving and hardly opening up to my parents and other family members. During this period my father passed away, which made me fall even deeper into depression. My mother struggled a lot to keep the family together morally and financially, and still does. Eventually I found some strength to go back and finish high school. My grades were fairly high for someone who completely lost the student mindset, mostly due to the fact I did not spend those 3 years only playing games (which is something I love doing), but also did a lot of reading on many subjects. I was 19 when I finished high school.

The past 2 years have been the same as before, I am isolated in my room, no friends, unable to find a job, due to anxiety, failures from previous attempts, I just stay at home, play games, read the news and other things, watch anime, neet things. 

I know I cannot stay like this forever, as much as I'd love to. I would love to stay here, in my room, away from social interaction, away from rejection and disappointment, but I know I can't leech off my mother, I need to find a way to support my lifestyle, I simply do not know what to do at this point. I am afraid that one day I will be too old to find a job due to lack of experience.

I have had suicidal thoughts but I am simply too afraid to do it, afraid of what would happen next, and I do not want to hurt my family. But my life is too unbearable right now. I also tend to isolate myself from the people who care about me. I am not sure how they can help me. I have major trust issues.

I know this is a long shot, but why not I guess: What advice can you give me? Have you been in this situation, or do you know someone who has been?

62,"Ok the title of this post is a bit confusing but I'll explain what I mean in a little bit.  So some backstory, I'm a 19 year old college junior and my parents have been fighting for a long time.  My dad and my mom havent shared a room in years and ever since I was about entering my teen years ive felt my parents have been on the fast track to divorce.  They told me a couple times they were gonna do it throughout high school but it never happened.  I always thought once my brother graduated high school (He's going into 8th grade next year so in about ~4-5 years from,the writing of this post) that they would finally go through with it.  While the idea of my parents splitting up never really got me depressed, its something that after a while kinda just became normal.  Mom and dad dont like each other, what else is new.  I know the end is near, so I just removed my self from it, not my call either way.  I just went through the motions.

Fast foward to this morning, its been about 5 years since my parents have even occupied the same living space as the rest of us and on our trip to Pennsylvania my dad ask to talk to him privately.  He breaks down and begs me to help him fix things with my mom.  He says how he wants me and my brother to help him fight for marriage and that showing my mom,that I care would help.  I told him i would.

Here's the kicker, and I feel like the worlds worst son saying this, I dont know if this can be saved, and I'm not sure I do care.  I lied to my dad to his fucking face about how I feel.  I cant sleep and im about 8 coronas deep and I don't see myself quitting anytime soon.

 I dont know what to do.  What to I tell my dad, ""Sorry but I think you two need to separate?""  ""Sorry but I just straight dont give a shit Anymore?""

If anyone has any advice, anything please help me.  I love my mom and dad and all I want is for both of them and my brother to be happy.  But I don't want to lie to them and say that I think staying together is the best option, because honestly right now, I dont think it is and I'm afraid to see what my dads response to that is.",29May2017,1
63,"Hi this is my first post so please forgive me if I'm even posting in the right place etc. I would love some advice or opinions about my current quarter life crisis. I'm almost 24, still living at home and feel as if life is passing me by. I never continued education after high school even though I promised I'd take only a year off to travel and work etc but here we are 5 years later. I have a crappy full time job in retail and I'm just about over it. I feel as if it's too late to go back to school considering my age and not having anyone to relate to or fit in. 

At the end of my senior year in high school I had personal issues at home including my parents splitting up, anxiety depression and was diagnosed with ADHD. Since then I've just been working and partying with no direction or goals to accomplish. I constantly buy thing I don't need and can't afford to suppress me emotions and problems and I feel as if I'm poring water into a bottomless cup.

65,"I'm currently 21 years old. Since I was 15 I've wanted to be a (Corporate) Meeting Planner. This required travelling, which I WAS fine with. However, in 2013, I had went with a French Exchange Group to France that completely traumatized me from travelling, and I haven't found a way to ease myself back into it.

My story of France is ridiculously long, but I'll bullet point it hoping to make it shorter.

* I do not care what your income is at all, but I do care when you know you are poor and decide to host someone anyways. Every other American student got to go places like restaurants, movies, shopping, etc. I sat in that family's apartment for a week and a half, forced to watch French television, because her family was too poor to take me anywhere like the rest of American students.

* My host gave up her bed for me. This bed was so lumpy that I pulled 3 muscles in my back and spent the entire week and a half crying myself to sleep from the excrutiating pain I was forced to endure.

* Their shower didn't have a door or a curtain, just the shower head. It was so cold every morning that I ended up getting sick with a nasty cold and spent about half of the week with a sore throat and stuffy nose.

* Her mother wasn't able to afford much food, so I ate cabbage soup and really cheap spaghetti most days.

* I wasn't allowed to leave and get my own hotel room. This was a high school exchange program, so I was required to have a chaperone.

* My host's sister and her mother fought every single day. They screamed at each other nonstop, even in front of me not even caring that I was there.

* My French teacher unfortunately overestimated how much French I actually knew which resulted in me getting paired up with someone who barely knew English. The language barrier was ridiculous. I didn't speak to my host hardly the entire time.

* I missed Thanksgiving with this trip. Not against the family, just another sucky negative.

* I legitimately felt like I was in a prison. Lumpy mattress, cold shower, almost inedible food, unable to speak to anyone.

* My host ended up talking very bad about me and spreading rumours resulting in all of the other French students hating me and avoiding me.

* The only time I left the house was to go over to her friend's house because that was the only other place she went. However, her friends didn't speak any English either (understandably), so I was forced to sit in the same seat for hours without being able to speak to anyone. It was to the point where I became completely invisible and they stopped paying attention to me altogether. Being extroverted, this was literal hell.

* My parents paid out of pocket around $2,300 for this trip and it was an absolute waste. I will never forgive my host or her family for costing my family $2,300, ever.

I'm probably missing stuff, the entire trip and experience was awful and I'm probably subconsciously trying to push memories away from me.

And before anyone states this, yes I know if you host a person, you are eligible to travel to their country. The thing is, she was in America last year. This hosting service did not benefit her at all in any capacity. My host was selfish. She knew her situation, and placed me in her apartment anyways *knowing* she did not have the appropriate money or resources to host me. I will never forgive her.

Point of this post: This trip completely and utterly traumatized me. I want to be a meeting planner, but meeting planners travel to their meetings. I'm so angry and frustrated that this trip has ruined everything for me. When I'm in another destination away from home I only feel discomfort, which I never did before. I need something to pull me back into travelling, because I cannot take it anymore.",29May2017,1

So last Sunday I took a flight to Dubai from NYC to help my Dad with work for two weeks (time change is +8 hours). I had trouble sleeping the first and second days and thought nothing much of it, but it has seemed to have snowballed. Normally, I go to bed around 11 PM, but end up waking up around 2 AM and resting with my eyes closed for an hour before I fall asleep again.

On Friday I went to sleep at 9 PM but woke up at 11:40 PM and was up until 2:30, falling asleep about 20 minutes later. Normally, we have to get up at 5:30 AM to go to work, and I am fine most of the day until 2 PM when a terrible bout of sleepiness consistently falls on me. I have never been the kind of person to sleep completely through the night, but I've never had erratic sleep this bad on international trips and I have travelled quite extensively all around the globe.

93,"My SO is pushing 40, is overweight, leads a sedentary lifestyle, eats lots of unhealthy food (mostly fatty stuff, like hot dogs, sausages, frozen meals, and fast food), and lets stress eat away at him. He has high BP, a fast heartbeat, and was recently put on beta blockers. We've made a few trips to the ER for chest pain, dizziness, nausea... classic heart attack symptoms. He hasn't had one (yet), but it's a matter of time. I guarantee that his BP would drop and he could stop the beta blockers if he'd change his eating habits.

In the past, to lose weight, he just wouldn't eat. Which is terrible.  We discuss his health on a regular basis, and naturally, he gets defensives. Keep in mind, I love the way he looks; I don't care that he's ""fat."" In fact, I find his chubbiness attractive! I've told him this, but it doesn't help. No matter what way I bring it up, he gets hurt.

I'm scared to death I'm going to wake up one day and he's going to be dead next to me. I've told him this. Sometimes he does good to make healthier choices, but then he relapses into sitting on the couch all day and pounding a 20 pack of hot dogs in one sitting (no joke).

I don't want to watch the man I adore slowly die anymore. How can I encourage him to be healthier and support him in this venture? He has expressed that he's trying to do better, but he doesn't want me to hound him.

I do get all the stuff I really need (clothes, food, school stuff, trip expenses, ect.), but for the things I want personaly, like games, headphones, phones, or other big stuff, I need to save up myself. I do get 20EUR for a week to eat at school and I spend almoust all of it. I do get few hundred EUR for birthday and I tend to spend it once I get it on the things I needed the whole past year.

Well, I tried some saving tactics, yet I don't think they are very helpfull for me and it is really frustrating that I can't replace my crappy 5 year old phone, who is anoying me every time I use it, to a new one (And I would need to save my money for 5 years to do so, tho :/).

I am thinking about a summer job, yet I don't like direct contact with people (like selling stuff), so I don't want to go behind the counter and work something that strictly follows orders, a work in a storage garage moving around stuff would be perfect! Yet I don't have any realatives working in a place like this, so I don't think its possible, since I'm not 18. :( And also, I might could work only for 2 months and I would need to take 2, about a week long vacations. I don't think it's a good deal for a job giver.

TLDR: I don't have a big income (10 EUR/month), I don't think I'll get a summer job and I failed with a lot of saving strategies.

Hello r/Advice, my name is Jeffrey and I am new to this subreddit. I am 18 years old and I still live with my mom, dad and brother in our home in The Netherlands.

I have a very annoying/bitch of a neighbour that likes to 

A: Turn the music up to 100 and is standing there with his decibel meter to check if we cannot report him to the police yet. 

B: Is shooting his PCP air rifle in his backyard which is obnoxiously loud, so loud that our dogs and I hide upstairs where we aren't as vulnerable as in our own backyard.

C: This is what he did last night when my mom was sitting in our backyard smoking a cigarette http://imgur.com/a/Nf110 he put up a big spotlight to where my mom was sitting.

D: He went on to our yard and pinned his used crossbow arrows in our yard.

E: One time we tried to talk some sense into him much like the first time and he completely went nuts about a hidden stash we have and such nonsense that we knew trying to talk with him would not help. So we decided to fight fire with fire for once and we turned our music up at some point he just climbed up on our fence and sat there half way into our backyard just sitting there and ""teasing"" us.

The biggest problem here is that he doesn't decide to talk to us he just goes to extreme lengths to annoy the living fuck out of us. 

I even tried to take my own life because I wouldn't want to be a part of this world anymore with a big thanks to him, I am currently visiting a shrink/psychiatrist and I am getting help.

Was good friends with this girl (I'm a guy) when we were little kids. I moved far away. We lost contact. About a year ago I found her on a social media and we began to talk a lot again. I've visited her. Eventually I moved back and now I live about a mile away from her. When we were talking over phones and stuff I began to developed a bit of feelings for her. But with 2-3 months left till we both leave for different colleges it seems a bit pointless. But I still like her. I have a hunch that she may like me as well. As the first two days of me moving back she has invited me out to drive around (which lasted till about 1am) and then she invited me on a walk and then we eventually hung out at her house after. She now asked to go to a movie with her and I think a hike at a local park. These all seem like ""dates"" but I can't figure out if shes into me that way. I don't want to risk losing her as a friend if I attempt to make a move and fail. Along with that she just ended a horrible relationship almost a month ago that affected her really badly. She has asked me to be her prom date because I assume she didn't want to go alone (which I said yes).

Sharing the love we both have for Indie and Alternative music, I asked her to write her number down so I can tell her what I thought.

Fast forward to that Saturday,
Me and her were at a fancy restaurant talking about life and such, everytime I complimented her, she would blush and say something really cute.

The next Wednesday, her power went out, and I offered her to come to my house so she could study and freshen up. Her Mum said she isn't driving that far, so I called an Uber for her, and she came. :,) And we didn't necessarily study, we were talking about music and video games she plays, I used to play games, so I could kinda relate.
(It was honestly so hard to stop myself from kissing her that day, but I managed to stop myself.)

And here comes the fun bit

She has a boyfriend in a country on the other side of the world. When she's awake, he's asleep, and when he's awake, she's asleep.
They used to date irl, but he moved away, so that's great...

And I know it makes her upset to an extent.

And I honestly just want her to be happy.

111,"Just for some background, I'm a male, mainly introverted, nerd and spend most of my time gaming.

One of my friends got invited to a party and was told to invite some of their friends, this friend (also a nerd but much more social) invited me to it. I met with the host of the party briefly on a trip with said friend, didn't really talk to them much.

So on the day of the party everyone got pretty drunk pretty quickly (this was also my first experience with alcohol, and as I learned at 2AM the next morning, I should have researched how to re-hydrate and properly deal with drinking), oh, and I forgot to mention the host of the party was female so the majority of the people there were also female.

Toward the end of the party, a bunch of my friend's female friends (I know I've used the word ""friends"" a lot), start jokingly nagging my friend about who he fancies within the group - I find this pretty funny at first as my friend avoids the questions and hurries with me to ""hide"" somewhere. He already told me that he does indeed fancy one of them and tells me not to say anything about that.

After they realise they aren't getting anything from him, their attention switches to me, as I said earlier I'm a hopeless fool when it comes to social occasions so I had no clue what to say here, for a while I kept dodging the questions and doing the same as my friend did earlier - he tells me to just name someone so they'll forget it and leave us alone.

Big mistake as it turned out, the person I named, I kinda did like, they were pretty attractive and seemed intelligent and funny from my brief experience with them - except at this point I was drunk and had no clue what to do in such a situation, I wasn't ready for this kind of social activity. The person I'd named told me that nobody had ever asked them out before, and that they would date me (I don't know if this was the alcohol talking or not) - once again I'll say I had no idea what to do in this situation, and my friend saw that so he swiftly dragged me away to ""hide"" again. He thanked me for getting them off his back.

Unfortunately, it seemed that I had accidentally made an impact on the person I had named, she came up to us, and my friend quickly covered for me, saying ""He was just trying to stop them hassling us"", she seemed very upset at this and I felt awful, I didn't want to make this person so upset, seeing as I did, kind of like them.

She talked to me alone for a brief minute or so, asked me if I did truly like her, ""crap"" I thought to myself, what do I do? I had no idea what I was doing and after what seemed an eternity of ""ummm""s and ""uhhhhs"" I told her yes, I did, and we exchanged numbers, and agreed to decide whether we wanted to continue this the following day.

I returned to my friend and told him I had messed up, and was very worried because, one, I didn't know if I was ready for this kind of thing, and 2, because I'm incredibly sympathetic and was afraid I would upset her if I told her no. My friend told me he'd talk to her for me the next day (as the person and my friend were friends), and that everything would be alright.

The following day, I was feeling awful (had been vomiting since 2AM), my friend texted me, asking if I could perhaps come with him, the person mentioned earlier and a few other friends for a walk in a nearby park where we could talk, I was pretty debilitated so I had to decline - he said that was ok and that he would talk to the person.

Many hours later, toward the evening, my friend asked me if I liked the person, and here comes the part where I messed up big time, I told him I barely remembered what she looked like, and ""not really"". I now sincerely hope my friend didn't show her this message, because as I said earlier I did, kind of, like her and felt really bad about the whole ordeal.

That brings me to today, I haven't spoken to my friend or anybody else for that matter and feel pretty nervous about what happened the days previous.

That also brings me to the reason I am making this post, I would like some advice on what to do next, what I need to do to clear things up and make things right with the person and my friend.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

What do you women truly want from men?

It is money? status? ''Love''? Partys? Puppies and roses? 

I'm not upset, i'm not bitter, i'm just a young man in my twinties that lived under a rock studying hard only to find the current situation society is.

People just divorce like it is nothing, a lot of my friends are already divorced, going for seconds or third marriages. It would seem like my parents are the only case of true lasting love in my social circle.

Life is to short to spent in mistakes, and i feel like talking to a women would be one. Sorry if it sounds horrible but i am lost.

114," It is important to me because I use English a lot and I just want to know if there any hard-points I need to improve. So here is the post. ""Why we judge, like always. Why are we always seeking for negatives in other persons? You are not good enough, you're not right, she's not beautiful enough, he's not kind enough, you've made a mistake, he's not good enough artist or writer or worker or professional or moneymaker, and that lady is not good enough mom or thinks not enough. Enough! There is no such a thing in the whole universe like right or wrong good or bad or not enough. We invented it as a term to express our point of perception, and that's it. Those are points of perceptions. The question is why we choose to search by our minds for that point of ""not enough"" in others. SO You're enough wherever you're and you will be even better if you want to. You're enough even if you like to judge or be angry, and you're loved. But that hurts. Judge hurts.""

This year, I am given the choice to stay, leave the general course (the one I'm currently studying) for an animation course, or take an ICT course as an irregular student.

But my problem is what I should take? I would like to take the ICT course but I don't know if being an irregular would be too hard for me, like too many subjects being added. I thought of taking the animation course because I thought that there might be a bit of coding here and there, but I was wondering if the things I'll learn there would be worth it. I don't want to stay on the general course because they have a lot of side lessons that I don't think I'll have much use of.

118,"My boyfriend (27M) and I(27F) have been together for 3+ years now. Actually have our second child on the way, any day now. In this 3 years, I have worked. The entire time. Until I got pregnant with our second child. I have been stay at home mom since January of this year. Been surviving off tax money. Until now. That money has finally faded to the last like, $100. So I brought it up to the bf that maybe its his turn to make money. Since I have for the past 3 years. And since I haven't been working, I have been doing Everything at home. Cleaning, cooking, baby watching... while I was working his mom or sister helped with that stuff. 
His reasons as to why he doesn't have to make money: the one and only reason I even slightly think is legit, is the fact that he is epileptic. Which can make some things difficult. But there are plenty of people who are epileptic and work. BUT. The whole reason I'm asking for advice here, is because, we have a roommate. His cousin. Who pays $300 in rent a month. Barely half our bills. And the BF says that because it was his idea, and his plan to have him move in with us and pay rent, that the cousin paying rent is the bfs income for the house. Apparently not the cousin who is working and paying his own way. It makes the bf the landlord. Which is his ""job"". So he doesn't need to do anything else. That $300 a month is suppose to cover both the bf and the cousin. I'm getting pretty agitated thinking about it. I just wanted to see if there's any logic to his point of view on this. Am I crazy?

119,"Really need advice on my situation, and perhaps air some things that I think might be contributing to it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I am a 26 / m and suffer from really bad anxieties, which I have suffered from all my life. For the most part, I can just about force myself through life but to say it isn't a constant battle would be a lie. I am really uncomfortable around other people, especailly ones I don't know. This makes every part of my life outside of the comfort of my home a real struggle, I constantly feel awkward and totally uncomfortable in my skin, never knowing what to say or even how to sit/stand/where to put hands. Over the past two years I devoloped a horrible habit of sweating a lot when I am uncomfortable, which could be anything from a job interview to a transaction in a shop.(basically anything with human interaction) I only really sweat on my face, and it's not the smell or quantity, just that it's really visible on my face and as soon as it happens I get physically uncomfortable and normally just end up running away as soon as I can, leaving people confused and wondering why I was acting so shady. Sometimes there's no problem, but depending on how busy the place is and how I'm currently feeling it varies.

I hate it, and when it happens I always get deeply depressed and feel like I'm absolutely nothing, because It's kinda pathetic right? Surely something so simple should be easy, but not for me. Because I hate this and social interaction so much, I am borderline agoraphobic and I've spent many weekends just locked in my home, not talking or speaking to anyone. Afraid to tell them because I've never opened up to anyone about anything, but also aware that this is only making me worse and I just don't know what to do! These feelings have resulted in me having a bad alchohol and weed problem, of which both are under control but the problem is quitting all that just gives me more time to think about it and not just ignore the problem, and that makes my depression worse!

I have a feeling this stems from genetics, as my parents clearly have problems of their own, and we are the total opposite of an open and 'lovey' family. Growing up wasn't easy with a very aggressive dad. Never physical but a lot of mental abuse. Always just shouted at and never reasoned with, alongside a mother who is a total enabler to my older brother who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. It's hard to put it all into words but helicopter parents come to mind.

Now to make matters a bit worse, I am moving to Australia to live with a friend for a year in a bit to get away from the toxic family household which I think is holding me back with the total communication breakdown and helicopter parenting. That being the case I will not be in England for longer than a month, which could complicate things if I was brave enough to actually fucking talk to someone about it. I'm so lost in a sea of thoughts in my own head. I've tried meditation, exersice and clean and sober living/eating but it hasn't helped. I am sick of this.",29May2017,1
121,"TL;DR I used a Zillow relator for one showing and he was horrible. Told him I'd use a family friend he was very rude now he won't stop texting me. 

I am in the process of buying a home and started out with putting my information into Zillow to see a place I was interested in. I am not purchasing a high end home just a small condo. So I get a call from the Zillow agent to show me the home. We go see it and it was alright but he was grossly unprepared with no sheet for the home and couldn't answer simple questions like how long has it been on the market, etc. I still sent him a few places as he did say he could show me any house on Zillow. I sent him about 5 different places and he said he would make an appointment asap. Then he said he actually had other appointments and wouldn't be available for another week or so. Either way all the houses I sent went under contract before I could even see them. He sent me three places that we're about 45 minutes away from my desired location and $50000 over my budget.  He also sent my information to a loan officer friend of his who reached out to me by email trying to get me to use him instead of the officer I was pre-approved through.  I decided to go with a family friend who helped my friends purchase their house and did a great job. I let him know I was going to be using someone else and thanked him for his time. His response was very rude saying I used him and that he sent me so many houses and it would not be fair if someone else sold me one of them. I simply said thank you for your time but I will be using a family friend who's schedule is more accommodating. Since then he has texted me three imes saying good luck the house you want is under contract and has sent me another property (not remotely close to what I'm looking for) and then he texted me again today saying happy memorial day hope your search is going well.

122,"I’m not sure if this is the best sub to post this. If someone knows a better sub, please let me know.

My dad is retired and my mom is expecting to retire in a couple years. They are in a position where after my mom retires, they’ll have just enough income to pay the bills every month. They are in some debt (I’m not sure the total), so they also need to pay off their debts. However, it will be difficult for them to do that with retirement income. 

My dad is always trying to dabble in new things to make extra income and he’s never very successful and never really finishes one venture before seeking out the next. He has investments of small real estate where he is breaking even or losing money over time. One of his new things is trying to ride the Shopify wave and create an online market with some trendy product. He wants to get my mom to work with him on this so that she has something to do that’s also bringing in money once she retires. My mom is not interested and gets easily flustered with anything technological. I am annoyed because I already know that this is not a fruitful venture.

They have a house in a slowly up-and-coming area. I have suggested multiple times that they should clean out their basement (it’s full of mostly my dad’s junk accumulated over time), renovate it, and rent it out as a private basement. I see HUGE potential here for them to create passive income that would be very beneficial. However, my dad seems to kind of ignore me whenever I suggest it and my mom is all for trying it but cannot make way with my dad to help get rid of all his junk.

124,"God Damned JFK airport fucked up, but in this rare case in my favor. InB4 obvious ""What are stupid"" posts. I only ask because I had to wait 2 hours for baggage claim (fucking JFK) and struck up a conversation with this dude. He seemed pretty cool. We both had a mutual hate for JFK airport for example. Anyway when we finally got our bags he looked through his and became really upset. I asked why and he said that he lost $100+ and a havana cigar. I said something like 'feelsbadman' and we parted ways.

This happened late last night (May 28th). Later on early this morning i got to my aunts house to crash. I looked through my luggage and sure enough I find a purse thingy thats not mine. In it is the cigar, a clip of 8 20's, and other sundries. There is no other form of identification. I didnt catch this guys name. What should i do?

It's been everyday for a couple months and starting to drive me up a wall. I've tried everything I know. I pinch my nostrils and puff and that fixes it for about a minute. I tried to remove any water in my ear and there was none. I even swam near the bottom of a pool to pop them again and maybe cancel it out but that didn't work. Does anyone know how to fix this??

126,"Background: My best friend was adopted around age 11. Her previous home was super abusive and traumatic. Her current homelife/parents are amazing and supportive. However, no matter the extensive therapy she's been to she still hasn't fully resolved her trauma/issues. Also 3 years ago, someone from her ""previous life"" (as in before she was adopted) recently passed away and this person was incredibly important to her. We are both in our early 20s now. Her personality to someone who doesnt know her that well can be standoffish, a little rude/bitchy, judgemental, snobbish (she is a little of every one of those things but truly has a heart of gold, lol.) Once you know her, she is smart, hilarious, and generous. She's also really hot, which is how she gets so many guys.

My friend is a SERIAL DATER. Every month she has a new guy that she found on a dating app or random place that she claims is ""amazing and treats her like nobody else has."" Each time I meet them/hear about them they are all pretty douchey or not right for her. She also has a lot of sex, so much so that she's gotten a few, um, diseases.

She has spiraled pretty hard lately. She dropped out of her nursing program because she was jealous of her friends going out without her. She moved to a dif country temporarily to ""find herself."" She came back with a new boyfriend. Recently, her latest dude (he was a rich trustfund kid) broke it off with her because he found someone else (ALLL of her relationships always end badly.) I took this opportunity to try and get through to her and tell her that she needs to do some soul searching, learn to love herself, find things that make her happy that doesnt include guys, the right guy will come at the right time. To this she responded,

""Growing up I was told Im not deserving of love. Im just a horrible selfish bitch who will never find someone. I either fall for the crazy ""bad boys"" because their energy matches mine and I get treated like shit, or I date the boring but safe guys who treat me nice but I'm not genuinely happy with them like I would be with the crazy ones."" 

To this I said, there are many happy mediums out there and again - THE RIGHT PERSON WILL COME AT THE RIGHT TIME. She pretty much ignored me and kept repeating that she wants someone, now. She can't stand to be by herself and has tried ""soul searching"" before in a different country but JUST CAME BACK WITH ANOTHER BOYFRIEND! 

I'm just so exhausted and tired of trying to be a good friend by supporting her dating decisions. I worry about her wellbeing and that she's on a dangerous path, being that she dropped out and all. However, if I confront her I'm scared she will get defensive and angry like she did with our other friend who confronted her. That didn't solve anything. Her parents are also enablers who support everything she decides/dates 100%.

So, we just bought his grandmas car, as I was all the time using it anyway and she feels too old to drive.

Then my BF took it to his usual garage to fix a headlight. He mentioned we had just bought the car second hand and was how bad luck, the light just stopped working the next day.

After picking up the car from fixing the headlight we drove to airport (usual 1h drive, we do it all the time also with this car) but on the big hill going up it started to loose power and going up, and all the motor lights started lightening up. We checked in the manual: it's the Diesel filter. I'm pretty sure over the last year this never blinked as I was the only driver.

Moreover. We took it to the garage, and they said it's the diesel filter and either it's possible to clean, or to fix it's more than the car is actually worth (this is a Passat from 2012).

On one hand I think this might be, but I just want to be sure, is it possible that they switched the filter or something when My boyfriend went there for the light?

136,"I'm going to keep this as short as possible so any questions, please ask. I've been in my relationship for 5 years, we met while in highschool.  Things were great for the first two, then we had a fight and I come home to a note and all her stuff gone, aside from her cat, who she claimed in the note has a good home here and will be well taken care of. long story short she ran off with another guy within 48hrs of the split up. I don't mean just went on a date, she moved in with him, became intimate and all the while I was trying to get her to come back home so we could talk, being that the thought of her with another man devestated me. That was three years ago this November, and we got back together after she had spent a week at dudes house. She was very dismissive of me during this time, but I kept fighting to get her to see me since I knew she was just caught up in her emotions using him as her coping mechanism. Shitty. I know. 

So, we get back together after she comes over and we talk things through. She's lived with me since the first year of dating, so she moves back in. Things go ok for a while, aside from the left over pain from previous events that I was dealing with, it made it hard to trust her in the coming months/years. 
She then went to visit family out of state, and claims that her mom shut off her phone, abandoned her out of state,  and her aunt and uncle got her a job which she was forced to go to and completely cut her off from the outside world. No phones, internet, etc. Mind you, at this point she is 20 years old. I'm devestated.  I just want to know where she is, what's happening. At the time I knew nothing other than calling her phone gave me a disconnected number playback and she hadn't been on Facebook or anything. After about a week, her dad calls her to talk to her and in his ignorance, doesn't ask his daughter yes or no questions assuming someone is filtering her responses. Her dad's girlfriend grabbed the phone, asked her if she was happy there, she replied no. Asked her if she wanted to come home, she replied yes. Claims she was scared that they were going to reprimand her for wanting to leave, and or was being forced to stay.
Her dad got ahold of me, expressed his concern, I shared with him our small correspondence in screenshots of the texts, and he went to get her because her mom refused to entirely. 

Last year, I pull into her works parkinglot because she was WAY late coming home, like obviously something had to be going on. She works part time at a restaurant, so there's usually not much in the way of hours let alone overtime. I pull up, see her car there still, and start to think I'm just an asshole with trust issues. So I'm sitting there, figured she's due out soon since it's going on two hours past her shift, I'll judt see if she wants to hit the grocery store together before we head home. She pulls up in her ex boyfriends car, with him driving. This happened once more through lying about her work schedule, which I caught onto as well and showed up to break up the reunion. Not long after, she's at her MOMS house and is completely ignoring every attempt I make to contact her. So I show up. Guess who's car is out front? 
Hasn't happened since, to my knowledge. 

She stayed the night there the previous night claiming it was snowing too hard, which it was snowing, but it wasn't that bad out for anyone that has to deal with it every year. The roads were fine. 

I'm really feeling psychologically abused here, she tells me I'm insecure and incapable of trusting her but she does things that prevents me from having that confidence in her. I love her, but I'm not sure she really loves me. I now feel that she is just here because she knows I'm a good guy that cares about her and I'm going to college. She smells success in my future and wants to be a part of it. I have NEVER lied to her, hidden anything from her, talked to another girl, or anything that would hurt her really. I'm not perfect, I slack on some chores and I'm a homebody, but I have a ton of friends from high school when I was a lot less domesticated. I had some rough patches growing up, started drinking and partying at 14, wrote graffiti since I was 13. Who the fuck parties with a 14 year old? They were all in their 30s, looking back on it now I don't understand why I'd even be wanted there being underage and all. That's besides the point, I've calmed down a lot and find myself happiest reading books and learning / working towards my bachelors. So I don't go out a lot. When I do something I like to stay safe and bring it to my house, smoke some bud drink a few beers over a bonfire or whatnot. 

I'm to the point of depression now. I can't stop worrying about her, I care about her to the point it's numbing all other emotions and I'm really fighting with myself here. She seems to think I'm overreacting. Am i? Be honest with me, I really need some input from people who aren't biased by their relationship with me or her.

Oh, icing on the cake, that cat and I really bonded when she left. She was a kitten, I was a mess. We cuddled in depressed blanket cocoon for days. I love that cat. She now insists it's her cat, she's taking it if we split up. Any input on that would be great too, as in what I can do to make the ownership official or legal so if she ever runs away with the cat when I'm not here its within the law for me to say it's a stolen pet? 

Unfortunately with the Rollercoaster of events creating a summary wouldn't tell the full story, but here it goes.

TLDR;
Got together in highschool, 2 years later she leaves while I'm at work. I inherit cat she left behind, she comes back, signs of fuckery are witnessed a year later, I show up at her work to catch her in the car with her ex from highschool (before me). This happens twice. Caught her third time at her mom's house hiding in a 'snow storm' with him. She insists I'm insecure and incapable of trust, I feel my emotions have been reduced to sadness and worry. 

This summary may be inaccurate, as I said a lot has gone on. If you're interested enough to read all of this, you are a truly wonderful person and I thank you for your time and input. Sorry I couldn't make this shorter as I intended. It's been going on for a very long time, a lot has happened.

Just a heads up, I am not experienced with this stuff. 

At the beginning of the year, I was at a party by myself and eventually found myself chatting with these two guys. (I was waiting for a friend that never showed up.) They were nice and all, I believe they were trying to flirt, but I eventually just said ""I gotta go"" and left. 
They don't go to my college, but to another in the area. So I don't see them on campus. But there was an event a few months later between a handful of the colleges in the area and I bumped into them again. They remembered my face, but not my name so ended up sending a friend over to ask what my name was. 

Maybe a week later, they both send a friend request on facebook. I accepted them.

Then three weeks ago, one of the guys just texts me how are you doing. I found it really odd and random that he sends that, but I go with it and text him for a few hours until I let the conversation end.
And then just yesterday, the second guy texts me how was college and now I'm just suspicious and stalling, trying not to answer.

So far, I have had really good internships in big companies, I have a decent amount savings, I study at a TOP university in a STEM program and I am on track to graduate in 2.5 years. At the same time however, I have been told that I need to grow up and be more responsible. My belief has always been that if I am going to have a good time, might as well do it while I am young. As a university student, and a general young adult, I really like going out with friends to clubs, almost every weekend, sometimes twice. I drink, I smoke, I sleep around, and I try to have a crazy time whenever I am free. However, after some harsh comments recently by a close friend I have come to reconsider my lifestyle. Is it childish for me to want to go crazy for another year or two? Or should I start dialing it back, be more responsible, find a hobby, and in general do normal adult stuff?",29May2017,1
151,"I'm not really sure if there's anything I can do about this, I myself am already very distanced from the issue and have not met the individuals involved. That said, I'm anxious about the situation and I honestly want to at least feel like I tried. Maybe there's at least something my sister can do?

My little sister is religious and attends a christian a school. There are a number of kids there who attend one local church which, I don't know all the details about, but I was already aware had EXTREMELY toxic and harmful beliefs (for example, I know they believe that having a mental illness dooms you to eternal damnation.)

So she has one friend regardless of those beliefs who she recently found out is being physically abused by her parents-- or, excuse me, receives regular physical discipline for doing things so much as not speaking loud enough. This kid claims that she's ok with this and believes is the right thing, but not only is that not an excuse as she's a minor, but story I was told leaves me to believe that she's being psychologically and emotionally manipulated as well. In this specific case my sister doesn't want to do anything about the situation, both from fear that her friend will get hurt more and from fear said friend will hate her for it.

More broadly, I am aware now that the church the girl and her family attend encourages this sort of behavior and harm. I don't know if that might be a more legal issue? If it is I can look more into the details and post on legaladvice. I'm fearful that if this is happening to the one girl, this is likely happening to many children in the area whose families attend said church. I'm under the impression this borders on a cult-type situation which I know are incredibly tricky to deal with.",29May2017,2

And also she keeps monitoring everything i do making feel nervous and start to do mistakes to.
And when she is doing something wrong she doesn't listen to me and become angry and passive aggressive (doesn't even look at me or makes a fuckin irritating face).
i tried to tell that she is making me stressed but she doesn't care.

157,"Hi, I've been out of college for ~6 months now. I've had a job working as a data analyst after going to school for Computer Science and Engineering. I thought this is what I've wanted to do for my entire life but now that I've been working I've been nothing but tired and sad?

I thought it was because the type of work I was doing was too easy so I was feeling unchallenged. But I applied somewhere else and did a coding test and instead of feeling excited about work that was difficult I just feel unsure of myself and if this is really what I want.

My brother is extremely passionate about this kind of work, but I don't feel like I have that same kind of passion when I'm working.

159,"Excuse me if this is the wrong subreddit for it. I have absolutely no idea where else I could post it. And sorry for a wall of text. I really have lots a thoughts, but no one to talk to.

I'm a 20 years old student, from Belgium. Born on 14 Oct 1996. Since I was little I was always into gaming, cars, etc... The casual things many people enjoy I guess. After becoming older, like mid 17 I started to like analyzing people. Learn their behaviour and pattern. I do not analyze every person I meet by the way, just some. Probably the ones my brain find interesting. I'm not sure why I started with analyzing people(I blame maturing), I'm certain I analyze people more than the casual human being though. (This info will come in handy later in the text).

So in high school I studied IT because I liked gaming and wanted to learn how programming worked. My interest in it didn't die after I graduated high school. After graduating I did go to college doing IT again but I quit. I didn't see myself later working on a PC for 8 hours/day 5 days a week. So I was thinking for a while during the first period of exams in college. Why do I not go study psychology. I like human beings, I love helping people and well I like analyzing people quite a lot. Also a factor of me deciding to change was people/psychologists told the that I would be an amazing psychologist. I'm really a kind person, everyone has his bitchy sides but I always have put others above me. Others first, then me. Their problems have to be fixed first, then mine. So I changed. Here I am now, in Psychology, exams coming up but again my motivation is dying. Yet again I don't see myself working as a psychologist. There is a huge amount of students graduating as a psychologist here in Belgium. So I know It won't be easy to find a job, especially since I'm not a special star. I'm just an average student, actually more on the lazy side. I barely study. I always aim for the 60%, never higher. I even stop filling in questions on math exams if i'm sure that I've reached around 60% on that exam. (Yeah somehow I can do math really good). I don't shine, I'm bit weird (as many have told me. It's not like weird weird, everyone says it's something special about me). And I'm a foreigner even though I'm born and raised in Belgium, I still have a different name than the casual Belgian man. And if they offer me a job it will be a really 'lame' one I won't like doing. I'm a very creative person, I don't like the 8 hours a day office job or any job that has the same pattern every day. I have absolutely no idea what job would fit me. I've lost all my friends since a girl blackmailed me so can't really ask someone. New people barely know me (funny how ask help on Reddit). And paying a therapist just for this is kinda insane. 

I do know I'd like to somewhere with authority. I just wanna help people. I know this sounds insane, but stuff like Dr.House and The Mentalist amaze me so much. Actually mentalist was also a small reason why I wanted to study psychology. I like it. But I know if I graduate here, it won't be anything like The Mentalist. Being a doctor came also in my mind, but I believe I'm not capable of doing that. So much to memorize. I'm too 'dumb' for that. Also I fail to memorize things perfectly. Like e.g. memorizing a script for a play. I can't, I always liked to improvise. And well improvising isn't something you do as a doctor I guess, or as a therapist/psychologist.

So here I am Reddit, asking you to help me put on tracks. I have no idea what I want to be.

PS: If this helps some of you guys, I took an official personality test. I'm ENTP-A.

162,"My dad is a 50-something year old man who comes home unhappy to see his wife and kids. I'm his son, and I can't handle hearing him talk or seeing him anymore. He's so very impatient, he won't wait for anything, not even for a family member reason. He's also the most irrational and unreasonable person I've ever come in contact with. Whenever he gets mad he's super biased and will stay to his opinion, whether he is right or wrong. Also, even if you want to reason with him, he will always say ""why do you always have to debate me"" or ""you're good at debating huh"" or ""whenever I give you one you always give me three"" (whatever that means). Almost every single argument I get in with him I'm always the one ending up crying and hearing him yell the usual ""stop crying."" Even if he makes someone cry, whether it's me, my sister, or even his wife, he always thinks he's right. It's so cruel, he doesn't understand it. I'm sick and tired of trying to put up with his bullsh-t. Every year I get into more than several arguments with him and he always gets his way through by forcing through his bias. 

I'm not of age to move out yet, but I already want to. He has caused many arguments with my mother, and I can't even count how many times they have wanted a divorce. He always blames me for every single goddamn thing, he even blames me for being the reason for every time he and my mom desired a divorce. My mother truly wants a divorce, but she won't get one because she knows that my dad would want me to stay with my dad and she knows that I don't want that. 

He also compares all of us to other families, whether it's people from church, our family members (more specifically our very successful relatives), etc. This is one of the most hated characteristics from my sister, mom, and I. It's truly horrible to always hear ""______ has a new Lexus, they're always going on vacations, earning good money, how come you're not like that?"" This ties in with the fact that he always trash talks everyone and has a big mouth. Even with the fact that he's only been a basic cook for 20+ years and earns an average income. He always says sh-t and won't even compare to others more successful. Currently he's complaining to my sister and mother about how they've quit their previous career choice and how his ""dreams were crushed."" It's quite a terrible thing to hear when he says ""______ doesn't earn any money, why did you take that insteat of being a ______?"" (by the way, I've blanked out everything that I've kept personal.)  He's talking all this smack about why my sister and mom should've kept going with their dream. It is 100% not even their fault, they have valid reasons why they've went other ways with what career they wanted to pursue in.

This is a little off the topic in my opinion; he is racist and has a strong bias upon other peoples races. It's absolutely inadequate that he always has something to say when it comes to anyone except his ethnicity. 

He's hard to live with if I'm being honest. I'm honestly only plotting moving out so eagerly just so I can stop being such a burden to his life. I've heard him say he loved me once in my life, and that was in a previous argument where I completely lost it and said he needed to give me space and that I'm not a child (please don't comment anything upon this argument, it's not what I'm posting for.) Even if he's said that, I can't see that he truly means it, it doesn't feel genuine. He is always disappointed in us and I just can't handle it anymore. What can I do to cope with this lifestyle I'm living through? 

tl;dr: My dad is an unreasonable, racist, impatient, biased man. I can't keep tolerating living with him and I don't know what to do.",29May2017,3
165,"Hey everyone. I've got a bit of a situation on my hands that has me somewhat confused on how exactly to handle it. This might take me a bit to explain, seeing as how there's some history behind it. Please bear with me.

I've had this ""friend"" of mine that I've known ever since we were in middle school. For a long time, we were each other's best friends. We were both kinda the outcasts in our own regard, so we both wound up forming a bond that lasted a good many years. The good that she did, is/was good. She was always very thoughtful. She always remembered my birthday and periodically bought gifts for me (birthday and Christmas in particular), without expecting anything in return. She was loyal to a fault. And even though her and I didn't exactly agree with or understand one another's views, thoughts, and questions for the other, I at least admired her passion for what it is she believes. Even if it did sound like something that was total nonsense, it's what she believed and I learned to respect it. I was also the first person she came out to as bisexual when I think we were in our late teens/early twenties. I personally had no problem with that whatsoever. She was my friend and nothing was going to change that. (I'm a straight female, by the way)

Even though we had our differences, we were still able to set most of our differences aside. The ones that we couldn't or events that happened during the course of our friendship were fairly vital and drove me away from her. She was a bit of a repressed wild child, so when she felt like she could be herself she was. Who that person though was incredibly toxic and made me feel really uncomfortable. She was always highly critical and judgmental in her views and opinions of others when she had no place being so, even if that person was me sometimes. When we would want to do something, it always had to be what she wanted to do. Everything I wanted to do was stupid to her and told me as much. She put me up to some pretty humiliating pranks and scenarios, thinking it was funny. When I told her how it made me feel, it was as if I was in the wrong for not laughing and agreeing with her all the time. Sure, all friends fight from time to time. Not as often and as heated as we were. She's a bit of an OCD control freak that wanted me to be like her (I pretty much got told that at one point). And I'm the type that hates to be controlled and didn't just agree with her because it's what she wanted. I thought for myself and I don't think she could accept that. I was more reserved when it came to social events and sexuality, and she was much more expressive about it. Not saying I'm a prude, I just don't exactly need to know THAT much about someone's sex life, much less any of it.

We had our moments to where we stopped talking to one another for months on end because the arguments were that bad. Which during those times, I always got to see exactly how sensitive she actually was when she came back around. And it was always some big apology with a peace offering and buttering me up. Until the next argument happened. 

The biggest one was when she got married; this was the first time that was a huge strike against her. Now, she was always a little off kilter psychologically. (I believe mental illness ran in her family on her mom's side.) I think she might have been schizophrenic/depressive based on what I know of her, which explains the erratic behavior. So when she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding, of course I gladly accepted. Although I was in college at the time, I did let my professors know that I'd be taking a day or two off class to be a part of it. The night of the rehearsal, the wedding party was there (as many as could make it) and part of the ceremony that the pastor/priest/reverend wanted to do was communion. She being an avid Christian HATED the thought of even a sip of alcohol, even if it was sacramental wine. This triggered a meltdown to the point of calling the wedding off. I figured, ""Okay, she's obviously this upset about it so chances are this'll be put off indefinitely."" So I went to class as usual. I got a phone call from her five minutes before class was starting, saying that the wedding was back on and if I can still make it. Being that it was last minute, I told her that I can't and that I'd be in class today. Because she called it off the night before, remember? I was quite livid and stopped speaking to her for just yet again expecting me to just drop what I'm doing. And avoided her at all costs. She wound up divorcing this guy like two or three years later.

Eventually, we did speak again and I told her what she'd done was unfair and selfish. I didn't let her back in as easily and for good reason. From there, the falling outs and falling out of touch got worse and breaks between speaking got longer and longer. It was always her though that kept wanting to be friends and contacting me.

A few years ago, she looked me up on Facebook for the first time since I moved out of state. We tried to reconnect, but I just wasn't feeling it. I tried though and gave her the benefit of the doubt. She was even more out there than she was before. Trying to have conversations with her just seemed as if she took it personal or just became irritated for even challenging her in an attempt to understand. During which one of those, she basically told me that I ""could never accept her for who she is"". Even though I was the one who was forgiving and accepted her unconditionally in the past. I was done with her at that point. I didn't want her drama and I just had no connection in common with her after the many times it's happened before. It became a one sided friendship, with it being her throwing herself at me time after time.

Fast forward to this year at Easter. I got a text from a number on my phone that I didn't recognize. So I asked who it was. When she said it was her, without hesitation I said to her ""I thought you'd written me off since that last falling out we had. You're the last person I'd expect to hear from.""

""Nah. I cried on your birthday last year. You used to be my best friend. I've missed you,"" she said.

So then of course came the Facebook friend request. And the awkward catching up conversation. I really didn't want to be back in touch and regretted answering that message. Yet again, I'd indulge and see if maybe she'd changed. So we talked and it was uncomfortable, almost seeming forced and neither of us really knowing what to say considering neither of us expected to hear from the other one again. I haven't really spoken to her since then. It was so awkward, I actually changed my settings to where she can't see my posts anymore. I do know she looks at my older posts, based on the fact that I get a random ""like"" from her every so often. Almost like I'm saying ""I really didn't want to be back in touch with you, but since you went through the trouble I'll give you a small glance into my life again."" She has sent me messages on Facebook or texts with things we used to laugh at and enjoy, not understanding and realizing that I'm not the same person she remembers me being. To which I'll give a short answer if I happen to ""see"" the message.

Here's my dilemma with this and where I need some advice/insight. When I look back on our friendship, I don't see a friendship. I see someone who has had feelings for her now married former best friend for many years. She didn't know how to deal with her feelings, so she wound up mistreating me or becoming overly emotional. She can't stand the the thought of not being in touch with me and will still do whatever to be a part of my life. She's either in love with the idea of me or she's just in love with me; one sided and unrequited. I'm not sure if I'm reading into this and if there comes a time to where I'll be faced with talking to her again how I should let her know that we're just not good friends for each other, based on how she's treated me in the past; nor do we have anything in common anymore or return her feelings. It is a delicate situation and I'd like for her to maybe understand the reality of the situation. ",29May2017,1
166,"A friend who had intentionally and knowingly hurt me whether it was once (extremely inconsiderate) or multiple times and not apologize for it, I wanted closure. I told them that what they said and what they've done to me aren't really what friends do. I felt like I was in a toxic relationship and if anything, if we were really friends, they'd agree and want me to be happy. 

So after removing them, they try re-adding me or try to force a conversation when I told them I no longer wanted to speak to them. Do you think they're being selfish and not considering how I would feel? To not give me what I want not even for once. To linger on and to keep me under this kind of torment... ",29May2017,1

193,"Hi there,

Today marks exactly one month since I started work as an apprentice software and web developer. I've already had several run ins with my boss that seem completely unjustified and I'm starting to think I'm just being used for the cheap labour.

My first week on the job I didn't even have a computer, I was shoved into a back room with no company, and told to pack a total of about 60 - 70 thousand leaflets into packs of anything between 10-1000 leaflets and send them off to locations around the country to promote the business. This took me a total of about 2 weeks of 8 hours a day work, and then a few hours here and there up until this week just gone. 

When I finally got a computer it was old, not up to spec and they expected me to run some fairly hefty software on it that it can just about manage if you're willing to put up with the go slow pace it loves so much. My boss pulls me into his office and tells me I need to get a laptop so I can work from home, I explain I already have a great desktop computer that I'd be more than happy to use, his response was 'no, it has to be a laptop'. I explain that I'm happy to use the PC I already have at home but if he's insistent on me getting a laptop it should be provided by the company and not out of my pocket. I caved in eventually and bought one out of my pocket.

Now that I have a laptop, he won't let me have the files and software i need to work from it because of 'security reasons'. Fair enough, but I'm a bit peeved I went out and bought a laptop for work, which he has now told me I can't use for the reason he told me to buy it for.

Ever since I finished the leaflets they've been ignoring me, not helping me with any of the stuff I'm meant to be learning, heck, it took me a month just to get the time out of them to inform me of the fire procedure and to be honest, I'm starting to feel like they just wanted someone who they could cheaply and legally employ to do these leaflets, now they're just looking to get rid of me.

I got an official warning on Friday for ""asking Jim (fake name, our web developer) for help too often and distracting him from his work. Fair enough, but I would argue that often it's the other way round, me and Jim spend a lot of time together outside of work and he let's our personal relationship carry over into work, something I like to avoid because I like to get my head down and work. But the thing is, I didn't get a tap on the shoulder and a ""Jim's doing something right now, try not to distract him"" it was just a ""Meeting room now, we want to talk to you"" followed by a ""Here's your first warning, you're still in your probation period, one more and you're gone"".

199,"Hello r/advice. I'm 15 years old and really need help right now. Here's what's happening: 

Back in March I started tenth grade. Everything was great, and I instantly got along with all teachers. All but one who didn't seem to like me for no reason at all. Just the typical teacher not liking a particular student, so I just decided to ignore her. However then trouble started. Our school has a rule stating we can use electronic devices for the class without asking for permission. However, as I knew the teacher didn't like me, I specifically asked for permission to use my device. She said yes, so I started using it when she suddenly takes it off my hands and tells me ""you do not have permission to do that"". I tell her she literally just told me I could use it and he ignored me and took my iPad with her.

Then I tried to be pacifist and not confront her, and try to get her to at least accept me. Nope! She kicks me out of the class for no reason! When I asked her why, she just shut the door on my face.

Shit continued being that way and I kinda hated her, but today something happenned that I just won't take. The teacher wasw checking the homework, and a lot of people had done it shorter than it had to be done. She was like ""okay, but make it complete the next time"". When she says my name, I show her my homework (which was of similar length to work she accepted from other people). She shouted at me in front of the whole class about how my work was wrong. The worst part is that she wasn't even checking the information on it, just how long it was.

I haven't been feeling well today but I was trying to keep positive until she came along. My mood instantly became bad and I was pretty angry. However, then this happened. She started giving the grades for a group project. A person from my group got a perfect grade and I had done roughly the same amount of work as her, so naturally I expected a decent grade at least. But no, I passed the assignment with minimum grade. 

And having to deal with other problems like insomnia is already hard, so the last thing I want is somebody making my life hell just because she feels like it. I'm going to try to talk to the principal but I seriously doubt it's gonna solve anything, so do you have any idea about what I could do?",29May2017,2

210,"We have communication issues. For me i've always been overly compliant with bosses, anything they force on me i've always taken and do it, i avoid trouble (like saying No even when i want to) out of fear of being denied things (like a day i really need off, etc...). 

My boss, being foreign, tends to get confused when we talk about my work schedule. Like before the semester started i told her i couldn't work certain days because of school but she thought i meant i could work those mornings (idk how). I'm worried she'll think i'm quitting when that's not what i meant. What i mean is that i need a constant weekly work schedule that doesn't interfere with my summer class and internship.

Furthermore my coworker is also in college and told me the days he needs off for summer school, he hasn't told our boss. She needs to work this out with both of us because he needs certain days off, i need to know what days i'd work to tell my new boss with my internship.

I've had boxes with locks on them, those get cut with bolt cutters. He takes clothing, anything he wants. If it's in the house, it's his. Just today my ammo box with a lock on it was pried open and my stuff gone and i'm really getting sick of it so i'm here. I know my mother and third brother have had the same issues. I've been looking for some sort of door lock so my whole room can be locked off, but i'm not really sure where to go or look.

212,"Hi,
I'll try to keep this short, I've been dating my current girlfriend for around 8 months who I met at university and everything is more or less great.

However before I went to uni, I was seeing another girl for a period of about a month, which coincidentally was the month before i started uni, we agreed to stay in contact and not see anyone else.

So a month later I move 250 miles away to university, and keep in contact with her but it slowly  fizzles out.

I've just moved back for summer, bumped into the girl and spoke to her properly for the first time since before I moved to uni, coming to the realisation that I loved her, more than I believe I could ever love my current gf.

I know it sounds cliche but she really is the one that got away, we're both on good terms but both in relationships right now.

Basically, what on Earth do i do? 
Im in my twenties so theres not a lot of factors involved like children or anything.

TLDR In love with someone who isnt my partner",29May2017,3
213,"Hi Reddit,

I graduated from a state school with a degree in industrial engineering, worked for a year in a field I thought I might enjoy (Healthcare). Unfortunately, over the last year I've grown increasingly unhappy. It was a gradual realization. I think I was in denial for a long time about it. So when I was offered the option to either change departments and work for someone who I didn't particularly admire as a supervisor, or leave, I chose to leave. Wednesday is my last day. I have a few job leads for things in my field, trouble is, I don't particularly want to stay in my field. I don't know if it's just laziness, or lack of stimulation or what, but it seems pretty mind numbing, getting in every day, waking up early, sitting at my computer, plugging through the usual work, responding to the usual emails. Over the winter I coped with exercise, I biked to and from work, ran during my lunch break, and swam after work. Eventually it got to the point where my legs were constantly sore and I hit a wall. I went from running 6 miles a day to getting tired walking up a flight of stairs. I've been recovering slowly over the last month. Not 100% sure what happened, but I think I just pushed myself too hard and it put me in a hole. The time off from exercise gave me a little time to meditate on what exactly led to that point, and I think part of it was just how I relieve the toxic combination of stress and lethargy that results from long hours in an office. So now I have some time off to recover mentally and physically, and the question is ""what next?"" I don't have any debt and I have a small puddle of money to keep me through the summer at least, but I'm at a loss for what my next step careerwise should be. I have a handful of interests, I've written short stories, and screenplays, and a webseries (working on producing with friends) I write music which I record and self release, I read, I love hiking and the outdoors. The problem is none of my interests lend themselves to much of an income. I have an engineering degree and I've built some marketable skills, but I really don't get any satisfaction from that, and it seems a shame to spend most of my waking hours with no clear goal, and no satisfaction. So the question is what's the next step?

A side story of some relevance: My father wanted to be writer after he graduated. He wrote for his college newspaper and I've read some of the articles: they were great! after graduating his father convinced him to take a more sensible job for the government. He had planned on working there for a year or two while he figured out his next step. But it was a comfortable job, and over time he moved up. a little over 40 years later he retired. He had planned on finally writing, and working on interesting projects. Unfortunately he was diagnosed with cancer and got very sick very quickly and a year later was gone. It wasn't that he made bad decisions, he provided an excellent life for my family, but I did sense a little regret. I have enormous love and admiration for my father, he was one of the most genuine, loving, witty, people I've ever known. But losing him was a huge reminder that life can be shorter than you expect, and if you want to do something, you don't have a lot of time to waste.",29May2017,1
220,"I'm a College student on summer break, I currently have an internship and a job, but I still have fear in the back of my head, tilling me that I'm not doing enough. It's making me exhausted and I don't know how to deal with myself. What do I do. ",29May2017,2
221,"I know I have trust issues, but this time, I will rely on you guys for this advise.

I work overseas and got this roommate. We partnered up as to share expenses. He cemented our partnership by having sex with me.

He isn't really single, he has a kid and they are still (sort of) together with the mother. I fell hard for the guy. But the guy clearly stated that the sex is just that, just one time.

Everytime I try to separate from him (he makes me shoulder 80% of the expenses), he tells me of his ""sacrifices"" for me (being teased at work, having that one time sex) being too heavy for his side, and now I will ignore it. He guilt-trips me whenever this comes to my mind. Then he will have sex just to make me forget it.

But that was months ago. Nowadays, he says that it's okay for me to go separate with him, for he is prepared.

I do like having sex with him, but he makes me financially and emotionally suffer. And now even that he won't give sex, for he said ""there are some things he can't give"" (as if he didn't give it to another person, he is fucking my other roommate now, and they lie about it too).

I wanted to change him, so that even though we are partners, we are equals, even without the sex. What should I do? Should I just take up his separation offer to simplify this? In doing so, this will make our work awkward. I know that he will never come back this time. Should I ask him to be equals? How can I talk about the sex part (we try to be discreet here, but some of my workmates seem to get some idea) as to tell him that either we have sex on a regular basis or we'll just forget it?

Just kindly tell me what to do. I scan handle myself if that need arrives and I became alone. I tried to tell him too many times and he just became adamant on separation if I can't provide for us. My heart tells me to bear it for he might change, but my mind says to give up. I know that I can never be together with him forever, and we will leave at some point. He will never love someone like me, for he is still in love and he clearly said before that he won't love me back.

Today, we even fought because I tried to tell him that I need to balance our expenses just to make us even. He was adamant on separating but when I said that ""you got what you wanted so now you discard me?"", he flipped. He told me again what he gave up, and when we are alone today, he told me that he might try finding a new fuck buddy that can give him money. I told him that if such a time comes, I will separate for good, whether he wants to or not. I told him I better distance myself, I am already harming myself, and that if he thinks that his penis has a value, than what about my body? He thought I was crimping his social life because he is being teased by our co-workers, which I sympathize, for they don't have the balls to say that in my face.

Tell me how should I do one of the following:

1. Separate cleanly with no hard feelings.
2. Continue with some conditions (tell me how can this be done)
3. Move on and forget that such a thing existed. (Now this is a hard thing)",29May2017,1
223,"So a few days ago my friend and I had a very intense conversation. During said conversation, they came out to me as gay. This person comes from a very conservative Presbyterian family, and they themselves are very religious. Their family and their church have a very negative attitude towards LGBT+ people, to say the least. Because of this, their mental state has deteriorated greatly and they feel an very intense self hatred because of their sexuality. This has resulted in depression and possible self-harm. Me and others who know if this believe that therapy would help them immensely. However, they are a minor and cannot legally seek therapy from a licensed therapist without coming out to their parents, who would most likely disown them or send them to a conversion camp.

229,"I know the title seems a little pathetic, but I assure you there is more to it than that. I currently share a room in my parent's house with my wife and our 2 beautiful kids. It's pretty tough, and I'll explain a little more, but I need to know what the hell I should do to get out of our situation. 

Without telling my life story, essentially we into my mom's house when my wife became pregnant with our second child because we had been living in a small apartment and needed to save for a house. Financially, things have always been a little rough for us, too, so it's not like we had savings account to rely on. Unfortunately, shortly after we moved in, I lost my job. My wife was already working part-time and going to school, all while carrying around a baby in her belly. I picked up 2 part-time jobs to make ends meet, but I had to quit to stay home with the baby. My wife decided to put school on hold because she was offered a salary manager position at her job, which was a blessing for us.

So here we are, 4 people in 1 bedroom, living off of 1 income. I start a overnight position soon, but it doesn't pay much. I don't really have any options though, because I don't know any free babysitters, and daycare is too damn expensive. 

What should we do as a family, other than  continue to work and save? Any advice for us? It feels like we'll never get out of here, and all I want is to provide decent housing for my family. ",29May2017,3
230,"A little backstory. My older sister and I grew up together and were very close. However, we disconnected from each other because of a small issue that escalated quickly when she started mentioning things from the past. She basically called me a bitch and told me to move out of her apartment that I was staying at temporarily before I started college. Stubborn at the time, I packed up everything even though 17 year-old me basically had no idea where I would go. All my friends were on summer vacation. I couldn't book a hotel room. Since then, we hadn't contacted each other. One, because of this. Two because she took $4k from me and never gave it back to me (college tuition fund). Three because I felt too exhausted by maintaining a seemingly toxic relationship. 

An hour ago, she just sent me a message request saying she wants to get a part-time job to pay for her medical bills. She said because she already has a full-time job she can't use her own SSN because the company she works for doesn't allow it. The message roughly translates to, ""I want to find a part-time job to pay for my medical bills. But I'm working full-time right now for my company and it doesn't allow me to use my SSN to file tax return. Can I use your SSN to file for tax return? That way you can use the money"". 

Therefore, she's requesting for mine to use, and in return I get the tax return. Should I give it to her? I've looked at some things that might happen from giving out your SSN and I don't know honestly if I can trust her. I really do want to help her and I know she has had medical problems. Any advice?

I've noticed he gets a lot more agitated more easily, constantly complaining about fixing things and generally not enjoying most of his day, I get the feeling.

I just don't really know what advice to give him. It's like fixing is the only thing he does now but he's not enjoying doing it. I get this feeling he's just doing it because he has nothing else to do.

The bus was pretty crammed and there was this guy sitting across from me. He was about my size, but seemed agitated. He spat behind his bench and kept clenching and unclenching his fists. 

At some point I dozed off in my seat and woke up and found him staring at me. He held the stare (it was a dirty stare) for a few seconds then scowled and looked away. I chose to ignore this.

10 minutes later, he does it again, and this times jerks his head when I stare back. I jerk my head back, and he leans in and asks me if I feel like losing my teeth today. 

At that point I just get up and move towards the back of the bus. So if we are talking about staying safe, I stayed safe.

244,"There is this guy—a guy i met about 6 months ago through school clubs. We are both in school. We started talking. At first it was just about school &amp; stuff. We had a good conversation going on. Then he started flirting with me, saying i looked nice &amp; stuff &amp; also sent shirtless shoulder pics. Eventually he started making sexual advances &amp; i actually felt like an attractive person for once (since boys don’t rlly talk 2 me). At first i was like no but then we started exchanging pics of each other through snapchat. I had told him i liked him (ik bad move) but it was fine. he basically was like i don’t want a relationship blah blah but he also would consider dating me if he got to know me better. this was kinda mean but when i asked him if he had any interest in me (ik! shouldn’t have done that!!) &amp; he said “none”. Of course i felt like shit. But i shifted my focus. I decided that i would maybe explore the sexier aspect of life since i am physically attracted to him(no i want going to lose my vigrinity with him— I’m talking about making out and maybe a little bit more). We talked 2 each other like every single day. Sometimes we would open each others snaps &amp; not respond, but eventually it was b fine.
Anyway @ 1 pt, he offered 2 b my boyfriend but then the next day he changed his mind &amp; then we didn’t talk for a few days. Like 6 days after, he started saying hi to me and stuff. I ignored him the 1st few times on purpose just to make him sweat and then he asked if i was just going to continue to ignore him. Anyway so we’ve kinda become good friends, got a funny dialogue going on, even though most of it was based on sex. He would still ask me about some of our teachers and how my day was. He also asked about my friend drama. I felt good when i snapped him. It was exciting to talk to him and actually talk to a guy. When i saw his texts or snapchat username, i got so excited. Ive been told by my friends to get over him before, such as during the time when he said he had no interest. This past week a lot happened. He sent full-on dick pics, which he hasn’t before. He had asked me to hook up before &amp; i recently agreed. We tried making plans but our schedules didn’t match up (it was the last week in school for him but graduation is later). i guess i was more into hooking up than he was at this point. he told me that he asked another girl for pics since i didn’t send enough (i was kind of hesitant about sending pics to him bc i found out that he used to ask a lot of girls—but not anymore). I let him know that i had recently gained another “outlet” or guy that I’m talking with about hooking up and stuff (which is true but thats another story). He wanted to know who it was but i didn’t tell him. he asked for pics on saturday &amp; i sent them. then on sunday, he just decided he doesn’t want to hook up anymore or exchange pics. I ask why of course, he says that he has had an “epiphany” and wants to “become a better person” and that he wants to share that kind of stuff with someone special, which is not me, I’m just a friend. He says to save myself for someone who is into me and that I’m attractive &amp; i will find someone blah blah. I tell him that i feel used. He says he feels used too. I ask why. He says because he sent dick pics but I didn’t send nudes. I say i feel used because he knew i liked him &amp; kinda used that to pressure me into sending pics. He says “u like me?”. it felt really bad last nite. I’ve tried to get over him in the past but it hasn’t really worked. Ik i should get over him and move on. But idk how to go about doing that! This is the first guy Ive really liked in a while.
I guess i just need to vent &amp; have someone to talk to. I feel used &amp; like i wasted so much time. like all those sexy pics, putting on my makeup after i already took it all off just 2 snap him, checking my phone a million times, picking a certain outfit--all 4 nothing. I knew i wasn’t going to get a relationship out of it, but i thought i would at least be able to remember him with a few hookups. I know i shouldn’t have expected anything from him. I knew he didn’t/wasn’t gonna like me back but i thought we would still hook up. but this all-of-a-sudden change is just so confusing &amp; i hate not understanding things. He is so confusing—there are so many mixed signals. Every time he implies that he won’t snapchat me anymore he sends a “hi” “wats up”. He offered to be my boyfriend but then for the next week he didn’t speak a word to me/ignored me. He says i look nice all the time. even as I’m writing this &amp; sort of heading towards a more permanent change, he could change his mind at any minute. I know i shouldn’t go back if he wants to go back to want we used to be but honestly i don’t know if i could resist. 
i feel that this time around its especially hard. He is being not a mean person right now, unlike last time when the i have zero interest came off very harsh. I feel like if he is mean it would be easier to get over him because i would be mad at him. also fir day was his last day at school, so i will probably never see him again unless we decide to meet up. 
I don’t know what to do. I feel like my life is all over the place. I have OCD so that is so not helping the situation right now—i can’t stop thinking about him. he still wants to be friends, but like were we ever really friends since we mainly talk about sex? We’ve never hung out before, not really anyway. one friend suggested that i like make a play for him. my other friend says get over him (but with no explanation how). I just feel very down, this among other things in my life are not going too great. Thank you for listening. I feel a lot better and that I’m already starting to get over him (this process has already been initiated several times lol). Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",29May2017,2
