I only brought along family I knew I could trust with a secret because I don’t want any details of what it looks like getting to him! 

His mother is insisting on knowing what the dress looks like and wants pictures (I didn’t take any) and I know I can’t trust her with a secret. I want this to be a surprise and be special for everyone when they see it and I know she would blab about it with others (possibly even my fiancé). She broke my trust really badly when she told other family members about a condition I have that my fiancé and I wanted to keep with just immediate family and it really hurt. How can I tell her no without sounding like a total bitch? I don’t want to be a bridezilla but I’m just not comfortable with her knowing. Am I over reacting?? ",04Oct2017,3
1,"so basically this girl i met online lives thousands of miles away from me, and we both love each other a lot, i tried asking her to date me, but she said she'd rather be friends because the distance is too hard, but she said she still loved me a lot. So thats when i started getting emotionally pained. She used to always text me first and ask to facetime and whatnot, but now (about a week later) if i dont text her first she wont text me, and if i dont ask to facetime she wont ask, and she never really talks to me like she used to, it just really hurts me because i think shes just starting to not like me anymore. Its come to the point where i can go over 25 hours without eating or feeling remotely hungry because of how bad and depressed it makes me feel. i have problems with overthinking and jealousy so im not sure if im just overthinking all of this, i sit in bed for hours crying by myself becuase i have no one to help me get through this, so im coming here for advice on how to get over the fact that this girl doesn't like me anymore, and how to stop myself from being jealous and overthinking all the time. This is really ruining my life because i cant focus on school or family or anything important in life.",04Oct2017,7

3,"Hello everybody!


As the title of the post suggests, I am unsure about committing to varsity basketball this year. As much as I am asking for advice, I am also doing this to get all of my thoughts down on text to help myself sort through everything; a therapy of sorts. So onto my lack of a clear path:


To begin, school is first for me. I am enrolled at my local university as well as my high school. I do not do much in terms of extracurriculars, my day mostly consists of school/evening college classes and homework. The rest of the day I find quickly diminishing with no clear goal in mind. I might play a little piano or whatever but the rest of the day is just plain boring. In terms of sports, I have not played organized in years and am therefore anxious about being on a team again. The team practices Mon-Tues-Thurs-Fri with games Tues-Fri when the season gets going. Part of this also means I cannot take the college classes I wish to take next semester due to scheduling conflicts.


The ""pros"" I see to playing is I will get out of the house often and will be part of a team. I am pretty good at basketball as well. Basketball will hopefully get rid of my persistent demons, this narrative I tell myself that I'm just this school only-nerdy loser. I loathe when I meet new people, thereupon they ask what sports I play, and I have nothing to reply. The ""cons"", on the other hand, are that I am usually too hard on myself and I am wary that the season will turn into a miserable 4 months for myself. In addition, our school isn't very good and thus doubtful we will win a mere single game over the season. The games are far away and just practice is on the other side of town. As I said before, the schedule interferes with classes I wish to take. I am anxious making this large of a time commitment in case I end up hating the season midway through.


Thank you for everyone here who makes an effort to help other people.

5,"I don't understand what has happened to me. I'm not sure how to describe it, like i want to talk to someone, but for some reason i can't just start a conversation. Like my confidence in talking is there when i talk to someone, but i can't ever seem to get myself to talk to someone.

Sometimes i'm interrupted or maybe didn't project as well as i thought i was going to (happens, and it's awkward), like even after i go up to someone. Other times i might be interrupted by someone else or something.

What really kills my confidence is seeing other people already knowing other people. Like i'm trying to meet new people, i know there are TONS or new people, yet everyone seems to already have a buddy in a class and aren't interested in making new friends.

I'm not a repulsive person, people tend to like me, but it just seems like a 1 semester thing for the most part as i've experienced. I'm also not the most interesting, and lately not the most talkative (lately i've been running out of things to talk about with someone i meet)",04Oct2017,3

11,"Hey Reddit!

I'm still pretty new here but I see people reach out to the community for help with all kinds of things every day so I figured I'd try my hand.

Due to a lack of good judgement I find myself serving probation for a DWI in Dallas, TX.  Fortunately, as it's my first offense and I had a pretty good lawyer, I only got 9 months probation.  Unfortunately, my main source of income is no longer an option as I was a bartender.  Now I know many people will argue that tons of people in this industry have DWIs and continue to work.  That's true and it frustrates me to no end but the reality is that was my mandate from the judge and I have to adhere so, moving on.

I need ideas and/or suggestions from people who have found themselves in a similar situation on how to find part/full time work that doesn't require the handling or serving of alcohol.  

My credentials are all over the place and the internet is daunting when just searching on your own.  I'm not degreed, I love working with people, I hate selling things (although I know loving my job is not necessarily a priority at the moment), I have management experience, wonderful interpersonal and communication skills, and I've worked with a digital marketing startup for 6mo with no previous experience so moving into that world at a high enough paying position really doesn't seem to be an option at the moment.  

I need to make $15-$18/hr or the salary equivalent at the very least to maintain my bills and expenses.

- parietal lobe
- occipital lobe
- frontal lobe
- temporal lobe
- cerebellum 
- medulla
- pons
- thalamus
- corpus callosum
- hippocampus
- hypothalamus
- pituitary
- amygdala

I get reasonably decent grades (highest GPA was a 3.6 junior year), but I will admit, I have a slightly harder time focusing and learning new things. In Elementary school, I was considered a bright kid but once middle school hit I fell into a mild depression and have stayed that way ever since. I have a good amount friends and I'm quite popular at school. Problem is, I'm basically the dumb one of our friend group. My friends always joke around with me as the one that never knows what's going on, says really stupid things, always clumsy, etc. Another example would be my baseball coaches. Ive been an excellent baseball player since I was young, but was told by one of my teammates that my high school coach and assistant coaches made some comments about how ""talented, but dumb and uncoordinated"" I am. That one really hurt. I've thought long and hard about how I can change myself, but I don't know what to do. I believe a lot of this stems from my depression making me lose focus and be forgetful. I've just never been able to shake the image from friends, coaches, parents, pretty much anyone I meet, that I'm always the slow one that can't comprehend things as easy.

While I was not chosen for the role, the CEO was impressed enough by my scores to want to invite me in for a meeting. They informed me that I tested at a very high IQ (132) and had a the DiSC profile of someone in an upper leadership position, which had convinced them that this position would be a poor fit for me as I would likely quickly outgrow it.


The thrust of our meeting seemed to be that they wanted to urge me to further my education and figure out how to best utilize my intelligence. While I'd known I was ahead of most of my peers in school, I'd never looked into furthering my education since my family wasn't in a position to offer much support and I was apprehensive about putting myself into debt for something I might end up changing my mind about. Now I've just spent the 5 years since graduating High School working in Food Service jobs that I feel bored and stagnant in.


I am hoping that someone will be able to point me toward the resources/tests I need to (1) better understand the typing of my intelligence, (2) the career options that would best utilize my mind, and (3) the process of finding the right school and the funding necessary to become a student and still survive.

Ten months passed and I'm not happy with the project. I feel really dismotivated, I found out for the second time that I'm not working in something I love. Also, I think the team has no sinergy even though everyone get along really well.

Today I told the team I was leaving the project, even though I ofered them to work for free for the next two months (the project haven't started to given money). Friend A is really upset with me, since I'm again a really fundamental part of the team and replace me will be a really hard task(near impossible), because I'm well qualified for the job and they don't have the money to pay someone to do it.
They invested Ten months of their life and some money on this project(about 1k dollars each). With my leaving they face the risk to be obrigated to end the project.

I'm really upset with the situation. Friend A told me that I had a personal issue of giving up on things to easy since I don't have obrigations in life. This is true, since I pay my bills with money of the rent of houses my father left me after he passed away.

I'm really upset about this situation. I think that two things lead to those things happening:
1 - I shouldn't have accepted to join the project since I was really in doubt if the idea was something that I liked to do.
2 - My lack of commitment with my word.

Anyway, I guess there's no way to gain the trust of friend A ever again and this make me really sad, event though that is a consequence of my acations and I'm aware that I'lll have to live and deal with it.

I would like to hear yout honest thoughts on the matter. 

Should I keep with my decision in leaving the project to seek something I enjoy doing? Or Should I try to stay with my friends on the project so they have a chance on making it work(even thouhg i'll not be happy)? 

What can I do to avoid this situation ever again? What if I make another ""wrong"" choice and start some project with some other persons and I fail him? This makes me really insecure. How can I work on this personal issue?",04Oct2017,1

I'm all for older people coming back to school but I think he's desperately trying to fit in with the younger students and that includes making awkward sexual remarks towards me and another female classmate.

We had a study group a few weeks ago and HE BROUGHT BULLETS. I live in Texas and we have an open carry policy implemented since last year so it's probably not illegal to bring them on campus but the fact that he brought them to a Japanese study group seems inappropriate. 

Fast forward a few weeks and he's spamming our class group chat with flirty remarks toward a guy in our class and the moderator reiterates to keep the chat class-related but Saturday he kept spamming the group chat with inappropriate comments so I block him.

He didn't show up to the test on Monday

I know he has a gun. And he might target me for blocking him. I've been joking about how he might shoot me with my roommates but I'm actually quite scared. The guy seems unhinged and socially inept. I know I'm overreacting but school shootings seem to happen more and more these days.

52,"I guess it's kind of harsh to say she stole from me, although that's technically what she did...

Here's the backstory: When my father died (last year), the place where he used to work gave me and my sisters some money to ""help us"". They gave me around $2144 USD, but at the time I didn't have a debit card and my mother thought it'd be safer to let my sister guard the money, as I was living with her at the time.

I, however, decided to move out because of two reasons: my sister was abusive, things would be fine with her as long as I pleased her, but when I did something she didn't like, she'd make my life living hell; this had to happen three times before I decided I had enough. Needless to say, she got mad at me and she still doesn't talk to me.

So fast-forward a couple of months, I'm now in college and in an environment I'm comfortable in, my sister had told my mother that she'd give me the money (that's rightfully mine) once I had a debit card, so I got one at the start of last semester. I knew she wouldn't really give the money, so I'm not surprised at all that she still refuses to give it back.

Keep in mind, when I moved out she literally shoved my baggage out of her house and closed the door, I had no chance to go back in and take my money.

It's not like I'm angry because of the money issue, but my mother's having some financial troubles right now and I feel like having the $2144 would help for a while, as I wouldn't have to ask her for money to help me pay for my stuff.

However, I don't like confrontations, so I'm still undecided on whether or not I should try to get the money back, or just suck it up and try to make do with what I have.",04Oct2017,1

66,"I've made a post before but I'd like as many opinions I can get! 

I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right section, I apologize if not. I posted in one but I think it was the wrong section lol I'm new here! Anyways, my boyfriend seems to think my orthopedic surgeon has a crush on me. I was born with a wrist deformity, it's not bad. It's not very noticeable. I'd mention what it's called but I really don't wanna give too much info out. Anyway, onto my situation....

I first had surgery to correct my deformity in October 2015. After my surgery I got my hair cut, my surgeon noticed I cut it and dyed it. I hadn't seen him for a couple months then. He said it looked good. I told him I'm surprised he noticed and the nurse chimes in saying he's very observant. I shurged it off. I still shrug this off. It's just my hair. Lol I cut it because my arm was in a cast.

The next time I was there I literally got a text from a friend saying they were moving out of state. I got was, and he gave me a hug for it.

I had to have multiple visits because of a pin my wrist.

I'm not really sure what visit this was, but I remember I arrived and the nurse told me ""I let Dr ********* know you were here, he turns around and says my girl? My my name, he's happy you're here!"" I didn't say anything except awe.

I had surgery next to fix my other wrist. After surgery I asked the nurse if that was it and if I was ready to go home. She told me to hold on so she could ask the doctor. She comes back saying he's in surgery so my father and I wouldn't be able to speak to him. No big deal. As I'm getting wheeled out I see him walking out to meet with my dad and I. He WALKED OUT of surgery to talk to my dad and I. He just sat there talking casually. Then gave instructions on how to care for my arm.

At one of my visits for post op I was last. He came in saying ""you're last but not least, never least!""

At another appointment he had medical students with him. I went there because it was a one year follow up on one wrist. I was given a steriod injection due to still being in pain. He kept constant eye contact and his medical students have me a weird look like something was going on between him and I. It seemed like he held my hand as long as he could without seeming weird. Anyways, I showed him pictured of my hummingbird feeding out my hand because I like to share that with everyone! The nurse loved the pics too!!! He then pulls out his pho me and shows me a picture of his daughter with boogers hanging out. I found it funny to be honest, and told him it was cute. Hahah I really didn't expect that! Then at the end of my appointment I was heading out and asked which way I needed to go to get out (It's like a maze in there!! Lol) and he was ""let me show you out!"" We walk and talk, small talk no biggie. He then goes in and gives me a hug put of no where! I give one back because I always hug back. 

He's sent me the plates I had removed from my wrist in the mail, is that even allowed? 

Anyways, that's just some. There is more but it's too much to type. My boyfriend seems to think my surgeon wants me. I have no idea what to make of it. But I trust him, and he IS an excellent doctor. I'm not asking for rude remarks, I'm NOT gonna switch doctors. Just want some input on your thoughts. Something to ease boyfriend's mind, I personally think it's just good bedside manner. Excuse any typos. I don't see why my boyfriend cares so much after cheating on me several times lol Thank you!!

68,"**TL;DR - Moved to Cali, savings screwed up by previous roommate and job offer falling through, finances tough, girlfriend blames me, wat do?**

So short synopsis, I was living in the Midwest making like 40k a year, which isn't great but wasn't uncomfortable. I was able to save a bit, paid all my bills, had a decent place with a roommate. I had poor credit from some mistakes I made when I was 18, but had been slowly repairing it with pay offs and co-signed loans, but on Christmas 2 years ago I hit a deer driving home and totaled my car. Insurance gave me some cash for it, so I started shopping around and found a nice 2013 Honda Civic, let the guy run my credit just so he'd let me go test drive it since I figured I'd get denied. To my surprise, Ally agreed to finance it for me so I set off with my new Civic and a $330 dollar car payment, which sucked but wasn't a big deal since I was making 3+ grand a month, but the down payment drained my savings. 

Anyway bout a year later, still working the same place, comfortable, I meet a gal online. Now, I've been plotting an escape from the midwest to somewhere more coastal for a couple years at this point, although I had been planning to go East where the water is warm and the prices are cheaper. And blue crabs, yummmm... anyway. I won a little vacation to NYC from my job coz I was good at it, and invited Miss Online to come along if she bought her own plane ticket; we met up and explored NYC and enjoyed eachother's company. Couple months later I buy a plane ticket to California to visit her, had a great time. I loved LA so when she invited me to move there to be with her I said ""Hell you only live once"" and off I went. 

Here's where things start getting fucky... My roommate at the time decided instead of giving me my last month free as she had initially offered was going to charge me full rent for a partial month. She decided this the day I was leaving, so I didn't get much chance to protest or save additional money, so my savings took a huge hit. Coupled with the gas prices and hotel costs, my savings took several more dips as we got across the US, and the day before we arrived the job I had lined up in LA decided to call me and tell me they weren't going to hire me after all. FUN!

Well, too late to turn back now, so I kept going, got into town and settled in at her place. Immediately started looking for work, had a few promising leads but some of them turned out to be scams, others just hired someone else. I hadn't realized how competitive the job scene out here is. I spent about 3 months unemployed (with her helping me out with my share of the bills since my savings were depleted by this point, to which she assured me was ""not a problem at all"" and ""don't worry about it we're in this together,"" etc. 

Anyway, finally got a dead end job making minimum wage ($12/hr here) and I've been doing it about 5 months while searching for other jobs. Setting up interviews is a bitch because I get my schedule each Friday for that following week, so I never know in advance when I'll be free. I'm giving her quite literally 75% of my checks, only saving enough to pay my car payment and get gas to go to work. I eat one meal a day, usually for free due to work, and I almost never have money to spend on myself. My only real expenses are my car and e-cig juice, which I buy in bulk to save money. 


Wow, you've read this far? Thanks, stranger. So now she's getting pissy because her family wanted to go on a cruise, and she can't afford to go anymore because she helped me out when i was hurting. She's taking it all out on me, and while I certainly wish I could pay more, I simply don't make enough money to do so. This dead-end job pays minimum wage and offers no benefits beyond legally required ones, and I'm certainly looking for others, but I don't know what to do here. I'm thinking she's going to break up with me soon, and if that's what she wants then fine, I'll swallow that loss later. Right now I'm looking for my well-being. I could: 

* Go back to the Midwest and hopefully crash with a friend, *maybe* get my old job back.

* Try and find a friend to stay with here, keep my current job until I find a better one, and try to get my own place in the LA area

* ???

On the other hand, if she doesn't want to split, how the fuck do I get out of this rut? I have 12 years of customer service experience, about 1/3 of that is in hospitality, and 0% of it is what I *want* to do.

I am at least moderately attractive and very charimatic and good natured.  I also am very outgoing and tend to joke a lot and make friends quickly.

83,"Posted this on r/LegalAdvice but not sure if that was the right sub. 

I recently found a room for rent in a 2-bedroom apartment being advertised on Craigslist. The poster was an occupant of one of the rooms, and had lived in the unit for 3-4 years. Of course, all bills and the lease were in her name and she wanted to charge a monthly rent of $1500 for the room (which was perfectly reasonable to me) and a flat utility fee of $120 which covered trash, gas, electricity and internet. This is where the trouble started.

I was perfectly happy to pay the $120 given that the roommate would be willing to provide me with any bills if and when I asked to see them. I mainly wanted to make sure I wasn't grossly overpaying my share of the bills and the cost did come up to $240 each month, give or take ~$30. When I asked her to add an addendum to the lease stating this provision she stated that: 1) she didn't understand why I would ask to see her bills, 2) I should just trust her word since she wouldn't scam me (I've known her for 26 hours at this point), 3) she pays the brunt of the utilities and $120 is on the lower end of what the monthly bills are, 4) these were her bills and I had no right to see them since they had her private information on it, 5) she's subleased the room before and no one has ever asked that 6)it was highly inconvenient for her to get them to show me. Long story short, we argued for about 20 minutes before we decided this arrangement was not going to work.

Was I completely out of line to ask to see utility bills for an apartment we'd both be sharing? Should I try to lease the room after all? She seemed completely flabbergasted that I would even ask and I don't understand why. As a note, she doesn't own the apartment and would be a renter just like me.

I was at home at the time of the shooting. I was nowhere near the concert. When hearing about the shooting, I stayed home.

I didn't donate blood the following day. I didn't donate money or physical items. I've literally done nothing about it except check in on friends to see if they were alright.

My Facebook feed has been filled with posts of heroes who saved lives. Now I just feel so guilty for staying home and not having helped at all. I used to think really highly of myself but now I feel like I'm a complete loser compared to everyone else who actually did something... Anything.

99,"So I don't feel stressed from the environment around me, even though i probably should. I graduated high school a whole year early and I'm a 17 year old boy working full time while taking online college classes full time as well. I also have a passion for YouTube and livestreaming on Twitch. I make sure to post daily videos and everything, but recently I've taken a break and my stressing doesn't stop. I overthink STUPID things. Earlier today, I was stressing about how I should title my videos (all day, from the time I woke up until now and I still don't know how I should title my videos). I feel like I have OCD, but I've never been diagnosed. Before I used to document EVERYTHING I did, like bad. For example, 10:31am-12:07pm Watched TV, 12:08-2:34pm had lunch, etc. I stopped that, but my little OCD things don't go away.


I keep track of ALL my YouTube videos in an excel document and it's really organized which there's nothing wrong with that, but it causes me to stress. I tried to not fill it out and leave it alone, but it worsens. Little decisions like how am I going to title my videos, should be decided in like 5 minutes tops, not 15 hours. I also have a hard time sticking to a schedule. I make a schedule and then I get overwhelmed or something, I really don't know, and I erase it and make a new one. I've tried simple to-do lists, longer lists, time based schedules, tiered lists, etc. I just can't seem to stop overthinking little things and actually move on. The only things I do get done, are college assignments (which are really the only important ones, but still). I hate not being able to post a video, because i literally can't decide how to title my video, or put it in a playlist or something even more stupid. It's to the point where I have headaches all the time, because I'm overthinking things and then I can't stop thinking about them. I try to go to the gym and relax, and it works, but as soon as I leave. I'm back to where I started, stressed as ever and overthinking everything. There was a point where I was overthinking my workout schedule. It took me a solid weekend off of work to make a 5 day plan that should be made in maybe 30 minutes.

Me, I'm actually a war refugee that came here in 1996 after the Yugoslavian war. We were given 3 months worth of free apartment rent and were basically told ""good luck"" afterwards. Me, growing up, I remember being the happiest of the happiest kids possible. I literally twirled around in wild flower bushes catching butterflies. Gay, I know. After arriving here in the US in 1996 I was the complete opposite. I hurt everyone and it brought me great joy like never before. I didn't care if you were my foe or friend or whatthefever, I was GOING to have my way with you and so I did. For many years. In fact, I was a heartless monster all the way from 2nd grade (1996) to freshman year of high school (do the math) A lot of you will hate me for this, but please give me a chance to explain, as this was my first turning point. One day after school, I was trying to take a nap and my neighbors dog would just not shut up. What did logical 16 year old me do? Took a katana and butchered it right there in the yard and went back to my nap. When I woke up, holy fuck! TALK ABOUT REGRET! It eventually got so bad I didn't want to talk to anyone, I stopped going to school, I developed depression because of it and thank God I did because I fucking deserved it. Eventually, I did finish HS with a 3.0 GPA and went on to college. What do ya know? The one teacher that I told what I did was there teaching English 101 and it broke me down again but this time I am only now coming out of it. You see, all those years back, seeing my old teacher and whatnot, somewhere on that path I developed a hug drug addiction to heroin. I've been in detox 3 times and in rehab twice. Just actually got out of my 3rd detox yesterday. I'll end it here so it's not too long and there's obviously huge parts left out - but I will promise you this. The ONLY thing that has kept me going is basically Dragon Ball Z or Goku more specifically. When the kid me heard him say (don't quote me on this it's been decades) ""If there's a will, there's a way"" it stuck with me in everything that I do on top of ""You don't lose when you fall, you lose when you quit."" These two sentences have been my lifeforce and if anyone would like to hear more, please free to ask me anything.

105,"Hey fellow Redditors, 
     
&amp;nbsp;

I am currently building a Business in Webdesign. I started this with a Colleague of mine (he is also a good friend).

We planned this for some time but now we got finally started and got our first couple of customers.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is, that my colleague is not very good in Sales and I have to do every acquisition of potential customers myself (I usually do Cold-Calling or Cold-Emails).

To set us up, I basically did everything for us. This means, that I registered the Domain, created our Company-Website and so forth. What he did so far, is registering our Company in a trade register and some paperwork.

&amp;nbsp;

Our first two paying customers are lawyers (I acquired both by phone). I also created the complete websites for them and met with them in person, discussing all the details. **He did absolutely nothing for those two**.

Now is the time, where those two customers will pay us money. Because we are a company, we have a company bank account, where the lawyers will send their money to and my business-partner and me have access to that account.

&amp;nbsp;

**Now my question is:**

&amp;nbsp;

* Am I supposed to split the money with my Business-Partner, even if he did absolutely nothing for those customers ? 

&amp;nbsp;

I did everything, from acquisition to the Website- &amp; all the Design work.

I don't know why but it fails really unfair to me, if I have to split that money, when he does nothing.

We got two other customers now (which I acquired of course) - where he helped me with the Website Design.

Would it be a bad move by me, if I would tell him, that we should only split the money, if we also split the work ?

&amp;nbsp;

Please give me some advice - I kinda feel like an asshole for not wanting to split but I really don't know, what is right or what is wrong. 

In my opinion, it would be fair, if we only split, if he actually did something for the customer...",04Oct2017,3

112,"Hi all, my first post here.

This is probably an overused topic, or might seem unnecessary to even post about. Nevertheless...
Yesterday night I broke up with my girlfriend of 5.5 months, and I feel pretty fucked up in the head. 

She was great. She always cared for me, we had the same humor and she obviously loved me a bit more than I her. A months time now I have been contemplating breakup. Trying to weigh pros/cons etc. and I ended up leaning more toward the fact that I didn't feel ""it"". She didn't excite me the same way. I obviously enjoyed her company most of the time, but mostly as a very good friend. We've never really argued either, so that made last night's talk particularly emotional. I had no particular reason for breaking up, the same love she felt for me was just not there for her, and she didn't deserve that.

She is devastated. I am desvastated. Shouldn't I feel kinda liberated? After all, I initiated this. I've started finding some interest in other girls as well. I'm worried I've made a mistake, with the cliché words looming in the back of my head ""you're never gonna find anyone as good as her"". Should I just let time do its thing and surround myself with other people/friends? keep myself occupied? 
Me and my now ex have agreed to keep being friends, but I'm unsure how that will work out seeing the intimacy part is kinda... gone now.

A part of me even wants to try to get her back, but I've heard that's a bad idea. Advice, please? What the hell do I do?

EDIT: This post might make it seem like the love was always one-sided and I didn't appreciate her enough. I can assure you I did the latter, not out of spite but out of love, and I *showed* it as much as she did.",04Oct2017,1

I'm a teen and I have a problem and I don't know how to deal with it and I also did smth stupid on top of it so yeah..it's just I have been best friends with a girl from the same fandom for some years now ,we have never met but we are really close we talk everyday and we send gifts at each other and everything..but she has been going through some tough things lately and she finally kind of trusted me enough to tell me she has an Instagram account where sje posts depressing stuff and it's kind of like her journal..well I also have an account like this,it's mostly about eating disorders though but I didn't tell her anything about it not because I don't trust her but because I don't want to worry her more..anyways my actual problem is : I can't see her insta story on that account from my original one so yesterday I decided to follow her from my other account (the one about eds etc) and when I saw her story I was just speechless..I was already worried but I saw that she self harms and everything and I was just so shocked I texted her right away but I couldn't get myself to tell her it was actually me because I also knew she wouldn't open up to me..so I did the stupidest thing and told her I was someone else and then she opened up to me telling me that she has some problems with a friend (something she had told me before but not really what happened because she probably doesn't trust me enough anymore...)

I just don't know what to do because if she's dealing with eating disorders too I really don't know how to help her I can't even help myself with this and I just feel like it's my fault that she is dealing with her problems like this now because she knows I used to self harm and now that I'm throwing up sometimes and I don't know I feel so responsible like it's all my fault and I don't know what to do now..I also texted her sister telling her to keep an eye on her but that's just all I could think of..

132,"Okay, so there is good reason why this is complicated, so i'm going to explain myself. The obvious answer is to live off campus because who doesn't want to live off campus, but his is why the decision is hard. (I'm a sophomore)

So right now I live in one of the best, if not the best dorm on campus. It's a 5 minute walk from each class, right in the center of campus, and my roommate is so nice. Not to mention I have a job there as well. I met her online so I didn't have to go in blind and it just so happens she's from the town next to mine. She usually will invite me to things, iv'e met some of her friends and really like the. But she works, is in a business frat, and has her own group of friends from last year, so she is busy a LOT of the time. 

My friends from last year have offered be a sub-lease for second semester. It's 5 of them in a house total. I love Allison and Zack, they were both really good friends of mine from last year. I don't know the third roommate well, but based off first impressions she seems totally chill. Hayli isn't my favorite person, she is also a friend from last year and her along with megan had some issues with me last year...they had felt that I was mooching alcohol off of them, which wasn't true, and we resolved the issue but afterwords I just felt uncomfortable around these two for the rest of myself, just because they had said things that were untrue to our other friends in the group, and I felt as if they felt weird about my being around after that. Since we've gotten back this year, megan, who everyone in the group sorta looks up to for some reason, she has some sort of queen bee aura and I believe thats probably why we never ended up staying good friends...has been very nice to me, nicer than last year, and has not made me feel weird at all about being around. I'm taking Haylis lease, so I don't have to worry about her really.

the reason this is difficult is because the house is farther away from campus, about a 20 minute walk, and I would be moving in with at least one person that I have had some issues with in the past. I would be leaving my roommate behind which makes me sad because she's been nothing but nice to me so far this semester. it would also be cheaper, and I would finally be out of the dorms. It's also appealing because I feel out of the loop with these friends, I don't have a bunch of friends, so I miss out on going out to parties and stuff because i'm no longer in the loop....a large reason I say this option seems appealing is the social aspect. But I spend a lot of time at my boyfriends apartment anyway, plus he isn't keen on me living with people who were kinda shitty to me last year. 

So I guess the main reason I want to move is to have the OPTION to go out and have fun with my friends from last year, which I dont have now because its difficult to plan things and be in the loop with people you don't see every day. BUT then I would sacrifice my relationship with my new roommate who has introduced me to some new people and always includes me. I just want OPTIONs, I hate feeling lonely and out of the loop and I hate sitting around all weekend with nothing really to do, but is that a good enough reason to risk something that I know works and someone that I KNOW is going to always be nice to me?? I don't know what to do.
I just dont want to never see/ talk to my roommate anymore because I turn to my old friends. I also don't want to go through the pain of moving just to feel uncomfortable in my new home. 

TL;DR Do I stay in the dorms with my roommate that is nice but always busy, or do I move into a house with some old friends who are very social, allowing myself more options then I have now, but knowing that we have some sketchy history that presents the possibility that I may regret the move.",04Oct2017,3

I looked at the comments and someone had commented something about them passing around a bowl (in the photo). She would have been fourteen in that photo and just done with freshman year. I know that she doesn't hang out with at least the girl that was in the photo (thank goodness because I never liked her to start with lol), and I doubt that she hangs out often with the guys because her boyfriend now is a bit jealous.

141,"Good morning Reddit,

I wasn't sure where else to ask for help. 

I woke up this morning and got a request for confirmation from my CC company that I paid someone $4k.  I declined it as I wasn't familiar with the charge. 

I go downstairs to my office and notice my monitor is on, and I see a window open for my Gmail and eBay. It looks like someone remoted into my PC, bought a diamond ring and had it shipped to me. I turned off my PC as they were trying to delete the email trail of the purchase, so I was able to save these. I screenshotted the emails on my phone just in case. 
I got a notification a few minutes ago from eBay that my package was shipped so I'm wondering if the hacker and the seller are the same person. 

What do I do to safeguard against this besides leave my computer off forever? ",04Oct2017,21

144,"So long story short I get a random message on Facebook yesterday telling me that this man has caught his girlfriend and my husband cheating on us. The way he caught her was through her Craigslist email account and there were a hundred messages exchanged with information about my husband that could be found from several different social media accounts and also personal photos from his phone. My husband continues to tell me that he has been a victim of doxxing. My husband has denied that any of these exchanges happened due to the strange nature of the emails the tone and text in the emails and also the fact that the man on Facebook is trying so hard to insist and convince me that my husband cheated on me with his girlfriend.(he was home that night this supposedly happened btw, it detailed in the emails) In the meantime I have been trying to get a hold of this girl who my husband supposedly cheated on me with. But the dude that hit me up on Facebook won't give me her number or any information. Looking through the Craigslist email chain again I found a weird email address that I decided to send a hello to last night. This person replied immediately and laughed and said LMAO your man fucked me last night get over it my boyfriend dumped me you guys are such fucking losers to not believe this actually happened. Mind you this man who messaged me on Facebook is 25 and the girl is supposedly 18. My husband and I are in our mid-thirties with children and we are married, I wouldn't say we are completely happy or perfect but our sex lives and our trust with each other is pretty darn strong, we do love each other. My husband just retrieved a new phone about 2 (back to android using google again, everything goes to google drive) weeks ago and download a bunch of new apps. He does take pictures and videos of himself (nude, etc.) from time to time that we share with each other I do the same myself. All of the pictures and videos of recent that he either kept to show me on his phone or he sent to me through email or text. The emails shared between the two people that Sarah girl and my husband were odd very short sentences but there was the first initial email that supposedly my husband sent and responsed to the Craigslist ad where he describes all of his likes and different types of fetishes. Mind you these are all things that have been sent via text between us and via email between us or in his past five years ago, when he was single. Now I am not trying to make excuses for anyone I'm looking at emails and pictures right in front of me but I'm also looking at my husband crying and kneeling in front of me and saying he's going to make a police report due to the hacking and the doxxing He is convinced this happened. he has already swept his phone clean changed all his passwords and has deleted his Facebook account he seems scared and upset. I am just trying to decidwle wtf to do.....was he hacked/doxxed? Am i being toyed with?? Has anyone experienced this or knows of this type of thing. Please keep in mind this is not a cry for help, like oh no my husband cheated. I need to know if this supposed hack or doxx happened and if anyone has known of or experienced a similar thing. Please respond if you have any help or information to share. Thank you!!

basically a car pulls up behind the building next door to my house. Everythings closed, they dont have any relation to the business there. they park up facing my house. When i notice them from my window I stare for about 30 seconds trying to distinguish any features in the dark. as soon as I move away from the window I hear sometimes a car door but the engine and the car leaves, and i see it pass by the front of my house once its rounded the building next door.

so theres other shops around, and theres bound to be security footage of the area. The thing is, I dont really know whats going down... How do I take some action?

I can get the security footage but it wont show anthing but a person loitering or trespassing at best.    in the past month someone has been through our backyard and tried our back doors which we keep locked.

whoever it is, is there with such frequency that I've been able to predict it.  it doesnt matter what night of the week, but at first he was there around 11pm - 3 times, then ive noticed him twice at 10:30pmish and tonight at quarter past - hes getting earlier and earlier, I wonder if he's waiting for somebody to come home or if he's seeing if anyones home or what. its kind of scary at this point",04Oct2017,4

150,"Bit of background, we're both 18, started dating back in May and I've never felt this close to someone. I have friends I've known for years and years - one even for my entire life - and none of them know me like he does. He's told me his fair share of darker, personal things about himself. We always talked about how long we would last, the things we would be able to do years down the line. Point is, I don't want to lose him. 
But I very well might be because he wants to move. In February. His mother is getting a divorce for the 4th time and she's not staying here so he's decided to save all his money until then and move to South Carolina with a group of friends. One of them already lives up there, so I have no doubt he'd actually be able to do it.  
I've already broken up with him 4 days ago (he made it clear that he didn't want to) out of fear that if I let it go on until February it would just hurt that much more. 
He's still upset. I can tell. Which makes me think I have a chance to pull this off. 
I want to ask him if he'd be willing to stay with me one more year until I graduate from the 2 year degree I'm in the middle of getting so I can move up there with them after I'm done. We both hate Florida a pretty great amount so I wouldn't be missing anything down here. 
My question is - is this too much of a commitment to be placing on a relationship of only about 4 months? Should we just stay split up? As much of a corny young girl thing this is to say, I really do think he's special.

But 5 days later while drunk I sent her a very long text... without further embarrassment I'll just say It was very bad. She read it but didn't reply and, same thing to my texts the next day. Fast forward to two days ago, I use to forward videos of her favourite animal when they appeared on the front page, so when her favourite animal showed up I instinctively forwarded it to her (we haven't spoken for 2 months now), and she replied with smiles and laughing saying it made her day.

153,"Hey y'all. Some backstory: I'm a 20 year old female, working two part time jobs and in college full time. I was living with friends in a no-commitment renting situation this summer, and the homeowner decided to sell the house so we all had to move out. I had a new apartment lined up, but the whole situation fell through due to unrelated issues I don't feel like going into. 

So basically I ended up back at home with my nearly 60 year old father and 17 year old brother.  I rationalized it by thinking of all the money, time, and stress I'll save by not moving or paying rent or utilities for at least a few months before I find something else. 

However the living conditions in this house are INTOLERABLE. Just absolutely fucking disgusting. They both take no pride whatsoever in their living spaces. It's so bad I'm terrified to bring any friends over, which obviously affects my social life. Like, it's not super cluttered or anything and 70% of the problems are overlookable. But there's also mold in the bathroom, dust and dirt covering 80% of surfaces, foul odor coming from brother's bedroom, dried piss congealed to the toilet, pet stains all over the carpet that no one attempted to lift, I could go on but you get the picture. 

I've respectfully and rationally brought it up to both of my ""roommates"" and they have slightly different reactions yet neither of them seem to recognize the problem enough to take action, from either a health standpoint or just a personal pride standpoint. My dad has alluded to getting new carpet and hiring a cleaning service, but I doubt he's serious about it. When I mention anything to my brother he says verbatim ""I could not care less."" Whatever I do I can not convince him that his habits and attitudes need to change. He just blames the problem on me, tells me to stop bitching and move out if I don't like it (if only it were that easy.) He even said today that he's going to try to be even more disgusting just to bother me. 

Guys, seriously what the hell should I do. Is there any diplomatic solution out of this, or do I just need to suck it up and stay in the unhealthy, repulsive yet rent free living situation, or what little money I have moving to somewhere I can barely afford? Right now it looks like a classic no win situation =(

Edit: to be fair my dad does seem to at least somewhat care about the house. His room is pretty well taken care of, and he attempts to clean the kitchen. But when it comes to the brother, my dad has basically given up. He fully accepted that getting him to change is a fool's errand. Is there a way to teach a 17 year old basic life skills or is my little brother going to be a disgusting slob his whole life? ",04Oct2017,1
154,"When I was younger, I wanted to be seen as a nice person, which often led to people taking advantage of me. They knew I would never stand up to them. I had a tendency to make friends with people who exploited my niceness and used me to their advantage. I believe this also had something to do with me being assaulted at school when I was 13 and again by the same boy when I was 17. 

I'm not blaming myself for the assault, but I do think the boy who did it knew that I was unlikely to tell someone. He was absolutely right, it took me more than 10 years to open up about it. He is no longer in my life, and I have become a much more assertive person, though I still struggle at times. A recent unrelated event got me thinking about the consequences of not standing up for myself in the past, mainly that other people can be hurt by the people who hurt me if I don't make it known that they abused me. 

I feel that I really need to confront the boy who assaulted me because I hate that he got away with it and I'm afraid that he has continued to do this to others. Is it a bad idea to confront him after so many years? If not, what's the best way to go about it? I really want people to know who he really is. Is there any way to tastefully do this?",04Oct2017,3
155,"So I'm really torn here.

THis is the first dog that I've owned that I've had to make this decision for. 

Long story short, my dog has a tumor in his foot, it got infected, and the vet had to drain it and bandage it up. Unfortunately the antibiotics aren't working, and when I change his bandage it looks worse every time.

He's still in great spirits, spry, eats well, but we are sure this thing is going to be the end of him. He has a little trouble getting around, he limps, but otherwise he's the same old dog. He's also 14 years old.

I'd like him to go out on top and with dignity like the tough bastard he is, but I don't want to cheat him either. Is it better to wait until he's extremely affected by his infection, or stop delaying the inevitable, treat him to a celebration of his life, give him ice cream, cookies, let him sit at the park, etc. - and then put him to rest for good?

I can see the benefit of both decisions, but I'm not sure what to do. He's my most loyal boy -- and it's hard to kill him like this.

158,"Sifting through Craigslist for a used car has been a bit of a chore. Thought I lucked out when I found a 2011 Subaru with 78k for 7,000 which is the absolute max I have to buy a car. Asked the guy if it was still available, he said it was and we've set up a time to meet (today). He wants to meet at a department store, which isn't a huge red flag, I get why someone would want to do deals in a public place.

Yesterday I saw another add with very similar wording, very very similar, for a different car, the contact info was the same. Seemed fishy, so I asked him about it, asked if he had the title, and asked outright if he was curbstoning. He said that he'd give me the VIN, that he has the title, and that he bought the car to flip and he has 2 other ones for sale, one is a daily driver, the other two are flips.

Now, I understand trying to make money, having a little side hussle, I'm not the police, I don't care that you're selling cars on the side. I'm just wondering if I'm being naive. I know it's a bit shady, and I know that I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt. Does this seem like something I should avoid? I'm not sold on the car.

However, I entered in the second semester, on January, which places me in the middle of two academic years. If I go by normal pace according to my program (8 semesters + 2 summers), I would finish on a December, meaning I would receive my diploma through the mail, and pay grad fees to a graduation I wouldn't even be around to attend.

Now, my parents really want me to graduate. I only graduated twice at this point: kindergarten and middle school. It would mean the world to them just to see me wearing that graduation gown and cap again. I don't mind either way, but the only way I could do it is to either push my credit max up (to be able to take in more classes per semester) and finish one semester early, or to stay back one semester and basically just waste time on a local internship (I'd rather do the internship in the city, but the uni has very specific requirements in terms of program attendance and I can't go back and forth to and from the city everyday).

We're financially capable of both options, and I can manage with either load weights, but I can't decide on which option would be more feasible to take.

Why do I want to quit? I never really truly programmed for money. I only program because it's fun, it keeps me busy and entertained. I spend 24/7 reading books about computers, so I don't work.

179,"My roommate met someone she went to high school with on a dating app. He didn’t know her, but she knew him, as he was very popular in high school. They started talking a few weeks ago, and he told her he is in recovery for a cocaine addiction. She told him she appreciated his honesty, but confided in me that she is not actually interested, and was afraid of leading him on. Recently, she said he couldn’t take no for an answer and she invited him over while I was at work. I advised against it, as this would lead him on. She had him over anyway and ended up crushing on him pretty hard after all, but I am concerned for my roommate and our safety. Their first date was in our apartment. He has come over since and has plans to return. I respect anyone in recovery and realize that addiction is a disease, but his condition (let alone the fact that he is a stranger) has me worried about theft, violence or the overall compromise of our comfortable living situation. I do not trust this man because I don’t know him, and I am worried that my roommate’s judgement is skewed on this one. What do I do, or not do?",04Oct2017,3
180,"I'm 26 years old, and I want to go back to school for a business focus.  Eventually I want to open my own business of some kind, but still working out what exactly I would open.

Here are my setbacks.

I dropped out of college for a degree I should not have gone for in the first place, and I'm still slowly paying off a $20k debt from that.  I work a full time office job that pays me well but the work is unfulfilling and doesn't help me with my goals right now.  My company doesn't offer any student aid.  My parents are supportive, but they live out of state and don't have room in their house to let me stay and pay off my debt.

I'm afraid to even start school again because at best, my previous debt would only sit and collect more interest.  Worst case, I take on even more debt to pay off after my degree.  I'm also afraid to go to school part time, since that means it'll be a good number of years before I can even get the most basic degree.

I've never had that before but I just love her so so much. Anyway, my university would be a 6-7 hour car drive from home and I will move there. I can't imagine leaving my cat at home with my family and I honestly think my cat would rather be with me as well. But if I take her with me she would leave her cats friends. And I think I would come home for every other weekend, I wouldn't want to leave her with my roommates then, at least not for when I'm longer at my family's home for christmas etc. So she would have to travel pretty frequently which she isn't really a fan of (but i guess you can train that a little) and have two homes which I've read isn't that good for cats either. So I don't know what to do. It would break my heart to leave her but the traveling and home switching, I don't know. Her well being is very important to me.

It seems that pretty much everyone there is extroverted, outgoing and engaging. I was nervous about this before I started but I knew that that sort of environment would be good for me. If people show an interest I can usually open up fairly quickly.

Unfortunately, the guy I work with seems to have no inclination to be sociable. Obviously, I get that. But in my first few weeks I really would've liked it if he'd made a bit of an effort to ask questions and make conversation, just to help me settle in. I tried to do just that but he just answers my questions with short answers and doesn't reciprocate or attempt to build a conversation/rapport.

From group interactions (in meetings etc.) he does seem to engage when he has to. I get the impression that he's not shy or awkward - he just doesn't feel the want/need to engage in idle chat that doesn't serve a specific purpose.

As a consequence of being shielded from the social folk I've become even more anxious and socially-inept than I was before I started the role. So whenever I have to go to meetings or mingle with other staff I get nervous and yearn to run away as soon as possible.

So, after all that ramble, I guess my question is - how do I engage with this guy? I don't want to talk all the time either.

186,"I know the goto solution is to block. She keeps on making new accounts whenever I do to message me through whatever kind of social media I may have.

We broke up end of August and I thought it went quite well, went our separate ways and stayed outta contact. Until she started messaging me off and on again with varied emotions. Some were her being sad and lonely. Sometimes she was really really angry and cussed me out etc.

Made a 'deal' in which she said ""If you ever break up with me, you have to pay me £200."" Obviously I said this is a stupid deal, why would you say that? She replied ""Well if you won't break up with me, you should have no problem making it."" So, knowing it'd lead to some kind of argument I said yeah whatever okay.

Walked 40 mins to a Sobeys store at 2 a.m.  and 40 mins back to try and buy a plunger. But it was sold out. I tried the dishsoap and hot water trick. Didn't work, I think it's just too far down the pipes at this point to be broken down. I tried to manually (with my arm + rubber glove) push the water down, it drained a bit but it's still mostly clogged and still not fully functional. So I tried the mop in a plastic bag trick. The mop was too big. I tried pouring a ton of water didn't do the trick. I finally bought a decent plunger (and not the awful sink plunger we have) and I heaved and hoed for 20 minutes and it didn't do the trick. All of these tricks btw I tried multiple times each to no avail.

I think that if I did the soap and hot water trick 100 times in a row, it might do the trick but I don't know anymore.

194,"Hello all!

I have some questions on behalf of my girlfriend. I would also like to know your insight as well because I’ve personally never been in this kind of situation.

She was recently hired as an administrative assistant for a company that manufactures materials and fabrics. She was very excited to land a job that works hand in hand with reputable companies. However, recently she’s mentioned a few things that we think are potential red flags.

The first week of work was nothing out of the ordinary: tours, orientation, meet and greets, and familiarization. We are in the second week and now things have taken a slight turn. On Monday, she was called into the division managers office (I’ll call him Dave) and told to go to IT to order a company iPad and iPhone. She politely told Dave that it was unnecessary and she didn’t really need one. Dave responded with some sort of scenario where it would be beneficial for her to have one. In other words, what Dave is saying is she would be accessible by phone/email on her off time outside of work to benefit the company. Mind you, the owners are notoriously known to be “needy”.

Now, for some this would be okay. However, the job announcement never mentions working outside of work as a responsibility or key duty. Additionally, it was never mentioned during the interview as well. She made it very clear to me that if she knew she’d be on standby or working remotely on her off time, she would’ve never taken the job in the first place.

She decided to ask individuals around the company with sonority for advice. One individual told her they were asked rather than told if they wanted a company phone/tablet. Others were shocked and told her it’s not right. Some advised her to talk to HR to handle it.

So, long story short, she feels like she’s being forced to take on an additional duty that was never disclosed on the job announcement and later during the interview. She feels they are forcing this on her and has zero choice in the matter. She would be directly reporting to the owners of the company like some kind of personal assistant any time outside of work and she’s not comfortable with it. What are her options? Is this normal?

I wanted to throw this in here as an aside: She was told in the first week she can come in at 8AM, take a 30-minute break, and leave at 4:30PM. That’s a total of 8-hours. However, Dave told her today, she has to take a full hour of lunch so that she can stay till 5PM because that’s the time Dave leaves work. Everyone else at the company takes the 30-minute break and leaves at 4:30PM. Dave is the only person who stays till 5PM and is essentially forcing her to stay with him just because. She on salary…isn’t it okay to decide whether she wants to take a 30-minute break instead of an hour? I mean, she’s still doing her 8-hours. Is this okay?

195,"Just turned 27 yesterday. For the past 5 or so years, I've been largely stuck at home, unable to be independant for lack of both transportation (Small town, no significant public transport, no car) and growing psychological issues. My therapist and psychiatrist are both apparently unable to do much because most of my problems are environmental, which they can't really help with outside of a life-threatening crisis.

I'm in Solano County, California. I'm looking for something like a half-way house or a group home that can assist people on the autism spectrum become independant. What I've been able to find have been things like crisis housing, for people who are at risk of harming somebody. I am not in a high-risk situation, I'm just stagnating and there's no opportunities or resources in the small town I'm stuck in. Yes, I'm willing to relocate, but that's one of the biggest problems: though I _can_ drive, I don't have a car of my own and one isn't very often available to me. Transportation is a huge issue. The local bus doesn't service many areas, has a fairly sparse schedule, and this town is distant enough from civilization that a cab would be exorbitantly expensive. (That's a problem when you have nothing to your name, you know?) There are no job opportunities for anything I am qualified for here. (Everything I've seen is customer service. Social anxiety + customer service do NOT meld. There's no market for IT jobs in an agricultural town of ~6000.)

CA Dept. of Rehab was of minimal help, and I didn't qualify for the regional center's services. In fact, it's been a recurring theme in my life when going in for some sort of help that the prognosis comes up as basically ""You're clearly impaired, just not impaired enough.""

197,"I'm posting on behalf of my SO, who is busy packing for a trip.

Situation: My SO was offered a job that was contingent on a lengthy background check (could take from 1 to 12 months.) When she was offered the position she stated that she could start work in mid November. The reason for that date was a family trip for her to see her parents who she hasn't seen in a year and a half. The current planned trip is for about 30 days. She has made several plans with various members of her family during this trip.

Today the company informed her that the background check was complete and that the training starts mid October. If she can't make that training another starts in mid January. 

My wife is torn between seeing her family or starting the job.  She hasn't seen her family in  so long and it means a lot to see them. The job offer is a very good prospect, this is in a very limited field but my wife is very qualified for the position. They said they will hold her spot for her to start in Janaury when another class starts. If she were to take the job her trip would be 11 days instead of 30. She would not be able to find a comparably paying job in that timeframe if she postponed starring, but could pick up some seasonal retail work.

198,"Okay, so i first need to apologise in advance if this is written badly, sorry i'm really shit at describing things.

I'll start by describing my friend groups as it seems the easiest place to start. I have two friend groups, the larger of the two is the one with my school friends that i have lessons with and talk to at breaks/lunches. The second one is much smaller, comprising of just me(guy), person A (guy), person B (girl) and person C (girl). I can't talk to these friends at school because they are either in a different year or go to a different school so i talk to at the weekends when we go out or on snapchat.
Also fyi person A and B are dating, just thought i'd let you know.

Anyway, so i might have a crush on person C i'm not 100% sure (which btw is something i was aware of before the following events happened).But last saturday A and B invited me to go somewhere with them and after i had been with them for about half an hour person B said something like ""I've got a question for you"". Then person A and person B both looked at each other and then person A said ""oh yeah she does"". Person B then asks me ""do you have a crush on person C""
I immidiatley said ""what no why"". I wasn't sure if they were just curious or if person C asked them to ask or what, so i just said no in case they were just being nosey,  a part of me is kinda regretting that now, idk.
Anyway, so i asked them why and person B just said oh no reason and i've asked person A individually why and person A said he didn't know and to ask person B so i did over snapchat. She said that there actually wasn't a reason and i said but there must be a reason no one just randomly looks at another person and asks something like that and she just said ""what a mystery"".

That was a few days ago and idk it seems like person C is upset when i talk to her on sc. Idk if i'm reading into it too much and she's not even upset or if she's upset about something else like exam stress (she was upset about it a few weeks ago, maybe more of that?)  or if what i said upset her or what. I don't know what to do, i was thinking of maybe asking person A what to do but if i do he'll probably tell person B cos they tell each other everything they know about everyone they know. And if person B knew then person C would know so idk what to do. Literally any advice would be appreciated, thanks.

202,"Hi Reddit. I'm 23 years old, I complete my undergraduate studies in July 2017 with a BA in International Relations &amp; Affairs, and I'm extremely confused with what I should do with my time. 

I've been trying to find work in my field: from internships to entry-level work, but every time I apply I get stopped by one issue: the fact I'm not a US citizen. I'm a British citizen who has lived in the United States for over 9 years, I have a Green Card and have worked multiple jobs in retail, food service and had an internship over the summer working for a grassroots political organization. I'm eligible to apply for the citizenship, however, it costs around $725 to file for naturalization &amp; for the biometric scan (plus I have a misdemeanor offense which was dismissed but plan on getting expunged since I don't want to risk not achieving the standard of being of ""good moral character""). I've just started working a $12/hr job in order to save up the money to pay for the citizenship test. Right now, I'm living at home with my family but I'm struggling to find direction. 

On the one hand, I'm very passionate about politics &amp; moving towards a career focused on a career with an international focus (I spend almost  5 years as a child in France, I've retained my French but I'd like to be able to use it for my career). I've been looking for work in Washington DC, but each job requires I become a US citizen in order to use my degree. It's become a catch 22. I've looked at internship opportunities, applied to them, even got a few interviews, but during each interview I felt the organizations weren't right for me or weren't paying enough (one organization was offering $500 A MONTH from October-April in downtown DC, I couldn't afford living costs while taking on a part-time job, let along afford the citizenship test). My parents aren't making me pay rent but I'm trying to find a way to move out so I just live on my own and feel in more control of my life. 

On the other hand, I'm extremely interested in business, I feel more passion for setting up my own business and creating ideas which can help others and where I can be in control of my own projects. But I feel that having committed 3 years to a degree &amp; internships towards politics puts me into a position where if I chose to attend a business school, I would've wasted those years and take even more years to develop skills in a new field. Plus school is expensive, I'm looking for work since it provides an experience which looks good if I want to attend a good business/Master's school, and more income I can use to save for further schooling, paying off existing debts and affording my own place.

My mind is constantly confused. I question whether getting the citizenship is worth it, in the end, I might get the citizenship months from now but when I apply for these jobs might not get any response. I'm still technically a ""recent graduate"", meaning I can apply for internships up until the next group of graduates come through. I chose not to pursue a Master's in order to figure out what I was truly passionate about before going I dive into greater commitment &amp; debt. 

I hope I explained my thoughts &amp; situation well enough to give you an idea. I'm looking anyone with good to honest advice, from strangers rather than just friends &amp; family. ",04Oct2017,1

Last year, I left home for studying. I was living in student dorms and I met the most extraordinary people during that time. They became the closest friends I ever had. At the end of the year, I decided to stop studying for the next year and to go find work in a city where I don't know anyone. 


Reflecting on this now, I only wish I hadn't made that choice. At this moment of my life, everyday is a new challenge. I have no financial stability, I'm struggling to find a decent job and I miss my friends more with every breath I take. Although it is hard, I can still appreciate that all of this forces me to be more responsible and drives me to put my life back together, one step at a time.


Still, I am puzzled on what to do next. Should I just ignore the voice that tells me to go back where my friends are because they are what makes me happy? Would it mean that I give up on my ambition to become more responsible? Would I be lying to myself just to have my old life back?

There is also this boy I met, back in the town where my friends are, who became more than a friend to me. We are not a couple, but he is the first person I fall in love with in all my life. We have the kind of relationship that feelings would still be in the air after several years of not seeing each other, but I don't want to risk losing my first love.

212,"Hey fellow 416:ers.
I have tried writing this post in great detail a few times, but it essentially just becomes a novel so i will keep it short for it to be readable.

I moved to a new place a month ago. The house has several units, but is not an apartment building. I have my own unit in the basement, across a 4 ft wide hall from an identical one.
I moved here a month ago. Made sure to introduce myself to the neighbor. Blue collar guy in his 50s. Got a bad vibe from the very beginning.
Quickly realized he likes drinking and blasting loud music. I am a student (international) and have morning classes, but i took the 3-4 times he was up partying late as one time things, and didn't want to make a fuzz about it.


&amp;nbsp;


**11 PM, sunday night:**

My girlfriend was visiting. We had dinner, and went to bed. Eric, as i chose to call the neighbor, was up blasting music at a disturing volume, singing and clapping loudly. 
I walked out in the hall, knocked and politely asked him to turn it down. He replied by throwing to sets of earplugs on me, claiming that you cant even hear the music in the hallway.
30 minutes later, i try again, pleading that i have a quiz in the morning and need to sleep. He shrugs and keeps on partying by himself.

I call the landlord, who lives upstairs. He comes down, eventually (after 20 minutes) manages to make contact with Eric, who dismisses the landlords request for him to turn it down (at this point it is way past midnight and we are both pretty worked up).
He stops playing music for five minutes. When the landlord had left, it all started up again. What then transpired was a four hour long marathon of him behaving like this:


&amp;nbsp;


https://mixstep.co/byqsgosvkbcm **&lt;-- ACTUAL AUDIO, some compression/EQ added to clear up muddiness**

&amp;nbsp;



These are just two of the many clips i took during the night from my apartment, standing by the door. As you can hear, he repeatedly screams ""Faggot"", ""Pussy"", and made threats to ""Bang your whore/Bang her, i'll make that happen, don't you worry"". One time he said ""I will rip her open, bring her here!"". When i said that i was on the bed with my girlfriend trying to comfort her.

&amp;nbsp;


Needless to say, i was on my way out the door several times to take care of him myself, he almost pushed me over the edge. My girlfriend, though, was smart enough to stop me, saying she would not allow me to put her in danger. Fair enough.
After another hour of this, we said enough was enough, and called the police, all while this was going on. After 90 minutes, two officers showed up, moderately interested in what we had to say, questioning that we even called them.

&amp;nbsp;


I am from a european country where this would have been grounds for harassment/sexual harassment charges to be laid, and the police would also have made sure to bring the perpetrator out for examination (drugs? weapons?)
These two officers, who i am sure had handled more serious matters during the night though, turned sour on me when i questioned them saying ""This is not a crime, he is just being a jerk"". They were more concerned with me and my attitude (i was indeed not very polite, but not unfair. I just wanted to know what the hell was going on, and why they could not open his door).

&amp;nbsp;

While the cops were here, Eric turned down the music, shut his lights down and pretended not to be home. When the officers left, he instantly started up again.
The policemen, in their attempts to speak to Eric, knocked on his door, and windows, called him ""Bitch"", and ""Pussy"", which also struck me as very odd.

&amp;nbsp;


**Anyway, current status:**

&amp;nbsp;

I got home about one hour ago, after spending two days at my girlfriends parents house. Eric is in the hall, doing laundry. Has apparently apologized to the landlord, but that does not mean shit to me.
I have aquired a bottle of pepper spray and will use force if i have to. We went to the police office today, but they gave us the same attitude as the cops two nights ago, which i am suprised and disappointed by. 
I guess, reddit, my question is:
Is this right? Is this how canadian law/police works? How do i resolve this situation?


&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR:**
Neighbor spent a whole night harassing me and my girlfriend with sexual remarks toward her. Cops showed up but did not do anything. Acted unprofessional.

215,"So my wife, me and our 10 month old son moved into a condo recently that we are renting everything seemed fine at first but we started to get a few silver fish in the washroom and now we just found on in our kitchen!! Should we call the landlord to get an exterminator to come look or are we over thinking this? What do you people recommend!? Thanks! 😊",04Oct2017,1
216,"So I grew up in a rural midwestern farm town. Parents are still in the same state but I moved about eight hours driving distance away for grad school. I graduated a couple of years ago and am working in a mediocre job that I desperately needed. I'm still in that city as that is where my professional contacts are.  

I'm now at the point where I need to further my career by getting a job in my field of mental health counseling. I will need to work a couple of years gathering hours toward my state license. However, each state is different so once I start working towards my license I won't be able to change states easily, if at all. 

Beyond that, I want to start building roots. I'm in my late twenties and thinking about marriage and kids and building a life. While I like where I'm at, I do miss my family and they have made themselves clear that they will not move to me. The logistics of traveling 8 hours away means that I have only been seeing them 2-3 times a year whereas I would prefer to see them closer to double that amount. This is becoming more important as my friends who have been like a surrogate family are starting to move away which is leaving me with the fear that I may not have much of a social circle soon. Additionally, now that I am dating, I'm realizing that my future kids will not see their grandparents more than a few times a year while they will be able to visit their mother's grandparents (assuming I marry a native of my city) every other weekend or whatever. 

Additionally, I would make more money in the other states after accounting for cost of living, which would be closer to my family (4-5 hours instead of 8). 

That said, when all is said and done, I actually like the city I currently live in. I love the scenery, I love the environment, I love the culture and I feel confident in knowing the city well. When I first moved here, I did not know where the ""bad"" parts and the ""good"" parts of town were, what streets to take to get anywhere, or what events and such were around. Also, knowing what other programs are around helps someone in my field tremendously. Not only that, but I had a difficult time building friendships when I first moved here, and I had the added benefit of taking classes back then. 

Another factor is politics. I am currently living in a more liberal, left state. This is important to me in the current political environment as the right-leaning federal government is threatening to cut the services and funding that my job depends on. The states that I am looking to move to are more conservative and my job might be less stable if the next governor believes that mental health should be thrown out the window. The state I currently live in appears to be immune to this fear as the state politics will always be left-leaning.  

I've been thinking about this for several months so that's why there are so many factors that are necessary. If you need more specifics I can provide some of them. 

TLDR: I moved far away from my parents for grad school and am now deciding whether I should move closer as I begin to put down roots. Moving to a new city is scary and I like where I am currently at. ",04Oct2017,2

218,"Short story,
I had around a week to prepare for exam. First mistake, i watched 2 seasons of anime in about 18 hrs. Second mistake is that comparing my life to it, made me have short existential crisis. I feel like I wasted my life for not pursuing my hobbies, meeting new people, forming stronger friendships than just school colleagues. And lastly, i fell in love with one of the characters,  which emphasized my feelings of loneliness. End result is that i haven't touched the subject in five days already.

What I ask for.
I think root cause might be something deeper, so i would like to know if there is a place where i could hear other experiences. I thought about posting this to waifuizm (or something like that), but they all seem pretty happy with their condition.
If any of you could forward me in the right direction where there are people with similar experiences, or whole subreddit, I would appreciated.

220,"My good friend and I moved into an apartment together about 4 months ago. I've known her for years and she's always been a heavy smoker. When we got this apartment, she said she really wanted to be able to smoke inside, and I reluctantly said she could smoke in her room with the door closed. I've never lived with a smoker before and I thought if she kept her door closed when she smoked it wouldn't be a problem.

The thing is, our apartment is so small that the cigarette smell basically fills the whole place. Sometimes I can even smell it in my room. It makes me nauseous, plus I don't like having to breathe her second hand smoke every day. 

But I'm not sure if it's fair for me to ask her to stop. I feel like I have a right to breathe clean air in my own home, but at the same time, she feels she has the right to smoke in her own home. 

What can I do? We have roof access at our place and we're on the top floor. I think asking her to smoke only on the roof is a good compromise, as it only takes a second to walk up the stairs, but she acts like it's some big inconvenience. Any advice? Thank you!!",04Oct2017,3
221,"Please kindly ignore my bad English. 

So, first of all a little context: I have a younger brother (25 yo) who is my only sibling. We are from part of the world where parents are expected to be part of the family (live with us) and form a very tightly knit unit. Our dad (57yo) is a very hardworking 9-6 guy who has spent all his life to provide for us. Our mom is a high school teacher. I am a 27yo Engineer who just finished graduate studies from the best engineering school in the world and started working in a foreign country. Basically I am very content with where I am and my parents are very proud of me.

What they don't know is about the younger brother. Last year, my parents put a lot of pressure on me to apply for Masters admissions on his behalf to the same university where I went. I filled out everything for him and submitted his documents. A month later the university refused and told the undergraduate degree you submitted is fake. Apparently he was fooling everyone since 2012. He would take money for tuition fee from parents but never attend college. Just drive around town and spend whole day sitting on laptop and phone. He used to show my parents fake transcripts and enrollments and they kept believing that he's graduating with a GPA of 3.5. It is 2017 now and he's been doing this fraud for 5 years. 

When I came to know about this, I could not figure out what to do. My mother already has chronic depression, I don't know how she will take when I break this to her. And I don't want to see disappointment in the eyes of my father. I don't want to make them feel sad. On the other hand, I have tried talking to my brother about this but he is completely non-responsive, he has no motivation, no aim in life. I even suggested to him that I will apply for your undergraduate admission and you can go complete that without us informing parents (they trust us blindly and won't ever find out). But he's not even interested in that. He's happy just sitting around all day doing nothing.

I want your advice desperately, what should I do in this situation. I don't want to make parents feel sad by telling them the reality about my brother but still want to do something about this situation. Thank you for reading, I really don't have anywhere else to say this.

232,"So last month my boyfriend (N) and I moved to another state with his best friend (T) that he's had since high school tagging along. We have a double master apartment, N and I share a room, T has his own. So I was fine with this because I really liked T, but now that we live together, he REALLY frustrates me. He leaves things out after being asked multiple times not to, he leaves the light on multiple times, he has already been late to work to his new job of three days. Oh and on top of this, T owes me over $1k in moving costs because we moved without jobs and I've been covering bills until N and T can start paying me back. I think the reason I'm so frustrated about everything T does is because on top of just not being considerate, he hasn't paid me back and is already screwing up his means of paying me back by being late to work. I'm extremely confused because he's in the military so N and I thought he would be more cleanly...you can't just leave things laying around everywhere in the military or run late. Now I'm starting to realize he just needs to be told what to do at all times or he won't do it, which is EXTREMELY irritating because I'm not his mother and it honestly feels like I'm raising my boyfriend's best friend. N is pretty irritated and has already decided he doesn't want to live with him when our lease is up, but says that T is apparently just like this and I'll go crazy getting so angry at every little thing he does. I just don't understand how someone can be so inept and every time I say anything, he acts like I'm just nagging him for fun. So basically what's hard is that I obviously want to stay friends with T since he's N's best friend, but it's getting hard when our friendship seems to ride on me telling him to do something for the 10th time. Also, my mom came to visit for three days and he never left his room (he has never met her) which in my eyes seems really rude, since when T's mom came to visit I was so courteous I even gave her sheets to sleep on.  So it's not only the cleaning, but his general character too. N and I sat him down and gave him duties to do and he just seems oblivious to anything (I.e. Oh is that my dish?). Should I just stop caring about what he does and pick my battles or do I keep telling him what to do? What is the best way to handle this?

234,"I am in my first semester of law school and I'm not doing so well. Part of it is my financial situation and some personal issues have been making it harder to devote as much time &amp; resources as I'd like to school. My two most recent midterms (i've had two so far, and two more coming up; these are only part of our grade but finals which are by far the most important, are very similar) I have failed, and my legal research/writing class I've consistently struggled with many of our biggest assignments. Even with talking with instructors, extra time studying, etc I feel like to some degree I just don't understand a lot of the material. This in turn is highly discouraging and makes it incredibly difficult to stay motivated, which means performance doesn't improve. I have thought I wanted to be a lawyer since I was very young, because I am very interested in the legal field and care deeply about many issues directly related to it. I worked pretty hard to get into this school, and it is too late to change to part time, transfer (which isn't really practical anyway due to where I live and my financial situation), or quit (I would get nothing if I did, and I at least want to see if I can do it because I know if I quit without really trying this semester, I would hate myself forever). I am not saying I'm ""giving up"" but I believe it's important to take a serious look at me and what the reality is, and that I need to have a plan. I have a Bachelor's degree (graduated cum laude) from a well-known state university in English, and I do not have very much ""work experience"". I am not physically very strong, and have a bad back, so a lot of manual labor is out of the question. I'm not very good at math, I can't stand blood or gross medical stuff in person, and I live in a small rural area (I commute to school 1.5 to 2 hours each way every weekday). I know I should consider other options for a job, but I'm not really sure where to start. I am good at other things, but unfortunately a lot of them either require additional certifications or don't pay a lot:
-writing/reading comprehension (hence the English major)
-I know rudimentary spanish (would need to really study it again)
-get along pretty good with people
-When I am motivated, I am pretty good at organizing/cleaning things
-I love kids (thought about substitute teaching but would have to hold off cause my state requires some kind of complex licensing process &amp; a bunch of other stuff)
-I enjoy helping people 

I guess my biggest worry is it's scary having to think about the possibility what you've invested so much of your life into and really believed in might not be possible. It's scary not knowing what to do. I have tried to talk to my family, bf, friends, etc but I feel like they don't really understand. I am under a lot of pressure from my family in particular to succeed and I feel horrible at the prospect of disappointing them.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated

I don't get paid nearly enough to justify sitting in traffic for 20 hours a week, so I am going to start looking for a new job. However, there are a couple problems I have run into:

1. I cannot live on my own anywhere near my new office as it is way too expensive.
2. I have recently renewed my lease on my apartment for another year.

I was planning on moving to another city after my lease was up anyway, and now this bombshell has got me scrambling to figure out what I'm going to do. 

So I guess my question is: How far in advanced should I look for a new job in another city? Is it worth getting interviews months before I wold even be able to start the new job? Any advice is appreciated. ",04Oct2017,5
255,"A month ago I was laid off from a job I loved. It was near my apartment downtown and I had moved downtown in order to be close to work. Once laid off I was referred to a new company (let's call it company 1) in the industry and brought on board within a week. This new job was nothing like my old job. 

It is about a 45 minute drive to and from the office, the hours of operation are 8:30-5:30 rather than my old job which was 9-5. I used to love the clients at my old job but now I feel lost in the industry and I am not excited about the position or the work. 

Over the month I have worked here I have never felt like I was given any responsibility and the team here did not involve me in projects. I constantly attempted to self teach and to ask others where I would be able to step in. At most I would be given random assignments taking only twenty to thirty minutes and would otherwise sit at my desk and read articles on the internet about our industry and best practices. I was trying to make sure I was doing something relevant. I am a highly organized person and I do well when I am able to really get involved with projects. 

Another position I had applied to before making the decision to come on board at Company 1 has offered me a position. This job (Shiny New Job) is within walking distance of my apartment, pays the same and is in an industry I am passionate about. I will also be able to utilize my graphic design skills there more! So I accepted. And yesterday I gave my notice that I will be leaving to Company 1. My last day will be next Friday. 

Here is the problem: my supervisor and the CEO of Company 1 both begged me to stay yesterday. They offered me the option to work from home 1 day a week and they brought up pay and asked if I'd like to work on other accounts. Etc. but I hate it here. I hate the drive. I don't have passion for the client pool. 

My supervisor went so far as to say that my new position is a bad call and I will be unhappy in the new industry. She said that I'll have trouble being successful there and I won't make as much money! 

And today they have now told multiple people that I am leaving. Multiple people in the office are now making things awkward with me and dropping comments like, ""are you working on anything now?"" And there is a new guy in the office and they keep saying, "" at least he's still here he must like it!"" 

How do I avoid all of this awkwardness? I honestly want to run for the hills rather than finish out next week but I know that it is extremely unprofessional. I just hate it here and feel SO extremely awkward and harassed!  ",04Oct2017,1
258,"So take me back to the 22nd of August and this girl messages me while I’m on holiday, I was pleasantly surprised as this rarely happens to me. Things are going great and we talk every day while I’m on holiday and we FaceTime and we arrange to meet up, she was clearly into me and I was clearly into her. I was having the time of my life thinking about a potential future with her as she teased about stealing my goodies in the winter, I even got her a little teddy bear from holiday which she loved. 

We have a first date when I get back and it went very well, I felt we got on great. We then go clubbing a few days later where I got a bit drunk and was oblivious to her friend flirting with me (I didn’t flirt back mind you) and I couldn’t find the right time to kiss her (we were with a group and I felt awkward kissing her in front of her mates) so I agree to kiss her on the next night out.

We meet up the following Tuesday and she’s with 3 of her mates who I don’t know so I was a little bit quiet as I didn’t know anything about these guys so I didn’t know what to say. We head off on our own to do shopping and we’re flirting and having a great time, when we parted ways we hugged and arranged to meet up again.

That was the last time I saw her because later that week she was being very blunt and seemed rather depressed, I did everything I could to try and cheer her up but nothing was working so I said I’d give her a bit of space to clear her head, she seemed grateful for that. A couple of days later I find another boys name I her Instagram bio with a ❤️ next to it, apparently she’d been seeing this guy in the evenings and “one thing led to another”. I was devastated because I really liked this girl and thought I could trust her, I never thought in a million years she’d do this.

She phoned me after I confront her and explains that I was “different and quiet” in person (referring to me being a bit more quiet when meeting her mates) and how I didn’t stop her friend from flirting with me (I was drunk and oblivious, I was absolutely not interested in the other girl) and she told me I didn’t make it clear that I liked her when I told her to her face that I did like her.

This was a couple weeks ago but today I felt rather lonely and just shit because I’d love to have a relationship, I’ve always struggled with women because they always lose interest after a while and it sucks. You got any tips on how I can feel a bit more cheery? coz I’m going a bit mad here",04Oct2017,1

262,"I've wanted a dog for a long time, when I was younger we had dogs and I've always loved them.

Over the past few months I've been torturing myself, pouring over ads for puppies and rescues and while part of me would prefer a rescue all the rescues in my vicinity are large dogs and my apartment only allows small ones. You basically have to be able to carry them around in common areas.

Added to that there's also the fact that I have my heart 75% set on a Corgi or at least a Corgi mix.

So far you're reading this and going ""Ok so you want to get a dog, go get one.""

The issue is this.

I'm a depressive with suicidal ideation and social/overall anxiety, I was actually hospitalized last year for a botched suicide attempt, given all sorts of attempts at treatment and I'm pretty much still in the same mind frame as that day. I lack motivation and energy, getting out of bed takes monumental effort, it's to the point where two months after moving to this new apartment it still looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/hZgQxQP.jpg).

Because of that my biggest fear is that I won't be a good owner for the dog.

On the flip side of this for a few months while a friend's fiance was away I dog-sat for her and while the dog didn't really help with the depression she did have an effect on the anxiety a bit as I would be able to stop what was doing at the time and go be with her for a bit and calm down so it was a positive force in my otherwise negative life. 

Then there's the fact I had to take her to the vet a few months back to be put down because she was suffering from increasingly frequent and debilitating petit mal seizures and her owner, who was still away at the time decided it was better to end her suffering. After an eval the Vet agreed with her and I was the one who stayed by her side from the moment the vet gave her the sedative and subsequently the euthanasia agent all the way through to the end. I stayed by her side for a good 10 minutes after the fact just petting her and apologizing part of me heartbroken she was gone and part of me jealous about how easy and peaceful it had been, another part feeling like a horrible human being for being jealous... 

So I've basically been tearing myself apart in all directions as I torture myself with all these thoughts, recent memories, fears and adverts for these puppies and rescues. There's three I've been looking at almost daily now, one of which is a 6 hour drive...

I apologize for the long read, I'm just driving myself in an insane circle and would appreciate some input really

263,"I'm 28, recently moved in with my gf and have a 2yo stepson and have decided to meet my dad. 

I've never got a straight answer from my mum (who raised me as a single mum with my two older sisters from another guy) as to why he left, but have known he lives local. I have been putting it off for years now, but since my mums dad and my uncle both died the same year(2014), and now helping raise a stepson it's been on my mind. 

I've got things I wanna ask but was hoping I could ask some advice as to what to say when I first meet him, maybe even from someone who has delt with a simular situation.

I have the time, I’m only 22, and I just moved back home. I just spoke with a school advisor that laid out the structure of what I would have to apply to get into veterinary school and it’s daunting to say the least. 

My only reservations are the loans that invariably come with the school I will need, and the job availability of veterinarians (or lack thereof)

271,"Hey guys I'm in a very bad situation. I got caught smoking weed on campus with 3 other people by campus police. They took all our names down and said they were reporting us to the dean. I don't know what to do, I CANNOT get kicked out of school. I will be getting a letter in the mail from the dean and will have a hearing where we all make statements. 

When the cops saw us, I wasn't actually smoking (even though I was before) and I offered to let them search my bag because I didn't have any weed. Should I try and save myself and just say I was smoking a cigarette? Or should I be completely honest (unlike the other 3, who will probably lie) and go to the dean's office preemptively and profusely apologize. Should I offer to pay these guys to lie for me?

277,"Starting from the beginning 
From elementary till university, i was severely abused(physically, mentally etc) not only by my parents but by my friends too. When I started going to high school, everyone use to pick on me because i was very soft spoken, shy, quiet, and i was always made fun of like everyday the kids would pick on me for some stupid reason. When I was in college, some anonymous student emailed me saying that i was the most depressed looking person they saw their whole life, but the same guy also tried hitting on me multiple times. Also, i heard my friends talking about me one time about how ugly i am. And a random guy on the sidewalk was rating girls and he rated me negative infinity :P (as you can tell already I’m not attractive at all, I’m a boner killer :P:P)

I had this friend who kinda sexually abused me when i was little, she’s 1 year older than me. One day she messaged me on Facebook to apologize and i accepted her apology, but later she blocked me and i tried messaging her from a new account but she never replies lol.

My dad was extremely abusive, i couldn’t do anything, put on makeup wear tight clothes show skin, talk to boys, come home at night etc. Even though he was abusive i was dependent on him/ He beat me up a lot, i got used to it. During university, i broke my arm trying to kill myself, despite this i still went to school but i got put on academic probation because of poor grades. The year after my dad died because of a heart attack and i went into a period of depression and confusion. This also happened the school year, and i got put on probation again because i failed most of my courses. I just didn’t have the motivation to study, even now I’m just forcing myself to get through it even though my mind isn’t really there. Btw since I’ve been put on probation twice, i lost two years of school. I was also put on probation on college due to poor grades, i also lost two years then..

Because of these experiences I’ve become awkward and really shy, i even walk like that. My voice sounds immature, its like a little girls voice, my uncle keeps telling me that you’re too soft if you don’t change people will step over you, you have to change. He says this all the time its kinda annoying now..

My dad never sexually abused me. But I feel like a sex object, like i always think guys are looking at me as a sex object etc etc, even though i know thats not true, how can I stop thinking like this. Because i think like this im super awk around guys

Even though my past was kinda sad and i have like no friends, I’m finally getting something this year! Im getting my engineering degree! I was excited, but now I’m scared. Im 29, and I NEVER WORKED, i always was dependent on my parent money. I couldn’t because my parents would think I’m hanging out with guys but now that my dads gone the coast is clear. I don’t have a lot of money so i don’t want to move out. Also since i don’t have any friends i have no connections or anything. So i don’t really deserve to be that happy. Where do you think I should go from here? How can I pick up my life. If you were me what would you do?

Do you think it makes sense it took me so long to get a degree, what will i tell my future employers? Like they will probably ask me what i did the past couple of years i didnt go to school... and the fact that i never worked",04Oct2017,1

I recently had an interview for a part-time job that aligns with my future career goals.

281,"So there's this one girl I've known since the beginning of the school year and lately she's been getting on my nerves. I don't want to mention any actual names, so I will just call her C. When I first met C she seemed nice and like she was normal, but then out of the blue after I only talked to her for 20 minutes, she starts mentioning that she was abused and had 6 miscarriages. She didn't even say it anywhere in private and she was acting as if she was proud of it. I felt bad about that, but it seemed odd. So I have been hanging out with her for a while and she seems like a self absorbed, killjoy that pretends like she's my mom and it really pisses me off. She whines and bitches about everything I do and always feels the need to tell me what to do. Even if I'm joking around. I'll just try to have some fun and mess around and she will yell at me and tell me I'm being obnoxious. Also, she told me that her mom was worried about her getting pregnant with her one ex. She said ""My mom doesn't want him at our house because she's afraid I'm going to get pregnant"". This seemed like she was lying to me considering the fact that she claimed she had 6 miscarriages a while back, but she just said pregnant. She didn't say pregnant again. What she says and how she says it doesn't seem right and I'm getting the impression that she's lying and trying to manipulate me. She says I act annoying and obnoxious but she also says that I'm the nicest person she's ever met (probably because I have the patience to deal with her). I really don't want to be around her anymore, but she's in most of my classes and it's hard to avoid her. And I'm not sure if I should be honest with her because she likes to lie and say bad things about people. My question is, how should I handle her or at least get her to stop her shit? ",04Oct2017,3

She's also had a very bad experience with dating before me, mentally and physically abusive, one of her exes even raped her.
When I ask her seemingly simple questions, she can get very defensive and sometimes the tone makes me feel like I'm stupid as well.
I've confronted her about it, as friends before dating and while dating, and it still hasn't improved. 
It can really hurt sometimes, and can start huge fights over the smallest things, and she's always very defensive.
I already know how to argue very well. Not pointing fingers, letting her talk, acknowledging I'm listening and understanding her side, apologizing when necessary, explaining to her what I meant when there's misunderstandings, etc. 
I guess my question is, how can I help her improve these passive aggressive and aggressive behaviors? Or, how can I get better at coping without my mental well being going downhill further?
And no, it's not serious enough for a breakup so please don't suggest that, I understand why she behaves how she does and I'm working on changing her and myself to avoid these terrible hurtful situations

283,"i need help. im 23, male and i think ive might have ruined my chances with a girl but also think i still might have a chance to redeem myself. i need serious help.

ive been talking to a girl in my college that i have liked for a while. we both took a psychology course and every lesson i would move a seat closer, so she wouldn't notice. 
after a while (because she kept moving seats) eventually i was sitting next to her and started writing little notes on the side of her notepad when she turned away (she talked to a boy on her right, i was on her left). just things like ""hi"", ""guess who"" ""coconut shampoo?"" (referring to her hair) and would pretend i didn't do it when she asked. she was getting quite flustered but it was cute.

on about the 3th day of flirting i asked if we could have a walk around together, since we have a park nearby thats fully forested, but she mentioned about sitting on a bench in the college, so we did that. i gave her one of my sandwiches (i make excellent sandwiches) but she said she didnt want to feel guilty about eating all my lunch(thats another thing i like in her, caring) we had a really good chat and i actually made her a laugh a few times. 

heres where things go wrong and i come across as creepy. we get talking about those viral videos of people using a glass to make their lips bigger and as a JOKE, i said she already has the ""blowjob lips"". as A JOKE but she got angry. I said i didn't mean it sexually its just what they call it and its a nice facial feature. she stormed off and i ate the rest of my lunch. (she still never ate the other sandwich)

i left her to cool down for a few days. she missed the first day of class after that incendent but was in the next ones, in the same space she was last time. after the class ended i explained to her again that i didnt mean what i said, and if we could do the bench thing again because it was a good time waster. she agreed but said only for a bit.

this time i made double sandwiches (made double sandwiches every day incase she talked to me. wrapped them up in a checkered blanket for her, and bought some really nice cheese) so i tried to be charming and said ""tadaaaa"" with a few sandwiches wrapped up. Again she said no (might she be a norexic? i want to try and help her if so) so i said ""theyre not poison haha, how about just one bite."" (trying to ease her into being comfortable eating around me) she laughed and said maybe another time.

at this point its going a lot better than it was last time, she told me about her sisters (2 sisters), her dog (4 year old jack named russell),why shes doing her courses (psychology, sociology and some other thing) and something personal about herself that i won't share right now.

I start getting excited because she seems really comfortable around me so i try again with the sandwich. ""hungry yet? just one bite"" and i smile. she gets really .. jittery? and puts her arms straight out on her knees and turns forward (she was facing towards me on the same bench), gets up and says if we can do this another time, but said she had fun.

again she didn't even eat. any ideas?",04Oct2017,7
