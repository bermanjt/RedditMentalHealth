1,"My boyfriend has been trying to get a job for one year. He's had just over 10 interviews and got declined for every single one of them. He says that there's nothing wrong with his interview skills, and honestly I don't doubt that. The only problem is that one year. These interviews have all been fairly recently, and he always gets asked ""why have you been doing nothing for (almost) a year"". He just answers ""I've been looking for jobs"", and that looks very bad to the employer. Yes, he could've volunteered somewhere, but I am disabled and he has been taking care of me for quite a while and has been taking benefits for job searching. I told him to stop taking care of me so much and that I'm fine on my own for a while now, and so that's when he started applying for jobs every single day, basically nonstop.

He really wants a job. He gets so sad whenever he gets declined. His most recent interview he thought he was absolutely gonna get the job, he wanted it more than any other he'd applied for and the company seemed really positive about him and his qualifications, but alas, he got declined again, which caused him to have a suicidal mental breakdown.

I can't stand to see him like this anymore, any advice?",02Jun2017,2
3,"i live in North Carolina. I need to get home on saturday but i won't have a ride so i want to take uber. the drive is about 15 minutes and i can pay 20$. if i use the cheapest option, how many miles or minutes will 20$ take me? if 20$ isn't enough, what is the cost of a 15 minute ride?",02Jun2017,2
5,"I live in an apartment building, 3rd floor. The neighbor directly below us uses his AC 6-7 hours a day and it resonates throughout our house. Last night from 2-4 am his AC was turned off and on literally every 3 minutes, I timed it. I confronted him today about it and he said everyone in his house was sleeping before 8, his AC is still on right now and I can hear it. Wtf can I do? I literally feel like kicking his AC off.

If it happens again I'll knock on his door to clarify everyone is sleeping. Do AC units malfunction like this? Or am I being trolled?",02Jun2017,0
9,"So a couple times a week I'll get stiffed on a tip. Usually it's for small orders so I don't think much of it. But I just helped a table of 8 and one person paid the whole bill and didn't tip anything. (They paid with their card and wrote ""0"" under the tip section). I'm in a state where I get no paycheck and make my living off of tips ONLY.

My boyfriend's family have a family event coming up and they want me to take a Friday off so we can all spend a weekend together. I have not asked my boss for the day off yet because I feel a little ashamed about it. I still have two weeks left for that Friday to be here  but I don't want my boss to feel that I'm getting too ahead of myself since I haven't even been there for 90 days, I personally feel that it is more professional after you have been with the company for at least 90 days.

12,"Okay so I'm a sophomore in high shook and I've had this massive crush on this girl for the entire second semester. She's moving away in the summer to another state and I'll probably only see her a couple times more in my life. So since the end of the year is drawing, students who ordered yearbooks are receiving theirs. I'm worried about what I should write in this girl's yearbook. I've been friends with her for all the second semester and we talk fairly often and she might know I like her but I'm not 100% sure. I don't know what to write in her yearbook and it's really making me worry because I don't wanna say something stupid like, ""Have a good summer! I'm gonna miss you next year! :("" or something like that. This is one of the last times I'll ever see her so I don't know what to put. I don't wanna confess everything in her yearbook like how I liked her the entire second semester because that's kinda creepy and weird and I can tell her all this in person or over snapchat or something. I just need help on what I should write in her yearbook.",02Jun2017,1
14,"I have dental insurance, it's apparently decent. I went every 6 months as a minor and now that I've gotten older I've neglected cleanings and getting fillings done due to financial restraints. Ive already lost one adult tooth (very back, figured wisdom tooth would drop down and take its spot)

Anyway I have at least 10 cavities now, amd sure they look like shit, but even when I was a child I would get the same cavities over again before the next appointment 6 months later. 

My plan now was going to be just let them get bad, and eventually get them all pulled and get false teeth before my insurance is lost (I'm on my dads until I'm 26). My insurance will cover dentures.

I just don't know why I should go every 6 months for more fillings that I'll have to fill again in 6 months anyway. It seems like an incredible amount of money to waste when my teeth are already shitty anyway. I have no enamel left due to my childhood diet and bad teeth runs in the family.

Would I be better off to save that money to put toward dentures in a couple years, and occasionally have a tooth pulled along the way? My back tooth on the other side has a hole the size of a qtip and it doesn't hurt but I'd just assume pull it.

Also my teeth are very sensitive and I've used the toothpaste for that forever and it doesn't help. If I eat icecream or sweet foods I have to be careful chewing it or else my teeth will feel like death. So as it is I can't eat what I'd like anyway, and it doesn't get better even after getting a cleaning and having the cavities filled.",02Jun2017,1
16,"Some background on my story, basically dropped out my second semester of sophmore year because of tuition cost (I had lost my scholarship from the previous semester and tuition went up almost 300%), pressure to study medicine, and a few more reasons. That didn't go over particularly well because I lied to them up until this point about doing Physical Therapy as a profession just so I could have the freedom of moving out. That all happened in March, they took my phone, laptop, and my car keys (that they gave me) and I received my phone back so far. They drug tested me twice to find cannabis in my system and I now work cleaning toilets and mopping floors for my dads building. I can go on and on about the kind of shitty situation I have gotten myself into but I just needed a bit of advice on some recent events. Two days ago my friend had brain surgery and the hospital he was in was about 8 minutes from work so I went to go see him after work. I was there for about a half hour before I got a call asking why I didn't tell my mom that I was going to the hospital. I apologized to my dad and told him it won't happen again. I get home and they basically give me the routine of yelling at me and being shunned kind of and it surprised me a bit this time because I honestly didn't think it was that big of deal. Well my attitude got the better of me and I muttered a few things under my breath including 'why does it matter what I do after work?' And that set off another whole session of yelling and stuff. Ended up with me either giving up my phone to them or giving them a way to track me by my iPhone, so I shared my location with my mom 'All the time' and it just really peeved me off. I'm almost 20 and getting treated like I'm 14. I know it isn't that big of difference in years but I feel like things should have started to change after I turned 18. I'm just considering giving them my iPhone and ask them to stop paying for my line as I will go buy my own phone + plan. There is a lot of depth to all this so unless you want to know it all you can stop reading here and give me advice (Thank you). Now this doesn't seem like a big deal to a lot of people like 'cool I was paying my own phone bill since I was 16' kind of thing and I know it's just my parents insisted on paying for everything for my siblings and I (youngest). They paid in full for all my brothers schooling including graduate school(medical school) and my sisters entire undergrad tuition so as you can tell they didn't mind spending money of important things. Obviously that is a good way to manage your finances but we were never ever allowed to splurge any money of theirs whatsover and I know this sounds extremely bratty and spoiled. I am just sick of the lifestyle over the whole money thing, since I've moved back home it's been go to work 9-5, come home and not allowed to go out again or play on my PC and just now recently I'm not allowed to 'relax' in the basement because I could be playing games. I can only relax upstairs in my room now, I have read all my books and I'm sick of Netflix and I just really am so sick of life. What does one do here? If I'm not in my room I have to be in the living room with them watching TV. I'm not even gonna lie I think about suicide way to often and this is kind of why I'm writing this post. I also just want to talk to people though and find out if I'm being a brat by thinking like this or is this not normal ? ",02Jun2017,1
18,"Hey Soo I need some good advice here.I am only 21 years old and  I've been working at this horrible company doing retail for almost 4 years now. I've been working there for awhile to put myself through school and what not, and they happen to give the most hours out of any part time job.(it's incredibly difficult to find a full time job. But that's not the topic at hand). I've worked there almost 4 years and by far am their best worker out of sales staff and am better than 80% of their manager/manager trainee staff(not conceded, it's just fact). I STILL make minimum wage there and only once got a 5 cent raise that was null one the minimum wage law went up 3 months later. Today they tried to ""offer"" me a Part Time Shift Leader position that they just made in the company. Now I put ""offer"" in quotes because they scheduled me for a shift and when I got there they immediatly put me into training for said position. There was no offering to me. They said congratulations and started me. The details of this job are to handle returns and exchanges as well as sell firearms to customers. Well the managers position in our store is to do THREE things: sell firearms, handle returns/exchanges, and tale care of the back office(money handling, books, and whatnot). This new position means I am doing 2/3s of their job. So essentially I received a PROMOTION by being given new responsibilities some of which can make me instantly fireable if messed up. And to top it off they said I'd be scheduled for shifts from 11-730 exclusively on weekends so that they could have managers there less when it is our busiest. Rhis does not even guarantee me any extra hours to work. NO compensation has been made and no OFFER has been extended. Tomorow I have a meeting with our regional manager to talk to him about this. I want this position but I'm done getting walked all over and getting nothing in return. I'm asking for a raise, an extra dollar an hour,(a pretty considrable one for a minimum wage guy) and guaranteed 32-40 hrs per work week(yeah basically full time). Managers make starting $15/hour and I currently make 10.5/hour. What my question is, is am I doing the right thing here? Am I thinking I'm entitles to more fore more work. And if I am doing the right thing, is this enough compensation I am asking for? Or should I ask for even more?",02Jun2017,2
19,"Hey.

I'm turning 19 in about a week and a half. I live with my boyfriend and I have a more than full time job (about 60+ hours a week.) 

Recently I got hit with a slew of problems that I really don't know how to solve. It's becoming way too much, and it's putting me back to my old suicidal thoughts because I really just don't see how to improve things from here. So just to lay all the issues out for you:

1.) my landlord is insane. She broke into my house while I was on vacation and went through all my shit, and when she discovered we had people staying at the house for us she flipped out, accused us of illegally renting out the top floor, and ""evicted"" us (it was not approved by a court, she just taped a piece of paper to our door with a notice. I know it's not legit but I expect a shitstorm at the end of the 30 days, coming up in about a week.) I am not making enough to afford a security deposit + a month of rent elsewhere, so I don't know where I'm going to go.

2.) I found out that my dad is still paying my mom child support for me - about $700 a month. She only spends about $100/month on me (she does pay for my weekly therapy and drives me back and forth to it - but that's about it.) So technically she is stealing money that's supposed to be mine because she doesn't pay any expenses for me since I no longer live at home. She refuses to give any of that money to me and also refuses to allow my dad to stop paying it so that he can help me out. I literally cannot afford groceries sometimes, and she seems to be ok with that.

3.) my boyfriend and I are having some relationship issues. When we stress we tend to take it out on each other. We've both said hurtful things. We barely have sex anymore (sorry tmi) and he barely shows me any affection at this point. I don't want to break up, because I love and care about him. But at this point he feels more like a roommate than anything and we're treating each other like personal punching bags (not literally, we are NOT physically abusive.) I've tried to talk these issues out with him, but he doesn't seem to care (scrolling on his phone while I'm talking to him/calling me names and saying I'm just expecting too much from him.) I don't know how to address our problems anymore, because I don't feel heard or cared about.

And finally, 4.) despite spending most of my life at work, my managers do not seem to respect me. I worked really hard to get this job and even harder to keep it, but they won't increase the size of my section (I'm a waitress, most servers get 4-6 tables and I've been stuck on 3.) Because of this I'm not making enough money to really solve any of the aforementioned problems (my boyfriend was recently let go from his job and is not presently working so I'm covering the bills for two people.)

I don't know what I'm really asking you guys for. I guess just advice in general. I feel really lost, and really wrong. I'm not happy anymore and I can't find the energy to do the things I used to enjoy without just getting frustrated. The odds are all against me right now, and I don't see being able to afford school or a new place or a better job at the moment. I just don't know how to fix this.

I don't need a lot. I don't need a ton of things or a ton of friends. I just want to be an average level of happy. And I don't even remotely have that.

Things is I've never actually shaved any hairs on my ballsack, which I'm thinking I probably should.

22,"Today is my one-month anniversary with my girlfriend. She seems happy with me sometimes, but other times she's just so frustrating and complicated. Today, we had an argument because she said I don't care about her feelings. Every time she seems upset, I repeatedly ask her if she's okay, she says she is, but she never tells me what's wrong. She also called me a liar, and says I don't want our relationship. That's a complete lie, I rack my brain daily looking for ways to improve it. And then she goes on how I don't talk to her enough, it's not my fault I can't stay by my phone 24/7 or come over her house all the time. She says next time, just leave permanently. I don't want to break up with her, she's the only person who can make me smile without hesitation. I enjoy her company so much, every second of it. Is it just teenage hormones? Am I really a liar? Who's in the right? At this point, I'm done trying. I'm using to being labeled negatively.

24,"I have an anxiety disorder and I see a therapist once a week. I've brought this up a few times but it doesn't seem to go anywhere, so here I am, hoping Reddit can help give me some tips to overcome this.
I have an extreme fear of my parents dying, in particular my dad (which is weird because my mom is the one who had cancer and a plethora of other health concerns). It has gotten to the point where I think about it at least 5-10 times a day. Sometimes I work myself up into full blown panic attacks just indulging in these scenarios I create in my head. 
Additionally, if I'm home and my dad so much as coughs in the other room, I will literally drop what I'm doing and run to him. Sometimes right before I get to him I have this moment of pause where I stop and think ""am I prepared to see what I'm about to see"" as if I am absolutely sure I am about to find his dead body. And in extreme cases my body will actually start shaking uncontrollably, taking up to an hour to stop even after I've been assured he's okay. 
I feel like this fear is ruining my life. I know it's irrational and I know that it's also useless. And that it's stupid to live the scenarios out before it happens because I'm really just creating suffering before the inevitable suffering even occurs. I want to free myself but I simply can't.
I'm currently in New York with my mom for a few days and my dad's at home in Toronto. I'm lying in my hotel bed wishing I could sleep but being consumed by the idea that something terrible could be happening to him right now. 
I know I can't be the only one who feels this way and I don't want to be that person who when my dad does pass that I say I spent years anticipating and fearing something I had no control over the whole time. 
It would be awesome if someone could help me find some ways to combat my distress. Thanks in advance.

26,"I'm currently in a relatively small friend group that has lasted for a few years. These guys have been pretty awesome to me, and I'm really glad that we've shared the experiences we have had. Of course, over time, things happen. For instance, we've lost a couple of friends in our group to conflict or life advancement. This is part of life, and I'm afraid that this will be happening again. 

A couple of years ago, my best friend (another group member who's been with me since the beginning) started dating someone.  We'll call her A. We were happy for him. I still am, in fact, because he seems more lively these days. After they started dating, A became more initiated into our group. She is an awesome person, and she has been a great friend over these last two years. 

Over the last few months, though, things have gotten a little more complicated between us. Although we've had some great memories, we've also had some not so great ones. A and I have gotten into a few fights over some small things, such as an accidental insult thrown my way or some miscommunication that made her upset. I figured at first that this was normal because friends get into arguments sometimes. Overtime, though, I've started to feel down about this kind of thing happening, especially with how often it is occurring. I've gotten a painful feeling that occurs when I feel that something is off.

Today, we hung out with the group. It was going pretty well. We all go out to get some dinner, and she seems more quiet than usual. I ask A if she is okay, and she responds that she is. I start to get a painful feeling in my chest, but I push it off and resume with our overall conversation. At some point, I thought I saw something in her teeth, and I ask if I can see her teeth. I know now that this is very creepy, and I hope to improve myself with not being so. Anyways, after this question was asked, she didn't respond. After this, A didn't respond well to me for the rest of the night. I want to mention that she has been pretty stressful over the last couple of weeks because of things in her life, but I don't know how much that influenced this. I eventually asked her if we could talk because I could tell something was wrong. She told me no, and she walked away. 

My hunch was right, and I think that she is mad or annoyed with me again. I haven't finalized this as the truth, so I need to figure out what is happening. However, I'm tired of this happening so much. I've questioned before if it was a good idea to continue our friendship, and I'm doing this again. I really want to be friends and laugh together and have fun, but I don't know if this is a good idea.

Right now, I'm considering ending our friendship, but I don't know how it will affect the group. Things will shift, and it could even get awkward. I've considered the following from my perspective if our relationship ended: 

-I should notify the group or let them know of the situation. This could help adjust any awkwardness, but it makes things harder on the overall group. 

-I should leave the group. I've had a great history with my friends, and I don't want to leave this behind. It would hurt, but I'm considering this option. 

-I would need to talk to A to see how everything will work out. Although it will be difficult, we can negotiate how to go about the group. 

If we stay friends, then the following could apply: 

-I would need to talk to A to discuss this problem and the quality of our friendship. I find it is important to fight for relationships, but some battles can't be won.

-I would ignore these problems and let everything remain. We'd eventually talk whenever she is ready, but if things continue between us, I'd be afraid to do anything more. 

-I would ignore her from now on. I don't think this option is effective for either of us, but it is an option. 

I've thought about this before, but I figured that I should really consider what's been happening and move forward. Has anyone else been in a situation like this before? If so, what have you done? Would you consider one of the options above, or did you do something else? How did it turn out? And finally, what do you think I should do? Thank you very much for reading this, and I appreciate you spending the time to go through this passage. If you need any more context, I will try to give you as much as I feel appropriate. 

TL;DR Friend and I have a history together within a group, but things have changed recently. I am thinking about ending our relationship, but I don't know if this a good idea or not. Im afraid this decision will affect the group. I'm looking for advice on what others have done and what they would recommend doing. ",02Jun2017,2
27,"Sorry this may be a tad long, just really curious what you great people think I should do.

My girlfriend is in desperate need of a new car. Current one is old and has issues. So after doing online searches we came across two possible used options at a local dealership in town. The first car we test drove was more in favor of the things we wanted(low mileage, newer than 2010 and as much under 10k as possible). First one wasn't a huge success so we continued looking with our salesman offering 2 other vehicles comparable to what we are after. One of those 2 being a 2009 Nissan Altima 2.5 S. Not a bad car but has almost 100k mileage and makes a slight noise when accelerating but the girlfriend loved it. 
As we're debating and decidedly chose to leave after being there for a few hours our salesman tells us that he's just gotten wind of a car that was just brought to the dealership that may be what we're after. The only catch was that it was still in initial maintenance and we would not be allowed inside or to test drive. So we said ok let's take a look. We walk over to the service area and it is a 2012 Hyundai Accent with 60k miles. Now as we're headed over we're told it's pushing our 10k budget but we were more lenient because of the model year and lower mileage. While looking over the car the salesman mentions they ""purchased"" the car from a ""sister"" lot. And lo and behold in the front seat there is the sales tag, from said ""sister"" lot and much to my surprise they were selling it for under 8k! What a price difference from the 7k range up to their price of 10k!
So I immediately tell him that I'm not paying higher than that sticker price because how can you show me one price and then try to sell me on another. He said that it must've been a mistake and that the 10k price was correct. So I said we were going to just leave and not come back. He asks us to come back inside and that he would have a word with his sales manager. I tell him that if they honor our trade in price and the price on the tag in the car that we would take it. So he talks with his manager for roughly 10 minutes and comes back with a smile on his face and says ""we will gladly see you tomorrow evening"". 

Cut to next evening, we head back over with every intention to purchase the car. As soon as we arrive he tells us that the car we wanted and specifically agreed to come back in for has been sold. I asked how that happened when it had only been posted online that morning and that we agreed to come in for it. And he simply replied that he didn't know, to which I angrily asked why he didn't tell us this when he called earlier to confirm us coming in. 
Out walks sales manager who right away says ""sorry guys the car has been picked up, but if you'd like I can run the numbers on the altima for you."" As I'm asking questions about how the car that I can clearly see on the lot was sold they continued to pressure us about ""running the numbers"", so I said we would think about it and we left. 
Being that I'm not a moron I had a very strong suspicion they were lying to us because they didn't want to honor the price they agreed upon. So I decided to call in, as someone else and inquire about the car. 
I spoke with a sales rep about the car and he gladly tells me that the car is on the lot and is available once it is finished getting serviced. I specifically asked about stock number and vin to verify that we were talking about the same car that the manager told me was sold from under me. I asked if anyone had placed a hold or came by to look at it and he says ""no you're the only person as it's a new to their lot vehicle.""

I recorded this conversation. 

I want to know Reddit, what do you think I can/should do about this? She really likes both cars but I don't want to give them my business, but I also don't want them to get away with it. I want them to either honor the price for the Hyundai or give us a better sale on the Altima. ",02Jun2017,2

35,"This is my scenario, a couple years ago I moved into my friends-parents cottage next to their house. I'm not a person who makes a lot of money, and my rent is incredibly inexpensive, ridiculously cheap compared to the area I'm in. It also, facilitates me, as a musician to play loud music and rehearse at my home, saving me money on renting rehearsal space. It's the golden handcuffs of, having seemingly the perfect spot, not being able to afford anything else, and not having enough money to move out. I don't have a written lease, and I pay my rent in cash every month (yes, I know this is foolish.) 

My landlords, are an unhappily married couple, who over the last few years, I've watched their marriage deteriorate. The husband, while I can't prove any physical harm, is a pretty textbook abuser. Financially controls the wife by making her sign over all paychecks, verbally abusive and manipulative, constantly accuses her of things she hasn't done, distances her from her family and friends, governs the home with fear and intimidation, ect. ect.

This wasn't something clear and apparent when I moved in, or I would have never moved in, but has escalated from occasional fighting to really crazy shit. 

The wife kind of gave me a heads up about 3 months ago that she was bailing out and skipping town. Which she did for about a few weeks, when she went to go live at HIS parents house, who also agree he's a huge shithead, before, (and forgive me here because this is where the details are pretty murky) I think he went and got her and made her comeback. 

My relationship with him however is way different. I've never felt intimidated, and my safety has never been affected at all. Other than the fact I occasionally overhear them arguing, it's never affected me. He's always been pretty friendly and personable with me. Actually, when she was gone he seemed the cheeryist and seemed the most happy he's been in years. We shoot the shit, and he seems genuinely interested in whats going on in my life. We're not ""buds"" but have a pretty good Landlord/Tenet relationship. But it really felt like all the animosity had lifted from the house and with her gone. 

Since she's been back shit has been REALLY hectic. She's lost her job, because he hid her keys so she couldn't go to work, then blames her for losing them (he's done this with her cellphones before too.) I recognize this as just another manipulative tactic to keep her financially dependent. Hostilities are at a fever pitch. 

My rent is due today (Thursday) but I don't get paid until Saturday (paying the rent within a window of about a week has never been an issue.) She came to my door last night, (because he had locked her out of the house again,) and gave me the scoop she was going to bail for good, and when I get the rent just give it to her to help her skip town with, Which I agreed to, and encouraged. Paying either of them has never been an issue, although he always ends up with it. Today the husband came knocking on my door, asking if I had rent, I told him the situation with me getting paid Saturday which he was entirely fine with, but told me, under no circumstances was I to give the rent to his wife. 

My gut says just give her the money, which isn't a lot, but will start her on her way. On the other hand, I really don't want to draw the ire of the husband. Like I mentioned before. I only have a verbal lease, I have all my mail sent to a PO Box, other than all my shit being here, there's nothing that proves I actually live here, and I feel like I have no protection under the law (and for the sake of anonymity, let's say, I live in California and that might be all the specifics I want to get into.) There's nothing from stopping him from throwing all my shit to the curb. 

I've thought about just up and moving myself out of this situation entirely. I don't mind moving all my shit into storage and living out of my car, but at the same time, although, I'm kind of fearful of what happens to her if I move out. 

I don't see any out that isn't the worst case scenario. I think If I tried to connect her with a women's group/shelter, she would not be game for the idea, and If I tried to pass off any info on the topic, he would find it/get to it first and it would complicate everything. 

Ideas, advice, anything is appreciated.

36,"I had a friend that I met early on in college. We were inseparable for a good year or two but over time she seemed to take more than she gave and it wore on me. I think a large part about that was immaturity as she was younger than me (only by 2 years but still). We did end up living together but grew apart and she wasn't the best roommate. Things got pissy and passive aggressive. After living in the house for 2 years, she moved out early to accept an internship elsewhere. This left my other roommate and I to deep clean the whole house. When it came time to distribute our security deposit, we told the other girl that we thought it was fair to give her slightly less since the deposit was only being returned because of the cleaning we did, which she had no part in. This resulted in a absolute shitstorm. We ended up splitting the deposit evenly because the conflict wasn't worth it, and we haven't spoken since. But, as the years have passed I've started to realize that there's always two sides of a story and that I could have been better in some ways as well. I've been wanting to reach out to her to check in, but I'm not sure if I should or not. I'm not really even sure why I want to reach out, but I've thought about it now multiple times. I even wrote out a message but then became fearful that she would think the message was weird, so I never sent it. Help!",02Jun2017,1
37,"My family, mostly my mother, has issues with boundaries and saying mean inappropriate things. Growing up with and around this kind of behavior I have become immune and don't even expect an apology. Mostly our family just acts like nothing happened, understandably my husband hasn't had the same reactions. I used to try to be around and do anything and everything for everyone in my family, but my availability to them changed when my husband and I started our own life and family, they resent him for that. I miss spending the time with them and it hurts me to know they struggle and I can't help as much. About 2-3 years ago we started making changes in our oldests son's diet, bedtime, and consequences for bad behavior which all helped him greatly.  My mother started throwing accusations that we were being too strict with our oldest, that it was child abuse. She would wait until we were not around to ask him if he was happy, and questions like that. She was pretty much abandoned by her mother for a new husband and family. She was sexually abused a few times and was in abusive relationships, so I understand her skepticism and her fear to a point. But every time she came to visit our son would become sad and act out. She would accuse my husband of being too strict to the point of abuse and of me ""loving my husband so much"" that I allow him to do so. It had been tense but it blew up when we stopped allowing our son to be alone with her, even on a small car ride to a restaurant we were all headed to, she lost it! Made a huge scene, told my husband he didn't love our son, all kinds of other stuff. We went no contact for a while, until about 6 months ago when I started talking to my mother, she has yet to apologize, waited over a year, to say ""no regrets, no hard feelings, let's be friends"" and then trying to call him to apologize but he blew her off and said he'd call back but hasn't. I'm lost as to what I can do to not fight with my husband any time my family is mentioned, I want to spend time with my family but I also don't want to hurt my husband's feelings. I want to give my mother the benefit of the doubt that she won't be that way with our son or my husband, but he doesn't even want to give her a chance, which makes me sad but I also understand.

We're both sophomores in high school. I've known him for a better part of a year, and he's always been outgoing, extroverted, joyous, etc. Only bad qualities: sometimes he doesn't take things seriously. Plus his childhood was rough (foster families) so there's that.
I went on a week long trip last week, and we kept talking throughout. We got in a minor argument near the end, but it seemed normal cause he didn't act any different after.
Suddenly when I return, he never does what he used to. He used to seek his friends out to talk, and would constantly keep in touch. But now, his messages are aloof, superficial, and they seem insincere.
Should I confront him or let it be? If so, how? I know he has family issues like I said before, but I'm not sure the extent of it.

I have never worked somewhere where I literally dread waking up and going there. On my days off I count my hours like they are moments of life left.

Only problem is, I could not leave this job and come back to it. I am currently in the probationary period as I just was hired on from a temp service. And I have not fought in two years because of a mistake I had made. I was an amateur golden globes champion, title champion, and junior olympic gold medalist.

62,"TL;DR - I'm an introvert that hates small talk, parties, dancing, and night life. My wife says I'm boring and that she's looking for exitement.

Long Story
Wife and I met online during college. Talked for 2 years, finally met in person and hit it off. Our relationship was formed around evening walks, quiet lengthy talks, and passionate sex. We finished school, got good jobs, got married, and purchased a house. Both 30, no kids and no plans. 

My wife says I'm boring because I rarely plan anything. We literally have no friends, and don't talk to family. Her life wasn't always like this. She had numerous friends in college, many alpha male type friends, and have many exciting evening escapades: sex with strangers, alcohol and drugs with friends, lots of house parties and dancing, and even one admitted lesbian encounter. 

I was always the outlet that satisfied the opposite part of her; the insightful discussive type, the mental adventurer and the healer. This worked well when we dated and used me to escape to a more stable territory, or at least provide balance. The problem is, after 5 years of marriage ; there's no more balance. We literally have zero friends and we despise our families. 

It seems the expectation is that I wear every hat imaginable; husband, friend, boyfriend, therapist, care taker, household handy man, vehicle mechanic, alpha male, etc. I don't wear all these hats well, if at all, and it's become a problem. In fact, my wife said recently that ""boring people like [me] are the reason wives seek out boyfriends."" 

I've never been one to dance or plan social events, but what can I do to restore health balance in our marriage and add some excitement without the obligation of wearing every hat well? Do women truly expect their spouse to wear all these hats or does my wife just have skewed expectations? What do normal healthy marriages look like!? HELP ME.  ",02Jun2017,28
64,"Hello guys, It's my first time on this subreddit.

I recently graduated from college, and while writing my final thesis I was really excited with my career prospect and my master's degree project. My teachers and collegues were all excited too with my career plans and I guess they all thought I had talent for the field I was aiming.

So, after my graduation, I thought to myself it was a good ideia to take a break and relax for a bit, maybe for 2 weeks, before going back to focusing on my career plans... But now I can't go back, and I don't know why.

It's been 3 months and I can't bring myself to get out of my house and do stuff. Out of nowhere I'm all depressed and with zero mood to write anything... I literally know what I have to do, and I know I still have some time so I don't lose my window of opportunity, but I can't bring myself to do it.

I don't get it, I was really excited with my graduation and my career plans, but now the only reason I get out of bed is to eat and play videogames! Every time I tried to write something I froze with anxiety and stared at my computer screen for half an hour. Everytime I get more depressed for being depressed, while I don't even know if I'm really depressed or if it's just an excuse I'm giving myself so I can go on with this and do nothing, as a way to avoid failing.

My ""problem"" is that I'm not sure if I care ""too much"" or something. I constantly worry myself (sometimes to actual tears, stress, anxiety attacks) about them and whether they're okay. And while I know worrying isn't necessarily a problem, I know that there isn't actually anything I can do for any of these people. In most cases, it'd probably be something like money. But I can't afford to offer any. I recently visited them (as I haven't seen them in a good 5 years or so now) and helped keep their house tidy, cooked for them, etc. Because they both work all the time. They have a lot of bad luck though, it seems.

81,"So first off, I should say I'm liberal, and my grandparents (like most of the rest of my family) are conservatives. I'm ok with this. That's not the problem. 
The problem is my grandparents have decided the reason I'm liberal is due to a series of brainwashings. First, in high school brainwashing by the ""liberal media"", then in college by my ""liberal university"" (that they paid for?!), and now, most infuriatingly, by the Japanese, since living in Japan for a year apparently makes me ""closer to being Japanese"" than being raised in America for 22 years does. And thus having been brainwashed, I am not allowed to voice any liberal or possibly liberal opinions in front of them. 

This infuriates me to no end, because even if it's just that they don't want to hear a different view (sad, but whatever, you're 70+ and family I can shut my trap for the sake of keeping the peace), this ""brainwashed"" wording takes away all agency from me. Even if they don't realize it, they're saying I'm incapable of having formed my own opinion.

I'm not out to change their minds. I just want them to acknowledge me as capable of having formed (admittedly different) opinions of my own volition as a result of considering the evidence with my own will. 

Any advice on how to communicate this to them?

Keeping silent isn't a option sadly because their favorite game is ""poke the liberal"", where they seek me out anytime they hear a new way to attack a liberal position. If I remain silent to their taunts (as ordered), I'm berated for being too serious and ""God we were just joking, can't you take a joke???"" but if I respond they get mad because I broke the rule and expressed an opinion.

So if anyone has advice on how to break this cycle, please help. I want to stress because this is reddit that I really don't care about the political part as much as I want my grandparents to treat me like a autonomous human being.

87,"I work for a non-profit organization here in the United Kingdom [but I can't say much about what I do due to the Data Protection Act 1998].

A friend of mine had been considering hiring a local celebrity [who lives in the county - by British definition of a county, not the U.S. description] to make an appearance at an event the NPO may be holding in the future but we are unsure of how to write a formal letter to a celebrity. There are legitimate reasons why such a celebrity would come [cannot really say much other than she is a model, and that's it. She's not an A-lister, only known in our county, would this qualify very low on a celebrity list?].

The NPO works with vulnerable adults [disabled] and has had some publicity around 2013-2014 and also in the mid-2000s [not saying who or where I work though]. However, I worry that may not be ""sexy enough"" for a celebrity [based on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3m2q2e/desperate_to_help_fulfill_my_dying_moms_top/cvbi60o/).

As far as I know she [the celebrity who is the model] doesn't have management etc. - only a Purestorm profile and personal website.

I've removed details about where I work for privacy and anonymity.

How should we approach the celebrity's agent with a formal letter [well, email written in the style of a formal letter] with a proposal?

Obviously - this has to go through management, but there has been other celebrities making appearances before in the early 2010s, but if management approve, how would or should we approach them directly?

101,"I started a new job at a grocery store and the safety procedure for a dangerous situation (armed robbery, violent person, etc.) is to page a code-word and every available employee (probably 15-20 people, on average) comes to your location. I understand why this would be helpful for removing a problematic but harmless drunk person or something, but in an actual armed situation I feel like this could cause a lot of deaths (spook the person, trigger a rampage, or otherwise escalate the situation).

I'm just a really low level employee though, so I don't know how to go about this. I am finding it difficult to put together something very coherent (it might take a week or two), but everything I've found seems to say to call for emergency help and focus very hard on deescalation - the opposite of our policy. I am just wondering if someone can give me help on how to go about this: who to talk  to (HR maybe? My union rep? My manager is so lazy and useless I doubt she would help at all and I don't know who her boss is), what to say, and how to design a well-informed safety procedure for a violent/emergency situation.",02Jun2017,2

105,"My fiancé has been working at an off license for 2 years. He has been Assistant Manager for over a year. Before he and I got together, he was treated with respect by all his coworkers, except for one who was annoyed she didn't get the Assistant Manager job, and he really loved his job. 

When he moved in with me, he ended up having to travel 2 hours every day to and from work. As a result, he had to ask his manager to stop giving g him 7pm-10pm shifts, as he would be travelling 4 hours total for a 3 hour shift, and asked if it was possible she reduced the amount of evening shifts (in til 10pm) he got, as he would often struggle to get transport back home and he would have to get the last bus back, which became difficult when the buses were often late. His manager complied, as she knew he was a hard worker. He usually only had 1 evening shift a week, which he was fine with, and all was going well as he started trying to find a new job closer to home. 

In February, the manager's daughter in law who also works at the shop, texted my fiancé on a day he had booked off in September and told him to go in and work for her. My fiancé had booked the day off to go to a concert with someone he no longer was friends with, so he didn't have any actual plans that evening other than just chilling with me. He considered saying ""okay"" and doing her shift, but the way she had ordered him instead of asking him to do the shift, and hadn't given him a reason why she couldn't do it, he said no. That's where his problems started. 

The daughter-in-law (we'll call her Jordan) was furious my fiancé refused to do her shift, bearing in mind he had food poisoning the weekend before and had asked her nicely to do his shift because he was so unwell, and she pretended not to know who the texts were from (even though she'd texted him the day prior, and only having to work with one man in the shop, who is my fiancé), and started slagging my fiancé off to his other coworkers, saying he was being snotty with her all the time and acting like he's above her - which he is, but he's never acted like anything more than just another employee.  Jordan was notorious for showing up late to work, without reason, and for doing the bare minimum whilst there, spending her time there eating, smoking, or texting instead. So as revenge against my fiancé she got worse. She would show up so late that he would miss the bus that only showed up once an hour if he was lucky. She would stand outside smoking until well after her shift started, laughing at the huge queue that was forming. 

My fiancé got sick of it, and the fact that the other employees no longer talked to him because of her slander, and decided to report her to his manager. His manager (we'll call her Pat) hired Jordan against the shop owner's wishes a year prior, promising to not let her get away with anything. However, upon my fiancé putting in the complaint, Pat began yelling at him, saying that he had been rude and disrespectful to Jordan, and that she was working hard whilst he didn't do any work. He asked her to check the CCTV to see what Jordan was doing, and she refused. To top it off, Pat told Jordan about what he had said, and Jordan just go worse. 

Since then, he's out in 5 complaints about Jordan. She began screaming at him in front of customers, who adore my fiancé for how kind he is, recently, as had Pat, for being a liar and for being lazy. His coworkers aren't talking to him, and he feels suicidal whenever he's at work. He can't find any other work, and he has applied to every job he has seen an opening for. The shop gets transferred over to a new owner this week, and he is going to ask for a transfer himself to one of the closer stores. He is being bullied out of his job, and he is so hurt by it all. He doesn't want Jordan and Pat to get away with what they're doing, and he understands that if he can't get the transfer he'll be there much longer and it's really killing him, but he doesn't want to put in the complaint whilst he is still working there as he knows he will be treated even worse if Jordan is fired. He can't quit, as he is paying £30 a week to my parents and needs the income. I'm so worried, and I don't know what he can do. Any advice is needed, please help. ",02Jun2017,7

107,So I've been living with my grandma for my whole life and our income has gone down around $1100 in the last two years.  We make about $1200 a month (definitely not enough to get by) and we're currently $4000 behind on rent.  Our landlord has been super nice over the last few months but he wants us out in the next few days so our debt doesn't get any higher.  We do have a voucher for section 8 but there are absolutely no houses my grandma can afford even with it.  I'll be moving to my mother's so my grandma can use her section 8 voucher for a new place. We're supposed to be out very soon and we have less than $800 to do so.  The brakes on our car are messed up because of my sister taking it out and not being responsible.

109,"I know that this is a very long shot, but desperate times call for desperate measures. I recently got 4 used tires put on my car (after 2 of them blew out at the same time). They're in better shape than my old tires, but they're incredibly bald. When driving on wet roads, I can't even exceed 50 mph (80 kmh for those of you from across the pond). If I *do* exceed that speed, I can feel my car sliding and drifting all over the road. It's actually difficult to stay in my lane and to avoid hydroplaning or spinning out. I have to focus on not dying every time it rains. It's not just when there's standing water -- it's when the roads simply get wet. I don't currently work due to an injury that I sustained while in the Marine Corps, and I've (foolishly) declined any and all monetary assistance from the VA (Veterans Administration) because I feel as though there are veterans out there who need it more than I do. So, does any one have any ideas as to how someone who's broke and has no income can get a new set of tires?

113,"This is going to be really hard, because I don't know her well, and I have very limited information.

I met this girl on tinder, lets call her Jade. We matched right before she left my area so she lives half the country away. We've talked a total of 2 days before now. Today she was acting really distressed. She didn't want to tell me why, but did tell me she's suffer from depression, anxiety, and  has been suicidal since her was 13. She's seen a therapst we she was younger, and then on and off, and now I think she only sees a counselor when she's at college. Her dad doesn't want to pay for it during the summer. Finally she told me her dad beat her up and got on top of her and bashed he head. From what I've gathered, this sort of thing has happened before but its not a regular thing. She says she hasn't been hit recently. She relies on her father for shelter clothes, food, college, everything. I suggested calling the police and she said that If he has an assault charge, he would be able to run his business which would end in her being homeless. We she was younger, her therapist called child services but they concluded that he just had an angry night (which I find unbelievable). She's told me the nearest womens shelter is too far for her to get to on her own, she has no family in the states, and shes leaving with her dad and family on a 3 week vacation in 2 day.

114,"So, me and 2 other friends want to go to [Pictured Rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictured_Rocks_National_Lakeshore) on a 2-3 day trip. For reference, we live in the Lansing area of Michigan, and Pictured Rocks is in the Upper Peninsula. I am 17, and both my friends are 16. 

Now, we have yet to make a plan. Like, all we have are concepts. We *know* that we have at *least* $300 dollars to use, $100 from me, and my friend says his parents owe him $200. We've divided our spending into 4 categories:

1. Gas. This shouldn't be a huge issue if I'm to take my 2015 Chevy Equinox. Doing the math, I believe it will be about $70 both ways if we only go to PR (but we do plan to stop at other places, like a [bear ranch](http://www.michigan.org/property/oswald-s-bear-ranch), and maybe some waterfalls.

2. Food. I think eating out once a day at some novelty restaurants such as [Bear Trap Inn] (http://www.michigan.org/property/bear-trap-inn) would be cost-effective. For the rest of the trip we could probably pack a bunch of food to munch on as we travel.

3. Lodging. This one's a bit tricky. Ideally, we would like to spend some time in a hotel, but that's expensive. If push comes to shove, sleeping in the car IS an option, albeit an uncomfortable one. I suggested camping, but my friend isn't too fond of that.             ***EDIT***: On top of that, I believe that there is a minimum age that you have to be to check in, so that adds another potential wrench into the plan (or lack thereof). 

4. Tours/souvenirs. This can potentially both the least and the most expensive. Kayak tours at PR can go for like $125 per person, so that's not an option, unless we find a cheaper service. I'm not too fond of souvenirs myself, as I treasure the experience more, but I can't speak for my friends.

Then there's the fact of convincing my Parents. Obviously, I need to show that I have a plan and I have the means to execute said plan. I imagine both of my friends would get the OK from their folks and may even be able to get cash from them. 

So basically, I need a plan. If anyone is familiar with the route we plan to take and know any cost-effective places to stay/eat, It would be greatly appreciated to hear from you!",02Jun2017,1

We hurt each other, she keeps on trying to change for me, but she has taken a stand and is telling me that I either start being more patient with her (ie not snapping, not getting angry that easily) or we break up.


I cherish this girl, and honestly, she's right. I have no patience for her BS anymore, and this wasn't the case a few months back. I know exactly what attitudes of her bother me, and I told her so. But even if she changes (and she did, a lot) I still have no patience.

119,"I'm 24, married, and an undergrad. I probably play videogames 2+ hours a day so it's easy to say I play a lot. Am I Addicted? Maybe. I have no problem not playing if I'm not around games or if I'm with company. However, if I'm at home you can bet I'm playing games. I'll even put off homework for games.

Gaming has been a huge part of my life ever since I was young. It was my way of escaping a bad life and visualizing things I could never experience myself. It was how my friends and I bonded in high school and I would go so far to say that video games have even taught me more than some of my classes have, both in HS and college. You can see as to why I am reluctant to give it up. It's a large part of my life. Not just a hobby or addiction, but a literal life building tool that I have used for nearly 2 decades. 

It makes me happy and gives me a sense of fulfillment. That is until I see that my personal skills could possibly be better for it. I'm an amateur artist, but my art work suffers because of video games. Significantly. I don't make money off of art and never plan to so it may be a useless skill to me, and my degree even gravitates more towards video games than art (it is interactive media design). 

My wife is very supportive of gaming too. If it bothers her, she doesn't show it. I've asked her countless times if it does and she has never wanted me to give it up. She even tried talking me out of selling my games and console, but said the decision was ultimately mine, as it was almost all an anniversary gift. 

We are moving in August because I am transferring to a larger school. We are aiming to have a total of $3000  saved by then to help with the move and I have offers for $500 on what I'm selling (it's worth it). We have $2500 so that would top it off for us. We would then have our set amount and everything else would simply be extra saved. 

I truly don't know what to do. 

On one hand, an extra $500 to top is off would be great. No games would also mean I have more time to draw and paint as well as read a book or two, as well no homework distractions.

On the other hand, they're a part of my past and quite possibly my future. They're a defining part of myself. They help me relax and enjoy the impossible. They help me connect to my friends on the other side of the state and allow me to meet new people that I would otherwise never meet. 

I would appreciate testimonials from those of you who have done this and how it worked out for you, as well as what you believe I should do in my situation. 

No biased opinions just because you hate/love video games.

126,"I'm not exactly sure where to start because this is a long story, but I'll try my best to put in the important details. It all started when I met a coworker of my gf. He seemed like your average guy when I first met him, so we hit it off pretty well. We started hanging out on weekends and whatnot and we had a lot of similar interests and I had no problem with him at all besides the fact that he is a little beyond cocky. He then introduced me to some of his friends and I met some other guys who are just awesome positive people to be around and so his friends soon became my friends because even though I'm a little different, I'm really easy to get along with. He then introduced me to some people who work at an engineering firm that he was working at and they liked me enough that they offered me a job as well. Everything seemed like my life was going in the right direction was spending time with the right people. Then things started taking a weird turn. He started treating me like he was better than me and constantly bragging about how great his life was and so on and so forth. Then he started dating a mutual friend of me and my gf. I found out that he was cheating on her with another girl and made no attempt to hide it when he spent time with me and our friends and it made me really uncomfortabl,e so I brought it up to him and said that maybe he should keep his relationship stuff away from us because if he wants to cheat on a friend of mine it would be wrong for me to kind of support it by not saying anything to her. Our friends agreed with me too. He blew up on me saying that he thought we were friends and that he could be himself around his friends and not have to worry about ""dealing with this shit"" when he was around us. So he continued his infidelity and I felt obligated to my friend to tell her so I did. He told her that I made all of it up and and I'm trying to ruin his relationships (even though I have no motive to try do anything besides be honest). Then he stopped talking to me and hanging out with me and my/his friends and blamed me for ""fucking with his life"". Then he started shit talking me behind my back and going on about how I'm a pussy and he could kick my ass and how I made everything up to try and ruin his life. My/his friends have almost cut all ties with him and have been really great to me but everywhere I go this guy is constantly talking bsit to try and fuck with me. So now I'm in a position where I work with a guy so toxic I can't even fully explain to its full extent, who is actively trying to make me look like the devil on steroids at work and in my circle of friends. The advice I need is how to confront this issue and get him to stop his bullshit and just be a normal human being. Normally I would just kick his ass and force him to own up to his shit, but I've a more positive turn with my life in the last couple of years and I want to see if I can handle this differently from how I would if I let my anger take control.

I was in alternative education for two years, during which times my tics toned down and I stopped them at school, I started to pay more attention to fashion and makeup and the like, so I looked more like a normal teen girl returning as a Sophomore, though I was still awkward and scripted. I still had issues with reciprocity and eye contact but I looked presentable, even pretty, as people have told me.

This boy came back to my school after a few years moved away when I was a Junior and he was a Sophomore.

134,"So, my boyfriend is currently a QA supervisor at a small factory. He has been there about 1 year and has told me the following.

1. Due to the termination of a supervisor of another department, he is now overseeing people in a department he is not experienced in nor was in his job description, as well as his previous work tasks.

2. His attempts to promote or suggest promotions of employees with relevant experience in that department to team lead positions so he has breathing room to get his other mission critical job tasks done have fallen on deaf ears. He feels like he needs to do 5 things at once.

3. The department employees in question have en mass asked for a raise 2 times now. He has filed the paperwork and training records of eligible employees as requested with management and, I quote, ""was laughed at"". Employees are not happy.

4. Upper management has repeatedly refered to hourly employees as ""losers""

5. Upper management is steadily increasing his work load and job tasks to things well outside his job description. My boyfriend says he feels like he is the assistant plant manager at times.

6. He continues to receive work related calls and requests from upper management during his off hours, multiple times while he was sleeping or out with family. He can no longer schedule personal responsibilitys due to an ever shifting work schedule and inconsistent work hours

7. Over the course of several months I have noticed his temperament is souring and he is getting much more miserable over time.

8. Critical work related equipment he needs to do his job has not been replaced, despite numerous requests (item in question costs under 250$) jeopardizing the quality and legal compliance of his work.

9. Accusations have come to his attention that employees are being asked and forced to work overtime without being compensated properly.

10. He is aware of rumblings about multiple critical employees leaving en mass because of poor work conditions.

----

Because of all of this, he is in the market for a new job of course. His complaints and concerns have fallen on deaf ears with management and he feels that he is being taken advantage of and working for a highly unprofessional and unethical company. 

My position has been to advise him to consult and start a running record with corporate ethics and HR to get this issue on record and on file, as well as assisting him in the new job search. He has not to my knowledge contacted HR about this issue yet as he is still working on documenting the situation and running through how to phrase this properly.

I have also been consoling him the best I can as he sounds about ready to have a nervous breakdown. And I am doing my best to help him wind down after work, so that he doesn't have *more* to do when he's home if I can help it. I have been very understanding about the situation and I'm doing my best to help him job hunt as he needs to be out of that facility as soon as possible.

Our situation is not conducive to single income, but I am consciously cutting back on expenses so that if he up and quits without another job lined up (which is not his plan but people can only be pushed so far) I can bear the financial weight for a while until he is back working again.

My efforts seem to be helping, but I want to do more and it severely pains me to see him so miserable day after day. I absolutely hate seeing him like this and the root cause is this damn soulsucking job he has gotten himself into.

What more could I do to help? And what other advice could I give him to help ease his situation? How should he broach discussing this job with his next employer?


Any ideas for a relaxing weekend to unwind him as much as possible? I want to surprise him and give him something that will really help him forget his issues and clear his head before he has a breakdown.

How expensive would a *high quality* spa weekend be? Is it hard to learn how to massage? Are there supplements or teas or herbal relaxation things that can help him unwind?

I had been working as a team leader in a reservations sales department for 3 years. I didn't really LOVE the job, it was very tiring at times. It did have some pros though, especially when I got promoted to team leader (I liked managing people). But I loved my colleagues, we really clicked together- it was a fun, young team and we really were like a family. When I announced I got promoted and I'm leaving to another office, some were even crying. I needed to do it in order to reach my dreams though...

Anyway...

The job I have right now is business analysis (or data analysis, whatever you prefer to call it), and I really like the job itself. It makes me use my strengths and I have learnt so much in 3 months... unbeliavebly so.

But... the new office is FILLED with old, boring, normal people, who got stuck in their career and are happy with it, or the polar opposite - fake, arrogant, cold people who only care about their job and are good for a small talk, but don't really fit as friends.

I am slowly losing myself. I used to be an entertainer (even though Im a bit introverted or loner, I always could talk to this team in a natural way), I kept the atmosphere fresh in my previous office, we were laughing all day about bullshit... people knew I was a bit weird but they liked it. And when I had a bad day, someone else cheered me up, or even one of the friendly clients.

RANT ALERT-

Now in the new office ... different kind of thing. I say ""good morning"" and half the people dont respond. I sneeze and no one says ""bless you"" (I dont really care, but its different). I pass an exam at school and no one cares or congratulates me. I make a joke and no one laughs. I cant talk about anything, because no one shares or cares about my interests. And honestly, I dont care about anyone else either ... I could pretend, but I cant force myself... All these people talk about is what they kids did yesterday, about their shitty diet, or about work. No one has any interests whatsoever, except TV and yoga. Dont get me wrong, Im not judging them. Im just saying... we are from totally different worlds. My main hobbies = picking up girls, working out (no ""healthy"" bullshit, I just wanna look amazing, I keep it real = when I say this to someone, they just smirk and look at someone else like ""haha this is one of those idiots""), playing games (Im nerdy as fuck, no one of these people even knows what is Star Wars), adrenaline.. travelling alone to cool destinations.. (these are the people who dont go anywhere, maybe visit their parents..), playing guitar, singing .. I love watching progress in science and technologies, I studied IT and medical school (I quit though), but I cant talk about that with anyone .. people on high school level

If I could at least bang one of the girls in the office, but I cant do that either, since the atmosphere there just doesnt allow it. Everyone is so cold, you cant really talk to anyone. If you do, they automatically respond to you the same way they would to other people... like you dont matter

Have you seen The Office? Well, I really feel like Jim Halpert, when he got transfered between Season 2 and Season 3. That's me. Except I dont even have clients to talk to... I just do Excel+VBA 90% of the time and meetings 10% of the rest

I am sorry, I know this all sounds really bad and you probably think I am a bad person to say all this in such a direct way. I just need to vent... I know I am not objectively better than any of the people (and even if I was, it doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things, there are other important things in life like being a good person = most of these people are much more GOOD than I am, so I cant really hate on anyone)

I finally have the job I had been striving for, for the past 3 years ... and I feel so lonely and disrespected...

Mind you - I am not looking for pity AT ALL. Just thought someone of you may have been in a similar situation, so I could use some advice",02Jun2017,0
140,"I met a girl who I got along with well. She's religious but every three months, we start talking and become close friends with two weeks. At the end of the two week period whenever one of us mentions anything about guys talking to girls, she freaks and says we should stop talking. At that moment she blocks for me for a few days and we don't talk for three months. 

She told me at some point that she has anxiety and I figured she thinks that the two of us will become a couple and sin. I proposed to her (we tell our parents about one another and go on chaperoned dates) the last time we talked and she became especially close to me because she appreciates that I respect her. She turned it down since she wants to focus on school. I'm the only guy she's ever talked to as more than a school acquaintance and for some odd reason, she hates it when I read her message and reply 20 minutes after reading it.

I'm not sure if she likes me or one of us friend zoned the other or if its her anxiety that makes her act strange. I wanted to text her but its only been two weeks since we stopped texting.",02Jun2017,2
141,"I really care about this job I just got. It's nothing sketchy or seedy. To be vague as possible, we are calling small businesses and trying to save them money by switching them to our service. If they won't save any money, we don't bother them for another couple years. We warn them about hidden fees and ways their current service could take advantage of them, and we refuse to do those things. It's possible because we have leverage in the industry in question. I really trust and believe in this company, and I believe I can do a good job. Plus, if I perform well, I get huge bonuses and commission.

So, what I do at my position is make appointments between the sales reps we have out in the world, and the business owners so they can compare services. The review is free and all, and everybody always mentions that. It takes like 20 minutes max, but we all say 5 to 10. The rep will give the business owner some information about what their fees and things mean, and advice on how to proceed. Like I said before, if we can't save them any money, the rep will shake their hand and walk away.

In the week and a half I've been making calls, I've made one appointment, and it was on luck since the business owner was just very very unhappy with his current service and basically waiting for someone to call him so he could talk to them about it. The expectation is 2 appointments a week after about a month of work. After 3 months, you're supposed to be doing at least one appointment a day or you get one of those 'do you have a minute's.

I really think this job, while tedious most of the time, is fun and exhilerating when I make progress. I know I can enjoy it once I start doing well. I'm well spoken and have a clear, professional sounding voice, and I know all the basic tips like 'don't sound like a sales person, make it a conversation, build repore,' etc. I just don't feel ready and I'm very anxious to get better and become one of the top performers. I don't expect it to happen overnight, I just think I should be better than I currently am.

I'm going to ask my supervisor if I can listen to some calls on Monday, since we were way behind schedule and didn't get to do that in training. It has always helped me to observe others doing something and take from them. Even listening one sided to calls my coworkers next to me are making helps a little bit, but I think I need a dedicated 30 minutes or an hour to really get any help. I also want to watch videos and read books.

Does anybody have any resources or advice?",02Jun2017,2
142,"I should start off by saying we aren't a couple, we're both dudes in our early twenties.

About a year ago I went through some traumatic experiences with my roommates, they bullied me, threatened me with violence, spread rumours about me, and essentially forced me into isolation. I was scared to even leave my room for months, and when I would come back I would notice that stuff was moved, as if my personal things had been gone through in such a way as to purposefully intimidate me. When they figured out that I was planning on finally leaving them things just got exponentially worse.

When I finally got out of that situation, I realized that it had a lasting effect on me. Even though I was away from them, I became extremely paranoid that their abuse would continue. My family members and doctor began to think that I may be experiencing psychosis and ptsd. This led to me isolating myself even further and becoming even more paranoid. I turned off my phone and laptop without even using them for months at a time.

Eventually with the help of some medication and therapy I started to become comfortable in using my devices again and leaving the house every now and then. I decided it was time to reconnect with one of my friends who I hadn't contacted for months.

I told him some of the things I had gone through and explained that it had lasting effects, such as people leaving my items in different places as a way to intimidate me and screw with my mind. I thought he would be sympathetic and understanding, but what happened was quite the opposite.

He became increasingly untrustworthy of me, which I could tell by his general attitude towards me, as if he thought I was making all of this up as an excuse for having to leave my university. It seems as if he felt like he thought it was my fault, as if I deserved what I got because if I felt everybody was against me it must be because I did something wrong and felt that that's what I deserved.

He made sarcastic comments about how 'western' medicine was just for people who wanted the easy way out because they couldn't achieve peace within themselves.

When I would visit him he would place items in certain places and draw attention to them to see how I reacted as a way of testing or baiting me into a reaction. (He didn't start doing this until I told him others had done it to me). The issue with this is if I call him out on the behaviour he would say that if I wasn't guilty of doing that myself then I wouldn't have even noticed him doing it (which isn't true because he's extremely bad at hiding his intentions, worst poker face I've ever seen lol). So option A: I call him out on it and fall into his trap where now I'm somehow the one who's actually guilty of it, or option B: Don't say anything and let the psychological abuse and entrapment continue.


The way I see it I have a few different paths now. I can choose to simply walk away and never look back (which he would probably interpret as me running away because I'm 'guilty'). Or I can confront him head on and tell him I know about the terrible psychological games he's playing with me (which he would then accuse me of either imagining him doing because I'm 'crazy' or having only noticed him doing them because I was doing them myself).

It's like a witch trial essentially. If you pass the test you drown and if you fail the test you survive, except there are no witches so nobody survives...

It really bothers me that after I went through so much trauma over such a long period of time, the one friend I thought I had decided to blame me for being the victim and then use what I confided in him against me to abuse me even further.

And I'm sure he justifies it somehow in his mind, just like all of my abusers have. He probably thinks to himself that I'm just getting more of what I deserve and that he's doing the world a favour.

Should I just walk away and let it be, accept that others will think and do as they wish no matter how hypocritical and evil their actions are?

(btw this guy has indirectly made it clear to me that he has extensive computer skills and could hack anyone he wishes, is this just more intimidation?)",02Jun2017,3
143,"Before we get far, I'm only 17 and I'm convinced that I love this girl. The thing is, it's not like she doesn't like me or anything, I feel like the only reason she doesn't like me is because she's kind of in a relationship. I say kind of because it's online and they've agreed to not date each other because of emotional issues, but they act as if they are dating. From what I've seen with her recent online relationships, this one probably won't last, in fact it almost ended a few days ago but they managed to save it, mean while before that whole ordeal went down me and the girl began to talk more, I learned some new things about her that I didn't know about which is cool because she's an introverted person and she isn't very open about things, and she knows I like her and she knows I don't like her boyfriend but she messaged me at 5 in the morning to talk, of coarse it was because her best friend was asleep but still she came to me when, 1. She trusts me the least out of our group of friends 2. She knows she shouldn't talk to me about her boyfriend. I didn't have a problem with talking to her about it surprisingly but knowing those 2 things really makes me wonder how much she trusts me. I brought her a cake when this whole ordeal went down and we just sat and chilled for a few hours but the entire time she was also chatting with her ""boyfriend"", I've proved I'm a good guy and the guy she's dating is actually a lot like me but the problem is, I've been told 2 different things. To pursue, and not pursue. So what do I do now, I love her and I feel like her relationship will end and then I could be the runner up(sounds bad Ik but she's had a hard life and I wanna treat her nice), but at the same time, even her best friend told me to ""respect her wishes"" and don't pursue her. The girl never told me to not pursue her so maybe she told her friend and she's passing down the message. So basically do I just try and move on when there's no one else in school I can see myself being with romantically, or do I sit back and wait while also slowly prodding into her life like I have been, I've been taking that slow and steady, infact I asked her if just us 2 could hang out and she said it would be awkward without her best friend there, and I asked her again after the whole event, she said the same thing but she might be open to it, so she trusts me a lot know, I could try and hang out with her more, get more involved in her life and stuff but at the same time I've been told to back off. Also keep in mind, I got super depressed and lonely awhile back and she's the only one to step up to the plate to comfort me out of all of my friends when I was open about it and that's why I started liking her, I know more about her than the rest of my friends, and I trust her the most, she tried to get me involved more when I felt like my friends were pushing me away(when they weren't) but the other 2 weren't helping with that theory, so she was there for me when I was at my worst that I've ever been. I'm going on and on but knowing all this, if this does get any attention, what do you think I should do, pursue or don't?",02Jun2017,1

So I'm 15 and I've been smoking for a year , I was foolish enough to record a couple of times I was out partying and in all the videos I was smoking , my dad asked me if I could lend him my computer for something and I forgot I didint close the gallery of pictures I was looking at and there were lots of videos of me smoking cigarettes , he said we would talk this night and told my mom , any help ? Obviously can't say it was once cause there are at least 4 videos and he has them now . ( both of my parents smoke and always tell me not as it was a horrible decision they have made )




Update: I have spoken to my parents about what I did and took all the advice you all gave me and put it into practice , my parents were clearly worried about me and said that all they care about is my health and despite the hipocresy of this all they wanted me to immediately quit which I agree is a great idea , now I will have to work on building trust again , thank you all very much all the  help you gave is much appreciated from all of you .",02Jun2017,15
146,"Hi all. I have ADHD, but wasn't diagnosed until adulthood. I have the symptoms managed now and it doesn't affect me to the point of degrading the quality of my life in my significant way.

However, I do think that ADHD is a deal breaker in the dating game. I've read that [people with ADHD tend to marry each other a lot](https://www.bustle.com/articles/144249-people-with-certain-mental-illnesses-tend-to-marry-each-other-study-shows) and it probably has to do with how neurotypical people are not that open to marrying people with ADHD or other mental disorders. I think dating is different as people are open to dating around/having fuckbuddies but I think marriage is different. Tying the knot implies that you will probably have kids in your spouse and I it makes sense that neurotypical people fear that their kids may inherit ADHD. It's not that different from how some white people I know are happy to date around yet they marry someone else who is white as they don't want non-white kids who face extra racial barriers in life.

I think some people do not mind marrying someone with ADHD but I think these people are usually marrying up for other aspect or settling due to not being very desirable themselves. I've seen people from the upper class saying how they don't want to marry anyone with mental disorders themselves (which gives sense given how they are technically at the top of the dating pyramid) and condemning people with disorders who choose to reproduce as there is a very high chance that their offspring will inherit the disorder.

And honestly I think ADHD will be less of a deal breaker to some people but these people are probably not very desirable in some other way so they can't be that ""picky"". It all makes sense. Given that all things are equal, would you pick someone with mental disorders? I think people do care more than they would like to admit and this is why most people with mental disorders marry among themselves neurotypical people are probably less open to marrying/having kids with those with mental disorders than we think.",02Jun2017,2
147,"Hi, so I'm 16 and not very sociable, I don't meet up with friends at all really as I'm not interested in the things they are and vice versa and am generally nervous about this stuff. 

However, I'm not unfriendly, in fact I'd say I'm a good acquaintance to more people than people usually are, and am considered 'a really nice person' to everyone, I just don't think I have any real friends.

But now someone's invited me to a party/gathering where we will play football and videogames. And I'm pretty bad at football and know nothing about videogames and in situations prior to this I've ended up being really apologetic about how bad I am and feeling like I didn't really deserve an invite.

So, my question is, how can I be a normal sociable person in this coming situation despite the lack of common interests? Thank you in advance.

The biggest problem that faced me however, is that im taking accelerated summer classes at community College and that they make my available schedule not very ideal.

I've tried applying to a couple places but many of the places i looked to apply to require a more flexible schedule, one of which i cant provide. The only night jobs i can find are stock room which to my knowledge can go to like 1 to 2 am, which i cant do because of daily hw and getting enough sleep for class (sadly it's calculus so i cant just bs through it without effort) i really need a job but everywhere either hasn't replied to my application or has required qualifications that i do not meet in terms of experience or availability.

When we met, we quickly became friends and began hanging out then became romantically involved. I had never felt that way about anyone before and had never had a stable relationship before I met him. It honestly felt like I had met one of my soulmates. He became my best friend first and then my boyfriend. There were a couple of obstacles before we officially entered a relationship but our feelings for each other kept growing. We always got along and had a great time every time we hung out.

179,"I'm 19 and I'm staying with my grandmother for the summer. I don't have a drivers license but I'm trying to get a job. My parents have a house on the other side of town that's in biking distance to a bunch of resturants and department stores. I have a job interview scheduled and I talked to my parents and they are fine with me staying at the house, it was their original plan for me to live in the house. However I told my grandmother about this and she doesn't want me to stay there by myself and says she won't take me over there. Without a job I'll just be sitting at her house doing nothing. What should I do. I need a job and legally i am an adult so she technically can't keep me here, but I'm not sure what to do.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, I don't have to make that decision anymore. I have to go to another state because my other grandmother is sick and I've got to take care of her. Thanks to those that responded",02Jun2017,1
180,"It's been four years since the charade started about me becoming a doctor. In truth I completed two years of undergrad but then stopped caring about my classes because becoming a doctor was not my dream, it was just an order. After the second year passed I failed my classes in the third and have since switched majors without telling my parents. 

I was waiting for the day when I could land a decent paying job that while not paying as much as a job in the medical field would, still pay out enough to not worry about bills. Today my parents both put the ball in my park and have told me about a doctor who needed an assistant. I have no skills to tackle on the role of assistant other than being a clerk or being a receptionist. 

It has been the dream of my father for me to be a doctor ever since my birth but I have no intentions of being one. I've played the game for three years where even my relatives believe I'm going to be a doctor. How do I begin to tell them that I'm not going to be one after three years of lies and false promises? People will say I'm a coward and a piece of shit for lying and I will accept that, just know that the culture I hail from rejects failures and treats them as one treats trash. 

I don't know what to do at this point in time. It's gotten to the point where I feel like taking my own life would be far better than revealing the truth. 

EDIT: My parents supported me by paying partially for my tuition for the years I was in pre-med. The years following my major change was all paid by me with my part time job that I no longer have. For now I'm still living with them but I am doing whatever they want me to do at the house even if the small things I do are insignificant. ",02Jun2017,1

I applied at the company I work at to convert from a contractor to an employee. It is the same job, same work, just with benefits. I beat the other candidates and was offered a position. I tried to negotiate salary and was shut down instantly. They were hiring 3 of us. One of the jobs got refused by an employee, the next got fired, and the last one they had the choice to offer it to, they were willing to negotiate with. They offered him an extra week of vacation and another $5,500 on his salary. This coincidentally enough was exactly what I was trying to negotiate to. I didn't ask for this information he just blurted it out because of excitement directly to me.

I was considering speaking to my manager and seeing if I could have my offer amended as I have just started. Ethically, if we are doing the same job, I cant see why they would negotiate and offer their last choice a better package than their first choice other than there is nobody else behind him to snatch it up.

* She's been slightly more avoidant of her bf where she normally isn't, and according to some mutual friends her feelings for him are fading (still acts more like that with him in public tho, guess she doesn't want to make it look odd) 

* Talking to me a lot more than she used to, generally spending time around.

194,"In the beginning of May, I was driving my sisters car in town and got rear ended by a motorcycle.

The police came, filled out an exchange of information form, had the bike towed, and sent me on my way.

The next day I called my insurance company and initiated a claim in regards to the wreck. I provided all of the information accurately even the point about my dad being the owner of the car. 

For reference- He bought it for my sister while she was in college about 7 years ago. My sister has since moved out of state leaving it parked at my parents for about 2 years with body damage and a transmission problem. It already wasn't in good shape, but it still ran.

I have an suv that has been leaking oil and by advice of my dad and his brother (the family mechanic) I shouldn't be driving it until it is repaired. So I traded cars. I am now leaving the suv parked while I drive my sisters car as I do not have money for the repair. I have been the only person to drive or be reliant on her car for the last couple of years. Everybody knows this. Everybody is fine with this. I have provided all maintenance to the car in the meantime in regards to oil changes etc.

Fast forward to the day after the wreck and I have initiated the claim, I find it a good idea to notify my mom and dad that I had been involved in a wreck and that I had everything taken care of on my end and that if they receive any mail or phone calls, not to worry.

To be clear, I usually do not speak with my mom and dad very often, and it has probably been 2 years since my dad text or called me on his own. However, as soon as I mentioned any word of a claim, guess who is all involved in my day to day? My dad.

He is calling and texting and making sure I get pictures, and proper estimates sent to the insurance company and the whole nine. It took me weeks of my own time between phone calls, emails, and appointments to get everything taken care of. All because I thought I would be receiving a check in the mail.

Come to find out that despite me being the individual involved in the wreck, doing all of the paperwork, and literally providing all of the information to both parties, the insurance company has been communicating with my Dad behind my back.

Now when I mention that check, he says things like he wants to ""help with the suv"" like its some grand favor that he is digging deep into his pockets for and that if I don't want to use the check how he sees fit, then I don't get access to it at all. And he isn't even talking about the oil leak. He wants me to repair the headliner. Isn't this like fraud or something?

He wouldn't have even known about the wreck unless I told him.

He never asked if I was okay.

He has only been concerned about ""his money"" to repair ""his car"" even though that car has been wrecked twice before several years ago by my younger sister and nobody offered to fix it then. He has zero intention of fixing it now.

Im just so angry.

He wasn't the one involved in the wreck and has done literally zero work to get it handled, yet he insists on the money being his.

Is there any way I can call the insurance company and explain that we chose not to repair the vehicle and to not send the check?

My Dad is being greedy and I can't stand him getting something at my expense. It would be different if we had a better relationship, but we don't. And honestly I feel really used.

Because Im not the owner, I feel like they won't send me the check, but because I initiated the claim, I wonder if I could end it so that he wouldn't receive it either?

What are your thoughts?



tl;dr

Got rear ended by a motorcycle, did all of the leg work to get claim processed. Dad who is absent from my life appears just as its time to collect insurance money. Is holding it over my head. I want to find a way for him to not get any money.

So I have this friend, I will call him Chris. Basically Chris has been 'in love with me' since I first met him which was like 4 years ago. He asked me out a few years ago and I said no because I was really young and I didn't like him like that. I didn't talk to him for ages but about a year ago I started to become friends with him again because he joined one of my friendship groups. I thought that we was nothing more then friends but I found out that he still 'loved me' a few months ago. He text me and told me everything, saying that he loves me and it's killing him keeping it a secret, so I told him that I didn't like him like that and that I didn't want a boyfriend. He was actually really understanding and I thought that was all but it wasn't. 

Since he's told me how he felt I have noticed some things. First of all he screenshots all my Instagram posts for some reason, I'm his screensaver, he has couple emojis by my contact name, he waits for me outside of school just to walk 30 seconds down the road with me, he buys me really expensive stuff without me even asking, he follows me where ever we go and trust me there is much more. And the other night he was threatening to commit suicide because he couldn't except the fact that we were never gonna happens, like seriously he wanted to kill himself. It really scared me to be honest, he's my friend I don't want him to kill himself but I don't want to feel like I'm forced to go out with him just because he is suicidal. 
I didn't think much of all this until the other day when I was talking about this to my best friends parents and they said I should get the school involved and that what he is doing isn't normal. 
So I want to know, is this a harmless crush or is he a bit obsessed with me?

222,"I'm an 18 year old female and my sister is 16 in a couple of months. Over the years we haven't had the best relationship but I (and my parents) have just put it down to sibling rivalry. However, I am convinced that my younger sister has a streak of evil in her.

Ever since we were young she has told my parents she hated them (I did the same as a child, it's a common enough thing for young kids to say when they don't get their way but she still does it at this age). My dad is partially disabled and since being made redundant in 2009, has been unable to work which has resulted in severe depression; my sister knows his weak spots and will scream that he is useless, lazy, a waste of a father, over something as simple as him being too tired to drive her somewhere. 

Over the years I have learned to simply ignore her where I previously would have hit her back, but I am currently nursing a bruise and some broken blood vessels in my arm because of an incident today. We go to the same school (I'm doing my last year of A levels) and since I'm off for study, my History teacher (also hers) gave her an essay of mine to give to me. Sister got home, told me she had it but that ""You don't need it, I'll just read out her corrections"". Tried to get it off her and was hit. 

This was passed off as temper tantrums as a child but she is nearly fucking sixteen and my family can't take it. My mum doesn't know what to do apart from joke that she ""needs her head checked"", and my dad and I virtually ignore her which makes her act up even more. When she is not at home the three of us have a great relationship.

The thing is, I'm off to uni in September and I'll be living in halls, with the option to come home at weekends. Considering the fact she has tried to smother me with a pillow and pass it off as a ""joke"" among other things, I don't think that once I've gone off to uni I'll ever contact her again, at least not until she acknowledges how childish and unacceptable her behaviour is.

As I'm sure you can imagine, reaction was swift: Kid was told he was not in trouble, mom was called and asked to pick him and the gun up and the day ended. Surely I'm telling a sick f**king joke, right? Nope. The school fully intends to sweep this under the rug to protect their reputation. No police or Child Services involvement, no letters home to parents and absolutely no consequences for the child. The school's charter asserts that children belong in the classroom, so no such thing as a suspension even exists. Staff and student safety be damned. 

My wife has expressed a desire to call the police and report this but at this point the evidence is gone and it would be her word against all those who are surely going to deny that anything happened.

When we started moving in, my female friend just moved all her own things into her room, and did not offer at all to help move some of our things (50% of our stuff which are the things that we are SHARING with her), and we had to hire movers to help with the big furniture ($200) which she is not chipping in for.

I had also asked her if she's available to help us move at X:00 time, and instead of coming through she says 'I need to go to the furniture store', proceeds to buys bedroom furniture, comes 2 hours later than when we asked her to, and asks us to help her MOVE it up and help BUILD it.

Everything was going great. She was almost always getting attention. Even our babysitter helped out with her (even though its not in the contract).

Now we're at the point where even though the babysitter still helps when she's here, when my wife has a day off at work I feel like I can't count on her to take care of the puppy while I'm at work.
