However, I really hate it and I cry every time I think about the next workout I have to do. He knows I don't want to do it, but he guilts me into staying. He says that I should be grateful I can do it because a family friend died and they can't do anything. He also says I am lazy and will get fat if I don't do it. I really don't know what else to do. Any ideas?",04Jul2017,5
1,"My sister was born with cerebral palsy. Now at age 22, she also has huge behavioural problems: hitting herself, crying, big movements of discomfort. In NYC, there are plenty of resources, programs that help and care for disabled people. My sister had recently joined one for several months after turning 21. However, because of her behavioural issues, she can no longer participate in the program. I guess it requires too much attention for staff to care for her when she goes into a tantrum and she poses as a potential danger to other students and herself.

At this time, I am not sure what else there is for her. My family and I all have to work. I feel there is a grim chance that other programs will accept her/treat her well. Staying at home with the home attendant would be too lonely for her. So... What are my options?",04Jul2017,1
4,"So this started a couple of months ago, when I still had a girlfriend, we broke up about two months ago, and I began to hang out more frequently with my friends, but lately I haven't been able to see them because vacations and stuff. But I've seen my best friend post really weird stuff that seem to point at me...

Example: My nickname at school is Batman, Bats, Batsy, etc. and last Halloween she dressed up as Catwoman, (bear with me, this might get confusing) one day she gifted me half a LEGO set which had Batman and Catwoman in it, and I quote from her ""I want you to remember, that no matter what happens, you will always be Batman, and I'll always be Catwoman, always together""

Well, about two weeks ago she posted a pic of Catwoman kissing Batman (from the Tim Burton films) 
[The pic she posted](http://imgur.com/FifIOYL.jpg)

I'm probably over analyzing but I need help

6,"Hey Redditors,

First of all, be gentle. First time posting and only been browsing regularly for about 2 weeks but let's move on.

As a 29-year-old Australian who has been living in Japan for the last 3 years, my partner (a New Zealander) and I have decided that we will leave Japan next April/May. We met here in Japan, have a great relationship, and have had an amazing experience here in Japan... but it's time to go home.

We are both happy with returning to either of our home countries but it's looking like NZ is the preferred choice; her heart bleeds Black and White.  I'm okay with crossing the ditch to the Land of the Long White Cloud.

Still, that's not the issue. After graduating with a B Sport and Exercise Science, coasting through university with respectable grades, obtaining zero entry-level experience (read: gym trainer), not using my trade for 4 years, and forgetting key principles for my specialized field of work; I'm stuck overseas with no pathway to obtain the necessary accreditations (First Aid, Exercise/Sport Science Practitioner, Strength &amp; Conditioning, Insurance) and stuck in the same position I was in after graduating, being told I'm over-qualified for Gym Trainer positions but being under-qualified for Cardiac Rehab/Exercise Physiology.

I'm planning on continuing my education for a Masters in Exercise Physiology but my conundrum lies in an upcoming move from Japan to New Zealand and obtaining a job I couldn't get even when I was fresh from graduating.

Any advice from fellow Kiwis about:
- Best cities to move to (Auckland has universities but is expensive and partner doesn't really want to return to Wellington
- Best job opportunities for me (Happy to grind out some hours at a Les Mills before finding better position)
- Accreditations needed for fitness instruction (Specialized in diabetes, Veteran Affairs, elderly, cardiac rehab populations+former AUS state-level athlete in multiple sports so sports coaching/talent identification and scouting is an option)
- Ideal tertiary institutions for Masters in Exercise Physiology
- Any other helpful advice

Hope you can help but sometimes the struggle is real.
Enjoy the day and stay frosty friends",04Jul2017,1

9,"I'll be a junior this coming year. High school has been an overwhelmingly mind numbing experience full of people I feel I just cannot connect with. Being there reminds me of how socially inept and less smart and talented I am than my peers. Most of the teachers don't give a shit about their job. They mindlessly follow rules but don't care to make a class engaging. I can't sit still and focus in class anymore, I can't make myself care.

There have been two teachers who have broken the mold, and who I respect a lot, both of which I had last year. I'm set to take their classes again next year. 

Last school year I met the best friend I've ever had, someone who made me feel like I wasn't so alone, someone who shared my interests and sense of humor. And she moved to another country. I think just meeting her made me realize how shitty and boring the people I had settled for were at the time. I've cut my only other close friend out of my life after he showed a complete disrespect and jealousy toward my other friend. That was the final straw. He's done a lot over the past few years, but I just decided I'm done with him. He's a self-described narcissistic sociopath that continually attacks my self-esteem and shows a disregard for my emotions. I've completely ignored everyone except family this summer, partly because I had so few friends to begin with, and secondly because I feel to apathetic and depressed to make myself hang out with people I feel no genuine connection or appreciation for.

I just sort of don't want to go back to school. I know I could try to make new friends, and there's a possibility to do that, but I really feel like I know most everyone I'll end up in a class with. My school isn't that big and I've been with essentially the same honors class kids since middle school. I've talked to my parents about homeschooling, and that's probably not an option financially, but I think it could happen, maybe. I'm hoping it's an option, at least. But I think American culture really romanticizes the high school experience, and I sort of feel that personally. So, even though I hate high school, and don't like to participate or anything, it's a comfortable place to exist. It's so easy to just be there and hate it. I don't want people to think I took the easy way out. I want some magic cosmic force to make people start caring about me.

I just feel so fed up. The only thing that makes me want to go back is to be in those teachers' classes, but I know they don't give a shit about me, so I'm probably being too optimistic there, anyway. 

I think, what I need advice on, is just, what my outlook should be. How should I be dealing with these feelings? Is homeschooling the solution, or would I be missing out on The High School Experience? Has anyone felt this way?",04Jul2017,1
10,"Sorry if this is in the wrong category. 

Yesterday my boyfriend's family found a baby quail in their yard. They looked for the nest and the mother and couldn't find either. So, they decided to keep it, despite the fact that the wildlife refuge who they talked to told them to leave it alone. My boyfriend was originally planning on taking care of it until it can fly but his mom told him that he can keep it forever, because if he releases it after it grows up, it will not be able to live in the wild because it won't know how. 

Is this not animal abuse? I know my boyfriend and his family would never intentionally hurt an animal but I feel as if they are making the wrong choice. When I explained this to my boyfriend he said I didn't know what I was talking about. ",04Jul2017,1
11,"Howdy Reddit,
I recently found out a woman I briefly dated years ago has become a successful stand-up comic/writer, something she was just picking up as a hobby back when we dated several years ago. 
I am really impressed, and my first thought was to send a note of congratulations to her professional Twitter page or something. It seems like a nice thing to do. 
However, I ended it, and I'm sure there were hurt feelings. We've never spoken since then, so I don't know how contact would be received. I don't want to be an ass, or seem creepy or awkward, just want to congratulate her. Any council from the redditsphere? Is it acceptable, or should I leave well enough alone?

Thanks!",04Jul2017,1

18,"This is a big problem and it takes a lot of context, so sorry for the massive post.

It all started when i came back from summer vacation to school (march). I met again with a lot of friends, including the subject, Lilly (not real name for privacy). We talked normally to each other, we had some simliar interests but nothing too much. One day, she tells me about how she started to have a long distance relationship with a guy she hooked up in summer. She was in love with him and started to talk to me about all of the time they spent together. I started to listen and liking the story. She started to ask for help about both of them since she was the first guy she kissed and all that. This made us get closer slowly. Then one day she asked me if she could vent on me and i said yes. She told me some personal anguish and sadness and i helped her. Some days later i did the same, feeling depressive. This ""venting out"" relationship made us get real close to each other, talking everyday. She called me on video and i conforted her while she cried over the phone. One day she introduced me to RP (roleplay) and asked me if i wanted to try it out, since her other best friend, who she calls ""brother"" didnt like it. I tried it out and liked it, so we started to do RPs together for months, even today. We even did sexual stuff together in the RPs and we talked to 5am.

All of this, plus the way she always talked to me and showed me stuff, led to me develop feelings for her, so i confessed about in April to her. She said i was a ""special friend"" and she wanted to keep me close. I asked if i would ever had a chance and she said ""maybe"".

After this, i settled with ""special friend"" and moved on, happy, since we still talked everyday and did all the stuff together. This ""move on"" phase led to me having a brief relationship with a girl i met outside of school. We went for a long distance relationship and Lilly always worried about me, saying how she cared about me, something she already said multiple times as she tried to advise me about things.

Now skipping to June/July. I broke up with this brief relationship, since long distance wasnt working. The breakup was really smooth and i went of glad, since we are in good terms. But Lilly ""broke up"" with this guy she dated by phone, only going out with him once. She was destroyed, i stayed up all night helping her to get over it. I downloaded IMVU to play with her. While playing she ""kissed"" me online, intending to be essentialy me, saying she wanted to see how i would react.

Besides all that, we have already been wingmans for each other once, in failed attempts and we already talked so much about so many things that we know each other in a quite personal level. She says that its not as deep as her ""brother"" but quite a lot. She said to my face that im the person she talks the most, talking to me everyday online with no fail for months. She already sent me pics of clothes she wore for parties and even the dress she wore in her 15th birthday. We took pictures together, something she hates to do, but we did together after i asked and she enjoyed it.

After so much, i started to grow feelings, slowly after all the time we spent. I never decided to be her friend just for the hope it will warrant me a girlfriend, i cared about her as a friend and i still do, but now im confused since i dont know if it is right for me to start wanting to date her...

I feel like i get hints how she likes me, at least in a new personal level. She does thing to me that she does with other guys like hugging me when we meet and making conversation with me. But from liking taking pictures with me (something she never done with any other guy), showing me new stuff and telling stories of her favourite anime all the time, she does a lot of stuff out of her confort zone with me when we talk. 

I dont know how to take all of this. She clearly enjoys talking and being around me, but i dont know how to see if its something further. She never labeled me as a friend in the last months. Even tough she already set her other friend as her ""Brother"" and some other guys as friends, she never said to me things like ""youre a good friend"" or ""youre like a brother to me"", wich i see as a way of not setting boundries for something in the future.

Since she is the more ""cold"" type of girl, rarely touching boys or showing a lot of physical attatchment, so i cant tell from that if she wants something. 

How do i take all of this? I feel like im being delusional by thinking she likes me and sometimes i feel like its wrong to feel like that for my best friend, even tough i never befriended her just so i can date her, i started to have feelings while being a close friend.",04Jul2017,1
19,"On my previous reddit account, I may have lied about who I am. I told people that I went to Stanford and worked for Google.

I don't know why I did it, I guess it made me feel like a success. Anyone, one day a girl named Stephanie contacted me, we got to talking and really hit it off. After a few weeks of back and forth messaging we told me she was willing to fly in all the way from Canada to meet me in person. I kept up the lie a little longer because she's the only friend I've had for a long time, but eventually I had to ghost her.

20,"So at the beginning of June I got a job at an estate agent which has been my dream job for a couple of months now. I was extremely excited went shopping the same weekend i got the news and bought suits and shirts and even a car. I thought I had a pretty sweet gig and things were finally falling into place. Wrong. The manager had recently fired all of the previous members of staff saying that he was looking for a fresh start and I had joined at a great time. This meant it was only me in the office, responsible for taking calls, arranging viewings, managing footfall and still trying to sell and let properties. The manager isn't the most professional guy but in the property field he knows his stuff. Last weekend I actually resigned because it got too much for me and I want to concentrate on other things. This evening I spoke with my manager and he has given me the option to come back. Part of me wants to go back to help out and watch the business build back up but the other part wants to stay far away because right now it is a train wreck. The pay is also low but I'm not too fussed about it because I want to learn about property. What do I do, if I decide to go back I have to be at 9AM tomorrow morning!

33,"I'm a highschool senior (Class of 2018) and I have an ex/friend (Ill elaborate), but for the purposes of identity I'll call her Alexia. Alexia and I met sophomore year, and right off the bat I knew she was a little, off. She always smiled no matter what and was as sweet as can be. She always had to leave school right on time however, and usually arrived 10 minutes before the bell. She could never hang out after school at clubs for too long as she had ""music lessons"" to go to and I almost never saw her outside of classes. Well, fast forward to November, and we became closer friends. I learned more about what her family is like. First of all, her parents had her when they were both 16. The two of them relied on the mother's mother for support, because she was affluent at the time. The Grandmother runs the house like a tyrant, manipulating others into her own agenda, usually to fill a need of love that doesn't come from the family due to her general wickedness. The grandfather is largely out of the picture but he does have a HEAVY drinking problem. The mother is a usual lackey of the grandmother and the father has ties with the mafia, along with alleged drug abuse and the purchase of whores. Not the happiest bunch for a sweet girl like Alexia to come from.
So in December of 2016, we start to date, and I am confronted with obvious problems. We can never go on dates and only really see each other in school. We break up in late February of this year, and just go back to being friends.
Last month I see on social media accounts that shes out with friends. So I talk to her, and i discover that her family has chilled out a little bit. Her grandma is leaving the picture and little by little leaving her alone. She always manipulated Alexia's time in the past, and was the main problem. So,  I figured maybe we could try it again. A month later, our relationship didn't work again. Her mother is now the main obstacle. Her family despises me and sees me as a coward that leaves when things get difficult, but this just seems impossible. I'm currently 16, I don't have a car or a license, there's nothing I can do. This is beside the point though.
Her mother has just pulled her out of school for her senior year and I am sick. I'm sick of seeing someone I care about and love in someways be manipulated by evil people. Everyone I've talked to says that this is a lost cause and I should give up but I honestly can't accept it. There looks like there's nothing I can do but I wanted to ask reddit for any opinions. 

Please help. I cant watch and see this anymore. I have to do something and I wont accept nothing. Does anyone have any ideas?

46,"It takes an incredible amount of energy to even be mildly successful at anything right now. It has been that way for a long while. At some point in my youth I found a way to get over this. I decided to stop caring about things. Everything really, except for music and video games. The only two things I really had any interest in. It worked as intended, and I got through primary schooling with minimal effort. But now that I actually care, and have big dreams about the future, all I can seem to do is care TOO much. Since I started going back to school with real goals in mind, my obsessive self-analysis has been the only thing getting me through all of my challenging obstacles. Once again, the coping method is achieving my most basic desire, but it is now causing to genuinely despise myself. And honestly, I have a hard time convincing myself that that’s not true. I flake on my friends constantly and make very little effort to stay in contact with anyone. Although it is summer, and I know it’s normal to take some time to focus on yourself every once and a while, but the more I think about myself and my own problems the harder it becomes to actually do anything about it. I’m drowning in a sick mixture of carelessness/helplessness  overcaring/thinking I know the answer to all of lifes problems. Most recently the best and worst combatant of my issues has been smoking weed. It really has had a tremendous effect on my anxiety, but the issue is that it has really only become a momentary escape from reality. A reality in which I'm unable to figure out how to do anything to help myself. I tried counseling at school for a semester and it helped, but it was no solution to what I was trying to fix. Although my parents try hard to help me whenever they can, at times it feels pointless to go for them for assistance because it rarely affects much change in my life. At this point I know I need to learn to start claiming responsibility for my own problems, but I just really don't know how to fix anything that I know is an issue. 

I just want to know how the fuck to sort all this out and turn my life into something that actually excites me. I have every reason to love my life right now. I’m excelling at the degree I used to believe I would not have the capacity of even pursuing up until really only a little over a year ago. 

I'm aware that there's a lesson in that. There’s a lot of stuff I tell myself I probably won’t ever achieve. However, I am damn sure there’s plenty of other life goals that I could find a way to pursue to some degree of success, but for now all I can focus on achieving is not falling apart on a day to day basis. I’ve held it together for a pretty long time, but I’m starting to wonder when the levee is going to break.  

I know this was somewhat rambling, but it's the gist of everything that is holding me back in life. If anyone knows this feeling, or what could maybe do to solve it, I could really use some help. ",04Jul2017,0
47,"So this is a complicated story, basically my dad was homeless a few months ago and it fell upon me to help him the best I could. Well one day he suggested getting a car in my name so he could sleep and drive in it until he gets on his feet. At the time I was driving my grandmothers car and did not need a car in my name so considering I love my dad and did not want to see him suffer I agreed. Fast forward a month later and my grandmother is in need of her car, leaving me without transportation for a few months as I struggle to get from school, to work, and back home. All during this time I never pressured my father into giving me the car or even extending himself to help find another given his predicament, I just kept moving and thinking. Three months after getting the car, my father gets arrested on fraud charges. In addition he had several warrents out for his arrest (bench warrants) which landed him in jail from February till this passed June. All this time I claimed the car and was responsible for it, paying the car note and insurance making sure it wasn't repossessed  and placed on my credit. The problem is when my dad got out he expected me to just hand the car back without any thought of how I would get to and from work school and home. On one hand he is now back in the predicament of finding a place to live and is staying in hotels paid for by his aunts and uncles. He also paid the down payment of 500 on the car so in that right it wouldn't be here without him. However On the other hand I'm currently extremely dependent on the car as the method of transportation I used during my struggling months is no longer available ( she got a job and can't do it anymore). In my time searching for another car I was constantly told I could not get one due to banks wanting a trade in of my current one, and all the money I had saved to get one went into the car payments and maintenance when I took it over.

The only thing? I just don't know what to do for payment, I want to use paypal. 

Should I select 'business paypal' for registering? The business name would be my 'art name'.

Also, lastly, this was a plan I had. I'd receive payment from the client, to my paypal. I'll move the paypal money to my simple account (which uses my real name), and then lastly move the money from my simple to my personal savings.

51,"So I toured an apartment today that was pretty nice actually. It was spacious and well maintained and to top it all off the rent is rather affordable. THE THING IS, the neighborhood it's in is not great, like I'm going to get mugged walking here at night not great. It's only about a mile from my campus but even still the area is pretty rundown and tattered.

88,"I am 23F, and have been struggling with my sexuality for a while now. Went through a ""phase"" at about 14/15 where I was very much attracted to girls. However, being super awkward and introverted (intense anxiety disorders), I never ended up in any relationship (let alone ever having sex with anyone). 

Fast forward and yes I went on to have a few crushes, but honestly have not found myself attracted (in any way) to hardly anyone. Obviously, a lot about my situation would lead me to believe that I am asexual, but I don't think that's the case. I still have pretty significant sexual thoughts and feelings. Enough so that I don't think I fall anywhere on the asexual spectrum. 

My sexuality is not really something I've ever discussed with anyone, but I would think about it a lot. The best way I could define it was, ""Whoever I fall in love with, I fall in love with.""

[Enter pansexual]

The pansexual thing has been a very recent revelation, even though I'm still not quite 100% sure that's where I fall. But that's what I'm going with for now. 

So now that that information is known, enter ""John"". He is 26, and I met him (online) through some mutual friends. Fast forward about a year and a half, and I really can't imagine my life without him. We've been talking almost every single day for the past year, for hours at a time, even into odd hours of the morning (we play video games together). We have more than enough in common, and I know that I can be myself with him. 

Problem is, I've never actually met him in person. I think about him all the time, and he's the first person I've felt *anything* for in actual years. I'm at the point where I don't wanna let a possible ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity pass me by, but I'm also not sure I know him (or even myself) well enough yet to be certain everything would work out. And I really don't know what I would do if I ended up ruining everything we have by acting on this. 

This has really been driving me crazy, so if anyone has any insight regarding ANY of this, it would be much appreciated. If anything needs clarification or more detail, just ask!

This routine has produced some good results.

Work is 40 hours a week, fitness is three times a week plus all the time spent eating copious amounts and piano practice is 1-2 hours a day. I am just unsure how to accommodate change into this to feel reinvigorated and allow for more social activities.

100,"Four years ago, I was getting ready to finish high school.  I had a bit of a bumpy senior year, smoking piles of weed and got hooked on cigs, depression, etc but i made it through nonetheless.  I had a few good friends, and was on the upswing in the last week.

There was a girl who I always had a thing for, though i had given up after freshman year and contented myself with being friends.  Moved on to the girl I'm now engaged to.

I get called to the office.  Shit, someone saw me smoking a cig across the road or something, here we go again with the deep talk.  I go in, see my parents looking devastated and the principal and counsellor looking grim.  Heart dropped to china.

They tell me that the girl reported that I sexually assaulted her freshman year, and had some questions before action was taken.  I was too dumbstruck to say much.  I think she might have hugged me once?  I told them just that. 

Principal knew me well, before i got into drugs.  I had done my Eagle Scout project at the school.  He believed me, but said I couldn't come back to the school while she was there, including graduation.  Policy or someshit.  I had worked fucking hard, getting clean and reversing my grades, and now i couldnt graduate.

I find out later that she told everyone who would listen her filthy fucking lies.  Apparently she was convincing, and with two exceptions i lost my entire circle of friends.  I got my diploma in the mail a week later, at least.  My reputation was beyond fucked.

For at least a month i was planning her murder.  That whole summer I spent trying to convince myself not to do it.  Almost trashed my relationship with my fiancee (gf at the time).  Going to college helped, but ever since that summer I've felt an underlying river of hate that springs up far too often.  I try to be a good man, to be kind, to be fair but I always feel the hate underneath.  I've tried therapy, tried meditation, tried screaming in the woods.  She might not have ruined my chances at success but she poisoned my mind.  She made me unlock that primal want to kill.  I still think I would if I saw her.

Fuck me, yall are going to think I took it all too seriously, but she made 400 people think I was a fucking rapist.  The worst possible kind of person.

How do I stop hating?  I can't keep it up.  I feel like I'll eventually lose it and do something terrible.

101,"Frankly, my dumbass issue requires an absurd amount of background knowledge so I apologize if this is intrinsically boring.

To commence the bullshit, I've always been the kind of introverted nerd who never made much friends throughout the shit of America's public education system. Seeking to change this aspect of my life, I sought to make more friends in college. 

Initially, I was a thorough social failure, never being able to hold conversations past the ""what's your major"" phase, constantly eating alone, drinking alone, and smoking alone. This all changed when I met my current roommate freshman year. He saw me sitting in the cafeteria alone and asked me to sit with him and his friends. We discussed Humphrey Bogart among art and other intellectually stimulating topics and it seemed to be a great outlet socially for me. We hung out and smoked a lot together, and I gradually grew closer to him than my dormmate I was living with freshmen year, and eventually my dormmate ditched living with me for sophomore year in favor of his other friends. So my new friend (lets call him C for now) became my roommate for sophomore to senior year along with some new folks who would become my friends (we'll call them A and S). 

Initially all seemed well with the camaraderie between all 4 of us, although A was very slow to become more friendly with us. Nonetheless, I observed two underlying issues with C and A. C would have moments of intense anger issues, I first observed this upon him going out of his way to destroy a cardboard box in the trash, perhaps a funny story were he intoxicated, but he was sober. I also noticed A's inability to deal with problems and just ignore them instead (as he adopted a cat essentially for the sole purpose of trying to impress this girl he was dating, then A never treated the cat for fleas, causing our whole apartment to be overrun with them). 

Yet before we all moved in together, I should mention this girl who worked for my dorm that I kinda had a crush on freshman year. I never worked up the courage to talk to her, but C was able to and began dating her. No real big issue there with me as I'm not some possessive asshole who thinks he owns girls from merely having a crush on them, except when we moved in together sophomore year, it was profoundly difficult for me to ignore how he treated her. To put it mildly, he constantly gas lighted her and blamed her for literally all his problems. I would constantly hear them arguing at 5am, and he would get angry with her for trivial matters like spilling water, when she was essentially an angel for him. For instance, when C missed the deadline of his essay assignment by 1 min, he freaked out bawling like a baby, meanwhile L calmly emailed his professor the assignment securing his ""academic excellence.""

Now, all this troubled me greatly, and it seemed impossible to stop the thoughts in my head, asking what I would've done if I was dating her instead. I know this is an unhealthy attitude, so I basically shoved those feelings way down into my gut, which was also unhealthy but whatever. However, my other roommate A held similar feelings for L, but he was much more blatant in his romantic interest in her while she was dating C, giving her an extremely personal birthday gift with a romantic note attached to it. 

To jump ahead a bit, C and L constantly fought over A's feelings for L. The decay of their relationship was too great, and they broke up when C did his classic thing and got upset with L for virtually nothing, he angrily stormed out the house saying ""when I get back L better be the fuck out of my house""

Now, this is where shit starts getting weird. As before this emotional climax happened between them, me and A were offered temporary work for a holiday season at the same company L and S (my only cool roommate) work at. This was at a time when both me and A's university jobs were not available so we both needed the income and accepted. However, once L and C broke up, C assumed that the only reason A wanted the job was to get closer to L. Which may have been partially true, but the obvious motivation was financial. Anyways, L and A were chilling smoking some bud after work, when C drives up and smashes A's car window. Now, this sort of cowardly and petty act is the antithesis of how I like to handle issues. We had no physical evidence that linked C to smashing the window, but nothing was stolen from A's car, it wasn't even unlocked, it was clearly broken from an emotional outrage. 

I confronted C on this matter as A is too much of a coward to deal with his issues himself (instead he moved out rather than confront C). When I confronted him, there were just clear physiological signs in how he spoke to me that he was lying up his ass when he denied he broke the window (inability to make eye contact, stuttering over words, blinking excessively when eye contact was made, etc). Pushing him further, his exact words were ""A deserved to have his window smashed cause he wants to fuck my ex"" now I'm no stranger to the emotion of jealousy, for I feel it in my very bones at this moment, but nobody really ""deserves"" anything that happens to them. Pushing him further was essentially talking to a wall, I believe this man has actually deluded himself to the point where he believes he actually didn't break the window. I even asked him to get psychological help for his anger issues, he agreed he would but has made no effort whatsoever to get help.

Normally I would think that A and L have every right to hangout even after the breakup because they're friends, and C's petty manipulative attempt to cease their friendship was undoubtedly wrong as you just can't control two consenting adults, but consent is where my biggest issue lies with A. L and A would hangout and smoke sometimes and L would occasionally fall asleep at his place, only to wake up to A stroking her face in her sleep and tried to cop a feel while she slept too. I straight up can't believe I lived with these two morally disgusting people for 3 years. 

So, being a reasonable human being who doesn't like his friends getting fucked with, I confronted A on the matter. He was shameful and sorry, but he refuses to properly apologize to L because of his fear of confrontation. He has since moved back home like the cowardly bitch he is.

So now I'm in this situation where my only reasonable roommate S has moved out and I expressed my desire to not live with C for my last semester. Instead I have decided to live with L (unbeknownst to C) as both of our housing situations were fucked and we're both good friends who enjoy keeping a clean house and not a fucking pigstye (that my old roommates seemed so fond of upkeeping). Now, I'm profoundly worried my feelings for her will interfere with our friendship. She is attempting to move on from her 3 year relationship with C and A's creepiness by being alone, and I totally respect it, I feel it would be a terrible time to tell her my feelings while she's still grieving the relationship.

However, she has already moved on to some other guy named E. They are not dating but will most likely be soon, and I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but a part of me can't help but be skeptical of the whole ""nice guy"" image when both these men whom I thought were my friends and morally good people, but turned out to be fucking scum. So, to be more specific about my distrust for this gentlemen is that L and C used to smoke cigarettes excessively, and L always wanted to quit but found it hard with C constantly supplying her with cigs. Now that they broke up, she quit and was really proud of herself, but this E guy smokes cigs and got her back into the habit, which frankly I think it's a bit silly, just cause you like this guy doesn't mean you have to give yourself carcinogens constantly. I really don't want to feel this jealous and over protective but to deny and bottle up the feelings I feel would again be a bad call.

I honestly don't know what to do at all, it's fine if you guys don't have an answer for me, just typing this out was therapeutic in its own right, but holy shit I feel absurdly messy.  I understand the difference between infatuation and love at my age, for all I really want is for L just to be happy, but I'm just going through some trouble accepting that I'm probably not the one who can do that for her. Is the right call just to ""get over it"" or should I just quietly wait until the right time to tell her how I feel?

tl;dr
I had a crush on this girl, then my roommate dated her, was a total dick to her, they broke up, my other roommate got super creepy with her, and now I'm virtually her only friend, and I don't know what the fuck to do with my feelings for her, they have evolved beyond infatuation and I just want her to be happy but I'm a bit sad the guy who can make her happy probably isn't me.

111,"I am not depressed, but I am feeling really lonely because even after my first semester in college, I have nobody who wants to invite me to a party, event etc. I have 'friends' whom I talk to during classes, but I have no actual friends who want to spend some time together with me outside of school. I don't know why. I have never been mean or disrespectful to anyone. 
I have no enemies. Just no one on my side.
Although appreciated, it is not the emotional support I need.
I just want to know how I could get out of this uncomfortable situation.",04Jul2017,5
114,"Hi everyone. I'll start off with the situation I'm in, then what I am doing and what I feel like I should be doing. 

I'm 21m and moved up to a new city for an apprenticeship in software developement. I moved here about 6 months ago and have had a bit of trouble meeting people and making friends, mainly because I enjoy staying at home and playing video games etc. 

I am working in a quite serious company with 100s of employees. I'm in a team with around 20 guys (mostly from india who are often speaking hindi) working on the backend IT services. My role (so far since about 6 months) has been to do one or two tasks a day which take about half an hour. Meanwhile the rest of the day I'm sitting on reddit or using my phone. 

I am seated quite a few rows away from the rest of my team so I'm left to my own devices a lot. Being easily distracted by group texts and the endlessness of reddit.

I have had my probation review which I passed saying that my work is good and I'm in on time but they mentioned that I should be more active in seeking help and interpersonal communication. 

The issue is that I should be going and asking for more work, finding ways to learn and become more skilled but I feel like every time I want to get up there's that anxious feeling that I don't know what I'm doing or what I should say.

I feel so disconnected to my colleagues it doesn't feel right to be walking and distracting them from their work or conversations.

I'm at a bit of a loss and honestly don't feel like I belong. 

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: I can't speak to my colleagues comfortably. What can I do to put myself out there?",04Jul2017,1

120,I am standing up for head boy postion in my school and we have to give a 3 minute speech tomorrow. The speech basically includes why should the students vote me.

123,Okay so for about the past 2 weeks I've had these weird kind of small worm things climbing up my bedroom wall. They're really tiny but gross and they keep appearing and freaking me out. Does anyone know what these things are?? And how to get rid of them?,04Jul2017,2
124,"I've developed the irrational fear that someone who essentially used to bully me is going to move house to my village. I haven't spoken to this person since they tried their best to ruin my life last year and from what I remember they live about an hour and twenty minutes drive from me.
There's quite a few new houses being built in my village and someone I've convinced myself that this person is going to be buying one and moved in, and though I know it's a really irrational fear I can't escape the feeling they're gonna move here and ruin my life again. It's sending my anxiety through the roof.


Anyway to stop worrying about something that I know won't happen? To put the mind at rest?",04Jul2017,5
127,"Colleagues and the few friends that I do have would think I'm a very happy-go-lucky type of person. I like to keep to myself, and they know that, but I feel I don't give off the impression that I'm depressed/lonely. 

I have a decent job, perform well, and get along with basically all my colleagues and people I encounter on a day to day. I can count the number of people I call 'friends' in one hand. 

I saved up for the past couple of years to treat myself to a few months of travel, I anticipated this trip to being a very ""eat-pray-love"" esque thing. Like I'd find myself, find what I really want to do in life. I've travelled solo before, but this time round it feels different. I long to be with someone, and this longing suddenly emerged greatly during these travels. Everywhere I go, especially those touristy place, you seldom really see only 1 person, there is always either a couple, a group of friends, or a family. Even my work colleagues were commenting how 'brave' I was to travel alone, for such a long time, to places I've never been. I took pride in saying that that's what I wanted. But sitting alone in a hotel room, the feelings of emptiness is just too much. I just saw one of nature's wonder yesterday, I happily posted on instagram how happy I was to be there #hashtag this #hashtag that, and reality is yes, I am happy to see and experience these places, but these feelings are quickly turned around when I realize I'm alone, and not experiencing these things with someone else. 

I've contemplated even hiring an escort, I've become so desperate just to have someone to be with me, both emotionally and intimately even if it was even a total stranger. 

My last (and only) relationship (which lasted around 2 years) was about 10 years ago, sigh, I'll be blunt and say I haven't had sex for the past 10 years, and it didn't really bother me till the past few days/weeks. I'm lonely for affection and someone to be around with (do things, see things)...have a relationship, and also days I just want to have some quickie, even if it were a total stranger. But it's not in me, I can't see myself doing any of these (hiring an escort, ""hooking up"" with a stranger at some trashy bar). 

I don't really know what I'm asking advise from you kind strangers taking the time to read this. Am I depressed? yes... will I do something foolish? no. Am I lonely? yes. 

I don't even know where to begin, what to do. I'm still on my trip travelling around, but seeing such amazing sights feels so empty and wasted, when deep inside, I just wish someone was there with me.

129,"Last saturday i was drunk, like really drunk, and at the end of the night a girl, that was not so attractive (lets just put it like that) hit on me and i took the bait.
A lot of my friends are making fun of me because of this girl, and i really don't wanna talk to her a lot. Yesterday she came up via text to me with a simple ""hi"" what can i say to just reject her and not have to talk to her all that much?.

131," So seven years back, when i moved to a big city and broke up with my first girlfriend, i started my journey to selfimprovement. In my teenage years i was depressed and quite anxious with associated social anxiety. But at some point in my life it occured to me...i can improve on that,...and life a better life. And thus my journey for selfimprovement began.


In terms of dating, all i wanted for the most part was a nice relationship with a nice girl, who i have a good connection with. Easier said than done. Over the last couple of years i had quite a lot short lived things with girls, and one longer relationship with a girl i later found out was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Naturally this relationship broke down too.

Now i am single for about 2 years now,...and one thing keeps repeating over and over again. Girls seem to be interested, as i am quite naturally good looking,...but when we date for a time something seems to happen, i can't quite put my hands on,...and the relationship breaks down. They lose interest. And it fades into nothingness. And to be totally honest...it hurts like shit. 


At first i was oook...not everybody is meant for each other,....its alright...and being alone is alright too...but it just keeps repeating and repeating over and over again....that i am quite honestly sure something is just wrong with me. As selfimprovement dictates,....i tried to improve that too, and got into dating advice/ pickup. 

But what the fuck.....it still happens,..even though i try to be authentic, lighthearted and fun. Even though i improved a lot of my life........and lately i even met what i feel like is my exact opposite in female...but even there...EVEN there something happened and she started being more distant...although she was so fucking needy at the beginning. 


Reddit,...i just cant deal with this anymore...it honestly feels like i am destined to be alone, and i just want to go to my room and cry about it. And i know it should be alright to be alone, i should feel fine by myself,...but honestly, i do not. 


What can i do my friends? I have no fucking idea. 
Even putting myself out again is so difficult nowadays...because it is so hard to open up again when you fully expect the other person to leave anyways. This last girl was the last i could lightheartedly get my hopes up. It almost felt okay.

134,"My mom, at 65, is not an extremely young widow- but many would consider her a young widow.  

Professionally, she is very much an independent person - well respected in her industry and enjoys her job.

Socially, however, she was always very much my father's wife.  They didn't do much socially but when they did it was with his friends and the guys/gals he knew from the bar where he played cards.  He was very much my mom's keeper socially as she is very awkward and rather shy.  For example, she would often linger awkwardly trying to enter a conversation until my Dad came over and started talking or until he called her away to someone else.  She has a few lifelong friends but they are scattered about the country.

I am at a loss for what to do or suggest.  I want her to make friends but I am not very good at it myself so I find it difficult to help.

Will cross post to r/advice.",04Jul2017,2
136,"Hey, I will try to keep it as short as possible, but here are several things coming together, so it might take a while. I am from Germany and studied psychology in the Netherlands, at first with the idea to become a therapist sometime. I started my study in 2009 and finished my bachelor degree in 2013. I wasn't an A-grade student or something, but it went ok overall. Then I did my masterstudy and first I failed at some subject. I had to repeat them and did it, but then I failed at my first attempt for my masterthesis. I then started an internship as a part of my study which went horribly wrong. They basicly told me after a few weeks that I have no business in this field. They saw me personality-wise as someone who can't deal with people. I was crushed. The internship was finished shortly after and with that I completely lost my confidence. My relationship failed one week after that. That was in 2015. Since then I started another masterthesis and failed with deadlines regarding that, as well. I think I was scared of failure like I failed with my internship. After that went bad, I fell into a hole. Last year in June, I got diagnosed with cancer in my balls. Of course it was a shock at first. But it's weird. Dealing with cancer was easier for me than dealing with my study, my future and the question what I am good at. I followed the plan, had an operation and chemotherapy. It all worked out. I figured if I can beat cancer like that I can also get my fucking masterdegree, right? Well, wrong. Active selfdiscipline and planning are different issues than passively following a treatment other people are responsible for. I started my new and last attempt for a thesis in March, fucked up again. They gave me a last chance with that topic if I would follow a strict plan. At first it seemed to finally work. Somehow I managed to get the first two deadlines done.
However, I didn't manage to get my shit done for this new deadline, so here I am now: all subjects done for years, money wasted and nothing to show for it. Looking back, all my failures came down to a lack of discipline and selfdoubts since my internship. There were times that I didn't know why I would do my study since my boss at my internship told me I am not capable of working with people in that way. For some reason I believed that person and let her shatter my confidence instead of asking myself if this one judgement of this one person is really true.
Well, my go-to strategy for these kind of situations would be hiding and denying that things are bad and waiting things out until they get better themselves. Since this hasn't worked out over the last 4 years, I thought I would try a different approach this time. I want to ask for help and get myself engaged with my situation by talking about it and doing something about it. However, I am afraid. I don't feel like an independent person who knows a lot about life and how to manage myself. And I would like to learn something about that. I want to be active and proud and independent about what I do with my life. But in the last years, I feel like I was all talk and no act.
I am feeling empty right know, I got kicked out an hour ago, so I am sorry if things aren't formulated in a coherent way.",04Jul2017,2
138,"Hi all,
Not really sure how to start this so here is some context:

My dad used to be a literal superman, one of the best in the country at what he did, a super dad, the father every women wishes their husband is. However in 2009 my dad got into a pretty bad car crash which fucked up his back significantly and changed my life drastically as suddenly he couldn't be nearly as involved in my life and my siblings lives due to physical inability. I'm pretty sure that it impacted his mental health as for a time he got seemingly depressed, struggling to justify himself as a man who can barely father his own kids.

8 years later and the situation has gotten drastically worse, him and my mother have gained SIGNIFICANT weight and all he does is drive us (his kids) around when we ask for it, go grocery shopping and browse reddit on his imac. All of his hobbies have essentially disappeared and he seems to have a severe lack of purpose besides the immediate need to provide for his family. Over the last eight years he has been progressively become emotionally distant and sort of detached from the family unit. His relationship with my mother has always been rock solid, but the last two years she has been losing weight for her kids and he just hasn't. Shes tried getting some sense into him when my siblings and I haven't been around but nothing seems to work. She consoles in me (sometimes in tears) that when she talks to him about his weight he gets verbally abusive. he often jokes about my mother remarrying. This all came to a climax when he allegedly screamed at her that he didn't care if he lived or died, and that he didn't care if he lived long enough to see his youngest daughter married. My mother doesn't want me to talk to him about it because she fears that he will abuse her more, and for the last year ive maintained the opinion that he is a grown man who can make his own decisions, and I as a son don't have a say in their marriage.

What caused me to have a change of heart was on my 17th birthday at 10pm when the internet went out, instead of going to sleep and fixing it in the morning, he feverishly stayed up for four hours calling tech support so he could get back on the wallstreet journal to read articles about cool youtube videos and cat pictures. It has really been getting to me lately how he is a shell of the man he once was, and how he doesn't really interact with us unless we force conversation. Needless to say watching the ageing process occur at an accelerated rate over my teenage years has been pretty confronting for me.

If I don't talk to him now I will forever live with the knowledge that I could have made a last ditch effort to get our father back. I'm not sure that I could live with the guilt that my younger siblings became adults without a father. I cant speak to him because he gets super defensive, I cant speak to my mother because she gets too emotional that she is slowly losing a husband, and I cant confide in my younger siblings who don't even know there is an issue going on. I want to sit him down away from the house one day, lay out all my cards on the table, tell him everything that is going on, my concerns, how he isn't really a part of my life anymore, why my mother is constantly fed up with him, why he always sits in front of the computer instead of doing something else, how I want to take up a hobby with him and promote a long term plan to get him to lose weight (keeping in mind his back issues).

I understand that he is an adult and he can make his own decisions, but if I don't talk to him now I fear I never will. I just want a second opinion on all this before I go through with it though.

Cheers",04Jul2017,1
141,"So I thought I was home alone and brought a girl over, she was pretty loud and my sister walked in. The girl I was doing was like please don't stop. And told my sister this dick felt so good and to stay if she wants. So she did.

And it was just awkward doing it in front of her like that, the girl made it worse, screaming and cussing, shaking and shit. She was kind of talking to my sister while also moaning but it was more just telling her how good it was. Then she even sucked me dry when I was about to cum... and getting head in front of my sister felt more awkward than sex tbh.

Now my sister is 19, I'm 18. So I don't get why she stayed or for what. The girl didn't really go talk to her when we finished. Just flirted more with me and played around in my room. So um... anyone have any logical explanation for this?",04Jul2017,0
143,"I have one of those cool teachers that think they're still hip or cool and tries to act like us in high school. Well I went to this party for the 4th and surprisingly he was there dancing and stuff drinking. I noticed him so ai went to speak and he started flirting with me ever since. 

We split up for a bit when my friends came over and I got drunk and all I know are blurs and just idk... I just know I woke up with a hangover naked in my teachers bed. I saw my underwear and clothes thrown across the room so I can only assume we did it. And when I tried to creep up and leave but he woke up and noticed. Even saying my name, didn't really care I was naked, like he knew he banged me.

I realize I couldn't drive home... so, I asked him to take me home, he says to wait a bit he has a headache. I start bitching to him that I do as well and he gets on top of me saying he can fix that. And before I can say no, he starts fingering me and sucking on my nipples, kissing up my neck. And well... yeah, he soberly had sex with me, knowing damn well I'm 17.

I won't lie and say it's rape considering he ate me out so I gave him head. But still isn't that illegal? He finally brought me home in his truck but asked could he keep my panties for gas money... and I stupidly thought that was funny and gave it to him... So well... yeah. I had sex with my teacher. But I swear that has to be illegal right? He knew exactly who I was and that I was in his class.

Why do I care? Because if it's not illegal, I might end up liking him...",04Jul2017,3

149,"So my best friend, i'm going to use 🌊, posted to instagram celebrating her 1yr anniversary with her bf. I'm happy for her, but she said in the post that she'll drive hours to see him and will talk to him every day for hours on the phone, etc.

I haven't seen her in 4+ years and have always tried to make plans for us to meet up. They normally involve me going up to see her, never her coming down to see me. Or even meeting in a mutual city half-way. I always check in to see how she's doing but she never reciprocates, she takes forever to return my messages both from FB and text sometimes it takes a week, never asks how I'm doing even after i told her i was depressed and have self harmed and in response she said she would be there for me and listen because she's dealt with depression too, and when i do message her to talk about something important to me she'll change the subject to herself or her problems after a few exchanges. BUT, she says she misses me and that i'm her best friend and she wants to see me again. 

The reason why she's still my closest friend is because she's one of the few friends I have that i don't share with my sisters. To give a bit of backstory, i'm a multiple so a lot of the friends i have they also have. 🌊 is one of the few friends that is just my friend. She knows everything about me and when she's there for me she's great and she listens. However, I don't know how much i can handle this. I'd like to talk to her about it but she never returns my messages in a timely manner. I don't know what to do anymore.

151,"Im 21 years old and have been having some rough issues with depression and anxiety over the last 3 years, basically since high shcool ended. Romantic relationships (which have all ended up me getting dumped for another guy), my father (whom I have always had conflict with) and uncertainty of my future (no idea of a career, etc) all terrify me and if either of those 3 things start going badly it is usually a trigger for me to enter a depressive episode... I've just finished my associates degree and was planning to take a break from school for a year to figure out what I want to do, so I can go back and get a bachelors degree, however, I've realised I actually enjoy being in school. It keeps my mind busy and distracts me from everything else, I want to continue going, but, have no idea what to even study. Along with that, I want a career. I want a real job. I don't wanna be stuck at a grocery store my entire life. I wanna feel like I'm doing something I care about but I havent a clue what to do.

I also recently got my first girlfriend in years. She's really amazing and more often than not, if I'm feeling down, she's able to pull me up out of it. We have a ton i common and I honestly have never felt such a strong connection to someone (My other relationships were very short and long distance)... Recently, a big depressive episode hit me and I panicked, I got cold feet, I freaked out and I dumped her. I thought thatI'd just be a burden to her and I thought that I needed to work on and improve myself in order to be in a relationship. But after two days without her, I realised how much she helps me. I was full of regret. I drove to her work with candy and flowers and begged for a second chance. I told her I""d continue going to my therapist (who I had quit seeing overt the last several months) and I'd even try medication so I could manage my problems. She hesitantly said she'd give me another chance. We are still working on things and it's slowly improving, but, she doesn't quite trust me yet, which I understand.

Which is kinda true, I can be really clumsy lol. And quite unaware of my surroundings sometimes. But the thing is I really want to be a journalist, in fact I'm taking a course to become one, and I want to do investigative citizen journalism as a portfolio/hobby. I told him that i want to investigate the background stories of ex-convicts, and find out about their life circumstances that drove them to a life of crime. Maybe they had a broken family or couldn't pay medical fees or suffered abuse or something. Anyway, my bf wasn't too happy when I told him what I want to do. He thinks that I'll get raped or killed (which is a real danger, to his credit) and now as I am typing this, he's saying that there's a risk that the ex-convict was never repentant at all and if my investigation leads on to exposing his new life of crime, I might get murdered for knowing too much or something. I don't know what to do; I really really want to do this, because I want to show people that we must not be so quick to judge ex-convicts and say that they are terrible people because they did whatever they did. I want to expose the problems in society, if any, that led them to commit the crimes they did. In a way I want to help remove the stigma that ""all ex-convicts are big scary men with tattoos everywhere and will fight you on sight"". I have a passion for this, but he's telling me I can't fulfil it because it will not only put me in danger, but it will make my friends and loved ones sad if I do eventually get killed or whatever trouble I get into. Also, the more he tells me not to do it, the more drive I have to do it. I'm the kind who will go out to get what I want, I don't care what people say. If I don't get it, it just means I don't want it enough. But him telling me that it might hurt people I love has had me shaken; what should I do now?

TLDR; I really want to fulfil my passion but my boyfriend thinks I shouldn't. What do? 

Edit: To clarify, he was already against me being a journalist for a career but he's slowly opening up to it; but when I told him I wanted to do investigations as a hobby and as a social favour, he's straight up against it. He told me that I can be a journalist but he's begging me not to do the blog. Help.

I'm a 22 yr old guy from Germany and I abolutely despise the idea of working in the same industry (to earn more money, more vacation days etc.) for god knows how long.

I'll (hopefully) pass my apprenticeship as a food technician next week so I have something (kind of) valuable in my hands to look for work. I could work for the company that trained me and I'll most likely stay there for a while but I need to do something more creative. 

Personally I see myself in the whole modern media industry as I'm pretty skilled with visual media editing but who isn't nowadays..

Don't get me wrong. The food industry is overall pretty exciting but to exaggerate a bit: I'd like to build cars for one week and develop new ice cream flavors the other week. I feel like that a job like this would fit 100% and help me to stay optimistic and not get stuck in the daily routine. But I don't know if something like this exists.

170,"First of all, throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Backstory: A girl and I were dating when I was 19 and we started living together after 6 months. We broke up and I moved back to my parents house. A few weeks later she came over and said she was pregnant. I was using drugs at the time and was very unstable. She told me that she wasn't planning on keeping the baby and even if she did, she didn't want me in her life. I never told anyone and never heard from her again.

Flash forward to last week, and I noticed this young lady, I'll call her Sarah, trolling my social media accounts. On LinkedIn, it said Sarah B. viewed my profile. I did some digging around online and found out that Sarah B. was the daughter of the girl who told me she was pregnant 21 years ago. I checked her birth date and it matched the timeline. Also, she looked exactly like my other daughter who is 13.

So, I started freaking out. I found an email account for Sarah and sent her a message saying that I might be her dad. A couple days later she responded and said that I was her dad and she wants to meet me in person. She said she needs some time to process everything, but she wants to meet before she goes back to college.

A lot of emotions going through me right now, and I have no clue what I'm going to say to her.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",04Jul2017,125

I just don't want to crash and hurt anyone or make myself look like a fool. I want to be able to drive like other people who are so relaxed.

I discovered he had a pof account up, as well as youtube videos with him and other women. My dad never really bought food for the house, never payed rent and made my mom pay all the bills. He has been coasting for the last 7 years for free. He always yells and always creates scenes. He had a lock attached to his dresser and 2 phones. Just 2 weeks ago he created a scene in which he threatened to shoot a worker due to not letting him get past a hotel room, he actually made the gun movement with his hand. A cop came to the house and told us what he did. Me and my mom could not believe he would go into a public arena and do that. He went to my aunt later in the week and started telling her I am a terrible person (smear campaigning me) I have not got 1 call or any word from my aunt since. My mom had enough and kicked him out. The other day He came to put his key on the table and picked up all of his stuff in boxes. He refused to tell me or my mom where he is going or moving to. I honestly had nothing to say to him.
I called him today to find out where he lives now and he said "" Do not visit him, I dont want anybody visiting me, do not call me, If it is an emergency call me, other than I dont want to see you""

177,"Hi guys,
so I'm 18, gay(still in the closet) &amp; from tunisia and i feel so depressed, suicidal.
I grew up with my parents and my brother and sister, i'm the youngest, and i was since childhood bullied and blamed for being a little feminine; i liked girly stuff like clothes and songs which made people make fun of me all the time, my dad was absent my whole childhood, he never did anything with me , never helped me understand what life is all about but all he did was provide us with money, he thought that giving us money was his only responsibility as father. Members of our family: my cousins, my uncles, my older brother and pretty much every male in my family has bullied and made fun of me since i was 6. i grew up losing my self-confidence, being insecure about the 'lack of virility' which made me feel uncomfortable walking down the street, being in crowded places, generally going out. I always felt like i don't fit in, I suffered from the abuses and the insults i got from my family since i was a kid and couldn't stand up for myself, that made kind of complexed bout myself i guess. Primary school was good actually, i had friends and i was accepted as i am. things got bad when i started going to highschool, there was a class full of 'bad boys' who have always ept an eye on me, they got me beaten during lunch breaks, they cyber bullied me on facebook they've posted my pics and edited them and even created a page especially to make fun of me. That part of highschool was so hard for me, i barely survived it &amp; tried to commit suicide many times by tryng to jump off our balcony but i was sooooo scared to jump but i would go and step on the edge of the balcony for hours thinking about jumping. I'm really good at my studies, but my social life is just horrible, i have no friends at all, only like 3 girl friends and my best friend since childhood doesn't want to talk with me anymore and started  calling me gay. In tunisia, it's different, like i can't go out with those 3 girl friends or go to the beach together since their parents won't let them go out with a guy regarding their culture but we go out together for lunch sometimes on school days. I feel alone, both of my siblings study abroad, i'm always at home if not at school. This year was a really hard one for me at highschool, i started getting bullied again by the administration this time, whose director hated me to death and he called me gay as an insult and said i was girly and i was not allowed to wear NORMAL sweatpants to sports sessions, and i got suspended for 3 days for wearing a pair of them. I asked help from mom and dad who were independent and told me to stop wearing sweatpants. I had no one except 2 of my girl friends to support &amp; help me survive that year because i was everyday called to the administration and all the workers there would say to me hurtful slurs and even kick me sometimes. Somehow it stopped, and now i'm on summer holidays. my older brother who is 25 came back to us, and he's making me crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!! he started abusing me and calling me gay and my mom and dad tooo they can't stop telling me im going to hell when i die and they keep telling me what to do , how to walk, how to act, how to speak.. I started modifying myself, i stopped walking the way i felt comfortable, i faked my voice and accent and stopped choosing my clothes as i like. All of this to fit in this ugly &amp; horrible islamic society. last week, my dad &amp; my older brother beat me over a stupid little conflict, my dad slapped me like 4 times my cheeks are sore now while at the smae time my brother was punching me, i was raised really scared of my dad cause he would go and slap me for any mistake, but this time i just started screaming and yelling at him and pushed both of them really strong away my father nearly fell down (it felt wrong but i looooooved it) and beat my brother and left the house quickly. i went to my aunt, the woman who has supported me and never judged me, and stayed with her for 3 days. I went home to pick my clothes and everyone was waiting for me they started yelling at me and telling me how impolite i was to push away my father 'who has raised me' oh no he didn't. My dad &amp; i don't talk anymore, he's mad at me for pushing him and speaking out until now. Today, i had a quarrel with mom over a veeeery stupid subject , she beat me like now i have bruises everywhere all over my body and scratches. I started cutting today because i  feel super depressed and i feel like no one ever gets me, understands me or accepts me as i am. i feel hated, i cannot live with my family anymore, i feel like i really hate all off them, i can't live in this country anymore, next year i'm gonna graduate from highschool and try to leave the country to study abroad like the other two and then ill never come back , Tunisia is really a bad place to live, people here are so cruel and judgy and especially violent. I almost cut my veins while cutting today, i'm just so upset and my heart feels heavy, what do i do? it seems like there's nothing i can do to save myself from such people , i don't know if i could make it until next year, my head keeps telling me to end my life and there's so many voices calling me to do so. It seems to me that suicide is the solution to say bye to all of my pains and problems, I have dead dreams now, i feel hopeless, miserable, unworthy of everything. 
i am also sick of hiding my true authentic self forever it feels like i'm suffocating.

178,"Hello there, 
this is about my little sister in law (""Emma"", 20 yo). I will try to illustrate the facts here as good as I can.

Emma just finished her apprenticeship in school and applied for a Job in a laboratory for a Company ""ABC"" by mail. 
She sent her certificate in a second mail for the sake of completeness. Hereupon came a message from the laboratory head, asking to send the application again. She did. (This was saturday afternoon.)

Promptly she got a long message from him again, in which he offered her a meeting with her personallly in a relaxed environment, suggesting a bar on wednesday evening. He explained extensively how he experienced, that other applicants were too shy in a job interview, facing multiple persons at once, so he offers to talk to her in before, to get to know each other. She was a little afraid of her first interview so gladly accepted to meet him.

Shortly later (maybe half an hour) she gets a message in WhatsApp from an unknown number. The guy stated that she may know him only by sight from school (where she just graduated), got her number through some others, and stated having interest in her and made her compliments. 

First she was excited about somebody having interest in her but soon became wary:
He asked questions about her, but did not want to give any information about himself, at all. Justified this because of ""excitement"". 

She got him to send a picture but he made sure that his face is not recognisable. But what is recognisable, could very well be the laboratory head, judging by hairline and beard. 
(Further information : the Company cooperates with the school, so the laboratory head was at the school once, but hat no direct or personal contact to Emma.)

He asked questions about what she does, what she wears.. It got creepy. Especially because he seemed to know some facts about her without asking, like her exact age (could very much vary in her school, but he said he put one and one together, which he could not have).

As she did not stop asking who he is and what he does, he gave some information about himself, which can not be entirely true : his name being  ""Michael"", him being 23 years old in a class at the same school, him wanting to go to college in fall. (If so, he would have graduated just now or last year, but there is no one who did with that name.) 

Lastly he mentions that the Company ABC seeks new employees, which I don't count as a coincidence.

We tried to find information about the mobile number, the laboratory head and the alleged person on WhatsApp, but found nothing.

The whole family is sure that it is very likely the guy from the company who writes her, but we have no evidence. Now Emma is afraid to go to the meeting on wednesday and I am seeking for ideas how to proceed. She might decide to not go, or alternatively bring a friend, maybe incognito to the bar. In no way she will go alone. 

If our suspicion is right, it might be best to call the company and ask, if they are aware that these inofficial meeting is intended. Further she could try to find out, if the laboratory guy has the exact phone number. But I guess a company will not give away personal data of their own employees. Emmas family suggests to report this creepy guy at the police. 

So does anybody have further ideas or tips for this situation? We are grateful for any ideas, thoughts  or advice.

Tldr: Girl sends her application to a company, gets creepy messages from an unknown person; likely from a guy of that company; not sure how to proceed ",04Jul2017,1
180,"Hey y'all

I'm pretty young, barely 21 years old. Quick version of my story would be: I've got some kind of French equivalent to a bachelor's degree in translation (French/English/Spanish), we call this a *licence* here for those who may know better (how ironical for someone who studied translation). Anyways, I've had enough of Uni and of studying in general, and in late May 2017 I passed my Cabin Crew Attestation with the purpose of becoming an air steward.

I've been sending applications to European airline companies for months, but in lack of positive answers I signed up as a barman in some remote shit hole for the summer. I started working yesterday, signed a contract up until August 31. Today I received an email from Transavia, a European carrier, saying I was qualified to their next recruiting session, on July 11. This is literally next week, in Paris. In the email they say their job opportunities are what we call here a *CDD*, which is a contract for a limited amount of time, ""over 2017's second semester"". Could be just one month, or even less than this for all I know.

What the f do I do? Do I give up the barman thing and go for it? Knowing I'm super short on cash right now and was really counting on the next 2 months. I mean it's just a recruiting session I'm not even guaranteed a job at the end of the day, and if I pass I don't even know how long they'll keep me.

She says it's for ""little kids"" and that ""nobody gets famous as a magician. Nobody cares about your silly magic shows, and nobody will come.""

182,"Long story short, I'm an older student due to a chain of negative events (24).

I got accepted as a transfer to one of the top public universities. The problem is that I can't picture myself living in the smaller, college town where it is located. I'm used to, and feel I need to be living in a bigger city.

I don't think I'd make it.

I have held professional jobs, and need to be living somewhere where I can expand professionally on my own while simultaneously finishing my degree. Further, I have other things I am eager to be doing and trying in life right now... and sitting in a college town is just not one of them. It's never been my thing. Even when I was a bit younger.

I've also been accepted to schools in the bigger city where I would like to live, but they are lower tier schools than the other.

I'm torn. I can't see myself giving up attending a top school after all that I went through, and I can't see myself living there long enough to finish. Going back to a ""college"" college would be culture shock. I wish I were past it at this point, and it is difficult to not have it finished to begin with.

206,"I'm a male student studying in university and I got to know this girl a few months ago in April 2017. I'm 22, she's 21. We met at a university event. She's from the same course as me but a different batch/intake. I do not have her phone number till now, only her Facebook.

So few weeks ago, I asked her out to watch a movie. I did not directly ask her 'Hey, wanna watch a movie?' face to face. No. What I did was, texting her through Facebook Messenger to ask her whether she has watched this movie. She said she hasn't. So I said great, let's go watch it together. She agreed and so we set a day two days later to watch it.

So two days later, on the day of the movie, we met up in campus and then went to the place which showed the movie. We walked to the cinema by the way. So along the journey to the cinema, we just talked like how friends would talk i.e asking about studies, favorite movies etc. Then we reached the cinema, went in and sat down. And then we talked a bit more before the movie started, about stuff like favorite food, favorite music etc. Once the movie started, we watched without talking. Well, I am not the type that talks during a movie. I would focus on the movie and watch in silence. I guess she is the same because she had told me not to tell her any spoilers if I knew any. So we did not talk during the movie.

Nothing happened in the theater between me and her. I did not try and put my hands around her shoulder, or touch her or anything like what you see in romantic movies. Should I have done so? But the thing is, I didn't know if us going out together was just us hanging out as friends or it was a date. The whole time I was thinking it was just us hanging out with each other like how friends would. And also, we did not hold hands, nor did I place my hands on any part of her.

Then after the movie ended, we left the cinema, then walked back to our university campus. The place where she stays is on campus too. So together we walked back while discussing about the movie.

Then, upon reaching her place, we stopped walking , and then faced each other. I told her I was going to get my bag (I left it in the lockers). Then she said she's going back to her room. So I said okay see you, bye, and waved bye to her. She then turned and walked in to her place.

Never seen her, talked or texted her after that, till two days later where I texted her on Facebook Messenger to ask some study-related question. She replied. I then shared with her a YouTube music video, saying how nice it is. Well, she hasn't replied ever since. By the way it was just a mainstream pop song. Surely her not replying has nothing to do with the thing I shared.

I do want to see her again. But I can't because we have no common classes/timetables, and the campus is big. The only way we would see each other on campus without arranging a time and place would be only through coincidence. And since she hasn't replied my last text, I don't feel like asking her to meet up.

What should I do? Did I do anything wrong? I really like her. I wouldn't want to make a wrong move or make a mistake.

tldr: I'm a 22 year old male university student. Asked a 21 year old girl who is the same course as me but different intake, whether she has watched this movie. She said no. I asked her to watch together. She said sure. Walked to the theater together from campus, watched the movie, then walked back to campus. The whole time with her, I did not do anything romantic like holding her hands, hugging her, placing my hands on her shoulders etc. The whole time, I thought it was just us two friends hanging out, not a date, and that her agreeing to go out with me,just me and her, was not because she liked me, but because I was her friend that asked her out to go see a movie, just like how if her female friend would ask her to go see a movie, she would go too.

Said goodbye to her after the movie and did not see her, talked to her or texted her till two days later. Asked her a study related question, she replied. Then shared with her a normal mainstream pop music video. She hasn't replied ever since, nor have I seen her ever again. And just to mention, in case you think what I shared is the cause of the problem, that maybe what I shared with her might have offended her or something, pretty sure its not. The video I shared has nothing to do with the fact she hasn't replied. It was just a mainstream pop music video. So, now what should I do?

My predicament: I have an amazing job. I love it, the people are fantastic, every thing is great. 

The place I used to work at, I absolutely hated. I was bullied regularly by the general manager and owner and absolutely detested it. It was obvious I would dread going to work there. I was asked to leave. Back then, even through the bullying, I thought I was friends with the GM. 

So I got a new job and am now very happy. The GM is not happy at my old job. She asked to meet up with me recently for a catch up. I explained how much I love my job. She suggested applying. I said go for it. 

She applied. She got an interview. The more I think of this, the more I absolutely hate the idea. She bullied me, she patronised me, belittled me and I ignored it because I don't like to focus on the negative parts of people, even though they are bad people. I tend to get used a lot. 

I struggle with anxiety as it is and the thought of working with this horrible woman is giving me anxiety attacks. I've had to be prescribed Valium on top of my current meds because I'm dreading the thought that she is successful. I honestly without a doubt hate this woman the more I think of it.

My current manager mentioned a few days ago that he interviewed her and she interviews well. He asked me if I thought she was any good. I didn't want to seem mean so I said she's a nice person but I don't like her as a manager. I hoped this would've spurned him a bit. 

She messaged me yesterday asking if they've said anything to me and tried to blackmail me to influence them on their decision. She asked to meet up. I told her I was busy. 

I am going into work tomorrow and I wanted advice about handling this situation. I don't think I could cope with the thought of working for her again. The thought fills me with dread and I have considered the possibility of having to quit if she is successful. Should I say anything to my manager tomorrow? I don't want to seem vindictive and I am in no way part of the hiring process and technically it is none of my business and I don't want to seem vindictive but I'm not sure how to cope with all of this. 

I've finally gotten over the way I was treated at my old job and I'm so happy now and it feels like she's trying to take this away from me. She's a textbook user and I'm an anxious mess.

222,"Hey everyone, sorry if this isn't exactly the right subreddit. i'm in kind of a tight spot. 
One of my coworkers treats me like garbage and insults me to my face and behind my back. They really ripped into me a few days ago. They do hardly anything while I usually wind up doing everything so I took these insults very personally. At our work we have an online survey that you can critique the service with. In a moment I'm ashamed of I wrote one insulting her work ethic. Now I hear they're looking for the IP address and are going to fire the person who did it. I unplugged my modem to change my IP address and now I'm worried if they're able to find my location through the old one? And if so, how long would it necessarily take them to get my address and find it? I'm trying to figure out what I need to do to get out of this and just quit regularly without too much pressure. Any help is very appreciated, i'm super worried right now. I know I messed up and I regret it badly. ",04Jul2017,5
223,"I've been seeing a girl for about a month now. We text every day and we have a lot in common, so it felt very natural to keep the conversation going day to day. We really clicked and we've had some great times together. Because of our work schedules and distance, we only get to see each other once a week.

This Friday, she stopped reading/replying to my texts. We were talking like usual when she disappeared mid-conversation. I figured maybe she got busy at work or her phone died (it's happened before, nbd), but she never texted me back. I sent her a ""checking in on you"" text on Saturday afternoon, still nothing. Sunday we were supposed to meet up but I still didn't hear from her. We had plans to hang out again today, so I sent her a short text, telling her I hope she's okay. 

She told me a couple weeks ago that if she ever goes dark for a period of time, it's probably because she's broken her phone, so I held out hope that maybe that's all that happened. Her phone backs up to the cloud so presumably she'd still have my number even if she lost her phone, and the messages I've sent her say they've been delivered but not read (she has read receipts on). I don't have Facebook but I was able to see she uploaded a photo yesterday, so hopefully that means she's all right. She's had some health issues before so I was mostly worried something had happened to her.

I'm just confused why she'd go quiet so suddenly. We haven't had any arguments or even minor disagreements; before she stopped replying, we were talking about her upcoming day trip to a park with her friends. I don't want to keep texting her because she's not seeing the ones I've sent, but I'm also not sure how to contact her without being weird in case she's ghosting me. We have a friend in common and I've thought about asking him to touch base with her on FB, but I don't know how to broach the subject because I'm afraid I sound a little obsessive. I care about her and I'd like to know what's going on, even if it comes out that she doesn't want to see me anymore. 

I guess my question is, what do I do from here? Should I wait for her to reply? Maybe I'm too close to the situation and can't see something that may be obvious to someone else.",04Jul2017,5
224,"Hi everyone. 
About 3 months ago, my best friend of 12 years and I got into an explosive fight. I had split up with my boyfriend of about 4 months, and out of spite, he called her and told her that I said horrible things about her and that I wasn't a good friend and didn't care about her. 

Long story short, I did in fact tell him some things about her, but not the way he said I did. I wanted to hook her up with one of his friends who seemed like a nice guy and so I had confided in him about her past relationship. Not intimate details but things like, I didn't think that was the right guy for her nor did I think she ever really fell for him the way she did with her previous boyfriend. I also confided in him about her relationship with her mom (bc he asked about her family, etc). This is not news or a secret really but he went back and twisted it all up and made it seem like I was talking crap about her. He also threw in a couple of lies, that I called her ""fat"" (which was never true, he did) and that I was grossed out by her. The real story is that she kissed me while we were super hammered and I told him I was grossed out because I felt like I was kissing my sister, not because I think she's gross. 

Instead of calling me or telling, she told him very personal things about me that I hadn't disclosed to him (previous relationship stuff, not his business). He was texting me these things and I didn't know who was telling him until about two hours later she called me flipping out saying I'm two-faced and wouldn't let me get a word in edge wise. We spent the next two days arguing over text and facebook messenger, she refused to believe anything I said. I was so pissed at both of them that I went to both of their friends and told them the ACTUAL shit-talk they had told me. Needless to say, that was a super immature move and I shouldn't have done that. Three months later and I've moved on and forgiven her and the entire situation. I understand she was hurt and he's a very convincing asshole. I wanted to write her a letter of apology along with a gift box with some little personal items but I don't know if I should or not. She's a very prideful person, she's been hurt a lot in her life so she's very defensive so I know she won't reach out to me even if she wanted to. I want to be the bigger person but I don't know if I should, or if I'm just wasting my time or overstepping my bounds. ",04Jul2017,1
226,"Hey everyone, 

I'm a 22 year-old marketing student from New York. I recently found someone on the East Coast who works a MAJOR sporting event in Los Angeles, CA. She said I can help work the event (even work with the athletes!!) for three days there. I'd get paid about a hundred bucks a day (which is decent). 

I've never been to Los Angeles before and am worrying how much I'll be spending out of pocket for airfare, hotel, food, transportation(probably so much for this one), and miscellaneous. 

**I think I could benefit from the experience, but will I just be burning money on this trip? Is this trip worth it for me?** I have some work experience, but even for 3 days, having a high responsibility to work with big name athletes is huge.

I can probably spend $500 on airfare, $100 per night hotel. I have no clue how to determine if it's worth it for me. 

Thank you!!!

Any help is great!! ",04Jul2017,1

228,"In a nutshell, I'm considering changing my major from Computer Science to something focused on marine life/ecosystems. Naturally, this is an intimidating idea because the two majors are very different in many ways. I consider them as practically opposite on the spectrum of science. Let's get into it.

I initially went to school for Mechanical Engineering. I did very well in my Calculus I class in high school and thought that Mechanical Engineering would be a good fit for me, although I didn't know the first thing about the field and what I'd necessarily be learning. I scraped through a year and a half of classes before failing out and completely disliking everything about my major. I found it extremely boring and thought that the job I'd end up getting would be just as boring. The last semester I was in school I changed my major at the last minute to Computer Science. I figured that I've always wanted to know more about computers, and found that those who did impressed me. So, I changed majors and then dropped out because my grades were so bad I couldn't take out student loans anymore. Spring semester went by, and I worked. It's summer now, and I just started a summer course in Calc III (one of the classes I failed back in the Fall). While optimistic about the potential career opportunities, I can't help but feel that I'm going to be surrounded by people I don't have anything in common with. I may be nerdy and interested in tech to an extent, but I also really enjoy outdoor activities. 

Like going to the CA coast.

Last night I drank with my roommate and we had a good time. Towards the end of the night I went to my room and watched some Seinfeld, specifically the episode where Jerry tells an old classmate that George is a marine biologist. Mid-episode I stopped watching and contemplated whether or not I'd enjoy a job like that. Maybe I would.

I've always had a fascination with aliens. The idea of a complex organism like ourselves out there in a different environment is a crazy concept. In my opinion, if someone wants to geek over aliens they should consider watching a nature documentary about marine life because it's CRAZY. These things float around in not air, but WATER. We can't do that. They look insane (I mean just look at octopus; what the f#ck is that thing???). And they live fairly differently from how we do as humans. Theres a relationship amongst the different species in an ecosystem that I don't necessarily understand. I definitely find it interesting.

Of course, I'm hesitant. I think what I'll do is try to sneak into a biology class of some sort in my free time and hear what they're talking about. I've also started watching ""CrashCourse Biology"" videos on YouTube. But I'm not sure if biology is a good idea. My very brief research on careers in Marine Biology tell me that jobs are scarce and don't pay much. Not promising at all compared to CS. I think I'd enjoy a different branch of biology as well; animals are cool.

I think CS is a promising field to get into, but I wonder if I'd be happier working in biology. And it's gonna get ugly when I tell my parents I want to change my major already before even taking a single class for CS. That's unrealistic. I'll stick to it for the semester, and look up more and more about biology. If it really clicks with me (because so far nothing has), then I think it'll be time to make the change.

229,"I got hired in October or so. The person in question is my boss, the store manager, and is a girl. Around December she hired one of her friends to help out with the holiday season, and her friend and I butted heads hard. A few weeks pass, and the friend starts collecting money from other employees to pay for engagement photos for the boss. Now normally, i don't know these people, so fuck em. But... everyone else did it, so I guess. I chipped in $10. Fast forward to now, and the boss has sent out wedding invites. AFAIK, every employee of our store has gotten one, except me. Including low level employees who work 20 hours a week at MOST, and were hired in February or so. The Boss and I have always been ""friendly"". However, one of the first conversations we had was about politics. Long story short, she stressed the importance of voting, and I said something to the effect of ""yeah let's please not elect a racist"" and she replied with ""better a racist than a murderer."" And I was like oh great. She's one of those. So yeah, honest to god that a few other minor, MINOR times we've butted heads, but like I said we've always remained friendly and talked about tons of stuff while at work. Movies, games, etc. so I sent her a direct message on Facebook that said ""hey, I'm just gonna ask, did I not get an invite on purpose?"" And no response and of course she didn't view it, yet is updating Facebook almost minute-ly. Ideally, she'd say yeah it's really only big enough for close friends and family, at that point I'd have evidence it's personal and call it quits. Meaning not bother feigning conversation, and on the off chance we work together again (she's currently deciding whether or not to change stores for more money), keep the chatter to professional only. But as of now, about an hour and a half after I've sent it, no response. Thoughts and advice super appreciated. Thanks!",04Jul2017,1

Even if I manage to find a job for now, it will only keep me busy for about a month. Once school in September with 5 courses, most with labs and an online course,  working a regular job would be inconvenient. To save time, I would need to find a job close to school but that would suck now as I live about an hour away. This is assuming I find a job only being able to work hard for about a month and drifting off to the weekends after. If I don’t find a job, I wasted time applying for nothing. 
 
I am thinking about freelancing because it takes the inconvenience away.  I would be able to use the internet now and at school. Setting my own hours is something could help me stay focused in school and I won’t end up kicking myself later for sacrificing my GPA and future career prospects for a measly part time job.

239,"So I'd like to start this off by saying that me and my close friends are all quite argumentative. As a result of this we very frequently argue and have lots of arguments both in real life and in group chats. 

Now although this arguments never affect our friendship, I am always left with a horrible feeling after one; like I let myself down.

I have come to realise a trend in most of these arguments that the argument devolves from a discussion about an issue (E.G. What we will do next Wednesday) to simply them holding on to their argument just to wind me up. It always ends up with me giving them solid facts and reasons for my point and me asking them why they think their option is the best; and then they tell me they have only been doing it because it annoys me.

I would try to ignore the messages when I see their messages turn to mockery and winding me up, but whenever I do, they notice and start to say 'birdodiddy pussied out' or something like that. So I want to know, how could I get out of a crucial argument that is important to me (not just an argument about opinions but about something that will affect me) before it turns in to a battle of winding me up?

Any responses are appreciated.

Do you have any advice on what I should do or is there anything I should know about before going to the gym tomorrow?

252,"So I got a part time job at a somewhat well known grocery chain, and it pays min wage which is 10.50 in my county/ state. However I am currently experiencing work burnout because this is not my only job. I work 2 jobs, and over the course of the past month I have worked plenty of 13 hour days, as many as 7 days a week. 

So feeling terrible I penned a resignation letter and planned to drop it on the counter and not show up the next day, and the date I was planning to do this was tomorrow. I am still tired and burned out from working 2 manual labor type jobs, however now I don't know if it's the best thing. The money was good, I was/am getting 6 paychecks a month. However I don't need this money anymore.

On one side I am thinking about my mental health, which undoubtedly has declined recently as I don't enjoy my part time job at all and it has been affecting my work performance at my other job in a field I would like to pursue. Getting up in the morning is painful. I dislike the people in general I work with at the part time job in question and I would never want to move up. 

I have never given a 2 week notice in my life and wouldn't plan on doing so at this job, references be damned. I knew full well I wasn't going to make this a long term job and am not even going to put employment at this ""grocery"" chain on my resume.
