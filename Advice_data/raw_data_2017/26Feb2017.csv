4,"So I have crush on a guy, who is a year older than me (senior). He is the brother of my classmate, I don't really know her but one of my friends is very close with her. Also, I have a lot of senior friends and they are (mostly) all close to him. We know each other by names but we don't know each other (do you know what I mean). And there is another friend of mine who is also close to him and she has a crush on him too. He knows about her feelings towards him but he said that he has a crush on someone else. Now, this girl doesn't know that I'm interrested in him but she tells me things about him all the time. Like: 'oh hes actually a real player'  'he is really hot' 'but he isnt someone who would date someone younger that him' The thing is: I know that he will never like me (logically, we dont even know each other properly and I'm an awkward mess and don't know how to make the first move. And I'm also afraid of what my senior friends are going to think when I tell them that I have a crush on him). But I can't help but like him more day by day. 

So, do you have any tips for me to either forget him or either let him know (in a not-awkward way) about my feelingd towards him.

I'm a male teenager that always get feelings for girls way out of my age zone, like 30 years old. I've never really got any feelings for girls around my age because of how useless it would be even to date, knowing most of them will just end up breaking up with me in a few years. Most girls now are immature, and I just don't like it. It saddens me to not be able to even have the chance to date someone older because they would seem horrible for going out with some teen.

12,"I bought a phone (mobile/cell phone), It was used but...barely, It worked perfectly fine other than an issue with the battery where it wouldn't charge past 72%. I contacted the phone manufacturer to see if it was a known issue/software bug etc. They checked my phones details and said ""ohhh don't worry about that, your phone is still under warranty, we will send you a prepaid bag..you can send it off and we will fix it for you for free"". The bag arrived, I put it in a box, wrapped it up in bubble wrap etc, put that inside the protective bag they sent...took it to the post office and got some lithium ion battery stickers etc and sent it off. I got a phone call from a 3rd party repair centre who fixes devices on behalf of the manufacturer to tell me they had received it and it was their policy to see some ""proof of purchase"" which I provided by email shortly after. They phoned me again the next day to say ""everything is almost done, we just need to know what network you were on in order to restore the previous settings, and then we can send it back ASAP"". Today (2 days after the last phone call) I got a letter through the post... it says they haven't fixed it because it received unauthorised repair which voids the warranty, and that I have to pay £14.40 in order to get it back, or it will be ""environmentally destroyed"".

Obviously they have me by the balls here, because I'm not going to let my phone which is worth about £400 be destroyed for the sake of £15 but it also feels like a scam.

17,"I have been continually sick for a couple months now, and it is really annoying. It's nothing bad, barely more than a cold, but it is the last straw on what I can handle right now. 

A little less than a year ago I cut contact with my mother after friends saw me having a panic attack from her being unreasonably angry, since then I've worked out that a lot of my current problems are caused directly by how she treated me as a child. I had hoarding problems for a long time, still do, but they're manageable now. I am also most likely bipolar, have huge problems with anxiety and eating disorders and what not. On top of that I am transgender and have been waiting around 11 months to see someone about that, with my estimated time being 14 months. I have dysphoria over my chest, hips and face, plus general dislike of my body overall. 

Obviously these things mean that I have self esteem issues and am constantly second guessing myself, obsessing over what I think others think of me. In spite of that all of this would've been manageable, had I not been so damned sick all the time! No doubt that it's my mental state affecting my physical state, but it means I can't go to the gym or bother cleaning up, things that can make me feel slightly better, or stable at the least.

26,"Hey all,

so I'm in university and about a month ago on the first day of this one class, the teacher went around taking a photo of each student 

he said it was to remember who's is who for when he marks stuff, but isn't our names and our student id numbers good enough for that?

honestly, I was uncomfortable but too shy to say anything when it happened because everyone else didn't seem to be making a deal out of it (and I'm not sure if they are okay or weirded out about it but I didn't want to be the one to look like I was making a deal out of nothng)

but honestly, I'm still uncomfortable with the idea that he has photos of us all. it just seems so uncessary. even if he wanted to remember what the person looked him, when he's marking our work, why would a physical image of the person be necessary to mark the word? shouldn't he be basing it on the work itself?

29,"I was threatening to hurt myself. The cops were legally required to take me to the hospital. Apparently If someone is at risk of harming themselves the cops are legally required to take that person to a mental hospital and get them checked out. 

When I arrived the mental ward I saw another patient, a man, fully restrained and in cuffs. The cop supervising him was yelling aggressively and telling him that he wasn't going to take his cuffs off unless he ""acted like a human being"". The cop was smiling and the man just kept asking to be let out. He was laying in his restrains calmly. The man was clearly uncomfortable and the weight of his entire body was on his arms handcuffed being his back.

I was part of another incident... Me and another patient were having a conversation while waiting to be accessed. This over patient was talkative, friendly and polite despite talking very fast and probably being manic or high as far as I could tell. The other patient was not rude or aggressive so I was surprised when a nurse and a cop came over to tell us to stop talking or we would be physically  forced back into our rooms. The nurse who came over to talk to us even rolled her eyes and him and said something like ""Ok ok !! "" and laughed. 

After the other patient decided to go back to his room I went up to the front desk and said something along the lines of this.. ""I get that you can't talk to patients in certain states of mind, but I feel that the way you treated that other patient wasn't proper."" Anyways the nurse stared at me and said ""Do you need anything?"" I was shocked at her reply so I stood there in shock for a few seconds and the nurse then said ""You can't stand there."" I went back to my room with my heart sinking. 

The incident takes the cake though.

After the previous incidents I was very wary of the nurses and doctors. I didn't like how they treated other patients and being person who will stand up for others if they aren't treated nicely I was upset after seeing all those things happen. I also had some private family business on my mind that I didn't want to tell the doctors about. 

When the doctor came into my room and I voiced my concerns about the previous incidents in a loud but non violent or threatening way he said ""we don't tolerate abuse here."" I also told him I didn't want to talk about my private family business. The doctor told me he could medicate me to ""calm me down"" and threatened me with a one month stay for ""talking back to him"" and not talking to him about what went on that day at home. 

Reddit I am naturally cynical of authority because I believe its important to be critical of the world around us. But Im not hateful to authority. It has its place and usually is a force for good.

But I am really scared about what happened and so sad that there is probably lots of people out there that are mistreated or even taken advantage of by those with power and we don't even know about it, or there is nothing done about it.

37,"Hey,

I'm in a sticky situation here. I'm sitting here filled with anxiety, worrying about what lies ahead. Bottom line, I'm an 18 year old only child, living at home (with my mum and step-dad) who is enrolled in a film production course at University. I'm still in my first year and am already struggling to meet deadlines. This is totally my fault as I procrastinate far too much. 

I'm a socially inept person as it is, not entirely incapable of leaving the house by any stretch of the imagination, however I 'prefer not to' engage with people I don't know should I be given the option. I've also fought self-confidence issues my entire childhood and now into adulthood, I'm overweight: 5'8""/220lbs, and these two in combination make it very hard for me to attain any form of relationship. In-fact up until this point I have yet to engage in any form of serious relationship, something that I think I could really use right now. 

Since I opted to stay home and commute to university (for financial reasons) I'm much further out than almost everyone on else on my course, and this in turn does make things harder for me. Whether it be renting out equipment and relying on public transport (haven't passed my test yet), or just simply being motivated enough to get up at 06:00 every morning to commute 50 miles and back, just to get up the next morning and do it again. My current project demands a reconstruction of a chosen scene from a chosen director of choice, however upon shooting and reviewing footage I feel that my work is of significantly less standard than anyone else on my course, and simply will not meet the standards of the project brief. I see people in my social media streams with teams of like 8 people, working with green-screen and professional actors, when here I am who's cobbled together a rushed script and shot it with 4 friends who were willing to help me out. It makes me nervous as hell. 

Not to mention that I missed the rough cut meeting last Monday which involved the course leader and an editing professional reviewing the work we had done so far and advising us on what to do next. Now the fine cut deadline is approaching, tomorrow in fact (Monday 27th Feb), and I couldn't be more nervous. A large portion of me is reluctant to go in period, however another part of me knows that if I don't go in again, it's going to raise questions with the course leader in regards to my dedication to the course. The people I have spent time with and gotten to know on my course have become somewhat estranged, considering I only really speak to them when I go in to uni, and haven't been in for nearly 3 weeks, making me somewhat nervous as to what they think of me, and perhaps what they view as a lack of effort on my part (The past 2 weeks being dedicated production/editing time, meaning we're not required to attend).

I'm just really damn anxious right now, and it's kind of just all hit me in one big blow this evening. I don't know what I'm going to do and I honestly fear for my future. 

Any advice/guidance or general comments would be greatly appreciated. ",26Feb2017,2

42,"Hi guys, so a little backstory: in college me and ""Kathleen"" kinda dated/slept together for a solid year. Eventually we broke up in a not-so-nice way, but we are still friends to this day. She immediately then started dating a good friend of mine ""Craig"". After all this I left the country for work for about 1.5 yrs. When I came back, I was looking for a place to live and Craig/Kathleen offered me their spare bedroom. Craig and I discussed the arrangement for quite a while and agreed that we trusted each other and that nothing should be weird and it was a good arrangement for us in every way except the possible middle-school drama of it all.

Anyway fast-forward to the last few weeks: Kathleen is often home with me a lot while Craig is at work and is constantly craving attention, not sexual, just social. We're still friends, and nothing has or ever will happen ever again between us. The thing is, I feel like she's using me as a surrogate boyfriend whenever Craig isn't around. Whenever it's just the two of us at home and I'm busy, i.e: not watching movies with her, smoking weed, etc. it's all just sulking and general moodiness. 

Is there any way I can tell her that this isn't acceptable for her to act this way? She seems unable to grasp our relationship in its current terms. I don't mind slowly sacrificing my ""status"" with her until I become the boring roommate archetype, but this doesn't seem to be making her realize why I'm acting the way that I am.

I'm in my twenties and he's 3 years younger. I was either never home or I came home so late we would lay on the same bed and talk for an hour before one of us fell asleep. 

I found my own place 3 weeks later. I started working a lot and going out more and so did he so our communication decreased. He has a gf that he's been with for 7 months and I am in a new 3 week relationship. I am not sexually active rn. I was when I moved out with my cousin and our sex life was something we discussed. So I haven't seen him since last December and he came over to catch up. 

We went out to eat and then came back to my place to talk. My past and present sex life was in discussion. We were laying down when we started falling asleep like old times. He then leaned over, groped me, and pulled down my pants. He stopped and he left. I didn't say a word out of shock. I'm a very open person and clearly too trusting. How could someone I considered my best friend and my favorite cousin do something like this?

Anyway, I'm still in shock and I needed to tell someone. I considered telling my new bf but I am hesitant about telling anyone because I just want this to go away.

52,"Recently I've been feeling increasing levels of inadequacy and insecurity, specifically around my classmates (I'm 19 years old &amp; studying at college). My class is on the small side - there's around 15 of us. I've been on the course for over a year so everybody is very well acquainted and it's a pretty close knit group.

There isn't anybody in the class who I dislike, but out of all of them only 3 of them are what I would call friends. My closest friend, I'll call her B, is probably the most adored person in the class. She's the class clown and everyone finds her hilarious. She's also very laid back and confident. I'd go out on a limb and say I'm one of her best friends (in the class) - she talks to me more than any of the others, and we usually sit together, etc.

The problem is, I feel invisible when B is in the room. Because she's so funny, the attention is almost always on her. Recently, I've started to feel very envious of her. Part of this is because nobody in the class ever actually acknowledges me (apart from the 3 who are my close friends), and I've started noticing the contrast between how they treat me, and how they treat B. Weirdly, I never feel resentful towards her over it - I only feel angry at everybody else. 

To add a little context, I do have borderline personality disorder. This means I suck when it comes to dealing with perceived rejection. One of the biggest ways BPD affects me personally is that I crave attention like it's oxygen. I have a constant need for validation. It's something I'm very ashamed of, and something that I try very hard to control, (I'm currently receiving DBT). However, these feelings have been getting increasingly more difficult to hide over the past few months. 

It's gotten to the point now where I am walking out of class several times a day because I need to lock myself in the bathrooms for a while while I cry. And every single time, its triggered by the same thing - my friend getting attention. I would trade in my soul to be able to make people laugh like she does, and for people to be comfortable enough around me that they could joke around with me like they do with her. 

I've started to contemplate dropping out of college because I don't know if I can deal with these feelings anymore. When I started college I was doing pretty well, and my self esteem was the highest it had been for a long time.

53,"My friends and I are in college and wanted to go somewhere fun for a vacation. The trip would be me, my girlfriend, my friend (the subject of this post), and his girlfriend My dad decided to be awesome and scored us a super nice place to stay near a great location (won't be specific because my friend uses reddit), and a bunch of stuff he really shouldn't have paid for. Today we were hanging out at my friend's place and everything was fine for a while and then his girlfriend just walked into his bathroom and started texting him about how something was wrong and she didn't want anyone else to notice or something along those lines. I saw the texts put of the corner of my eye. Anyway, my friend asks me to give him and his girlfriend some alone time and about an hour later I text him and ask if I should go home, he says yes, and makes his friend drive me home. I asked him if we could just hang out later and all he said was maybe. I asked him if he was still gonna be able to go on the trip and he didn't respond. I'm not really sure what I should from here but the trip is in 2 weeks and this is not the first time something like this has happened. I don't want to uninvite them but I feel like they have something they need to work out and the best place to do it would not be on a vacation with me and my girlfriend.",26Feb2017,1
54,"My fiancee and her roommate are currently on a lease together. She has two dogs, one registered as a service animal, the other a stray we adopted. When they initially moved in, they only had the service animal, which kept them from having to pay the initial pet deposit and pet fee. She later had to pay both, a total of $500, once the apartment office found out she had the new puppy. (She came home to a notice on the door stating they had 24 hours to pay or have animal control remove the dog since she had the dog for a couple of months and hadn't notified the office yet) As of now, both of her dogs are on file with the office.

Her roommate then brings in his girlfriend, claiming she was thrown out of her house. They brought her dog with them, a one year old lab/pit. Within a day or two of them bringing the dog in, my fiancee's puppy started getting physically ill. Our friend who works with dogs on a daily basis said it might be a symptom of stress, likely caused by them bringing a new dog into her environment. Her puppy has already had several medical issues already, so seeing her continue suffering is less than ideal for either of us.

Our problem is what we can do to get the dog removed. Nothing on the lease says anything about breed restrictions, since some will straight out ban any kind of pit mixes. There is a part about removal of animals due to complaints, which there easily could be, since the few times they've taken the dog up to the complex's dog park, it's gotten aggressive with some of them, including one of our friend's dogs, who would be willing to make the call if needed.

Alternately, we've considered going to the office ourselves and letting them know the roommate brought another dog in but hasn't come down to register it, but that she isn't comfortable having it there. What the office staff could do about it, we're not sure. Our biggest concern is that if we wait too long to make a decision, the same thing that happened with the puppy will occur, and there'll be a notice on the door about another fee. While we aren't worried so much about that happening and them taking the dog, we are worried that because it would be the third notice we've gotten for some type of lease violation (one for the puppy, second for a late rent payment) that it could wind up in their eviction.

TL;DR Roommate moves in girlfriend's dog, won't get rid of it on his own, need the best way to get rid of it before it hurts our dog even more.",26Feb2017,1
55,"I really only switch shifts when it's convenient for me, always have. But he's telling me he had something planned for tomorrow before telling me this. He didn't even ask if i wanted to switch and i'm kinda pissed off. I've already told him no, he's starting to be a dick about it.

At my last job i had this coworker who always asked me to switch shifts, sometimes it was convenient for me, like him taking my shitty saturday shifts. However it got to the point where he got ahold of my number and kept texting me to go in for him. Eventually i had to tell my boss because he pestered me for 7 consecutive weeks and asked me to take his shift when i had class all day.

But he's my friend which makes things a little more complicated, the other guy i mentioned i had no problem telling my boss about because i didn't like the guy (he made me really uncomfortable and sexually harassed me, and i'm a guy). Like if i take his shift then he'll think it's fine to just do what he wants, if i don't he'll be mad.

I work for my parent's business. But I am deeply unhappy. My health is at its worst, as I am recovering still from a stroke I had a few years ago. I'm dealing with what could possibly be a tumor or cyst in my tongue, on top of 2 benign tumors I already have in my boob, gastritis, hemhorroids (gross, I know), and im overweight. I'm constantly stressed out, anxious, or depressed. When I had the stroke, my life changed. I used to do hair, which was my passion but the stroke affected my hand mobility + fine motor skills. I am pretty upset writing this because when you're young, you aren't supposed to be dealing with shit like this. I'm upset because I have lost hope. It hurts me that I am dealing with this much at this age. I am reaching out to anyone who reads this as a means of the possibility of waking up something inside me. I am upset because I see how great everyone else is doing, and I know if I hadn't have had the stroke I would be successful and happy.

61,"So I've (21F) had a bit of an issue lately with people making passes at me without my realizing. Twice this week, actually. The first one was in my math class. Super cute guy, says ""we should study together sometime, I suck at math"" and I accidentally rejected him since the implied hanging out flew over my head. I said ""oh but I suck at math too"". Thankfully we kept talking in the hallway but I feel like I shot him down. Still unsure if he was actually flirting, really. Another instance was a few hours ago. A couple people knocked on my door asking for my roommate. I said where she might be, and one of the guys came in and said hi, and gave me a high five. It was really weird. My roommate came back and said he asked her if I was single. This one was seriously so obvious that I don't know how I missed it. Is this an everyone problem? How can I, as someone with low self esteem, realize that yes, people do like me? This stuff is constantly flying over my head and I feel like I've missed out on so many opportunities. Not sure how to pick up on this stuff.",26Feb2017,2
62,"I'm going to be vague on purpose but leave important details in.

I'm an early twenties female who works at a small store in a small town.  Anyway, one day this guy came through my line, he's about mid fifties. He started to kind of, idk, I guess flirt with me? He was asking me if I grew up around here, if I go to school, etc. I answered his questions because alarm bells weren't really going off at this point. I am in college and as it turns out, he majored i what I'm majoring in. Okay cool, whatever. When he left, he gave me this really uncomfortable look and was like ""I'll see you around, [name.]"" Side note: I find it creepy when customers use my name anyway.

So then after that he started coming into the store fucking CONSTANTLY. I haven't asked my coworkers if he comes in when I'm not working, but literally I can 100% without fail guarantee he'll come in at least once on days that I'm working. It's been about 2-3 weeks and I haven't had one fucking day where he didn't come in. Another side note is that I'm married, so I try to hand him his change with my left hand purposefully showing off my ring, etc, to not embarrass him but get the point across. Well this caused a problem last week.

Last week he came in 3 times in about 20 minutes. Kept ""forgetting"" something or whatever. While looking at my ring, he began to talk about jealousy and lust. I freaked the fuck out on the inside and kept looking over my shoulder for the rest of my shift. My radar was going off so bad after that. Then the other night he kept asking me what college I want to transfer to after this one and I told him I didn't know (even though I do) because at this point I'm afraid he's trying to get more information in order to full on fucking stalk me.

Whenever I tell anyone about this, like my manager for instance, they all say ""Oh he's just not getting the point"" ""He's just friendly"" ""he's probably harmless"" etc etc etc. This makes me feel like I'm just over reacting but honestly the dude makes me feel very unsafe. Just the fact that he comes in so often, asks me so many questions, the jealousy thing he talked about, and one day when I was not on the register he purposefully took the long way around to the door just to walk past me and didn't say anything but I could see him staring at me out of the corner of his eye. He always says my name in the creepiest way as well and I've honestly considered just quitting my job because it's so stressful.

Am I over reacting? If I'm not, what should I do? Shit, even if I am, what should I do because the mental stress is getting to be too much

One with a responsible driven adult, nerdy, smart, classy, doesn't like partying all the time, and has long term potential for a serious relationship, etc. But then he meets girls at bars or tinder who maybe fit one of those criteria but who sleep with him the first day they met him and usually the opposite of classy and no drive and likes to party all the time, etc..

But I'm just feeling so lost and I still don't know what to do with my life. I really don't want to go back to school, I have no desire to. :/

I've been wanting to be a flight attendant for so long, but in the end I always am being rejected. I hardly can make it every month paying my bills with the job I have. I'm a seasonal sales associate at a department store, one week I'll have about 33 hours and the next week I'll have 0, it all depends on what hours I can pick up. I have been applying for new jobs everyday. I love working with the public and I'm very personable and friendly.

My grandparents just tell me to keep applying for jobs until I find something that I'll really like. I'm just tired of working my ass off at the current job I have, and the pay is not worth it.

I'm just here to get all of this off of my chest. I know my family can see that I'm upset and depressed with trying to find another job and trying to make something out of myself. I just want to be successful in life, be comfortable, and I really want to just travel the world. I just feel like I'm just going with the flow, and it's really not taking me anywhere.

98,"So 2 years ago my little sister was working in our hometown at Starbucks. There was this VERY nice attractive 30 something year old man, we will call him Bob, that always came in to buy a drink. My little sister found out he worked across the street as a sales clerk at a grocery store. 

She admits she was a little shocked because he really seemed like a ""Businessman"" with the way he dressed and held himself. 
No big deal. 

Fast forward a few months later and one of my sisters coworkers (who was 16) comes into the store and tells my sister the following story. 

""Yesterday as I was walking to my car after my shift and Bob pulls up in his car and hands me this card and then smiles and drives off""

The card was a black business card with a red rose and no name or number, just the phrase ""I know a masterpiece when I see one"". 

The coworker tells my sister ""haha I get hit on all the time lol"" and despite my sister trying to convince her that this is a bit strange, the girl laughs it off. 

It has been quite sometime since I heard this story (2 years). And after recently looking into the Sex-trafficking business I am a little concerned.

100,"Ok so I'm looking for some advice..  We recently got our kitchen completely re worked. New everything. Was a fairly small company that took it on. Like four guys.  but I learned that one of the guys decided to take it upon himself to text my partner and then started sending dick pics. Then on his last visit..  Decided that he would inappropriately touch my partner,  pulling at her shorts and what not.  She obviously said no! Tried to get him off. And didn't.   She told me what happened.. And to say I was devastated was un understatement.  But.. She did say she didn't want to go to the police as she doesn't want the hassle of court etc..  She showed me the texts and whilst she was responding to the texts which she admits was wrong.. She in no way insinuated she wanted anything, other than texting. She admits she was wrong. 
Now..  I called his boss who was obviously very sympathetic but also.. Kinda said it's nothing to do with him but doesn't want his business going down woth it..  So he told me he has let the guy go..  My partner has told me I need to put this in the past and move on.

But I can't. So 
I managed to track down where the guy lives.. And found out he's still working for the same company.  Obviously his boss doesn't care that much about reputation.  Whether or not he believes that the guy was forceful or not.  He admitted to the boss that he did sleep with my partner. A paying customer of 6 grand..  Knowing fine well she had a partner and a four year old.   He could be doing this to every customer..  

I'm in a dilemma..   I know where he stays.. The angry part of me wants to bust in his house and beat the guy senseless.  Just to let him know he can't do that!!! And he doesn't get away with it..  
The revengefull side of me wants to destroy this guys reputation.. Spread the word, let every potential customer know that he's a sexual deviant aswel as the boss not giving a shit what happens.

104,"My mom (54) recently confessed to me that she wants to divorce my dad (same age). They've been married for over 20 years. He cheated on her multiple times and is probably still doing so, plus he's pretty mean to her. I assume at one point they loved each other and were normal but after they had kids and separate careers (dad is retired navy, she was a federal employee) they just quit on their marriage but never actually divorced. They were both great parents but pretty shitty spouses to each other. Anyway, she wants to get divorced which I totally support. She only has only $4,000 in her own personal savings. She doesn't have a pension because she got cancer and had to stop working (she's been cancer free for three years). She gets zilch now and I am not even sure how that happens for federal employees with almost 20 years of service. She does have $150K in her TSP which she can touch when she's 62. She wants to move away from my dad and on her own. I don't have the best relationship with my mom. We just don't get along very well but I still love her and am concerned about her well-being.

At the moment I [F25] am happily married [M25] and we have an almost 2YO son. We are both active duty navy so we are both very busy. Luckily we make some decent money to live comfortably. I've lended both my mother and my brother a lot of money in the past and I'm kind of still supporting my brother which is an unrelated situation. 

She hasn't asked yet, but should I help my mom financially through her divorce? What if she can't find a place to live? Or make money? How do I help her when I already have my own family to take care of? I honestly don't want to involve myself but I'll feel horrible turning a blind eye and muting it. I feel like I have to help...

TLDR; parents getting divorced. Mom doesn't have a lot of money to be on her own. What resources does she have? Should I get involved even when I have my own family?",26Feb2017,3

He seemed nervous at first but he came in even with me wearing a very revealing gown with good cleavage. He went into my room when I made drinks saying he was going to the bathroom and he sat on my bed, I scared him by whispering on the bed behind him the drinks are ready.

We talked for a bit on the bed and I gave him surefire compliments of his so-and-so, he seemed to really be shocked by it. I knew he was trying to get with this mean girl who he knew a while ago but... I kissed him. He seemed still stunned but pulled away after a few seconds, after that I pressed him on the bed and even had my breast on his chest as we talked and was going to kiss him again, he looked like he wanted too, he waited till I got closer and closer, closed his eyes like he was really thinking hard on it...

Then he stopped me. He claimed I didn't like him, he wasn't going to be with someone who was going to play with him and when I asked if he was choosing the other girl it was basically that.

Since then I haven't felt very well. I can't bring myself to take my medicine. I can't eat, I can't sleep without feeling my heart ache from nightmares. I feel deathly sick and I left home. I don't know how to do anything anymore, what it is... what I did. I thought everything was perfect... we're equally attractive but he was in my bed, I was so close... Tbh, I can't feel my heartbeat anymore or if I do it's very faint... it matches how I feel tbh.

As of now, I spend every weekend thinking of how I could at least take a step in the proper direction or find someone who could help me with and through this.

122,"I'm 19. I was raised in a household that didn't drink at all. Ever. I was raised to believe that if someone gets drunk you cannot reason with them. They are not themselves and if it's a man who is drunk, you have to walk on eggshells because if you make him mad he will hurt you. I've never really been exposed to it and have never drank myself. 

However, I'm in college and while I want to wait until I'm 21 to drink, a lot of friends I have are drinking and that scares me. 

I'm really don't think it's okay to get so drunk you puke because that means you've had too much and it's not healthy. So that isn't the problem. But someone who is drinking responsibly still scares me. 

I'm terrified of looking my boyfriend in the face when he's drunk and him not really being there. I'm afraid that when he drinks, even though he says he gets happier, that I would make him mad and he wouldn't be able to control himself. He's never shown any kind of tendency like that while sober but I'm still scared that alcohol would make him angry. 

I just really feel like I need to get over this fear I have because I can't avoid it forever and it isn't fair to think poorly of people for drinking or to be scared of them. Even if I don't like drinking and choose not to participate in it, I can't live my life fearing anyone who touches alcohol.

130,"Hi! 

I need some advice on what I should say to my friends/other school students as to why I was away for two weeks. (I'm a 15 year old Australian by the way) 
I was away due to me fixing my pilonidal cyst/sinus. If you don't know what it is, don't Google it, kind of nsfw. To sum it up, It's a disease(?) where a hair follicle gets lodged between a butt crack and ends up growing inside, eventually causing a cyst. Very painful. I had it fixed at the end of last year and I was away for the rest of the time at school (3 weeks + all of school holidays) but no many people noticed I was gone due to a few people going on holiday so it was common for people to be missing. I was good to go back at the start of this year but has to be careful. Well three weeks ago I noticed it has come back so we decided to have surgery again but to have a different procedure so I wouldn't be away as long (2 weeks). It's now been two weeks since surgery and I'm ready to go back to school tomorrow but I'm not sure what to say to people if they ask why I was gone. At the moment, my teachers, SO and a friend know why I'm gone but the rest still don't know. 

Should I tell them straight up why I was gone? Should I just say I had something done to my back? Or should I just tell them I don't want to talk about it? 

Thankyou for your time :D

135,"So basically I'm the kind of person who has a very difficult time finding people I don't mind being around.  Even when I do find those kinds of people, like the couple of friends I have, I almost always prefer being alone over being around others.  
This makes it hard for me to make and keep friends that I enjoy being around.  
  
I've read similar things from other people, and a general trend is that they seem to be unlikable people that others avoid or they think they're better than everyone else.  I definitely don't feel like I'm better than everyone else.    
  
I'm not an unlikable person either.  In fact, it's quite the opposite.  People love being around me and generally enjoy my company.  I tend to get people attracted to me(in a non-sexual way) very easily without ever trying.  
I can't explain why, but maybe it's just my general happy carefree attitude combined with how nice I am on the outside. 
  
These relationships are one-sided though.  I don't feel as happy being around others as they do being around me.  
    
At 22 years old, I found a girl I liked enough to ask out.  It took me about a year to even realize that I liked her.  And we dated for about 2 years.  
A few months ago I cancelled my engagement and ended that 2 year long relationship with her, even though I once thought I loved her.    
At first I was hoping that some time away from her would make me realize what I had and how much I missed her....But basically ever since she moved out, I've felt so much more comfortable with my life.  Like a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders that I didn't even realize I had.  
  
She wasn't controlling or manipulative in any way either.    Our relationship was honestly pretty great.  
  
But it doesn't seem to matter whether it's co-workers, friends, family, or significant others.... I'm always happier and more energetic when I'm alone.  
  
The idea of being alone still bothers me though.  
I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm looking for here, but there it is.  
  
Should I try harder to meet more people, even if it makes me unhappy?  Do I get more comfortable with the idea of being alone?  Or maybe something else?",26Feb2017,1

I have checked my social media accounts and they are still registered to my email address, which is odd because I am sure these sites won't allow two accounts with the same email address to coexist.

My theories are:

1) The automatic emailer bots for these sites confused my email with his as both of our names are quite similar, so both of us receive the same emails.

2) He made a mistake and typed in my email address instead of his.

3) My email address was recycled and it used to be his. However, I have owned this email address for almost 10 years and this has only started happening a year ago, so I find this unlikely.

141,"Feels like I'm on an episode of ""Strange Addictions"" but here it goes....

I'm in my early 20's and my addiction to Youtube has ruined my life since I was 14. I acknowledge this is pitiful but I've reached my last straw and don't know what to do. Let me start off by saying that it all started when I was beat up in middle school and thus, caused me to develop severe social anxiety, depression, low self esteem, and no desire to form relationships with people. As a result, I opted to lock myself in my room after school every day for the past 9 years and watch videos instead. It took reaching my low point last week to realize that getting beat up and being lonely all these years fueled my addiction.

I literally spend up anywhere between 5-12+ hours of Youtube daily (from when I wake up to when I go to sleep at 3 in the morning), just surfing for any video to push off my daily responsibilities and problems.  What started off as enjoyment, eventually turned into skipping classes, birthday parties, weekends out with friends, and time with family.  I just graduated from college and have no desire to find a job, manage my finances, or do anything that requires maturity.  My girlfriend broke up with me because I had no plans after graduation (understandable from her perspective). I'm slowly losing my friends and sense of self respect because of my online addiction. My parents have brought this up to me many times, and I've failed to acknowledge my problem until now. I'm still young and can possibly have a future ahead of me but I don't know how to break this addiction. I feel like a disgrace because I ruined my relationships, job opportunities, along with my grades in high school and college to lay on my bed and watch videos all day. When others went out to concerts and parties, I stayed in my apartment watching videos all day. It even comes to the point where I run out of channels to watch so I just type in random words in the search bar to keep watching. When I see others live this lavish life online, I think to myself I should be living that life, yet I'm sitting on my bed moping about the life I'm unable to change. Yesterday, I took the first steps by blocking Youtube on my phone and computer so we'll see how this works out. Right now, that's all I can think about is watching videos and I'm struggling like a drug addict. 

I'm honestly sick and tired of my life and want to break free of this, but don't know how to. I'm too embarrassed to ask my friends/family on what to do because my family thinks I'm a lazy bum. My friends on the other hand think I have it all together because of the lies I tell them and think I'm really funny. Little do I know, my life is crumbling. I know I have potential t as I was a leader in many sport teams and extracurr. activities in high school/college and willing to work hard for my dreams but I haven't been able to in the past. I was so happy in elementary/ middle school and earned many awards for having the highest grades/most involved. I want to get back to getting my freedom back. Never in a million years would I imagine that kid would develop into the person I am today. I'm tired of living this life.  I have dreams of getting a salary paying job, getting married, having a family, but at this rate I'm not going in that direction. 

I guess what I'm asking does anyone have any advice to break my addiction and get my life on track? Has anyone else been in a similar situation struggling with addiction and been able to break free?",26Feb2017,1

I had to deal with an incident last night on my own college campus near my dorm, where someone tried to randomly come up to me and give a problem, asked me what I was looking at, and then attacked me for no reason at all.

I ended up telling him to back off and go home and he was reluctant but eventually did. Normally I'd call the cops but the only reason I didn't was because he kept following me and wouldn't leave me alone, and if he saw me physically call them, he probably would've tried to cause more tension and get physical to prevent me.

146,"She insists we are being noisy?! 
I am a single mum and have a 10 year daughter. We recently moved to a new place, a small block with only 8 apartments. I don't own a TV, stereo or anything that makes noise. I actually respect other's people space, I am generally very quiet and LIKE quiet. Even when my daughter was very small, if she wanted to watch her cartoons, she had to use wireless headphones, with their volume adjusted to a minimum. If I watch a movie, or she does, we do so only with headphones. Long story short, after we moved in, my furniture hadn't arrived yet and so we were living, eating and sleeping on the floor. On the 1st night we slept there, my neighbor knocked just a bit after 22.00. The second day too. Ok, I said to myself, she probably wants to make a point. As I said, I do respect other people's space and would never, ever intentionally disturb anyone. Me and my daughter resorted to whispering and literally walking around in thick socks, until one day I spoke to a friend on the phone, my daughter made some noise and I shush-ed her. He asked what's going on and I explained. He nearly started shouting at me that this is not normal, and knowing me and my daughter and how we dislike noisy things I am being ridiculous to let my neighbor rule my life?? I had an awakening. He was right! We don't blast music, stereo or anything, I work every day and we are going to bed at 8.30-9.30. In the weekends I cook and do the washing and tidy the flat. So it's not overly noisy, just two people living. But before Christmas I had to do an airport run and we had to wake up at 3.00 am to get  ready so we can leave at 4.00am. And then she started knocking on her ceiling with vengeance. At this point I thumped back, this was getting beyond ridiculous. She complaint to my letting agency, they took no notice of her. I tried talking to her but she didn't open the door. Then one Sunday nailed exactly 8 nails to hang some pictures. It was during the day. She started pounding again. I went straight to her. She opened the door and started shouting at me. I told her calmly she has to be reasonable. She said shes has lived in the building for 15 years and never had any problem, which I found very strange(I will explain later why). I told her that I don't care how long she lived there, we ALSO live there, have the right to live there and that she should stop harassing us! At this point the said she's selling and she's moving out and slammed the door in my face. I don't know what to do? Is there any noise inspectors, and how can I prove that we, in fact do not do anything more noisy than live(quite quietly at that). I considered going to the police and complain. I am getting really frustrated, not for any other reason, but as I said I DO LIKE silence and what she's doing is simply unfair. My flat has carpet throughout but the construction of the building obviously is not at all noise proof. Anyhow, she is not mean to only me. As, apparently she has lived in the building most than the rest of the people in the block, she has named herself ""the management"" and constantly writes and posts notes on the entrance door to the residents(signed ""The management"") The latest one was a gem. Someone had visitors and apparently they parked on this woman's parking space(she doesn't own a car). Next day there was a long note saying no one has a right to park in someone else's parking space.

149,"Hiya.

I'm only 15, from the UK.

For the past six weeks my dad has constantly been harassing me and I suspect this behaviour is that of an narcissistic dad.

He's constantly been telling me I need to ""stop being so manly, so macho, start becoming all camp and effeminate."".

He also said ""I do not want a macho son, I want a camp, effeminate little son who's all girly and gay, I'll disown you if you're not camp.""

I've kept telling him NO, but he's insistent and says ""I neeeeed a camp son, for fuck's sake, can't you just be camp, and stop dicking around with your going to the gym and weightlifting, I'd rather you be all camp and effeminate, I want a femboy son, not some butch lad.""

I've told my mum about this and she roared at him, told him ""This is not how you speak to my son, apologise"" and he grudgingly did so, but then, once mum had left the room, he said ""You will be camp, and you're gonna learn how to.""

Dad can't and won't accept that I enjoy macho things like weight training, garden/labour work and cycling, and even insists I'm gay despite having met my girlfriend Jenny (she's 15, like me).

Even when Mum told him ""John (that's me) isn't gay, he told me himself"" he would not accept it.

I'm not gay, never fancied guys and never will.

I don't understand my dad. Why is he so obsessive about me being camp, I thought he taught me about acceptance, and accepting people for who they are; doesn't this make him a hypocrite?

I feel like I don't have a great relationship with my dad, but I have a good one with my mum.

I've no idea where this obsession with me being camp has come from or why, but he's insistent about it.

I need some advice as I don't know who to go to for advice, it's creeping me the fuck out, and I feel stressed.

Mum tried her best to deal with it but she's frightend of his temper and thinks he'll yell at her again.

What should I do?",26Feb2017,0

I am posting on behalf of my sister, Grace, who is in need of some advice concerning the death of her cat, Walnut. Back in December, Grace came to visit our family a province over and had asked her roommates, Ethan and Jessica, if they would be okay to look after her cat in her absence. They agreed to this arrangement and gave no indication that they would be unavailable to properly attend to Walnut. It is not unknown that this cat was very important to her, having been in our family for 9 years. Grace was only away from home for about a week, 3 weeks or so before Christmas. When she returned, she learned that her cat had been missing for nearly a week, but neither one of them attempted to contact her because they expected that they would find Walnut before Grace came back home. Obviously upset, she asked how this happened and when Walnut had gone missing. Ethan and Jessica admitted that they weren't sure when Walnut went missing, but said it had been at least 2 days before they noticed Walnut was gone. I believe this was around Dec 7-9, at which time there was heavy snow and the temperatures ranged between -21 to -27 degrees Celsius. Grace has spent the last 2 months searching for Walnut by posting ads online, speaking to neighbours, visiting the local animal shelter, and keeping an eye out on local lost pet pages online. Ethan helped her look for Walnut a couple times the first week Grace got home, and Jessica offered no assistance at all. Neither roommate offered any form of apology or acknowledgement of their part in the loss of Walnut, and being deeply hurt and upset, Grace completely stopped interacting with them after the incident (outside of occasionally passing each other in common spaces).


Just this week, Grace heard a cat meowing outside so she went to investigate hoping Walnut had finally made her way home, but unfortunately, searching for this meowing cat lead her to discover Walnut dead and frozen buried under the snow under the living room area of their home. She was horrified and asked her boyfriend to take Walnut to be cremated the next day. At this point, she had called me and gave me the tragic news wondering if there was anything she could do to get justice for Walnut. I advised her to speak with our close relative, Danielle, who is a lawyer concerning the matter. Danielle and Grace discussed the possibility of pressing charges (I believe they came to the figure of around $5000 as this is roughly equal to the investment Grace has recently put into medical procedures that saved Walnut's life), however Danielle warned Grace that court would not be cheap and offered the alternative of asking the roommates to cover Walnut's cremation as an apology for the negligence that lead to her death. Grace felt that this was acceptable as she was simply after a genuine apology from her roommates showing that they understood the magnitude of their carelessness.


She asked me to help her write level-headed texts to her roommates (they have a group chat) as she wasn't ready to face them in person. They shared a long back and forth which began by Grace telling them how devastated and disappointed she is that something like this happened when she had asked them to take care of her cat and that to be able to move on, she would be moving in a month's time. She asked them if they would repay her for Walnut's cremation as an apology and out of respect for Walnut's preventable death. The total was $32, $16 per roommate. Ethan's first response was asking what was going to happen with bills, followed by a message for Jessica wondering if her boyfriend would move in to take Grace's place, telling her she could move to the master bedroom. Grace expressed how rude and inappropriate that was in response to telling them that she had just found Walnut dead, to which Ethan told her she was inappropriately dealing with her grief going so far as to say he was grieving better as he had just lost his dad a few days before (a few days later we learned that Ethan's dad is not dead, the loss and grief he was referring to was in reference to a falling out). Ethan proceeded to say a slew of other ridiculous and irrelevant things, including it was common not to see Walnut around the house for 2 days (referring to when Grace is home and obviously caring for her own animal) and that he and Jessica were quite busy at that time (yet neither roommate gave any indication they would be excessively busy when Grace asked if they were available to look after a living being for her), avoiding answering Grace's request. Jessica responded fairly late after getting home from work that her friends had advised not to pay citing ""when a family member dies, you foot the bill"" and saying she would not be ""as worried about it"" if she were in the same situation. She proceeded to remove her own cat, Larry, from the house that same night despite apparently not being ""as worried."" I advised Grace not to continue the conversation with her roommates any further at the time since they are clearly not sympathetic, nor remorseful for their actions.


At this point, Danielle has advised Grace to first speak with police and their local humane society to see if there are any services available to her though them, but we are doubtful and Grace wants to go to court more than ever to seek justice for her wrongfully deceased cat. She is devastated and open to other opinions/advice on the matter. Thank you for anyone who took the time to read this long post!


TLDR; Sister asked roommates to look after her cat in December while she visited fam for a week and they agreed. She returned to find her cat missing, the roommates hadn't originally noticed for 2 days and they live somewhere cold with heavy snow where we feel it is very negligent to not know/check each night that your animals are inside as they will freeze to death if left outside overnight. Sister finds cat frozen and dead under their house 2 months later, and roommates refuse to apologize or even acknowledge responsibility for their role in the tragedy. What possible actions can/should we take to pursue justice for the cat's wrongfully lost life due to their negligence?",26Feb2017,1
156," My aunt was first diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, she spent some time in the hospital and they were able to treat her and she got rid of it. 

But now the cancer has came back even stronger than the first time and it's spreading all throughout her body. 

At first she had control over it and she was able to function normally without any help, this was only a few months ago too. But as time went on you could actually see the disease taking control of her body. 

Literally a few months ago me and her were going to the gym together running on the treadmill and now I'm currently sitting next to her in the hospital and I'm having a hard time looking at her without shedding a tear. 

She can no longer move the lower half or her body and. She can barely move her head either. Both of her hands are swollen. Her legs and feet are also swollen and she's barely conscious. I don't even think she's aware that I'm sitting next to her. Her form of cancer has gotten so extreme that no amount of treatment can help her. It's just a matter of time before I have completely lost her and the anxiety is killing me on the inside. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. ",26Feb2017,1
158,"Since I was roughly six years old, I have been saving money from birthdays, side jobs, real jobs, etc in order to help my father pay for my university. This fall will be my third year at uni and I will studying in England, far from my family. For the first two years of uni, my family and I did not have to spend any money on school because I had a two year scholarship that covered all tech school costs. Now that I am attending a real university, and especially one out of the country, I will be needing a significant amount of money. Fortunately, I've raised about 10k in cash and would like to deposit it in my savings account. 

How should I go about doing this? I'm afraid my bank may file a SAR and delay my money being processed, as I have to start making down payments on my tuition relatively soon, and the money needs to be in my account before I can apply for my Visa, as they have to see that I have the money to support myself. Does anyone have any tips for me? Things I should know? Paperwork I'll need to fill out? 

Tl;dr: I [20/F] have been saving up for school since 6. I currently have 10k in savings and would like to deposit it in my account before I study abroad this fall. How can I do this without seeming sketchy? ",26Feb2017,3
159,"I am not talking so much about Facebook or Instagram which clearly have been found to be harmful. I am talking about more direct apps like Snapchat and particularly Tinder.

On the one hand, it helps you pushing yourself aka putting yourself out there. On the other, it makes me a bit too keen in wanting to be liked, and every time I’ve gone on those apps, I ended up giving it more importance than I should have. But again, a socially-healthy individual would manage to have an account and take only the positives of it. 

So I’ve been going back and forth especially on Tinder for the last year. I create an account, meet people, feel great... then invest myself too much too quickly, then I withdraw myself from them and the app for the sake of my own sanity. 

I am at a crossroads not knowing whether to never use these apps or what to do to use them properly. I would like to use them in such a way that they are only beneficial, and they can be! But they can also make me shift my focus from myself to them. ",26Feb2017,1
160,"Im 20 (girl). I don't have any dating experience, especially with  gay/bi girls and I know it's not easy to meet them in public, so i tried tinder. Now, this was the first girl I developed a serious interest/liking with. 

I never actually met her, but we we talked on and off through text and snapchat for about 5 months. We live about an hour away from each other, which is not too bad, but both don't have cars. In the beginning, she did have in her tinder bio how she's ""terrible at texting"" and she's shy, so i took that into consideration. 

I had to initiate most convos, but she would reply with detail and sometimes very quickly, while others were pretty delayed. She would apologize quite a few times, for a terrible texting delays, so i just assured her that if she's not interested, she doesn't have to reply. But she said that wasnt the case and to not think like that. I really wanted to know if she was into me or not, instead of waiting around. So I took the initiative to ask her out. 

So i told her how i find her cool and sweet, and how i want to get to know her even more in person, and if she's up for that, great, if not, thats okay too. Now, the case scenario that can follow up, is either she ignores me or replies with something vague/disinterested like, ""sure..we'll see!' but no. She told me how Im really cool and sweet too, and How she would really like to see me as well, being all ""nervous but excited"" Well, I took that a clear positive sign. She told me how she hopes to see me before her birthday, as she doesn't like celebrating her b day on the actual day, due to past negative experiences with either her ex making her cry or her family fighting.

So, we set up a date at a fair halfway from where she lives and i live (despite the not so easy transportation/distance situation) my dad was willing to help. The night before she confirmed the date with me after we didn't talk for a week, then flaked on me the day of. She said something along the lines of, ""you're gonna hate me..but I can't make it. So i asked why?

She then said how her family told her last minute of her niece's soccer game at her school. So I told her I was disappointed, but understand and hope to see her soon ( I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Things happen). She said, ""same""

Then thanksgiving rolls  around, I wished her a happy one, and she was busy with the dinner and didn't message me until later that night. She then replied the next day to ask me how my black friday was going, so i told her It was good and I was spending it with my mom. Then she asks me last minute if i wanted to go with her and some of her family to the same place I asked her out too. I told her I couldn't make it because It was last minute notice, but hopefully another time.

The second time I asked her out to the same place, she agreed. The day of the date rolls around, and I message her in the late morning to confirm for the date at 7pm. She left me hanging for a few hours, didn't reply until around 4, to say,"" omg I'm so sorry. my co worker called me in last minute so i can't. sorry.""

Okay...this time around I was a little more upset. Cause she knew I had my ticket already printed out to go to the fair/park, and the money is nonrefundable. So i said, ""look, I understand if things come up and you get busy, but i don't appreciate being left hanging in this type of case. If you're not comfortable or interested in seeing  me, Ill appreciate the honesty and let you be. All you have to do is be straight up.And if I'm overreacting cause things come up for you, then I'm sorry""

A few hours later, I literally get a novel of messages..and i mean..NOVEL of messages explaining what happened the night before, how she almost got in a car crash with her friend behind the wheel. Then something came up the day of, and she wasnt having a good day. She said she really wants to see, she really does, but the distance/car situation makes it kind of hard. She then said how she likes me  (even though she originally thought I wasnt really into her) and wants to get to know me better, but is hesitant as well being she got out of a bad relationship.

She's bi, and the last relationship was with a guy. The guy was insecure that she would leave him for a girl, but she eventually ended the relationship herself because it was toxic at the guy made her a prisoner of own body. How he didn't treat her well. She suffers from depression and low self esteem, and used to cut herself. She doesn't cut anymore, but still has the scars. She's never been with a girl and says she wants her first time with a girl to be someone special. How she's not into pda, but how she will lightly kiss and hold your hand. Then she went onnnn about other personal stuff about herself.

She told me the reason why she was telling me all of this so I know the ""real her"". To figure out if I'm wasting my time and LET ME decide if i like her as a friend or more. She doesn't open up and share personal things unless she likes the person. She admits she can be distant at times, but thats because of her past/emotional scars. So the fact she shared all that to me, means obviously she has some liking to me

So I said that I'm not wasting my time and that I still like her despite what she told me. That I don't want to pressure her into a relationship, just talk and spend time with her to see where it goes, cause I'm not one to jump the gun so soon. That I appreciate her honesty and at least I know she likes me back. From that point on, we talked here and there but not that much. I tried to give her some space. One night at 1:30 in the morning, she texted me a pic of a drawing. It was two eyes with designs all around it, and she wanted my opinion. I said I loved it and then she admitted how she was modeling my eyes, and that she hopes that it doesn't ""scare"" me that she did that. So, I was like.. no no lol. I thought that was so sweet and flattering. Then christmas rolls around, I wished her a merry christmas. She ignored me. I text her a week later with a simple hey. She replied within seconds..

Then sometimes she would comment on my snap stories and reply with things how I'm seriously cute and funny when I said something  funny, and heart eyes to a makeup look I posted. Clearly....the signs seem straightforward to me in  way. I wasnt misinterpreting things.

But...she would go mia on me for up to a week or more at a time. Then she would text me, I would reply, then ignores me again. So normal reaction was to ask whats up with all of this eventually. Im waiting around for her and wondering when I'm ever gonna see her, and that I understand to give her space, but if you claim to like someone, you don't go from talking to them for that long. I said if she's keeping her options open with other people and isn't sure, its fine but let me know instead of the  mixed signals i feel I'm getting ( I sent that in a long message). She ignored me but had the time to continuously post on snapchat and instagram of her new tattoo.

I mean, she knows I would probably see it. So i wait 4 days...and instead of letting this go and figuring she probably wanted to be left alone or wasnt interested anymore (which is weird to drop interest in someone just like that). I texted her again to say that its inconsiderate and I'm not gonna wait around like this. I noticed shortly after that, she unadded me on snapchat. I told my friend about it , and he said she's ""emotionally fragile"". So I felt bad  considering she deals with depression and stuff. So maybe she needs a friend. So I  sent her another message later that night to say that Im just hurt and confused. That if you only like me as a friend at this point or whatever, Ill take it, and from this point, ill leave you alone but I'm here if you need anything.

She ignored that one too. Later, I was on instagram, and she happened to post a story. So out of curiosity and watched it. It was the song ""bad girls club"" by falling in reverse playing in the background.  The lyrics she played were saying, "" she's blowing up my phone. I wish she would just leave me alone. I gotta change my number and its hard for me slumber"" She did this really forced cough and this bitchy smirk while it was playing.

..so I put two and two together considering she posted it shortly after I send her the texts. I mean, It wasnt directly to me, but the shade was OBVIOUS. So i had to comment with, ""wow I love that song! Honestly, you could've just told me i was annoying or you wanted to be left alone instead of throwing shade. idk what i did to you. idk, guess I'm crazy""

She then blocked me on there, and blocked my number too...then her best friend blocked me on instagram as well....and It felt like the harshest sting to my chest. 

This wasnt just any ol' rejection, but stringing along then treating me like I was the creepy plague..I don't know what i did wrong for her to treat me like that. Maybe I was annoying...maybe I didn't take the hint...but with everything she told me, I figured she really did like me but was scared. I never ""blew"" up her phone  or over compliment her. I wasnt that creepy guy who couldn't take no for an answer. or take the hint when someone ignores you from the get go and gives you one word replies to get the message across. I would give her space here and there, but I wanted more reciprocity and consistency of interest from her..

It really broke me into confusion and questioning for the first two weeks, I went into a big depression. It really broke my self esteem and I started to attack myself and figured I did something wrong to push her away like that. Maybe i shouldn't had never asked her about the mixed signals. I mean, I would send her long texts sometimes, but it never bothered her. She would even tell me that with texting, even if she's really bad, she a little better with me and can write paragraphs me, and not anyone else. (btw, I don't really like talking on the phone and being i live with a homophobic mom, its hard to make phone calls willy nilly without her questioning).

So yeah..its been a little over a month since she blocked me and stopped talking to me. I thought I would be over it by now, but I ended up tearing up last night again. Ive gotten several dreams of her contacting me to make mends and give me closure...I hate to dream about it.

I feel crazy for even pining over someone I never actually met in person or had a proper relationship with...I just hope my feelings are still rational. I still hold on to that tiny hope shell unblock me...but I realize thats unhealthy to think.",26Feb2017,1
161,"Hi reddit. I am a 32 year old male who is having difficulty with finding a career path so that I can save up money for retirement. I wanted to see if someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong. I think I have gone about everything the best I could given my circumstances yet I still keep falling flat on my face. My circumstances need explaining, of which I will do now.

In 2005 I was 20 years old and started my first real job at a toy store as a sales associate making minimum wage. I was always on time and had the job for about 3 months before the store closed. Afterwards, instead of immediately going back to finding a new job, I procrastinated and smoked the reefer at my parents place like a lazy bum would do. Then it hit me, I had my first bad trip and became delusional and landed in the hospital. Diagnosed with schizophrenia. My life broke into a tiny million pieces. Cue the violin. So then my mom pushed me to get on disability and after a few months I kinda thought it was nice to not have to work and still give my money to my parents to help with rent/food. Biggest mistake I could have made. After a while I started to get nervous if society would ever accept me and this thought kept making me more and more anxious about finding work again. So then I was persuaded by friends of the family that I should go to college. I was asked what Id like to do and I already knew it would be something with computers. Programming sounded nice because computers + cash = win. 

So I started going to a community college. Early on I noticed I was getting nervous sometimes around people and decided I would take online courses from here on out. Second biggest mistake I could make. I started taking all my courses online, and even found a 4 year university, www.mga.edu, that I could transfer to and take completely online to get my bachelors. They had a  Bachelors in Information Technology degree and one of the majors is Software Development. Well, what progressed was me slowly picking less and less courses each semester so that I could continue gliding on free money from disability which meant no need for work. This made me more and more anxious about my future every semester. What should have taken 4 years had now taken 4 years to just finish my sophomore level classes. I had a setback with my mental disorder after reflecting on this and when I came back from the hospital I kept slowly trudging along. Come circa 2015 and I was done but broken inside. I never increased the number of classes in later semesters because I was afraid I couldn’t handle it and would end up in the hospital. I wish I didn’t have that mindset, I wish I would have given it my all but my anxiety coupled with living on the governments dime made it a quicksand I couldn’t get out of.

So at the end of 2015 I am out of college and have entry level knowledge of php, c#, java, and python along with a net+ certification that expired in 2014. I applied for programming jobs for months and never heard one reply. So I decided I would reposition myself as an IT professional. I applied for networking tech jobs and never got but one interview and they passed on me for lack of experience. So now were here in 2017 and I repositioned myself again as a Tech Support agent and would try and move my way up to a network admin through experience. I'm applying for tech support jobs and no one is contacting me. I had one opportunity I pressed for with a staffing agency that was promising but because I was having sleep problems I passed on the interview. I should mention Ive been having sleep problems since graduating college. I would be awake until 4 am and asleep till 12 pm. I couldn’t fix the damn thing until about 3 months ago when I started doing melatonin and light therapy. The thing is I am kind of a shy person as well so the thought of talking to people on the phone makes me kind of uneasy but I have put myself in the mindset that they are hundreds or thousands of miles away and all I have to do is not take it personal. But beyond this I wish there were anther type of job I could do with as much pay as an experience tech support agent/network tech but I don’t think there is. 

Now what I want to know is what am I doing wrong? In my resume for work experience I put that I was an eBay seller from the time I lost my job at the toy store till now. It's not a lie because I did sell things throughout the years on ebay but it wasn’t income that could sustain me in any way. But they don't know that. My resume is at the bottom of this post.

So am I stuck with only minimum wage jobs now for the rest of my life? I see recommendations on r/personalfinance to learn a trade or go to college but I already did that and I cant find anything remotely meaningful. I have went to a vocational rehab center and they have no connections to jobs- all they will do is apply to jobs for me. They have a work assessment thing I can probably do which is working for a nonprofit for a month or two to have something recent on my resume. But that’s it. If I were to go back to school I'd probably try to be a Lab Technician because its decent pay and not much customer interaction. But I keep thinking that I am 32 years old with almost no job experience and going back to school would make me at least 34 years old with no job experience and Im afraid Id have the same problem as before where employers wont hire someone like that. So that’s why Ive kind of put schooling again off the table. But I am open to any and all suggestions.

165,"There are hundreds of thousands of possibilities in life, and most I don't have trouble making decisions on which is best. Maybe its my new found maturity...

You don't need to know me well, you need to know the circumstances.

I moved to the West coast about 6 years ago. I love it there, expensive and strange but it offers new material. My home town isn't as exciting, but has many of my old friends.

Recently, drama has brought me back into the fold at home. But as I sit here, I realize the good I could do in my home town. Along with that, the quite dread how I get stuck back in my old rut.

I don't know what to do. I have opportunities for amazing work back on the coast, but then I have the support of my friends and family here. Drama and familiarity or clear sailing and strange?

If anyone has had to make an similar decision, let me know. I am at a loss and any perspective will help.

171,"I'm trying to make this short.

**tldr;** I'm 26 and threw many opportunities away, fucked up big time and am trying to make it right and see some perspective.

When I was 19, I started a really bad phase, I hung out with the wrong people, tried the wrong things and was in a really unhealthy relationship and pretty weak minded. I slept in hotel rooms all over the country without paying, got a criminal record because of that (thankfully I live in a country where people can't just search for this stuff). I worked as a c++ developer back then, had some success and some clients who had every right to hate me because i lived a very unstable life and did a shit job, disappointed them, etc.

This lasted for about 3 1/2 years, then I hit rock bottom which I absolutely deserved - criminal record, debt, wasted years with nothing to show, lonely, sad, broke, addicted and fat. I went cold-turkey, cut every relationship I had, went to therapy, started school and working out, stopped doing freelancing work and took every damn job I could get. I am living what I think is the closest thing to remedy I can think of. My situation isn't perfect, I still have debt, I'm not finished with school yet, and so on.

Here's my dilemma: I am not who I was before, and I would like to work in the field I was in before - programming, essentially. I think I can offer high quality there, but I know that my name might come up with some people in the industry (I'm not famous or anything, but people know people who know people who know people) and they would have every right to think negatively of me. I am not sure how to tell the narrative I think has a right to be told: I changed.

My plan is to get any tech job I can get and work my ass off, and maybe let time pass. I would like to do public stuff at some point, or start my own business eventually. Do you think, I should let that one go, or do you think I can have a chance at this again at some point in the future? Be as frank as necessary.

Thank you.",26Feb2017,1
172,Hello everyone I have been attending college for about 2 years now and I almost done with my basic courses and will be hopefully accepted into my physical therapist assistant program by next year. But I have always had this sense of terror of me becoming a failure and disappointing my parents by not achieving this goal. I don't have any bad grades or anything like and my gpa is pretty high. I do own my car since I was the age of 18 and have been working at various fast food jobs to keep up with the payments of my car and school. But I know I don't want to be doing that type of job for the rest of my life. I guess you could say that I am a responsible person for keeping of my bills and helping out my family the best I can. But if I don't get accepted into this program I don't know what I am going to do with my life. The very thought that I may fail terrifies me and turning 20 in a couple days doesn't make me feel any better because of the uncertainty of becoming a success. I usually don't show my true feelings towards any one and I usually keep up a happy act to those who are around me. I'm also planning on taking out a 1300 student loan to help pay for some of my classes but I don't feel entirely comfortable about taking a large of sum money like that. I am thinking about maybe taking the summer off or something like that for my school. There is a lot going on right now in my life but I'm tired and scared for future and thank you for listening to my story. Any advice would be greatly appreciated ,26Feb2017,1

VERY soon after. it was obvious they didn't mesh together, but anytime my grandma, my brother, or me would mention this, he would get really mad. when he finally discovered it, and they broke up, he moved out of the house they shared, he jumped into another relationship. when relationship #2 ended, he jumped into ANOTHER relationship, and then Karen found out. now, he says he loves Karen, and him and Karen are getting back together. she's changing herself, just to get him back. i have no doubt that she'll go back to the person she was if they get back together. how do i talk some sense into him????",26Feb2017,1

176,"To give a small amount of backstory, I got out of a long relationship about six months ago and I been hesitant to get back into the dating scene because I don't like the co-dependence that is present in a lot of young relationships these days. I really wasn't looking for anything serious or exclusive.

I (21f) have been casually dating this guy (30m) I met for a couple of weeks now and I really like him. I knew from the start that I wanted to take it really slow, but always struggle to pace myself. We have had a lot of really great conversations and I feel like he's really into me. However, we have barely spoken about our previous relationships (which is fine) but it sort of adds an element of mystery to the situation. It also hasn't given me the chance to tell him that I want to take things slow, but that I do want to pursue something. 

We both have very busy schedules including juggling work and social lives. I really like that he isn't trying to make me his whole world and doesn't expect me to do that for him, but it does make it a little difficult to read him. It also makes me cautious about what I say because I worry about coming off too strong.   

My biggest concern is I don't want to assume we are working towards an exclusive relationship while he isnt then end up getting hurt.

Am I overthinking this and should I just let myself ride this wave and see where it goes, or should I try to initiate a conversation to see if we are on the same page? Thanks ☺",26Feb2017,2
177,"So the other day right before school starts, I go to pull out of my apartment complex, and I get rear ended. I get out of my car, and the bumper got damaged. The woman that hit me gives he her cell phone number, and I take a picture of her insurance information. By this time I was already going to be late to class, and the woman seemed trustworthy, so I leave without calling the cops. I called her a couple days ago to tell her she needs to file a claim with her insurance, and she told me that she'd call me back later that night. She didn't. Now she is avoiding calls/messages. I looked her up on facebook and sent her the info she needs in order to file a claim. I have half a mind to go to her apartment (same complex) and give her my info. I have yet to hear anything from her. Did I screw myself over since I never called the cops? If I can get proof that she hit me, can I file a police report? Am I able to take her to court over this?

Update: Went to the front office of my apartment building, got video proof of her rear ending me. Called the police station to file a report, and an officer came down to check out what happened. He saw the video, filed a report, and even called the woman. The best part about it is that her insurance was expired, so she might have to go to court and/or pay fines. He filled out a report to give to my insurance, and now she'll have to deal with this, and pay for the damage to my car. You can bet I'll be taking my car to the ford dealership so it costs as much as possible. This bitch is gonna get what she deserves for flat out ignoring me when she damaged my personal property.

178,"Not sure if this is the subreddit I should be posting to.
I'm a first year college student and in high school, I was the awkward guy who's always cracking jokes because that's all I could do. I was short and didn't have much self-esteem, even though I looked confident most of the time. After 6 months of college with new people, I've become different, more confident, and definitely a lot better at social skills.
However, a couple days ago I hung out with some high school friends, and I acted like I was still in high school the whole afternoon while being aware of doing such. I just keep questioning myself why I was telling these god-awful jokes, why was I being awkward and such. I just put on a mask I thought I'd lost. Have I not learned anything?

She's apparently uber-traditional and wants to get married, kids, etc. So I guess she would be in the same ""stage"" as my brother in some ways cause he's starting to want this stuff too now that he's in his early 30s. I'm just skeptical of the whole thing. They only met 5 months ago and she's already real eager to get married. She's really pretty so I feel like she's manipulating him with her looks. I don't think it's a good idea for him to rush into anything with this girl. She could have good intentions but the age difference combined with how fast they're going just seems a tad concerning to me.

He's not rich, and is average looking. While she's like a 9 or 10 and 13 years younger than him.

182,"Last night, I was at a bar in Atlanta with a friend where I was one of the only non-black or latino people there.  We were minding our own business and watching people sing karyoke when a very angry black woman approached me, screamed at me that I touched her ass, and started hitting me in the face.  I didn't do such a thing, and immediately backed away to avoid the confrontation. However, I ran right into her black boyfriend and his gang, and they started beating on me at the bar for touching her, which I never did. I backpedalled away as quick as I could, trying to explain the misunderstanding, but they followed me to the front of the bar and were going to pull a knife on me until security threw them out.

I'm from a conservative part of the country, and my dad doesn't like blacks, even though he's highly educated. As much as I don't want to agree with him, events like these piss me off and really make me want to hate hood black people like that. I'm not really sure how to balance wanting equality and open-mindedness, and pragmatism when faced by thug gang assholes. Is this wrong?

EDIT:  Appreciate all the comments. Let it be known that I've never been attacked or verbally abused by anyone other than blacks. This isn't an isolated event - from getting cussed out at Walmart by an irate black woman to witnessing a black guy stealing wallets in my hometown, it doesn't stop. I have black friends, but it's getting harder and harder for me to empathize with the ""we live in the projects because the WHITE man put us here"" mentality.",26Feb2017,64
183,"Okay, so long story short, when I was about 5 or 6 my parents got divorced. I am now 15 and for that whole time I have been living with my mom. Over the years she has told me how my dad physically abused her and how overall he was a terrible person to her. And up until this point I just blindly followed that thought. But I just can't imagine my dad in such a way. He has ALWAYS been good to me and I haven't ever seen him be angry at basically anyone. My mom does tend to overexaggerate things, but constantly reminding me how my dad is a terrible person because he beat her just doesn't seem like something you would want to overexaggerate. Basically my mom wants me to hate my dad. Even telling me not to call him dad and call him by his real name. 

But the thing that really ticks me off is when she gets drunk. And for about 2 years straight she has gotten drunk, every single day. Plus she takes the anti-depressants of like 3 people. She used to tell me stories about how my cheated on her with multiple women and how he would go around sleeping with numerous women. But she has done the exact same thing. I know for a fact that she has cheated on my step-father, which is just wrong considering all that he has done for us. I remember coming home one night from friend's place and basically some random dude and her banging. 

Oh, and my mom uses my money to buy stuff. When my dad gives me spending money on my bank account, she will use that. I don't really know what she buys alot of the time, but only assume that she considers the money extra and just buys alcohol.
My dad gave me like 300 euros to buy myself a monitor and basically all of that is gone. He then gave me another 250 which is also in use at the moment.

Now I don't actually mind having my money spent that much since I wouldn't really do anything with it anyway, but I just feel bad because my dad is giving me all of this money and my mom is just spending it. She did tell me that she's buying me the monitor anyway so I've got nothing to worry about, and I don't doubt that. But I don't know. I'm not gonna tell her to stop using my money or anything. I don't know.

So who is right? Is my dad really the person my mom makes out to be or is my mom overexaggerating everything? 

I just need advice from someone who isn't involved. An outsiders opinion if you will. Thanks. 


EDIT: (To clarify in the upcoming paragraph, my grandma is from my mother's side). 

Yes, my mom does sometimes want me to get money out of my father.
Basically what happened in the past was, when we bought the house we had at the time, we put in all of my mom's money, my dad's money and my grandpa and grandma's money to buy the house. Now after all the shit went down and they divorced, my dad moved away to another country. In 2015 the house went up for sale, and once it was finally sold, the money went 50/50 to my mom and dad. But my mom says that it was unfair, because my grandma's money was a big part of that purchase and she should have gotten a cut too (split three way).
But since they had signed a contract before, it didn't happen. And now my mom says that whatever money my dad gives us (child support and spending money) is actually rightfully ours, because it belongs to my grandma.",26Feb2017,10

I never did do that. 

Anyway, I have decided to leave all that junk behind, the anger, anxiety, depression, etc. Goodbye to all that useless weight. In doing so, I am less reactive to her now.

So, what exactly can I learn from the way she decides to interact with me? What does it say about me?

Examples:

1. She seems to not be able to hold a conversation with me if it doesn't interest her. Me with her, anything she wants to talk about is fair game, but if I bring up a subject she deems not worthy, she basically ignores me. Doesn't say anything at all back to me and just clams up or just trashes what I am saying.

2. Anything I suggest she give a try or look into because I think she would like is immediately seen as dumb or stupid. Even things I know she'd like to do or whatever. She just shuts me down. Not interested. Boom. Done.  It's like she gives it the old 50,000ft view and calls it stupid and that's the end of it. If I try to engage it again....see #1. 

We are very much opposite in just about everything. It is very likely that whatever I like and enjoy, she will dislike. She is strongly conservative, and I am very much less so and we disagree on most things like that. We know this about each other and we've gotten into some heated discussions on same-sex stuff and just about anything dealing with human rights.

Maybe she's just an asshole or maybe I am the asshole.  

Why not just leave her alone? I don't know. Maybe it's the time we've known each other and the times we've seen each other through.

I am looking for a more skillful way in dealing with her. Should I pull back from her to the point that I don't say anything to her if it doesn't interest her? Seems like a lot of work to alway have to wonder if this topic or that is worthy of her attention.

Any advice/help?

My school(I'm in the last year of high school) put up a box and white board for little anonymous handwritten letters from admirers. The board was for the ones that were public and the private ones were handed out by the mail-person (a kid from the class that organized it). 

A lot of the girls in my class received them but none of the guys. An hour later I found out from a friend from another class that I have my name on the board. I went and I saw it and was pretty damn shocked.

 I never had a girlfriend and never have girls showed such interest (I had received a flower in kindergarden and apparently a girl was hitting on me at a party in the first year of high school). 

The letter reads "" For WadKnock, from class X, You've attracted my attention with a single gaze. Dearly, some girl from the next class over. &lt;3"" 

I don't know where to go from here. My suspicion is that the letter is a forgery made by the girls in my class to torment me. The handwriting is very much female so it can't a forgery made by my friends. 

It could also very much be a real letter from an admirer.(keep in mind this never happened before).

I have disciplined myself by buying a cork board where I can plan and organise daily life, I use my journal frequently and My phone as the main planner.
However, with the Noise and Distractions at home, I found it impossible to concentrate. I have younger siblings. I go to the library on a frequent basis and I'm able to accomplish a lot more there. How can I create a space at home? Or Ignore the noise? I can't find a solution to this because it's an unavoidable problem that it taking me backwards.

218,"It has been going on for a few years now, I cant cry when I'm sad/down/angry etc. The last time I remember I cried was when I was about 7, Im nearly 18 now.

Like I said I cant cry in any situation, not even when a relative died. I have been noticing this fact because Im having a rough period with myself, my family, school and stress making me feel sad/down a lot. But whenever I am, no tears  are flowing. Not even if I wanted too or felt like it.

Does anyone else experience this? Or has experience with it? Or just knows more about things like this? Please let me know.",26Feb2017,1
220,"I really need some help, please read to the end:)
I'm a teenage girl not far off 20 and have had quite a few sexual partners in the past, however I've never really ever had 'loving' sex. The only 'real' relationship I've had is with a guy that turned my world upside down. He is the most intelligent person I've ever met, so driven and so sure of himself. However, he treated me, you could say, quite badly. He made me cry often (I always considered myself rather assertive however he left me rather unsure of myself), called me a bitch most days and would generally project all of his negativity on to me. He is an individual with A LOT of emotional problems, due to his family being very cold and emotionally distant, so he wasn't able to show me love. I have suspicions of him either being gay or basically having some sort of sociopathic, control issues (hard to explain). Anyway, we broke up, due to our communication breaking down, however we had THE BEST sex literally ever, he knew exactly how to make me cum and so did I. Now. Since our break up I've fucked a few guys, but find myself switching off and being totally unable to make eye contact with the person I'm having sex with. Whilst having sex with one guy I started crying as I felt horrible, another was painful yet I just couldn't bring myself to tell him of this so I just buried my face and gritted my teeth. ive just not had one fully enjoyable experience since my ex. I have issues with saying no to sex with guys, and they seem to literally jump onto me and start groping me and I just get turned off, zone out and allow it. It's like I almost leave my body or begin to think of my ex again. I know I'm not fully over him, but he bought such darkness to my life with the relationship that we had that in our current lives we can not be together. Also, I am very confused about my sexuality, I know I like intelligent guys but I also know I am very sexually attracted to girls, and recently have been admitting to some of my friends of this, but I haven't had the chance to have a full on proper lesbian experience. Would it help me to get over my confidence issues? I don't know how to go about finding girls. I also want to know why I can't engage in mutual sex anymore, i just haven't fully engaged with someone since my ex, is it because he rejected my affection often? Can anyone offer me any help in general, any life tips, recommendations, how I can say no? Thank you x",26Feb2017,1

I have always been very introverted but iv been making more and more efforts to go outside my comfort zone.
I drove 2hrs to my friends college to  party his bday.
But as he would meander around his party i would be left by myself. If i was with him, id kind of just be following him around, tryn to be part of his conversations with other people, but not realy knowing what there talking about/or just not having anything to say left me just standing around. (Very uncomfortable)
If i was on my own, Id try to talk to people and just have a good time and everyone was nice, but i just couldnt hold conversations with anyone..
Id mabey say a thing or two but end up just standing there akwardly and eventualy walk away.
Its a party college and most of everyone knew each other, i only knew my friend who would go mia several times. 
Idk why i had such a problem, but i decided to leave after awhile just cause i couldnt keep sitting around like a dumb ass.
I realize this its up to me to go and talk with people, but what do you do when that fails?
It felt very dramatic to me and my friend would find me from time to time n appologize for leaving me, but i also feel like thats not fair to him either right? Hes hosting alot of his friends and shouldnt have to baby sit me. Shouldnt i be able to go to a party and chill with people?

Whats some advice others have found usefull when it comes to socializing situations? Would talking to some sort of professional help? Or am i just being a little shit for not being able to act my age..

Tldr - i have trouble socializing with people in general, and especialy when im with groups of people idk. Would talking to a professional help?",26Feb2017,1

228,"I'm 14, and from time to time, when I'm alone or think that nobody is listening, I play pretend war, with gun noises (when people are around, I usually am quiet with this), jumping, running around, and hand motions. My family has known this for a long time, and they've dubbed this act ""pew-pewing"". Lately, I have cut back on doing this in hopes that I'll just stop, but I sometimes can't help it. 

I am afraid that this isn't normal at all for my age, and that I am way less mature than others my age. I am also afraid of a possibility in the future where I bring home a girl that I like to my house (or a friend for that matter), and my family brings up my ""pew-pewing"", which they find extremely weird and distance themselves from me.

Am I reasonable to worry like this, or is this just me worrying too much?

EDIT: If this is abnormal or could harm any future relationships of mine, do you have any advice on how to stop doing this?",26Feb2017,1
230,"Hey guys. Looking for some general open discussion on my current state in life.

I am 26M, I live in a very urban city in North America. I am a son to immigrants but I was born and raised here so I’m split in terms of values/traditions.

I still live with my parents. I personally don’t have problems with this, but I know that generally this is probably considered taboo. While I respect everyone’s personal choices and whatnot, it’s my preference to save on rent and save for a downpayment. My life plan has always been to find a SO and move out with her into the same space. The big problem - I’m currently single, so it might be a while until I get there.

I’m starting to feel a bit of pressure not from my parents (who are the best and just want what’s best for me), but from friends/peers who have sort of gone ahead in life. They’re starting to jokingly ask when I’ll grow up/move out. I’m starting to meet girls who generally consider a guy living at home at 26 (almost 27) to be a dealbreaker. While I think this is unfair (I don’t have plans to live in the basement forever, I know how to cook, do around the house chores, etc. and I don’t depend on them for a single thing), it is what it is.

I guess there’s just a lot I’ve been thinking about:  
- Should I move out just because society norms dictate as such? Are there any significant advantages to moving out that aren’t the obvious (i.e. I know privacy would be great, but tell me if there’s something else I’m missing out on)? I'm trying hard to find a reason to justify moving out, other than it being what society does, because I'd feel pretty crummy spending money on something I don't fully believe in. I have a pretty decent job. I could afford to, but it would definitely hurt long term savings.  
- Where should I move? I currently live in the suburbs and I have no strong desire to live downtown (I’m over the clubbing phase), but again, it seems like everyone my age makes the move to downtown. I know I will settle down back in the suburbs. So does it even make sense for me to move downtown? Should I just find a place in the burbs? I'm already dreading how lonely it could be though. At least if I moved downtown, it would presumably be to a lively neighborhood.  
- Then there’s the issue of my current single status – I’m very much an introvert by nature (I don’t lack confidence, that’s different). I like my personal space, and throughout my life thus far, I’ve just sort of been happy maintaining a small but close circle of friends. Unfortunately, a lot of my friends have moved out of town for work so the circle is quickly dwindling and I find myself going out a lot less. I’ve been trying different ways to meet people (i.e. gym, classes, online dating) but no significant success thus far. I don’t think I’m so much concerned with this – I know the problem and how to fix it.

I’ve got no real question other than the above but feel free to leave some comments or questions if you want to know more. I’m hoping somebody will provide a fresh perspective on this.

234,"Here are the details:
 - we signed a one year lease, we are all (4) friends that have known each other for years
 - one roommate has a car, when we signed the lease (apr 2016) he said he would pay ~10% because he would be using the parking spot, but we would be paying the renter as a group and would split that difference amongst us (so to the renter the total is the total no matter who pays what)
 - we are staying past a year and will be continuing with a month-to-month lease, same terms
 - the roommate who has the parking spot has decided he will sell the car, no longer wants the parking spot and wants us 4 to now split the cost
 - other 3 roommates disagree
 - He says that because lease is ""over"" and we will be going month to month it's ok
 - can't sell the spot
 - will be unlikely that he will be able to sell the car before we have to start paying for the spot
 - at the outset/signing of the lease, there was no mention or indication he might sell the car

not a big deal in the end (+~2% increase in overall rent), but i was wondering what you guys would do/ how would you react?",26Feb2017,1

237,"Don't know if these types of posts are allowed but here's the shtick for anyone who cares to read:
I'm in 12th grade. Been playing piano since I was 5. Used to live in the city where my teacher is but last year we moved an hour drive away. I still drive there every Wednesday after school to get piano lessons and teach a little kid who's gonna take my time spot with my teacher when I leave. I also work three days a week, 6 hour evening shifts. On the one hand I'm afraid of losing it cause it's been a big part of me all these years, but on the other hand it's really taxing when I don't have time to practice, going to lessons is hard and I end up not having time for homework, and I keep disappointing my teacher cause I just don't have the time to prepare the pieces as good as I used to. Today I had my last concert of the semester and I fucked up half way and left stage with my head in my hands. I also am afraid if I quit I'll just be another pizza delivery guy and be that much less awesome of a person. I have one semester left before the summer when I was planning to leave anyway. Is it worth staying until the summer? Or should I give it up?",26Feb2017,2

245,"Hello everyone, I need advice. I am a 23 year old female. My mother has but addicted to drug for 10 year and we only found out recently. She had an extreme manic episode because of the drugs and we had to take her to the hospital where she stayed for a month. Since she was at the hospital she has completely changed. Her personality and she is like a zombie. She does not know how to interact with people, and its like she is a 4 year old.

My youngest sister (18years) and her boyfriend are currently staying with my mother. My mother stays in a house that my grandmother owns. My granny is very sick and will die soon. When my granny dies my mother has to buy out the house from my uncle in order to keep the house. My uncle stays in another country and he does not really care about my granny. 

My mom is not working because of her behavior and her zombie state , she sleeps 18 hours a day and does absolutely nothing. My mom and sister had to get food from the church in order to survive each month. There is no way that my mom will be able to afford to buy the house from my uncle and they will then become homeless when my granny dies. 

My idea was that I buy the half of the house once my granny passes and go stay there. The only problem is my mom is really like a 4 year old, she shits in her bed, she doesnt make food for herself, and the house is sooooo dirty each time I visit. Its so bad that i go pee outside because the bathroom is so dirty. 

If I do decide to buy the house I will essentially give up my entire life and cause strain on my relationship of 7 year, because he does not like my family and he loves living in a clean house, he refuses to go visit them. 

My mother is going to rehab in a month, but she is bad she is not doing drugs anymore but she drink 7-10 sleeping pills a day with alcohol, and no matter what we do she does not stop, she will go out of her way to get alchol and drugs. I think she does have abit of brain damage or something. We live in South Africa so pur health care is shitty. 

I really dont want to give up my life, but I dont want my mom to loose hers. I think it will be bad for me because I work 15 hours a day, will I then need to go home and clean and cook for my sis and my mom? Will I need to spend every free hour I have to look after them. 

It does not matter what I do my mom and sister does not listen to me. Its like they don't care about me. What should i do? Please give me advice!",26Feb2017,1
